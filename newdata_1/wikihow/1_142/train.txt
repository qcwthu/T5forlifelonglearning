,, These connection-clients are also referred to as "viewers." The official viewer is Viewer 2.0. Alternatively, there are a number of third-party viewers that one can use to connect with, some of which provide more functionality than the official client.  You will start off at a Help or Orientation Island -- which is essentially a tutorial for newbies to help learn how to navigate and make use of the features Second Life (SL) offers. This isn't a requirement, however. Note, however, that while on this Island, you won't be able to search for other areas on the main grid (for whatever reason).  There will be another button on the Map display that reads "Go Home." Click it, and you should be taken to the main grid.  Open your Map display back up again and type in "Midgar" into your search bar and click "Search." Our sim should pop up on your map.  Welcome to Midgar. Please read the rules and the necessary information to get started in our community. Enjoy!	Go to SecondLife.com; , Go to Choose in your starting look (which will be unimportant in the long run), fill in your desired information, and complete your registration.  , Once you've signed up, you will need a client to connect with. Once you have your client/viewer installed and downloaded, simply log into your account. If you wish to leave the Help/Orientation Island, you have to teleport yourself to your Home location, which you can do by looking at the bottom of your screen and clicking on the "Map" button.

This button will be on the upper left side of your screen.; , The name of your function should be the name of your file, so when you save this new script file it will be the name of your file. In this case, for example, you can name our function slope-equation.  An input is something you need the user to give to you. For example, if you want to determine the slope equation y = mx+b, you need the user to tell us what is the slope value(m), the x coordinate and the y-intercept(b).  Skip to line 2 in your program and type for example, “%m is the value of the slope of the line”. Repeat this for each 3 inputs. Commenting is useful in programming for you and others who modify your program to understand all the variables and things you have done and how they are defined.  What this means, in this case, is you want your equation to define a variable y as the product of our input m and x and then add the y intercept value (b) to it. In line 5, you define your equation. Do not forget the semicolon this semicolon suppresses the output! What does that mean? That means the software Matlab automatically assigns the y variable the value of mx+ b and it doesn't output the value to the screen.  An fprintf statement is used to output information to the user of the program. You will first define the fprintf statement and then go into more details. Type in at line 6 fprintf(‘blank message’);  , Replace the words blank message with your own words your sentence should be descriptive of the output of your function. You can say, “The y coordinate of this line is:”  , This means since you are dealing with integers you should use “%i” this will call an integer value from our fprintf statement. What are the different data types? Well the most common one is integer which in an fprintf statement is defined as %i but there is also a whole list of numeric data types at this website http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/numeric-types.html where you can look and decide at which data type you would like your answer to be formatted in!  , In your case the output is the value y so after the single quotation you type “, y”. The fprintf statement automatically recognizes this variable and puts it in the first %(datatype) it sees in between the single quotation marks.  This line just simply is to make your program look neater. It makes your program enter after your initial fprintf statement. This is just the line “fprintf(‘\n’);’. The new line character in other programming languages is “/n”; in MATLAB it will only work with the backwards slash.  This end will close our function and is necessary in every function you create in MATLAB. If you do not save your program you will get the wrong output or no values when you execute.  This part is considered calling your function; you go to the command prompt and type “yourfunction(inputvalue1, inputvalue2, inputvalueN)”. This means you type your function's name and the values you want to assign to the inputs. Test your function with the input value of 4, 5 and 6. That means on the command prompt you would write slope Equation(4,5,6). As you can see from the picture mistakes are bound to happen in your code just refer back to these steps and the warnings and see what you missed or messed up on!	Open up MATHWORKS MATLAB and press the New Script button. Type your function name. Type the inputs of your function in between the parenthesis. Comment on what each input is. Type in the operation you want your program to do using your inputs. Use an fprintf statement to output the result of your equation. Decide on what you want your message to display. Insert the data type of the output of your function after your sentence but still in between the single quotation marks. Type the output of your function after the single quotation mark. Add an fprintf statement which contains the new line character. Add an end to the last line of your program and save your program as your function name. Test your function out on the command prompt!
If a regular structure to your day helped you get through the initial withdrawal period, it may also help you conquer your addiction long-term. Adjust your schedule as necessary, but keep the good habits that you’ve developed already.   Make sure you continue to manage any medications you are taking and have regular trips to your medical doctor., Don’t stop taking advantage of these resources just because you are feeling better. Recovery from addiction is a process, so continue to check in with your doctor, therapist, or support group. If this begins to feel burdensome, try thinking of it like eating right or exercising. It’s something you do regularly to stay healthy, even when you’d rather not.  Thinking about the rest of your life can be overwhelming, so stop and celebrate your accomplishments periodically: two weeks clean, a month, three months, a year.   After even a day or week sober you can treat yourself to something you enjoy like a nice dinner or a trip to the beach. Focus on what you have done well and take the time to set goals for the next week. After a month of sobriety you can celebrate by having a clean and sober party (with no alcohol, drugs).  Build healthy friendships and stronger personal relationships. Resist the urge to start spending time with the people with whom you used to use amphetamines.   You can set specific boundaries with individuals who use amphetamines by saying something like, "I am focusing on my sobriety and am still in the early stages of recovery, so I can't be around people who use right now. It is too risky for me and I hope you will understand that." Cultivate new relationships with individuals who do not use alcohol or drugs or any kind. Try signing up for a gym, dance class, church group, or any other social activity.  If you notice increased cravings, feelings of hopelessness, or a lot of additional stress, you may be at risk for a relapse. During these times, it is especially important to avoid people, places, and situations you associate with amphetamine use. Stay strong, and focus on what you’ve accomplished.   If you do use amphetamines again and regret it, try not to beat yourself up – that won’t help. Remember that you stopped once; you can do it again. Get help immediately, and get back on track.	Continue to adhere to your daily routine. Stick with your counseling program or support group. Celebrate milestones. Surround yourself with the right people. Watch for warning signs.
In marketing they call this a surrogate indicator – it is the idea that because something is expensive it is of higher quality. This often has no bearing on the reality of the product. Many times a product is simply expensive because people are willing to pay a lot of money for it – not because the product is of high quality.; , Many people lose money simply because they do not value it. You are very easily going to give up that which you do not value and money is no exception to that rule. Many people think that having no money is a noble thing but there is no nobility in poverty alone and it is definitely not a noble thing to lose all of your money simply because you do not value it.  This is the key to financial stability. The moment you start spending more than you earn is the moment you begin to become financially complacent. Such a habit can be difficult to recover from.  Budgeting is a tried and tested way to remain on to of your finances and stop yourself from losing out. There are numerous ways to budget your money and many of them are on this website. (insert page link)   Budget your time. Your time is more precious than money therefore it is imperative that you budget it well. Budget your week, your days, even Look at where you have five minutes, ten minutes, half an hour to spare, what habits and routines can you place in these times that will benefit you in the long run?  , Some people are exceptionally good at pushing a product onto you that you do not really want or need. One of the only ways to make sure this does not happen is by being able to see through the sales ploys of others.  Debauchery can mean living in a self destructive way but is often the squandering of wealth put into habits. There is nothing wrong with having fun or living a lifestyle with filled with parties or good times so long as you are very mindful of the effect this will have on your finances. Moderation and understanding is the way to proceed. Be very mindful of debauchery and the effects it is having on you.  Whether its gold diggers or just enemies pretending to be friends, there are people who will stay with you just for your money and people who will make sure that you remain broke on the basis alone that it benefits them for you to be broke. Such people may discourage you from doing anything that will definitely result in financial gain. So be very wary around these people.  Obviously refraining from these things completely is the most beneficial thing and will aid significantly but even just becoming mindful of your consumption is useful.  Gambling is virtually a guaranteed way to lose money and even destroy your life. Think to yourself – if gambling was really geared in your favour, could casino’s and betting shops make a profit?  ,  All enhancements of intelligence will contribute somewhat to the ability to arise and maintain wealth as intelligence is more than just knowledge. Intelligence with regards to wealth, possessions and finance is useful directly.  Through appreciating of what you already have you lose a lot of the need to acquire things that are of absolute no benefit to you. A lot of your desires become more healthy and you stop wasting money on regretful things.  The more clarity of mind you have, the easier it will be to take care of your finances. One of the reasons many people do not take care of their finances is simply because their minds are all over the place.  The more you perform them the easier they are to slip back into. Laziness is often found simply when we have bad routines that work against us – it is important to be mindful of these routines and be able to transform them into good routines once more.  Without this your personality can gradually change into a lazy one. This a slow process and can be difficult to notice until it is very bad and you don’t know what happened to your life. But the moment that you become aware that you have allowed your personality to become a lazy one is the moment that you begin to improve it for the better.  Through doing this you keep developing your knowledge into saving and spending. this knowledge should not be underestimated, it is actively through developing knowledge of losing money that a person avoids losing it. Observation can aid with this.  Those people who have knowledge of money, who study things like accounting, business and so on are far less likely to lose money.  It has become a recent trend to hate rich people for no other reason than they are wealthy. This makes a person want to prevent themselves from becoming rich and therefore works against them. Upon analysis it reveals that being rich alone does not make someone unpleasant or in compassionate, and so this hatred is often unfounded and even pointless.	Do not buy things just because they are expensive. Value your money. Don’t spend more than you earn. Budget your money. Be able to see through the sales ploys of others. Be mindful of debauchery. Be mindful of bad company. Be mindful of your consumption of alcohol and drugs. Refrain from gambling. Find ways to enhance your intelligence. Appreciate what you have. Know what makes your mind clear. Get into good routines – routines bring us from one point to the other. Improve your personality with regards to laziness. Observe those people who lose money and speculate the reasons why they are losing money. Study money. Avoid hating rich people for the simple fact of their wealth.
It's a good idea to pack all of the parts out at once. Assembling your tent will be fastest if you don't have to unpack each item one at a time. Keep all parts nestled in one place so you can keep account of everything. Because the list of supplies depends on the specific type of tent you're using, here are a few different types of tents you can consider:   A-Frame tents are the most typical and common type of tent for personal use. They're the easiest to erect and usually come with extras like a rain-fly and weather tarp. Tunnel tents are different from typical "A-Frame" tents because they are structured by two long poles that both run the width of the tent. This creates a wider interior with more headspace. However, they're not nearly as stable when it comes to wind.Dome tents are generally the largest, and usually reserved for larger groups in camping. Although they're quite a bit bigger, they're generally very easy to pitch.; , A ground cloth should be big enough to encompass the space of at least most of your tent. The added cushion of a ground cloth will lead to a more comfortable rest.  Lie the tent frame out. That way, you can make sure you're sliding the poles through the right slots. This is arguably the most time-consuming part of tent assemblage, but it's very straightforward.   In the case of a "tunnel tent", make sure the poles are parallel from one another.  If the support poles have joints, make them rigid. The poles are going to have a pre-set frame to them for the main body of the tent. Help the tent up by lifting parts of it. The poles should hold the frame in place. If not, secure loose parts of the poles or extend them as needed.  This will stabilize the tent and make sure it doesn't move around. If you don't have tent pegs for whatever reason, you can improve by using sturdy sticks and pushing them into the soil.  This is where the rain-fly comes in. A rain-fly is an additional piece you set overtop the tent. There should be something along the line of latches on the roof of your tent to secure the rain-fly in place. Even if you're pretty sure there will be no rain, it doesn't hurt to install it nonetheless. It will ensure all of your tent equipment stays in one place, and prepare you for unforeseen rain showers.  Once the tent is set up, you can equip the interior. Because there isn't usually much space in a tent, you should decide which things are alright to store outside, and which things should be kept inside. Sleeping bags are an obvious must in your tent. Crates and hard-cased storage can be left outside.   If there's a risk of bears in the area you're camping, it is strongly recommended you keep food out of the tent. If a bear comes, you don't want him rummaging into your tent because he picked up the scent of granola.  This makes the experience of camping nicer, but it also makes the cleanup process easier. Make an effort to keep shoes off while you're in the tent. Keep the space clutter-free and throw out excess wrappers appropriately.  Taking pegs out is usually pretty easy, and should be the first thing you do before dismantling your tent. If you can't pull them up by hand, try digging out the soil around the peg to loosen it.   The rain-fly should be unlatched as soon as possible as well.  Once the pegs are out, pull the bottoms of the tent poles out from the sockets in the fabric. Do this for all four corners before you move on and take out upper sockets. This will make sure the tent isn't imbalanced later on during the dismantling.   Take down the camp slowly. Even the best tents can be fragile if you're not careful.  While you're putting pegs and poles aside, do your best to keep them all in one place. You should be storing them all in one place usually, but it's especially important if you're out camping. You don't want to drive away without first taking account of all the parts.  Once the camp is dismantled, you should do a last-minute scan to make sure there isn't anything you accidentally left or forgot about. In most cases you'll be able to account for everything, but it definitely helps for the occasions you'll have missed something. While you're scanning, you should make sure you haven't left any garbage. You should make the campsite look as good or better than when you left it.  Once you get back home, you should keep the tent parts in one place and somewhere dry. If the tent gathers mildew or moisture over time, this will rot out the fabric and ruin the tent for any future use.  There are lots of different types and sizes of tent on the market. Some are only big enough to fit one or two people, while others are massive enough to include tables and chairs. If you're buying a tent for personal use, you should stick to smaller-sized tents. Bigger tents are harder to carry around, and usually take longer to put together and dismantle.   Tents will usually have a recommended persons limit on the box. Although the worth of these estimates is a bit iffy (you should usually round up the number, if anything) it can give you some insight as to the approximate size. Don't cheap out and purchase the discount brands of tent. Although you'll save money, they wear out quickly and lack the protection of better tents. You'll be making this tent your home on more than one occasion after all, so it's worth to spend a bit more and go for at least a run-of-the-mill model  , Any new tent is going to take a bit of time to figure out how it goes together. With these two things in mind, it's a good idea to set the tent up in your back yard or living room before you even leave for your trip. You'll be able to work out the kinks in the assembly process without having to worry about time or having somewhere to sleep.   This is also recommended in the small possibility that the package did not come with all its parts. If there was a fault on the part of the manufacturer, you can send it back and get a replacement version.  Among the more obvious things like food and clothing, its essential that you bring some kind of basic first-aid kit with you whenever you camp. Bandages, over-the-counter painkillers, gauze and topical cream are some of the things you should bring with you. Although serious injury is unlikely, minor scrapes and bruises are commonplace when you're outdoors, and you'll want to get to soothe them quickly so that they don't impact your experience.  It's a preventable pain to realize you've forgotten something necessary at home. This is especially true if you get to your camping location and realize you left something essential for the tent behind. Even if you're in a rush out the door, take a few extra minutes to verify you have all your bases covered.   It's useful to write up a quick list of the things you and your party will need for a trip.  When you get to a potential camping location, you should give a quick glance around to see if you spot anything dangerous. Chances are you will be camping in a natural woodland area. If this is true, it's a good idea to read up on your location a bit beforehand to see what kind of hazards other people have reported.   Broken trees above can be lethal if they fall on your tent in the tent. It's best to stay clear of anything that looks unstable. Bee hives are hard to spot in a wild area. All the same, the sight of one is a good sign you should stay away. The common sight of animal droppings is an indication that this is an area that gets a lot of animal traffic. Although many animals will steer clear of you, some predators (often bears) will make a target of campsites.  If it rains, the rain will trickle down and risk flooding your campsite.  This is the ground you'll be sleeping on, so it's necessary you find the flattest possible piece of ground within reason. Keep the size of your tent in mind, and accommodate for a space outside the tent gate. Having a hill drop right outside the door is a recipe for injury.  Although broken glass can be legitimately dangerous to camp on, you won't be able to sleep if there are stones on the ground where you're trying to rest., If you're camping out in a relatively wild area, you should be prepared for the possibility of animals. Although most animals will stay clear from humans, bears are a major danger and can be lethal. Seeing a lot of animal droppings can be a sign that you're close to an animal's hunting ground. Although you'll never be able to know for sure, you can usually look up the camping region beforehand to see if other people have reported bear sightings.   If there is any risk, you should keep things like food out of your tent. That way, a bear won't need to rummage into your tent if he picks up the food's scent.	Unpack your tent supplies.Once you've found a good area to set up camp, it's time to unpack your things. Lay down a ground cloth.No matter how much you clear the area, there may still be twigs and other debris that could puncture your tent or make the surface otherwise uncomfortable. Insert your tent poles through the frame.Once you've gotten all your tent parts out, slide the support poles through the body of the tent. Raise the tent. Hammer in your tent pegs.Using a mallet or a nearby rock, take the spikes that come with your tent and hammer them into the ground. Set up the rain-fly.It's important to keep in mind that tents on their own are usually not waterproof. Move your things into the tent. Keep your tent clean while you camp.It's a good idea to keep your tent clean while you're camping. Unpeg the tent from the ground. Remove the poles from the frame. Keep all of the tent parts in one place. Scan the campsite for anything you might have missed. Store your tent supplies somewhere dry. Buy a tent that accurately suits your needs. Do a practice run-through of setting up the tent.Generally speaking, you're going to want your camping experience to be as problem-free as possible. Remember to bring first-aid. Make sure you have everything before you leave. Look out for apparent hazards. Avoid setting up in low areas if there's a chance of rain.It's not recommended that you camp on a day where there's a likelihood of rain in the first place, but just in case, it's a good idea not to set your campsite in a depression in the ground. Find a flat space.Tents need a flat space to be set up properly. Clear the chosen area of debris.Once you've found a relatively flat area that's free of apparent hazards, you should prep the campsite by clearing out debris that could hurt the tent or make the surface uneven. Make sure the area is reasonably clear of wildlife.
Many kids prepare their own hype for the holiday by dyeing and decorating hard boiled eggs with their parents the previous night. Stick about three to four refrigerated eggs around their basket and encourage your child to eat them later on.; , Trees begin to grow leaves again and Spring is also the season to start preparing new gardens for the year. Insert a package or two of seeds in their baskets, along with a plastic shovel and mini watering can. It can also become a new way to bond with kids and educate them on gardening. Add a small box of sidewalk chalk or bubbles.  A lot of small toy "inserts", such rubber ducks, matchbox cars, a small Easter stuffed animal, or a sheet of Easter related stickers are always a treat to get. Even if it's a small zipper bag filled with nail polish and travel sized lotions, it'll be appreciated by your preteen daughter. Use Easter to also "refill" on small school supplies, for example pencils or educational flash cards.  Pass with the ideas of chocolate or marshmallow fluff sugared candy. Add a handful of store bought or homemade items into a zippered snack plastic bag.    Granola, with nuts such as pecans Dried fruit, such as banana chips or cranberries Sugar/fat free pudding boxes Mini popcorn package; most "mini" bags typically are meant for a single person Crackers Non-candy that resembles bunnies or chicks  , Stick a movie ticket in the Easter grass or a pre-paid month gaming card, whether it's Club Penguin, Halo, or Roblox. Add a few coins, such as quarters or nickels into plastic Eggs.	Use dyed Easter eggs. Think of Spring and Summer activities. Think of small Christmas stocking ideas. Prepare small bags of healthy snacks. Give your child a special treat.
Your parents may relate differently to your sibling, and and act differently around them, but not favor them. They may not realize that they make you feel as though they favor your sibling.; , This can be a mental list or a real list, which you will use later to speak to your parents. Try to come up with specific examples to back up what you're saying.  Ask if you can speak with them about something important, and make sure your tone is non-accusatory.  Remember not to get angry, or use the examples as accusations. Once you get angry, they may clam up and stop listening. You want this to be a discussion where you both can share your sides of the story, not an argument about what they're doing wrong.  Some parents don't want to listen, and will become angry if you explain that you feel they are playing favorites. If they don't listen and get angry, or if you feel yourself angry, prevent the discussion from becoming an argument.  Jealousy can make it hard to avoid blaming your siblings, and anger can make it had for you to avoid blaming yourself. However, blame does not fix this problem, and tends to make you focus too much on anger you may feel.  Avoid seeking their approval for everything, and have pride in yourself. This will help you see that not being the "favorite" does not mean you are not as good.  Sometimes, the anger will get to you, and you will need to vent. Don't worry, just get your feelings out so you can allow yourself to move on from them.  It can be tough to deal with parents that shower your sibling in gifts and money, yet give you a hard time when you ask for something. If you're old enough, look for a job to earn things for yourself. Spend more time outside of your home in a more accepting and supportive environment.	Consider whether it really is favoritism by looking at all sides of the issue. Make a list with examples of how they show it and how it makes you feel. Approach your parents when both of you are in good, calm moods. Explain how you feel, using examples to back yourself up. End the discussion if the tone becomes angry. Don't blame yourself or your siblings. Work for yourself, not your parents. Begin a private journal to vent in. Become more independent.
When you have a family member who is missing, it is a very frightening and emotional experience. Make sure that you are taking care of yourself and getting the emotional support that you need. You may need to explain to friends that you are going through a tough time and you need some additional support.Consider counseling. You will be dealing with many emotions, such as anxiety and fear. You might find it helpful to talk to a mental health professional about your situation.  Obviously, you want to locate your lost family member. But it is important to prepare yourself for the possibility that your relative may not want to be reunited. You should also be aware that many missing persons cases are never solved. Try to keep a positive attitude, but prepare yourself emotionally for any eventuality.Many missing adults are found living a homeless life. Often, this is the result of an untreated mental illness or substance abuse. While many reunions are happy, be aware that your missing family member might have changed since you last saw her. Try to have realistic expectations for your reunions.You will need your support system around you even after you are reunited with your family member.  It can take awhile to locate your missing loved one. Try to remember that you are taking action and doing all that you can. This process typically does not happen overnight. Be patient, and keep using all of the resources available to you.	Get a support system. Be aware of all possible outcomes. Be patient.

With a bread knife, cut the loaf of fresh white bread into thick slices. Remove the crust from edges of each slice and set aside along with the ends of the bread. Place the slices on a drying rack and leave on your counter to become stale overnight.   If you’ve forgotten this step, you can dry the bread out in the oven. Preheat the oven to a very low temperature. After removing the crust, place the thick slices of bread on a baking sheet and put it in the oven. Once the bread feels dry to the touch, remove it from the oven. Do not toast the bread.; , Remove the outer layers of the white onion. Cut the peeled onion into quarters. Stud each quarter with one clove.  Pour 1 liter of full fat milk into the sauce pan. Add the quartered onions, 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon whole white peppercorn, 2 blades of mace, and 1 teaspoon table salt. If you are using ground mace, sprinkle it into the milk.  Gradually heat the mixture. Just before it starts to boil, remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover the saucepan and let the mixture infuse for 1 to 2 hours.  Retrieve your stale white bread and a mixing bowl. As you hold the bread over the opening of the bowl, tear each slice into cubes. The mixing bowl will catch the cubes and all of the crumbs.  Return the saucepan to a burner set on very low heat. Uncover the pan and pour in the breadcrumbs. The bread crumbs will absorb the milk, thickening the sauce. Cook the sauce until thick, approximately fifteen minutes.   Before you add the crumbs, you may strain the milk. This will remove the onion, bay leaves, peppercorns, and mace.  Prior to serving, stir in 30 grams (2 tablespoons) of butter. Add a splash of cream or milk to the sauce if desired. Grate the fresh nutmeg over the sauce. You may also add more salt.  Pour the sauce into a warmed gravy boat or bowl. Grate more fresh nutmeg over the top of the sauce. Bring the fragrant sauce to the table for your guests to eat with their meat.	Prepare the bread crumbs 24-hours in advance. Peel, quarter, and stuff the onion with cloves. Combine the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring the contents to a near boil and then let them infuse. Rip apart the stale bread and add the crumbs to the sauce. Add the bread to the infused sauce and heat. Add butter, cream, and nutmeg to the sauce. Serve.
By definition, dark chocolate is chocolate that has a higher concentration of cocoa butter and less milk. It’s actually possible to make dark chocolate without any milk at all, making it perfect for people who can’t or don’t consume dairy. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need:Grater Double boiler Metal whisk Candy mold Optional ingredients to add to the chocolate, such as dried fruit or nuts; , In the bottom of the double boiler, fill the pot with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place this over medium heat and allow the water to come to a boil.   If you don’t have a double boiler, fill the bottom of a regular saucepan with water, and use a metal or glass bowl as the top portion of the double boiler. Make sure the bowl doesn’t touch the water, otherwise the chocolate will burn. Place the bowl into the saucepan and make sure the water isn't touching the bowl. Pour out some water if the water is touching the bowl.  Grating the cocoa butter will help it melt faster.You can also cut the cocoa butter into small chunks if you prefer. When the water is boiling, place the cocoa butter into the top of the double boiler. Use the metal whisk to stir it frequently as it melts.   It’s important that you don’t use wooden utensils to make chocolate, because the wood can still contain moisture from the tree, and this can leach into the chocolate, changing its composition.Some recipes call for coconut oil instead of cocoa butter, but coconut oil will result in an oily chocolate that isn't as smooth, rich, and creamy as chocolate should be.  Once the cocoa butter has melted, add the cocoa powder and whisk to combine. When the cocoa powder melts and the mixture starts to take on a glossy appearance, whisk it until it becomes smooth and creamy.When the chocolate is creamy and glossy, add the sugar and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Continue heating and whisking until the sugar is melted. You can use honey, maple syrup, or any other sweetener in place of the sugar.  When all the ingredients are melted and fully combined, pour the mixture evenly into your mold. Use a flat mixing spatula to distribute the chocolate in the mold if necessary.   Once the mold is full, you can sprinkle in any additional ingredients you're using, such as nuts or dried fruit. Try to distribute the ingredients evenly throughout the chocolate. You can use any mold you like for this chocolate, including a bar mold, heart shapes, or any other design. If you don’t have a chocolate mold, you can use clean ice cube trays. You can also use dark chocolate to make chocolate chips, truffles, and other delicious confections.  Set the chocolate aside to cool to room temperature, because you don’t want it to harden too quickly. Once it reaches room temperature, transfer the mold to an air-tight container and into the fridge to set for about an hour.It’s important to wait before putting the chocolate in the fridge and to put it in an air-tight container first. If the chocolate cools too quickly or is exposed to moisture, the chocolate can bloom, which is when the surface of the chocolate becomes dull and streaked., Take the chocolate out of the fridge once it has set. To get it out of the mold, place the mold upside down on a flat surface. Peel the mold away from the chocolate.   You can also put the chocolate into the freezer for five to 10 minutes then try again to peel away the mold.Gently tap the back of the mold with the but end of a kitchen knife if the chocolate doesn’t come out right away. Instead of tapping the mold with the knife, you can gently tap the entire mold against a hard, flat surface to release it.	Gather your ingredients and supplies. Heat the double boiler. Grate and melt the cocoa butter. Add the remaining ingredients. Pour the chocolate. Cool the chocolate. Remove the chocolate from the mold.
Dogs, like humans, are susceptible to jealousy. Your older dog might act out if they feel they are being snubbed in favor of a new puppy. Be sure to share a bit more time with your older dog than with your new puppy. Dogs of all ages appreciate petting, verbal praise, and opportunities for play. Doing so with your senior dog will prevent them from feeling that the new puppy is muscling in on its turf., While your older dog should have slightly more time and attention than the puppy, both should feel they are loved. Pay attention to each dog individually by petting them, playing with them, and offering verbal praise. If each dog feels appreciated, the dogs are more likely to get along and less likely to resent each other., One of the primary causes for conflict between dogs is a lack of play toys. You can prevent this by ensuring there are enough for all your dogs. Don’t assume your new puppy will enjoy the same types of toys that your older dog does. Provide a generous variety of toys, including dog bones, chew toys, KONG toys, balls, and rolling toys.Ensure your puppy doesn’t steal the older dog’s toys. Puppies who are not socialized don’t understand boundaries and sharing the way older dogs do. Even if you’ve provided an adequate amount of toys for your dogs, your puppy might decide to take your older dog’s toys. When this happens, say “No” sternly to your puppy, then return the pilfered toy to the senior dog.  Your new puppy will have a lot of energy, but your older dog will not. In order to prevent your new puppy from using its excess energy to harass your senior dog, give your puppy plenty of opportunities to run about. Let it out in the backyard on its own to frolic and play.Try to find opportunities to exercise your puppy without making your older dog feel like you’re neglecting them. Wait until your older dog is napping or curled up in front of the TV to take your puppy outside for a game of fetch or tug-of-war.  Apart from toys, dogs will likely feel their space is being invaded if another dog is eating or drinking from “their” bowl. Ensure you provide both dogs with their own food and water dishes, and place them at least three meters apart to avoid food fights.It might help if you begin feeding your new puppy in a dog crate.  If you really want your dogs to get along but they just aren’t, you might need to get professional help. Dog trainers can help dogs of any age improve their social skills and learn to tolerate others. Contact dog trainers in your area and explain your predicament.Ask your vet or friends who have dogs to recommend a good dog trainer, or try the Association of Professional Dog Trainers’ searchable database at https://apdt.com/trainer-search/. Remember, dogs are like people, and they all have unique personalities. Some dogs will just never get along, no matter how long they’re together. If your dogs don't get along, don't take it as a personal failing on your part. Just try to minimize their conflict as best you can.	Give your older dog extra love. Ensure each dog gets time with you. Provide plenty of toys. Provide extra exercise time for your puppy. Provide separate food and water bowls. Get help.
When you carefully consider your abilities, you should begin to recognize your limits.; , Overconfidence is a way of depreciating other people's talents, skills, and abilities. Just because someone else can get "serious air" on an 8 foot (2.4 m) half pipe doesn't mean you can. They have paid their dues with practice, and probably lots of bruises.  Don't dive off the high board until you have made lots of trips to the low board and worked on intermediate levels.  This may be one of the most important steps in abating your overconfidence. This is not necessarily to say critics are always right, far from it. There is a possibility they are right, and because they see you from a different perspective, you should hear them out.  Overconfidence can cause you to over commit yourself. When you tell someone you will do something, be realistic in how much effort and time it will take. Promising to help paint a buddy's car, even though have never done it, may turn into a three day project if you are a victim of your own overconfidence.  Not only will this help you to shape a realistic measure of your ability, it will help you to focus on skills, strengths, or other qualities that you need to work on.  We all see superhuman feats and stunts on TV, and movies like Jackass take these to extremes, but these are accomplished by talented, unique individuals who often train all of their lives in their own disciplines. Sure, gymnasts make the parallel bars look easy, you don't know how many gallons of sweat it took to get to that level.  If you take an overconfident view of easy success, and you fail, you may become discouraged and give up too soon. Rumor has it, Albert Einstein was lousy in grade school.	Be honest with yourself first. Do not compare yourself with others. Test yourself cautiously. Listen to criticism, especially constructive criticism from people you trust. Treat commitments seriously. Take time to look at your failures, or incidences when you did not achieve your own personal goals. Keep fantasies separate from realities. Try new sports, activities, or pursuits with a goal, and work your way up to it. Remember you are a unique person with your own talents, skills, and goals, and confidence or overconfidence can be a pitfall to be avoided if you mix modesty with your enthusiasm.
It may sound silly, but in reality, it is a great boost for your relationship, which can help prevent a fight or argument.   If being around your siblings for even a short amount of time is hard for you, try starting with something simple, like chatting before you leave for school, or sitting by them at dinner.  If you're ready for something big, however, you can set aside 20 minutes or an hour a day with them. When spending time with your siblings, make it all about them.  Don't talk about you, instead ask them sincere questions about their art project, or how their math test at school went. It's important to decide whether or not you want to specifically tell them that you're working on improving this relationship.  If you think they are likely to protest or be offended by this, it's probably a good idea not to say anything.  But if your siblings whine or complain about the amount of time you spend with them, you may want to let them know that you are making a conscious effort to do better. Try to have both times that you spend with individual siblings, and times you spend with all of them.  If you worry that your siblings will fight and ruin your quality time together, however, it may be a good idea to start with just individual time.  Keep in mind, though, that by having good times with your siblings all together, you may set a good example for them.; ,   Before you speak, analyze what you're about to say, and make sure that it doesn't have a high probability of hurting someone's feelings. If you have continual problems with saying hurtful things, try being quiet for 60 seconds to let your brain calm down. When you say something rude, stop and apologize. Every time you think something you wouldn't want to say out loud, tell yourself to stop. Do not interrupt a sibling.    Try to say at least one nice thing a day to your siblings.  If you're ready for more, try saying 10 nice things, or one nice thing every time you meet. Make sure to compliment them, but be wary of saying "I like/love you because..."  This can make it seem that you will only appreciate them if they continue to do or be something. Write notes, signed or anonymous, that let your siblings know how you feel about them. Expressions of love can be as simple as "Nice shirt," "Good job," or even "Hey, how's it going?"  ,   Make a sibling's bed or clean their room. Do a sibling's chores. Give them a turn on something you're using (the phone, a game, a certain toy, etc.) Let them have part of your dessert. Agree to a certain activity with a sibling who really enjoys it.   Different things work for different people.  Here are some ideas:   Wear a special bracelet or tie a rubber band around your finger to remind yourself to be kind. Every morning, stand in front of the mirror and say, "I will be kind to my siblings today," Write down a few things you are going to do each evening or morning. Tape a note or homemade poster to your bedroom door or inside your school locker. Tell someone you trust about your plans. Constantly think good things about your siblings.	Spend more time with your siblings. Avoid criticizing or making comments that could offend your siblings. Express love. Do things to show that you care. Remind yourself about your plans.
Creating a thorough and useful self-evaluation takes time, so make sure that you schedule enough time to complete the process. If you rush through it, then you’re likely to skip over important accomplishments or growth opportunities, which makes your finished product less productive because it won’t truly reflect your career progress., Your self-evaluation must reflect that you are meeting your self-set goals and the goals of the company at-large. Most importantly, to show your organization that you are an effective employee, you must show that you are working to meet the organizational goals.Completing a self-evaluation will show you if you are on-track to meet your career expectations because you can see if all of the hard work you are doing connects back to your goals.  Based on your goals, create an inventory of all of the work you’ve done over the past year. Include things like projects you’ve completed, committees you’ve served on, and reports you’ve drafted. This list will include everything - from the client records you stapled to the committee you chaired.Assess your work materials, such as emails and reports, for examples of your work and support for your accomplishments.As you write down your accomplishments, think about how they fit in with your goals and use that to help with wording. For example, if your goal is to increase sales, and you have been calling potential clients, then you could say that you “initiated sales” or “increased point-of-sale opportunities” rather than “made cold calls”.  Because this is a self evaluation, include only your accomplishments, not those of your entire team. Demonstrate how you contributed to any team assignments, including your qualities as a team player.  Every worker has weaknesses, and honestly identifying them is the only way to overcome them. You must reflect on your struggles in order to set new goals and choose useful growth opportunities.Think about times you’ve fallen behind in your work, needed assistance, or were unsure that you completed a task correctly. Provide examples. Just as with your successes, include concrete examples to support your need for professional growth opportunities.If you’re struggling to identify your weaknesses, talk to a trusted colleague, a mentor, or your supervisor.  Record your professional development activities from the previous year, connecting them to your goals and prior weaknesses. Show how you’ve been successful at overcoming your struggles and how hard you’ve worked to become the type of employee your organization wants.   Include professional growth activities you’ve completed in your own time as well as those you did as part of your job.  The feedback that you have received over the past year will be instrumental in supporting your accomplishments and helping your identify areas for development. Remember to include feedback from your supervisor, colleagues, and clients, if it’s available.  Show your organization the unique qualities that you bring to the table. For example, do you have a varied educational background or are you bilingual? Include these traits in your self-evaluation to show your organization how you are contributing to the company culture.What makes you different as an employee? Ask yourself what characteristics you bring to the job that go beyond the job description. Since this evaluation is focused on your performance, incorporate details that demonstrate how you contribute as an individual.  Work through your list of accomplishments and develop a list of the work you performed as part of that accomplishment. Once you have an overview of the work you completed, write a brief explanation using action verbs.Action verbs show what you did in concrete terms. For example, state that you evaluated survey results, trained a new hire, or initiated a new project. Be honest. While you want to word your accomplishments in a way that reflects well on you, make sure that you are being accurate. For example, don’t record your independent work as managerial experience because you managed yourself.  Support your accomplishments with quantifiable examples, such as statistics, percentages, or calculated totals.As an example, say, “I increased my customers by 20%” or “I lowered bug reports by 15%.” You can also use straight calculations, such as “I completed five surveys” or “I averaged four customers per day.”  , Prepare a list of qualitative examples to support your accomplishments, especially in areas you were unable to provide numbers.Qualitative examples show that you took actions but are unable to show numerical data. For example, say, “I increased customer support by creating a new web app.”   Qualitative examples are great support when taking an action is meaningful, regardless of its success. For example, if you are in charge of a program to prevent teen drinking, any action you take is useful, even if you only stop one teen from drinking.  Link your positive feedback to your accomplishments to show that others have observed your successes in the workplace. Only include feedback that clearly supports an accomplishment so that your self-evaluation will be accurate and useful., Read over your self-evaluation, paying careful attention to how well you accomplished your previous year’s goals and the organizational goals. Identify gaps where more improvement is needed. Then study the struggles you identified, which will show you areas you need to improve., Based on your identified gaps and struggles, develop new professional goals for the upcoming year. Aim for two new goals, and remember that you will continue to work toward your organization's goals.As you set your goals, remember that you will need to show support for your accomplishment of the goals and that you will need to be able to take growth initiatives. Write your goals in a way that allows for you to meet those demands.  Schedule a meeting with your supervisor to review your results. Be prepared to explain the information you’ve included. Show them your initial new goals, and explain why you’ve chosen this focus for the upcoming year., Once your supervisor has reviewed the results of your self-evaluation, ask for areas of improvement and areas where you’ve demonstrated success. Ask them what they think of your initial new goals, and allow them to help you reshape those goals., Discuss your previous struggles with your supervisor, and offer your ideas for the coming year’s professional growth. Listen to your supervisor’s suggestions and be open to pursuing their ideas. Show them that you are addressing your weaknesses and pursuing success.  Based on the feedback you received from your supervisor, finalize your new goals and update your self-evaluation to reflect the changes.	Set aside time. Review your goals. Catalog your accomplishments. Keep the focus on you. Explain your struggles. Explain your growth initiatives. Assemble your feedback. Differentiate yourself. Support your accomplishments. Quantify your results. Provide qualitative data. Incorporate your feedback. Review the results. Set your initial new goals. Discuss your self-evaluation. Ask for feedback. Suggest professional growth initiatives. Finalize your new goals.
You may already know exactly where you want to go to medical school, but if you don’t, you should start looking at the possibilities as soon as possible. This will be very similar to your experience searching for an undergraduate program. Don’t just pick the top medical school in the country for that reason. Instead, search for a school that will be a good fit for your long-term goals, financial limitations, and personality.There are many factors to consider. For example, some medical schools focus mostly on research while others focus on patient care. Some focus on a specific specialty and many don’t. Medical schools even vary on levels of competitiveness. For example, Johns Hopkins is famous for being cutthroat, but other universities might offer a more collaborative atmosphere. Don’t forget to consider things like location, weather, and student life. Though these may not be the top things to consider, they are still important. For example, if you cannot stand long, cold winters, a school in the Northeastern United States may not be the optimal experience for you.; , The MCAT is a written, multiple-choice examination. It looks at your ability to think critically and problem-solve, and tests your knowledge of the natural, behavioral, and social sciences. The exam usually takes about eight hours to complete. Most undergraduate students take this exam during their sophomore or junior year of college.   There is a nearly limitless amount of study material available for the MCAT. See what materials and courses are available through your university, or visit the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) website to view and purchase study materials: https://www.aamc.org/.  Once you’ve made a list of all of the medical schools you believe to be a good fit, you’ll need to start the application process. If you are applying to a lot of medical schools it is important to stay organized. Take note of applications deadlines and any applications fees that must be paid.You could consider creating a folder for each medical school you want to apply to. On the front of each folder, write down the name of the school, the date the application is due, and a checklist of each document that is to be submitted as part of the application, as well as the address or website where you must submit the application. You will need letters of recommendation as part of each application. Don’t put off asking for these. Be sure to take note of whether the medical school has a template for the recommendation letters and how they are to be submitted. Make this clear to the people you will be asking. Many medical schools use American Medical School Application Service (AMCAS) and others use the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). This is nice because these application services do some of the work for you, but they do require a $160 fee that includes one medical school. Each additional medical school you wish to apply for costs $38.  Your professors will play an important role in your medical school experience, and will also be important for landing a position in a good residency program. This is because they are often the ones responsible for writing letters of recommendation. Put your best foot forward in medical school so that your letters of recommendation will be favorable.These professors will also act as mentors, and the relationship you have with them largely depends on how you use that relationship. If you don’t take an interest in building a professional relationship with your professors, then they won’t either. You will be continually challenged in medical school. This is because professors want to see who is cut out to become a doctor and who isn’t. You will need to study the information you are learning very hard so that you can put that knowledge to use without supervision.  During your first two years of medical school, you will be required to take the first of three steps towards becoming licensed. There are two different types of licensure examinations offered in the United States: the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX). The USMLE is required for licensure for medical students attending medical schools that confer a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree but may also be taken by medical students attending medical schools that offer a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree. The COMLEX is required for licensure of DO medical students. Both examinations are taken in three stages (known as levels or steps). The first stage of each series of exams is very rigorous and includes 8-9 hours of testing on about 300 questions. This test examines your basic understanding of science and how it is applied to practicing medicine.It is important that you study extensively for this examination. Be sure to take full advantage of any study materials available to you. You can find practice materials for each step of the examination process on the USMLE and COMLEX websites: http://www.usmle.org/. http://www.nbome.org/comlex-cbt.asp  You must pass these exams in order to move on in medical school and eventually to receive a license to practice medicine.  In your third and fourth year of medical school, you will likely move your education to the hospital. In the third year, you probably won’t get much say in the rotations as all medical students are required to spend time working in each of the fundamental specialties; however, in your final year, you may get to speak up about what you’re interested in. This is when you should try to focus on cardiology as much as possible.Don’t forget that you will be required to write an essay for your residency application. During your rotations, try to keep a journal of your experiences and interactions with patients. You can then use this journal to write a great essay about why you would make a good resident in their program.  In your final year of medical school, you will complete the second of the three steps for licensure. The second step of the USMLE and COMLEX examinations are separated into two parts. The first of which tests your clinical skills (Step 2 CK for USMLE and Level 2 CE for COMLEX) through a written examination.The second part (Step 2 CS for USMLE and Level 2 PE for COMLEX) is an exam that looks at your ability to work with patients.Step two of the examination is administered over a two-day period. As with step one, you will need to prepare yourself for this examination extensively. Visit the USMLE and COMLEX websites for practice materials.  Medical school is a very challenging time in the life of a student, and you may think that you should spend all of your time studying; however, getting involved in extracurricular activities and continuing to volunteer in the limited spare time you have will continue to build your CV, and will also provide a network of mentors, friends, and peers that can provide academic and emotional support during this time.Don’t underestimate the importance of social support during medical school. Your friends, family, mentors, and peers will be vital for this. This also means that you should do your best to find the time to be something other than a medical student. For example, don’t feel bad going out to have coffee with friends sometimes.  In order to become a cardiologist, you’ll need to complete a three-year residency in internal medicine. Interviews for residency positions usually occur during December to February of your final year of medical school. The day when residency positions are announced is commonly known as “Match Day” and occurs in March of your final year of medical school.You will need to apply to residency programs around the country/world, much like you did for your undergraduate and medical programs.  The final test for licensure is usually taken at some point during the residency. The final step is a two-day exam. The first day involves a written, multiple-choice exam consisting of ~250-300 questions that test your knowledge of basic medicine. The second day involves observing your assessment skills.The first day of examination usually takes about seven hours. The second day of examination usually takes around nine hours. COMLEX Level 3 is taken in a single day  , Like the residency, the fellowship is typically also three years. During this time, you’ll likely split your work between seeing patients and learning from experienced cardiologists, and doing research.Once you have completed your cardiology fellowship, you will be able to become certified by the American Board of Medical Specialities (ABMS) and/or the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) as a cardiologist.  During your cardiology fellowship, you’ll have the chance to choose your specialty. There are several specialties that you can choose from, including: non-invasive cardiology, invasive, non-interventional cardiology, interventional cardiology, and electrophysiology.Be sure to understand that a cardiologist is not a surgical field. If you want to become a cardiac surgeon you will need to pursue a surgical specialty instead of a cardiac specialty. Pediatric cardiology is also a tract separate from cardiology, requiring three years pediatrics residency and three years pediatric cardiology fellowship.If you wish to be a pediatric cardiologist, you must pursue a pediatric specialty.  A cardiologist has a wide variety of choices when it comes to employment settings. For example, you could be employed by a government agency, a hospital, or a research lab. You could also be employed by a private practice, or you could even open up your own if you wanted to.Opening up your own medical practice is a big commitment, and may be especially challenging if you don’t have a lot of experience working as a cardiologist. Many cardiologists work in a hospital or a practice owned by another doctor to gain some experience before venturing out on their own.  Cardiologists are typically very well-paid, but it is important to understand that the amount you are paid for your work depends on a range of factors. If you work in a big city, you will probably get paid significantly more than if you live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Keep in mind, though, that this is also due to cost-of-living factors. It will probably be tremendously expensive to buy a nice home in the middle of a big city (or even in the suburbs), but you will probably be able to afford your dream home in a smaller town on your salary.There may also be significantly more competition in a cosmopolitan city that everyone wants to live in. It’s all about comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different job opportunities. The median salary in 2014 for the lowest paying cardiology specialty was over $245,000 and the median salaries only increased from there.  Because of the prominence of heart disease in developed countries, a job in cardiology can be a busy one. On a day-to-day basis you can expect to: diagnosing heart problems, prescribing medication, conducting medical procedures related to the heart, and giving health advice to patients.Day-to-day duties can vary widely depending on the type of job you hold. For example, if you take a job that focuses on research you might not see patients at all.  Becoming a member of this association is a good idea because it helps you network with other professionals in the field, gives you access to continuing education, and will help you stay informed about new developments in the field of cardiology.You can even join the AHA while you are still a student. Memberships range in price from $78.00 up to $455.00 per year depending on the level of membership and the benefits included., The ACC is another respected organization that you might want to consider becoming a part of. As a member, you will be connected with thousands of other professionals in the field, and you will be given access to relevant medical journals, which can be very valuable.The initial cost to join the ACC is a little over $900, but the cost to maintain your membership is only around $150 per year.Note that to become a member of the ACC you will need to prove your qualifications and provide letters of recommendation.  In high school, you may not have much choice in what classes you take, but where you do have a choice, try to aim high. If your class offers AP or Honors courses, take them, especially if they are in science courses such as biology and chemistry.If your high school doesn’t offer advanced science courses, look for any advanced courses they may have. For example, courses in literature, history, or economics. AP/Honors courses may help you earn college credit, which looks great to prospective universities. Take as many courses in math and sciences as you can. You want to have a strong foundation in these subjects before entering university, if possible.  You may think your grades aren’t that big of a deal in high school, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. If you want to become a cardiologist, you will need to think about long-term consequences of your decisions, which starts with earning good grades in high school. Developing discipline when it comes to studying and doing well in academics will help prepare you for what is to come in your undergraduate classes and medical schoolIf you are struggling in a course, take steps to find a tutor, or go to the teacher after class to ask questions and get help. Most teachers will be happy to spend extra time helping you if they can see that you are taking the work seriously.  It is never too early to start thinking about where you would like to complete your education after high school. You’re going to need to complete an undergraduate degree and go to medical school. Start thinking about your long-term plans. If there is a particular medical school you’ve always dreamed of going to, look into their undergraduate programs. Make a list of things that are important to you in a university, and go from there.If you’re not sure where you’d like to go to university, then you can take a more practical approach. Think about how far you’re willing to travel for your education. In the United States, it is more affordable for most students to stay in the same state that they hold residency. Most of the Ivy League schools have great pre-medical programs, but these universities are extremely competitive (not to mention extremely expensive). You can certainly apply to these programs but consider other universities as well. While a huge university might have more resources and prestige, consider the fact that professors won’t be as accessible. You may spend four years with a professor without ever getting a chance to speak with them one-on-one. On the other hand, a smaller university may not have access to the latest educational technology, or access to top internships, but you will get to know your professors much more easily.  Once you have a list of schools you are interested in applying to, you can look into the entrance requirements for these universities. Almost all universities will require you to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and many others will require that you take the ACT as well. Doing well on these exams can make the difference between getting into your top choice or not getting into any of your top schools so it is important to take these very seriously.There are many options when it comes to preparing for these tests. You can attend preparation courses for both the SAT and the ACT, but these tend to be expensive. You can also study on your own using one of the many study guides available. Be sure to check your high school library for these study guides before purchasing.  If you are still in high school, you should do this well before you graduate. If you have already finished high school, you can apply as soon as you have all of your application materials ready and the application period is open for your prospective universities.If you are planning to apply to several universities it is a good idea to begin preparing your materials well in advance. Make a list of required application materials for each university you want to apply to. Make note of deadlines and application fees as well. Remember that universities are looking for more than grades. Think of everything you have done that will be impressive to a university. This includes volunteer experiences as well as extracurricular activities. If you are still in high school, start work on your applications in the summer before your senior year begins.  Many students believe that, in order to get into a good medical school, you must be a pre-med major or a biology major. This is not true. More and more, medical schools are looking for students with well-rounded liberal arts education. This means that, in some cases, you could actually major in English and still get into a good medical school.If you do major in pre-medicine or biology, consider rounding out your education by taking classes in a variety of subjects. This will give you the best of both worlds by preparing you for what is to come in medical school, while also demonstrating that you’ve gained knowledge in a variety of subjects.  Volunteering is a good idea for many reasons. It gives you a chance to see what it’s really like to be a cardiologist, which can help you figure out if this is really what you want. Volunteering looks great on a CV, and it will give you experience in the field, which is valuable for many reasons. Try volunteering at a local cardiologist’s office, or any kind of medical clinic where you can gain experience.Even if you can’t find a volunteer opportunity in something related to medicine or cardiology, you can still volunteer. Look for volunteer opportunities that help people in need. For example, you can volunteer with Habitat for Humanity or at a local soup kitchen. If a university or medical school must choose between two academically impressive students, they will likely choose the student with volunteer experience. Some programs, such as Gap Medics, offer pre-medical students an opportunity to shadow doctors abroad, but you must be at least 16 years old.	Look into potential medical schools. Take the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). Apply to Medical School. Maintain a good relationship with professors. Prepare for the first step of your licensure examinations. Look for rotations in cardiology. Prepare for the second step of your licensure examinations. Get involved in all your school has to offer. Complete an internal medicine residency. Take the last step of USMLE and/or COMLEX. Complete a cardiology fellowship. Choose a specialty. Be aware of the types of employment available for a cardiologist. Know the average salaries. Understand the day-to-day duties of a cardiologist. Consider becoming a member of the American Heart Association (AHA). Look into joining the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Take classes in the sciences during high school. Earn good grades. Look into universities that interest you. Take required entrance examinations. Apply to your chosen universities. Don’t assume you must be a pre-med major. Volunteer.
Make sure you have a large clean counter space to work. You may need to gather some special winemaking supplies to help your wine ferment properly, but they should be relatively inexpensive. You will need:  A 2 gallon (7.6 L) crock or glass jar A 1 gallon (3.8 L) carboy (a glass container with a small neck) An airlock A thin plastic tube to be used for siphoning Clean wine bottles with corks or screw caps Campden tablets (potassium or sodium metabisulfite) (optional); , You can use fresh or frozen cherries. Here are some things to consider when choosing cherries:  Frozen fruit is the best way to make country wines since it helps break down the fruit and promotes fermentation.However, the cherries are picked when fully ripe and frozen immediately, instead of being allowed to ripen over several days on the store shelves. Frozen cherries already have the seeds removed, so there will be less work involved when using frozen cherries. You can also freeze fresh cherries, just make sure to take the seeds out first! If using frozen cherries, make sure your fruit has been in the freezer for at least 3 days before beginning the process.  This step is only necessary if you are working with fresh cherries. Take off the stems and leaves and rinse the cherries thoroughly.  Some winemakers choose not to wash the fruit before crushing. Since fruit has natural yeasts on its skin, it's possible to make wine using only the yeast from the fruit's skin and the air. However, washing the fruit and controlling the yeast you add allows you to ensure that the flavor of the wine will be to your liking Allowing wild yeast to grow can produce foul flavors. If you're up for an experiment, you could make two batches of wine, one with controlled yeast and one with wild, to find out which you like best.  Again, this step only applies to those using fresh cherries. Removing the seeds can be tedious, difficult, and time-consuming. If you are using fresh cherries, try these methods to remove the cherry pits:  Use a toothpick, unbent paper clip, hair pin, or orange stick (as for manicures). Insert whichever tool you choose into the stem end of the cherry. You should feel it hit the pit. Twist your tool around the pit and pop it out. This is not easy. Be patient, experiment a bit for the twisting motion that works best for you. Insert a pastry tip or straw into the stem end of a cherry and push it through. The tip or straw should hit the pit and push it out the other side.  Place your cherries into a crock and use a potato masher to crush the cherries until the level of the cherry juice is within 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) of the top of the crock.  Top your crock off with filtered water if you don't have enough cherry juice to fill the crock almost to the top.  This releases sulfur dioxide into the mixture, killing wild yeast and bacteria.If you're starting with fresh cherries and making wild yeast wine, don't do this.  As an alternative to using a tablet, you can pour 2 cups of boiling water over the fruit. Using tap water can affect the taste of your wine since it contains additives. Be sure to use filtered or spring water., Honey provides food for the yeast and sweetens your wine. The amount of honey you use will directly affect the sweetness of your wine. Here are some things to consider:  If you prefer a sweeter wine, add more honey. If you don't like it as sweet, limit your honey to 2 cups. You can add sugar or brown sugar instead of honey if you'd like. You can always add more honey later if your wine doesn't come out as sweet as you like.  If you're using your own yeast, now is the time to add it. Pour it into the crock and stir it into the mixture with a long-handled spoon.  Only if you're making wild yeast wine can you skip this step.  The smell of your fermenting wine can attract insects so be sure to close your container enough to keep insects out while still allowing air to flow in and escape. You can use a crock lid designed for this purpose or stretch a cloth or t-shirt over the opening and secure it in place with a large rubber band. Place the covered crock in a warm area with a temperature around 70 degrees overnight.  Putting the crock in a cool place won't facilitate the growth of the yeast. Storing it in a place that's too warm will kill the yeast. The best bet is to store your fermenting wine in a place that is room temperature.  Now that your wine is fermenting, your winemaking process will move a lot slower. The day after you make the mixture, uncover it and stir it thoroughly before covering it again. Repeat this process every 4 hours or so the first day, then keep stirring a few times per day for the next 3 days.  The mixture should start bubbling as the yeast moves into action. This is the fermentation process that will lead to delicious wine., When the bubbling slows down, about 3 days after it begins, it's time to strain out the solids and siphon the liquid into your carboy for longer-term storage.  Once you've siphoned it into the carboy, affix the airlock to the opening to allow for the release of gas while preventing oxygen from coming in and spoiling your wine. If you don't have an airlock, you can use a small balloon placed over the opening. Every few days, pull off the balloon to let out the collected gas and replace it right away.  Let the wine age for at least one month. It's better if you can let it age for up to nine, during which time the wine will mellow, enriching the taste.  If you used extra honey in your wine, it's better to age it on the longer side, or it may taste overly sweet.  To prevent the wine from catching a bacteria that could cause it to turn to vinegar, add a Campden tablet to the mixture as soon as you remove the airlock. Siphon the wine into your clean bottles, filling them almost to the top, and cork them immediately. Allow the wine to further age in the bottles or enjoy it now!Use dark bottles to preserve the color of red wines.  There are a few different kinds of cherries on the market these days, and using a particular type will influence the taste of your wine. Here are some things to consider:  Try black cherries or sweet cherries for a sweeter wine. Morello cherries work well for a dry wine.  A dry wine is simply a wine that has no residual sugar, meaning it isn’t sweet.To make a dry wine, let your mixture ferment completely, allowing the yeast to consume all of the sugar. Here are some things to consider when making "dry" wine:  After about 2 weeks most of the sugar will have been consumed by the yeast and fermentation will slow, making it easier to keep track of the falling sugar level of your wine. Tracking the sugar level will give you an idea of how your fermentation has been progressing. You may wish to stop the fermentation early and leave a bit of residual sugar in your wine. The fermentation is considered done when you either reach your desired sugar level or go "dry" at 0° Brix on the wine scale.A wine with 0.2% residual sugar contains two grams of sugar in a liter of wine. Dry wines are typically in the 0.2%-0.3% range, off-dry wines in the 1.0%-5.0% range, and sweet dessert wines are normally 5.0%-10%. There is no "correct" sugar level for your wine, it just comes down to your personal preference.  You can give your wine an intriguing flavor by adding small amounts of oak during the fermenting process. Here are some things to consider:  Use oak powder. This way, you won't risk over-oaking your wine. The oak powder will also sink to the bottom of your crock during fermentation, making siphoning easier. When adding oak powder to a batch of homemade wine, you'll want to add anywhere from 4 to 20 grams per gallon, depending on the type of wine (white vs. red) and desired flavor. Generally speaking, for six U.S. gallons of wine you would add about 40 to 50 grams of oak powder for a white wine, or 70 to 85 grams of oak powder for a red wine.	Set up your space. Get your cherries. Clean the fruit (optional). Remove the seeds (optional). Crush the cherries. Add your Campden tablet (optional). Stir in the honey. Add the yeast (optional). Cover your crock and let it sit overnight. Stir your mixture a few times per day. Strain and siphon the liquid. Age your wine. Bottle the wine. Experiment with different types of cherries. Make a "dry" wine. Oak your wine!
When it comes to any relationship, honesty is the best policy.   You'd like your man to be honest with you, so be sure to afford him the same courtesy. You should never withhold or hide things from your man -- you may think that you are preventing him from getting hurt or angry, but this could really backfire in the long run, when he eventually finds out.; , Kindness is an important trait in any relationship, but one that is often overlooked.   The whole "treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen" is fine for the dating scene, but doesn't really work once you're in a relationship. Being kind encompasses a lot of things -- it means being patient and understanding if your guy makes a mistake, it means doing nice things for him just because you care, and it means treating him with dignity and respect, just as you would like to be treated.  Men may not like to admit it, but most of them desperately want a little TLC every now and them.   So don't forget to express your affection by giving him a big hug and kiss when he's looking a bit down. If you're at the "I love you" stage in your relationship, don't be afraid to remind him of how you feel or feel like he's the one who has to say it first.  Very often, people in committed relationships find themselves settling into a comfortable, predictable routine.   And while this has its benefits, its nice to inject some fun into your relationship and do something spontaneous every once in a while, just to keep things interesting. Plan a romantic weekend trip for the two of you, or organize a day out to visit a museum, zoo or art exhibition. Book a sky-diving or scuba-diving experience. Get out of your comfort zone and you'll see a whole new side to your other half!  , Treating a guy well is all about loyalty -- there's no point being nice to his face, then complaining about him behind his back to family and friends.   He needs to know that you're there for him and that you have his back 100% of the time -- just like he has yours. Next time someone disagrees with your man or criticizes him for something, speak up on his behalf -- this will let him know that you're on his side.  If you want your guy to trust you 100%, then you need to afford him the same luxury. Trust is a two-way street.   Don't panic if he doesn't immediately return your call or reply to a text -- guys are forgetful about these kinds of things -- it doesn't mean he's up to something shady. If your man is open and honest with you and has never done anything to hurt you in the past, then you have no reason not to trust him. So if he wants a wild night out with the guys, you can be totally zen about it!  , Making a guy feel good about himself is an important part of treating him well. You don't want to be around someone who puts you down all the time, and neither does he.   Be considerate of his feelings -- thank him when he does something nice for you to let him know that you appreciate him, and apologize when you say something harsh or uncalled for. If he's having a hard time at work, let him know that you believe in him and have confidence in his abilities. He'll feel much better about himself afterwards.  Sometimes we all just need to vent and share our feelings with another person.   You want to be that person for your man when he needs it, so show him that he can tell you anything by being a good listener. Try not to interrupt or make any judgmental comments -- just listen to what he has to say, try to be sympathetic and offer some constructive advice.  Men are egotistical creatures, so boosting his ego with a well-timed compliment can put him on top of the world.   Tell him he looks great today, that his gym workouts are really paying off, or that his new haircut really suits him. Let him know that he's the only man for you, and that you feel lucky to have him.  Your guy should know that he can count on you no matter what and that you'll always be there for him when he needs you.   Be his safety net when he needs it -- back him up if he wants to take a risk with a new business idea, support him if he's having family issues and be his shoulder to cry on when something bad happens. Being in a loving relationship is about sticking it out through the bad times as well as the good -- so don't be a fair-weathered girlfriend!  , Treating a guy well involves doing nice things for him from time to time, so why not let yourself in on the action and plan a fun date together!   Do the classic dinner and a movie if you haven't done that in a while, or try something a bit more adventurous like going paintballing, taking a dance class or attending a concert. Even a quiet night in can be jazzed up with a few candles, some romantic music and a nice bottle of wine!  , The old saying that "the way to a man's heart is through his stomach" is pretty spot on -- so do something nice for your man by cooking him a delicious meal, whether it's an old favorite or something new and exciting.   Don't worry if you're a terrible cook -- pick a very simple but tasty recipe, like some kind of pasta dish or coconut-based curry, and give yourself lots of time to prepare. Alternatively, you could just order take-out from his favorite restaurant and serve it nicely -- from actual plates rather than plastic containers!  , You really can't go wrong with giving your man a massage, especially after a long, stressful day.   Get some nicely scented massage oil, dim the light s(or light some candles) and put on some relaxing music. Invite him to take off his shirt and lie down. Work your way up his back and across his shoulders, focusing on any knots or areas of tension. He'll feel so good afterwards he might just fall straight asleep!  , Every so often, it doesn't hurt to get all dressed up for your man and make him feel lucky to have you. You'll feel like a million dollars when you see the appreciative look on his face!   Do all the things you used to do when you first started dating -- spend three hours getting ready if that's what it takes -- shaving and moisturizing and applying makeup and curling hair. Put on your best dress and a pair of killer heels -- now you're all set for whatever the evening may bring , whether it's a night on the dance floor or a romantic evening at home.  Nearly all men appreciate when a woman has an adventurous side in the bedroom, so unleash yours and watch your guy become putty in your hands!.   Try taking the lead if you're normally the one who just goes with the flow -- experiment with tying your man down or handcuffing him to the bed if that's what he's into. Remember that sexual intimacy is an important part of any healthy relationship, so don't withhold sex if you're feeling angry -- work things out in the bedroom!	Be honest. Be kind. Be loving. Be spontaneous. Be loyal. Trust him. Make him feel good. Be a good listener. Boost his ego. Let him know he can count on you. Plan a fun date. Cook for him. Give him a massage. Look your best. Be adventurous in the bedroom.
To turn mercury into gold, you will need the following:  Mercury (duh....). Get as much as you can, because it's not very efficient. A neutron source. Ideally you need a particle accelerator (or a nuclear reactor). A neutron moderator. Water (yes, the stuff out of a tap) works pretty well. Neutron shielding, reflecting and collimating equipment Nitric acid; , The neutrons from the source need to pass through the collimator (a thing that makes them go in straight lines) and the moderator (something that slows them down so that they react better) and finally into the mercury. Set up the neutron reflectors around the mercury (so that any escaping neutrons are reflected back) and then surround the whole thing with shielding., Ideally, you want to hit the mercury with a short, very intense burst of neutron radiation., Here's what's happening:  Ordinary mercury contains seven isotopes: Hg-196, Hg-198, Hg-199, Hg-200, Hg-201, Hg-202 and Hg-204. When it absorbs a neutron, Hg-196 becomes Hg-197. Hg-197 decays into gold. As a by-product, Hg-202 and Hg-204 become Hg-203 and Hg-205, which decay into thallium. Other isotopes change into each other and remain mercury.  After the neutron burst, the reaction that produces gold has a half-life of 64.14 hours. If you wait this long, half of the Hg-197 will have become gold., After the reaction, the mixture should largely contain mercury, with some thallium isotopes, and gold. Nitric acid will dissolve mercury and thallium, but not gold., You should be left with gold.  And now for the bad news: Hg-196, the isotope converted to gold, comprises 0.15% of natural mercury. Assuming perfect conversion to Hg-197, then after one half-life (half of the Hg-197 decays), a kilogram of mercury will give you... 0.73 grams of gold. That's right, you get less than three-quarters of a gram of gold per kilo of mercury.	Gather the equipment. Configure the equipment. Fire up the accelerator. Understand the science!, Wait. Treat the mixture with nitric acid. Filter off the mercury and thallium nitrates.
Modern slings are much more comfortable, ergonomic, and protective than what most individuals can craft. However, arm injuries can happen and you may have to improvise. If you are injured in the wilderness while on a camping trip, if may be impossible to obtain cloth to make the sling above. It is certainly better than no sling at all.  Use a sweater, sweatshirt, button-up shirt, or other long-sleeved garment. Tie the garment's sleeves behind your head and carefully insert your injured arm through the loop formed. Allow the clothing material to support the weight of your arm somewhere along the forearm or wrist - wherever is comfortable.   Try to adjust the length of the garment's sleeves that your knot allows to hang so that your arm can hang at a roughly 90 degree angle (horizontal to the ground). If you have safety pins handy, you may want to try "closing" the fabric of the long-sleeved garment around your elbow as a makeshift backstop for your sling as described in the method above.  One piece of clothing seemingly tailor-made for improvised slings is the belt, due it having the built-in ability to form a loop with an adjustable size. Secure the belt buckle behind your neck and slip your arm through the loop formed by the rest of the belt. Allow your arm's weight to be supported by the belt along the forearm or wrist. Tie or fasten the belt behind your neck so that your arm is supported at a 90 degree angle.   The belt's buckle can be uncomfortable against the back of the neck, so may want to shift the belt so that the buckle is in the length of belt stretching between your arm and neck. You can also put padding between the belt and your neck for greater comfort.  If you're injured in an office setting or while wearing formal ware, a necktie can suffice as a makeshift sling until a real one is available. As with the methods above, simply tie the necktie behind in a simple knot your neck and pass your arm through the loop formed. Adjust the positioning and length of your makeshift sling so that your arm hangs at a 90 degree angle.  Duct tape can be used very effectively to help immobilize the arm. It has strength, flexibility, and a fabric-like quality which lends itself quite well to this situation.   A loop of duct tape can substitute for a belt or tie, supporting the wrist, arm, and elbow. Duct taping the injured arm to the torso can help reduce movement. Be sure to avoid getting duct tape residue on the skin. Duct tape should be faced so that it does not adhere to the skin.  The types of situations in which you'll need to make a sling from your clothing are usually situations in which actual medical care is for some reason unattainable. If your injury is at all serious or persistent, seek the help and advice of a trained medical professional as soon as you can. Improvised slings are usually better than no sling at all, but they are no substitute for a real sling (to say nothing of the other treatments for an injured arm that a hospital can provide). It's better to be safe than sorry - don't risk worsening your arm injury by neglecting to show it to a doctor.	Improvised slings are not as good as professionally-designed slings. Use a long-sleeved garment as a sling. Use a belt as a sling. Use a tie as a sling. Duct tape. Seek medical attention (and/or a real sling) immediately.
Depending on the cardboard scraps you have, here are some suggested preparation methods (in each case, try to make the resulting circles evenly sized):   If you're using cardboard cut from cardboard tubes/rolls, cut the card pieces down to similar size to form even, shorter circular shapes. If you're using cardboard strips, cut to even size and roll into circular shapes. Glue or staple into place. Allow to dry before using. If you're using corrugated cardboard, roll into circles in a spiral fashion (as pictured above). Glue or staple into place and allow to dry before using. If you're using old cards (for example, Christmas cards), cut the cards into even strips and roll into circular shapes. Glue or staple into place and allow to dry before use.; , Take the different circles made from the cardboard scraps in the first step and create a wreath circle on a flat surface. Shift the circles around until you're satisfied with the design you've created.  Taking care to keep the overall shape, glue each circle together until the entire wreath forms. Let dry.  Tie a bow from ribbon and glue to the top of the string where it has been knotted, to cover the knot.  Done.	Prepare the cardboard. Arrange the wreath shape. Glue the circles together. Attach string or ribbon to the "top" of the wreath to make a hanger. Hang the wreath up.
You can use compilers on the internet if you can't download one.; , Brainf**k converts letters and symbols into their ASCII value, and stores them in this form. You'll need to be able to look up the values for letters while you are programming.  Imagine a ribbon of paper, divided into squares. The ribbon is one square wide, but an infinite number of squares long. In each square, you can put a number. Now imagine that you have a pointer (e.g. a pencil) that can point to ONE of the squares. Brainf**k can move the pointer back and forth along the ribbon, change the value in the square that the pointer is pointing to, and go around in loops.  The pointer is pointing to a particular square. < moves the pointer to the square before the current one. > moves it to the square after.  + increments (adds one to) the value of the current square. - decrements (subtracts one from) the value of the current square.  A full stop . is the output command. This reads the number in the current square, then outputs the corresponding ASCII character (this is why you need the ASCII table).  A comma , is the input command. This will ask you to input a string of characters. It will take the first character and store it's ASCII value in the current square, overwriting any value already there.  Otherwise, it will continue to the next instruction. When the program encounters a ], it will skip back to the corresponding [ Loops can be nested (placed one inside the other).  If you understand the instructions above, you should be able to figure out how it works. It will print Hello World! on the screen.   ++++++++>+>+>->>+<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.  There are many derivatives of brainf**k. Some of them add new features. Others simply replace the instructions with different words.   Ook! is a simple derivative of brainf**k. It doesn't change any instructions, it just replaces them with ooks. Here's the translation: < = Ook? Ook.   > = Ook. Ook?   + = Ook. Ook.   - = Ook! Ook!   . = Ook! Ook.   , = Ook. Ook!   = Ook? Ook!      Ook! was designed to be read by orangutans (as a joke). Blub is another simple derivative. It's exactly the same as Ook!, just swap the word Ook for the word Blub e.g. [ = Blub? Blub!      As Ook! was designed for orangutans, Blub was designed for fish.

; , A wooden spoon with a sturdy handle is a good idea, since it will help you mix the dough into a uniform consistency. Be careful though - you don't want to over-mix the dough!  ,   You can spray the sheet with cooking spray or brush it with oil. Two soup spoons or teaspoons can be used to drop round blobs of about the right size onto a cookie sheet fairly quickly. Leave a couple inches between adjacent cookies and don't pack them together too closely. They will tend to spread out somewhat as they bake, and it helps them to bake evenly if there's space in between.  This achieves that crisscross pattern characteristic of peanut butter cookies. If you don't do this, the balls will still spread into a cookie shape, but you won't have the pattern on top. ,,	Preheat the oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Measure the ingredients straight into a large bowl and mix them together. Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and place them on a lightly greased cookie sheet. Use a fork to press into each of the dough balls, then turn the cookies 90 degrees and press again. Place the cookie sheet in the preheated oven and bake for ten minutes.  , Cool for two to three minutes on the sheet, then transfer the cookies to a rack to cool for another 5-10 minutes before digging in.  , Finished.
Your child learns by observing your actions. While you might sometimes feel like yelling or showing your child that you are really angry, you should try to stay calm in the face of his bad behavior. When you yell and get angry, you are showing him that it is ok to sometimes act out in that way.Instead of yelling or showing your anger, calmly approach your child and tell him—again calmly—that his bad behavior has made you really upset.; , It is important to remember that it is not necessary to correct every single thing that you child does wrong. When you constantly are telling your child he has done something wrong, or disciplining him for a bad behavior, may cause your child more stress. When a child with bipolar disorder gets stressed, it is more likely that he will act out.Take a step back and consider what things your child does need to be controlled, and what can be ignored. Sometimes little moments of acting-out that don’t affect anyone can be ignored. Talk to your partner and make a decision about your child’s specific actions and which ones you want to discourage.  Once you decide which behaviors you are going to discourage, reinforce, or ignore, you need to stick to that decision. Bipolar disorder can often create a feeling of needing control or consistency so when you are consistent with your disciple, your child will understand what is happening better than if you sometimes disciplined his behavior and sometimes ignored it.Remember that, like children without bipolar disorder, your child will most likely test the limits of your disciple. Try to be as consistent as possible and continue to discourage or encourage as different behaviors occur.  Children who have bipolar disorder tend to show a heightened awareness of fairness, particularly when it comes to discipline. Like any other child, your bipolar child probably won’t like the disciple you dish out, but he will be more likely to accept it if he thinks it is fair. Come up with logical forms of disciple that relate directly to your child’s bad behavior. Think of this as a consequence that ‘fits the crime’.For example, if your child is handling a toy really aggressively and starts banging it on the ground, tell him that it is going to break and that he will not get a new one if it does break. If it does break, tell him again that he is not going to get a new one, and take the broken toy away.  If your child understands that a certain type of behavior is not simply “bad”, but rather that it affects others in a negative way, he will think twice before behaving that way again. Children can find it challenging to put themselves in another person’s shoes and understand how their words or actions might be hurtful or harming to those around them.   You can use dolls, drawings or any other sort of creative, playful activity to reenact the situation. You child is likely to show you a lot more about his feelings when playing, as opposed to talking. Act out the ‘bad’ thing that your child did, and then show him how is action affected you or others around you. You can also use exaggerated facial expressions to make your child understand how his ‘bad’ actions made you or someone else feel .	Resist the urge to yell or get visibly angry. Pick your battles. Be consistent with the things that you reprimand your child for. Discipline your child with logical consequences for his actions. Do not blame your child, but make him understand that what he has done is wrong.
Mother cats are not always able to stay with their kittens, they have to leave the kittens alone in order to find food for themselves. If you find one or more stray kitten, you need to be sure it has actually been abandoned by its mother before you take it inside.Unfortunately the only way to know for sure if the kitten is abandoned is to wait and watch the kitten. You’ll need to do this from a distance where the mother cat cannot see or smell you. If you wait a few hours and the mother cat doesn’t return, there is a good chance she’s not going to return. If the mother cat returns, it is best if the kitten stays with her until the kitten is weaned. Until then, you can help the mother cat by providing her with food, water, and some shelter. Once the kitten is weaned, you can decide if you want to bring her inside and try to socialize her, or leave her to live outside. Many stray cats and kittens actually live in colonies. If a kitten is at least 4 months old it can survive in the colony on its own.; , A kitten needs different care depending on its age, so the first thing you should do is try to estimate how old the kitten is. You can perform this estimation before touching the kitten and bringing it inside, if you can see her clearly.A newborn kitten who is less than a week old will: weigh approximately 3 to 8 ounces, have her eyes closed, have her ears folded down, and be unable to walk. She might even have a piece of her umbilical code still attached to her belly. A kitten who is between 1 and 2 weeks old will: weigh 8 to 11 ounces, have slightly open blue eyes, slightly open ears, and will attempt to move around. A kitten who is around 3 weeks old will: weigh 8 to 15 ounces, have open eyes and ears, be able to take tentative steps, and respond to noises and other movements. A kitten who is between 4 and 5 weeks old will: weigh 8 to 17 ounces, be able to run and play with her litter mates, be able to eat wet food, and will no longer have blue eyes.  Mother cats who are nursing have very strong maternal instincts and have been known to adopt other kittens into their litters. Since a mother cat’s milk is the absolute best food a kitten can be given, and a mother cat already knows how to take care of a kitten, being able to give the kitten to a nursing mother is the best option.Call your local humane society, veterinarian offices, and rescue organizations and ask if anyone has a mother cat who could take on an extra kitten (or two). Even if the kitten can be given to a nursing mother, you can still agree to take the kitten back once it’s been weaned.  Kittens have a lot of trouble regulating their own body temperatures (in fact, they cannot control their body temperatures at all until they’re at least 3 weeks old), therefore they need a lot of help to stay warm. Usually kittens will cuddle with their mother to keep warm, or they’ll cuddle with each other (often in a pile, one on top of the other).If the kitten is cold to the touch, warm her up with your own body heat. Use your hands to rub her body and increase blood circulation. Use a box, laundry basket, plastic tub, etc., and build the kitten a nest. Put blankets and towels inside the box to help keep her warm and prevent her from falling or climbing out. You can also put a heating pad inside the box (under a towel) if you need to, but make sure it’s only under a portion of the towel so the kitten can move away from the heat if she’s too hot. Because the kitten doesn’t have a mother cat to clean up after her, the bedding is going to get messy. Make sure to change it often so the kitten doesn’t get wet. If she does get wet, wipe off the mess and dry her with a towel.  A kitten can only drink kitten formula. Do not ever give a kitten any other type of milk that you may have on hand. This likely means you’ll have to go out and purchase some kitten formula at the pet food store as soon as possible.In addition to the formula, you’ll also need to purchase a bottle for the kitten. They’re likely sold in the same section as the formula. If available, purchase an elongated nipple for the bottle as they’re easier for the kitten to drink from.  If you need to feed the kitten, but there are no stores open, you can make up an emergency formula from things you may have at home. If you don’t have all the ingredients, chances are there’s a grocery store open even if the pet store is closed. This formula should only be used for emergency purposes.Option 1 — Mix together an 8 ounce can of evaporated milk with 1 egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of karo syrup. Strain the mixture to remove any lumps. Keep the mixture in the fridge until you need it for feedings. Make a bottle with ½ this mixture and ½ boiling water when it’s time for a feeding. Allow the mixture to cool before giving it to the kitten.Option 2 — Mix together 2 cups of whole milk, 2 raw egg yolks (organic if possible), and 2 tablespoons of protein powder. You may need to use a fork or a whisk to mix these ingredients together. Warm them up by putting the bottle in a bowl of warm water.  Kittens need to be fed as often as every 2 hours, depending on their age. Kittens also need to be fed while on their tummies, with the bottle upwards but at a slight angle. The milk you feed a kitten must also be warmed up, but not hot.Kittens 10 days old and younger need to be fed every 2 hours, around the clock, including the middle of the night. Kittens between 11 days old and 2.5 weeks old need to be fed every 3-4 hours, around the clock. Kittens between 2.5 and 4 weeks old need to be fed every 5-6 hours, around the clock. Once a kitten is 4-5 weeks of age, you can start weaning them off the bottle. You can do this by mixing formula with wet food and giving it to the kittens in a bowl, instead of a bottle. You can also start to give them dry food to see if they’re interested.  Just like human babies, kittens who are drinking formula via a bottle need to be burped when they’re done feeding. A kitten will usually stop drinking when she’s full, unless she’s having trouble latching onto the nipple of the bottle.If the kitten isn’t latching onto the bottle, you can pull on the nipple when she's trying to drink to help encourage her to suck harder. You can also move the nipple around, again, to encourage the kitten to suck harder. If the kitten is ill you may need to feed them via a tube directly into their stomachs. You’ll need to go to a veterinarian before you attempt to do this. Once the kitten has finished drinking, place her on your shoulder or on her belly and pat her back gently until she burps. Once she’s burped, use a warm and wet cloth to wipe her off and remove any excess milk that might have missed her mouth.  Kittens under the age of 4 weeks need help going pee and poo. Normally their mother will lick them to stimulate them to pee and poo, but since they have no mother, you’ll have to do this. Thankfully you don’t have to lick them, you can simply use a soft tissue or warm, moist cotton ball to do the job.Use the tissue or cotton ball to gently rub their bum until they pee and poo. While they’re only drinking formula, a kitten’s poo won’t be solid or in normal poo shapes.	Be sure the kitten is actually abandoned. Estimate the kitten’s age. Try to find a mother cat who is already nursing. Keep the kitten warm and dry. Purchase kitten formula. Make emergency kitten formula. Feed the kitten based on a schedule. Burp the kitten after a bottle. Stimulate the kitten so she pees.
The most important person to consider is the patient/loved one for whom the decision needs to be made. What are their wishes, what would they want? What have they said in the past about life support, death and dying?; , The hardest thing is putting your own wants, and the need to hold on to that person, aside, and deciding in the best interest of the patient/loved one. No one wants to lose a loved one, but is holding on to a person in a vegetative state, or putting someone through pain and suffering to keep them alive, what they would want?  , Ask questions about quality of life, potential outcomes, and alternatives. Don't expect your physician or the nurse to say how long a person has to live, since no one knows that but a higher power.  There is no right or wrong choice. Some people are kept alive until their body won't function any more. Some people are taken off life support and life-sustaining treatments like ventilators, dialysis, and tube feeding and allowed to go peacefully in their own time. ,   DNR (do not resuscitate) means nothing will be done to bring this person back if their heart stops or they quit breathing. They will be allowed to die without any measures to keep them alive. They will not have a tube put down to help them breath, they will not have someone compressing their chest to make their blood flow, and they will not be given medications to sustain life. They will still be kept comfortable, and any pain medications and treatments they are already receiving to keep them comfortable can be continued. DNI (do not intubate) means everything will be done to keep them alive except placing a tube down into their lungs and being placed on a ventilator to breathe. Chest compressions will still be done, and medicine will still be given. Consider comfort care only. You can specify that you only want measures taken to keep your loved one comfortable. No lab work, finger sticks, x-rays, or other procedures will be done. Only pain medicine and medicine to assist with comfort will be given. If you have a loved one in a nursing home or assisted living and they have a DNR or DNI status, obtain an armband, necklace, bracelet, or some kind of identification that states this. Many times when a resident collapses or goes into distress, the staff will not immediately remember the code status of the patient. If the patient has this identification on them and emergency personnel are called to the scene, it may prevent a person from having life sustaining measures done to them when they do not wish them done.  Discuss these issues with other family members and try to come to an agreement on what you want, keeping the loved one's wishes in mind. Feel free to ask doctors and nurses any questions you may have.  If you have a loved one with cancer or a disease that may be life ending, find a time when you can discuss what their wishes are. Even if your loved one is perfectly healthy, having this discussion is important. No one likes to talk about death and dying, and surely not their own death, but it makes it so much better for the families when they know they are doing what their loved one wanted.	Consider the patient. Put your own needs aside. Talk to the physician, hopefully more than one. Make a decision based on what you believe your loved one's wishes would be. Never regret your decision, it was the best decision you could make at the time.  , Learn about DNR, DNI and comfort care directives. Know that these decisions are yours to make - nurses and doctors can not make them for you. Don't wait until the last minute to discuss this.
Keep heavy items locked away or well out of their reach. If oven doors are not lockable, buy a latch to keep them shut unless you want to watch your child at all times when baking.; , They can bang on pans or sort your plastic storage containers while you cook or clean. If children cannot get into anything, they will find ways to get around your child-proofing measures. , Toddlers are not as sure of themselves when walking as older children, so it is especially important to ensure that the floors are dry and not slippery. If your bathroom floor has very slippery tile, it would be a good idea to put down rugs with a plastic gripping material on the back.  They could easily slip and hurt themselves. If the tub is slippery, using items like textured bath stickers or mats could help keep toddlers safe. Always supervise young children closely when in the bath because they can drown in only inches of water.  If your toddler is the curious type, an open door is an open invitation to trouble. Make sure you close and lock any doors to the outside or to unsafe areas. Use baby gates to help you close off dangerous areas that don't have doors, including stairways. Supervise children well when they're roaming around.  This will also prevent these items from falling on your child in the case of an earthquake other other disaster.  Toddlers will trip and fall often, but will do so less if the floor is clean and free of debris. Vacuuming and dusting often will also prevent toddlers from getting as many allergic reactions and other respiratory illnesses.	Use cabinet and drawer child latches to keep little hands out of poison and sharp items. If you can, leave some items accessible to toddlers that are safe. Make sure all toilet and shower cleansers are locked up, just like detergents and other chemicals in the kitchen.  , Keep the floors dry. Do not allow your toddler to stand or engage in horseplay while taking a bath. Take safety precautions for doorways and stairways. Make sure any furniture that children can climb (such as bookcases or entertainment centers) are affixed to the studs in the walls. Put toys and other items away often.
If you want healthy-looking, strong nails that will look clean and stay clean, mix a paste of baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, using about 2 1/2 tablespoons of baking soda per tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to create a paste. Spread the paste on and underneath your nails, then rinse and pat dry.          Applied weekly, this mixture helps to keep your nails white and luminescent, especially after having used a darker nail polish.Alternatively, try using whitening toothpaste in the same way. The active ingredients are essentially the same, if you're not interested in mixing up a batch of the home-made stuff.  To keep your nails pliable and free of cracks and other problems, it's a good idea to moisturize them regularly with aloe, cocoa butter lotion, or even natural oils like olive or coconut. These natural treatments won't necessarily change the look of your nails, but will help to keep them soft and pliable over the course of the week.  If you have yellowish nails, it can be the result of either smoking, stain from polish, or a fungal infection, which can be difficult to treat and get rid of. Tea tree oil, however, is a natural fungicide with antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, while lemon juice or lemon essential oil has citric acid which helps to whiten nails back to their original luster.          If you have yellow nails, try using an eye dropper to drop a small amount of tea tree oil onto each of your nails and let sit for 5 minutes, then rinse. Apply lemon juice in the same way, rinse, and clean your hands normally.  While it might sound strange, tablets used to make denture-cleaning solutions are high in citric acid and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), which can be used to clean, whiten, and otherwise improve the look of your nails. Instead of soaking false teeth, soak your fingernails.  Apple-cider vinegar is rich in malic and acetic acids, which have cleansing and anti-fungal properties which can help to whiten nails and keep them from infection and discoloration. Dilute vinegar with an equal part of clean water and soak nails for up to 20 minutes.  There are a lot of misconceptions about natural remedies for strengthening your nails, but the only sure way to do it is to introduce supplements into your diet. The only supplement that has been proven to strengthen nails is biotin, which takes an average of six months to show any effects.Most home remedies like applying garlic, or eating more protein, will not help your nails to grow faster or stronger., If you regularly wear nail polish, you can stain and weaken your nails in the long-term, even if you thoroughly clean them between applications. It's a good idea to let the nails build back up some strength and healthy color about once a year or so, keeping polish off them for a month or two.   Instead of applying polish, use the chance to really pamper your nails, applying coats of homemade cleansers and whiteners to get your nails looking good again. It's also important to always clear-coat your nails before adding colored polish to keep them from staining as easily as they might otherwise.	Apply baking soda to whiten. Moisturize your nails every week. Treat yellow nails with lemon juice or tea tree oil. Use denture-cleaning solution on your nails. Try apple-cider vinegar. Use supplements to strengthen nails. Give yourself periodic vacations from polish.
Before setting the clock, you should hang it on the wall where you intend to keep it. The clock must be in an upright position before you can set it.The clock should be 6 to 6.5 feet (1.8 to 2 m) above the floor. Use wide wood screw (like a #8 or #10) that is long enough the fasten into a stud in the wall. You must choose a spot in the wall with a stud; do not attempt to hang the clock where no stud rests. Place the screw in the wall at an upward 45 degree angle. It should stick out by about 1.25 to 1.5 inches (3.2 to 3.8 cm). Hang the clock on this screw. The clock must be flush against the wall. If the chains are still in their packaging, slowly remove the packaging and loosen any knots. Pull out the security wire between them. Do not handle the chains in this manner while the clock is horizontal or upside down since doing so can cause the chains to come loose. One weight should be placed on each chain hook. Make sure that the pendulum rests on the hanger at the bottom of the clock, near the back.; , If the cuckoo bird's door is kept closed with a wire latch, you need to move the latch aside.   Failing to unlatch the door can prevent it from opening when it should. This can cause damage to your clock. If the cuckoo does not call at the appropriate time even with the door unlatched, check the wire latch again to make sure that it did not slip back into a locked position. You should also make sure that the shut-off switch is not flipped into a silent position (when applicable) and that all clips, rubber bands, and Styrofoam packing materials have been removed from inside the clock.  Grab the chain that does not have a weight on it and gently pull it directly down toward the floor.   Do not lift or otherwise touch the weighted chain as you wind the clock. There must always be some pressure on the weighted chain in order to keep it in place within the clock. The unweighted chain may have a ring on it.  Gently nudge the pendulum to either side using your hands. It should continue swinging on its own after you start it.   The pendulum should not rub against the clock cabinet and should swing freely. If this is not the case, then the clock probably isn't completely vertical. Readjust and try again. You should also listen to the ticking. If the clock does not tick evenly on both sides, you should readjust the straightness of the clock until the ticking sounds even.  Turn the long hand of the clock to the left until you reach the correct time.When done in this manner, the cuckoo call should set itself automatically. There is no need to pause and check the sound.  If you turn the long hand to the right, you must pause at every hour ("12") and half hour ("6") mark before continuing to turn it.   Wait for the cuckoo call to finish playing before you turn the minute hand any further past these marks. If you have a musical clock, wait for the melody to finish playing before you continue to turn the minute hand. When setting a cuckoo clock that has both cuckoo birds and quails, you will also need to stop at the quarter past ("3") and quarter until ("9") marks. Wait for the call or music to stop before continuing.  Do not turn the shorthand at all when setting the clock.   Turning the hour hand instead of the minute hand will damage the clock.  Even if you purchased a new, pre-regulated cuckoo clock, you should observe it for a full 24 hours to determine if it is on time.   After setting the original time, compare the time on the cuckoo clock to the time shown on another trusted clock, watch, or time-keeping device. Make sure to use a time-keeping device that can be trusted. Stick with a watch or similar device that has always been reliable in the past.  If the clock runs too fast, slow it down by carefully moving the pendulum bob downward. This causes the pendulum to move slower.   The bob will usually look like a weighted disc or leaf. Monitor the clock for the rest of the day to make sure that this adjustment was correct.  If the clock runs too slow, speed it up by carefully pushing the pendulum bob up. This causes the pendulum to swing faster.   The pendulum bob will usually be in the shape of a leaf or weighted disc. Continue checking the clock's accuracy to determine if this adjustment was correct.  The frequency with which you need to wind the clock will vary depending on the model, but you'll usually need to wind it once every 24 hours or once every eight days.Each time you wind the clock, do so in the same manner used to wind the clock initially. Pull the unweighted chain down to raise the weighted chain up as high as it will go without resistance.  The cuckoo noise of some clocks can be switched of manually as desired. Make sure that the switch is adjusted to either play or mute the sound as desired.   The switch can be found on either the bottom of the clock or to the left side. Usually, you will need to flip the switch off to turn off the cuckoo call and flip it down to turn the call back on again. This can vary by model, though, so you may need to check with the manufacturer to verify the correct way to use the manual shut-off switch. Never adjust this switch while the cuckoo call or song is actively playing. Note that this feature is not available on every model. It can be especially rare for vintage or antique cuckoo clocks.	Keep the clock in a vertical position. Unlatch the cuckoo door. Wind the clock. Nudge the pendulum. Turn the minute hand counterclockwise. Alternatively, turn the minute hand clockwise and pause. Never move the hour hand. Observe the clock for 24 hours. Move the pendulum down to slow the clock. Move the pendulum up to speed up the clock. Wind as needed. Adjust the cuckoo shut-off switch as needed.
; , Note the following:    Coloration: Many Gerts (a short form of referring to Santa Gertrudis cattle; also referred to as "Santa Gerts") range from a deep cherry-red to a more reddish color. There are very often no white on any cattle of this breed, as the cattle of this breed are solid red. They have lighter colored noses, lighter pigment around the eyes, and also on the udder and scrotum of cows and bulls, respectively.  Body type and characteristics: Santa Gerts always look to be a cross between a European breed and a Brahman, which in fact they are. Santa Gertrudis are 5/8 Shorthorn and 3/8 Brahman. Bulls have a slighter more prominent hump over their shoulders than cows do, but it's not as big nor defined as in Brahman cattle. Most cows have a very shallow hump over their shoulders, whereas others may not have any hump at all. They have the loose skin and dewlap characteristic of a Brahman, as well as skin hanging loose from the navel in both sexes of this breed, but note that both characteristics are less defined in Gerts than in Brahmans. A Gert will look more blocky and less smooth over the rump than a Brahman.  Head characteristics: Gerts have what's referred to as "less ear" than a typical Brahman, thanks to the Shorthorn influence in this breed. They lack the dished nose of the Brahman, also due to Shorthorn influence, but still maintain the broadness in the forehead typical of a Brahman. Gerts can be horned or polled, with the horns jutting up, out and slightly back from the head.  Other characteristics: Known as a calving-ease breed, and one that is highly tolerant of a tropical climate and insect-resistant, but more tolerant of colder temperatures than the Brahman, Santa Gertrudis are a beef breed that are often known to have better meat quality than the Brahman breed, thanks to the Shorthorn influence in this breed. Santa Gertrudis is, like the Brahman, made in America, with the breed's foundations started on the King Ranch near Kingville, Texas. Santa Gertrudis may have the temperament of the Brahman, but it is known also that they are as docile as the Shorthorn breed from which 5/8's of the breed is created from. , Take pictures of what you thought were Santa Gertrudis cattle, and compare them with pictures of Santa Gertrudis on the Internet and in your Cattle breeds book.	Do a search on the Internet or in a Cattle Breeds book for "Santa Gertrudis". Study the characteristics of the breed. Memorize the details and characteristics of this breed.  , Go on a field trip or road trip and see if you can find farms and ranches with Santa Gerts.
You should eliminate these bombs right away as, with any level, if a bomb goes off, it's game over.; , These are the goal of your level and should be a second priority. Nothing spells rage quit more than a single block of jelly that you overlooked.  You will need a lot of luck to make it through this level. Your main combination will be striped candies, with color bombs being a heaven sent.  Check if you have a "good hand," meaning you have a lot of similar colors or not.   If it looks like a bad hand, exit the game without using a move and you won't lose a life. If you do have a good hand, proceed with the game.  Unfortunately, for jelly-covered bombs, you're only given 9 moves to eliminate them. On the plus side, they're on the same row.  Or if you already have them, bring them down and use them on the same row as the time bombs. You'll only need to do this once, and the bombs will be eliminated.  Start building more striped candies and use them on the row where the two outer jelly boxes are.  These are a huge help, especially if the jellied candy on the outside of the board are the same color.  Congratulations, you’ve won level 109!	Make jelly-covered bombs your first priority. Make jellies your second priority. Know your candy mixtures. Start your game and enter level 109. Prioritize the two time bombs at the lower half of the board. Make striped bombs. Focus on the jellies once you've eliminated the bombs. Make some color bombs if possible. Continue matching candies until you've wiped out all of the jellies.
The best way to burn more calories is to incorporate more exercise into your daily routine. Cardiovascular exercises like walking, running, swimming, and biking help you to burn calories even after you have finished. You should aim for at least 30 minutes per day, but keep in mind that the longer you work out, the longer your body will keep burning calories after you have finished., Muscle burns 2.5 times more calories than fat, so the more muscle that you have on your body, the more calories you will burn when your body is at rest. If you don’t already have a strength training regimen, add strength training into your daily routine.   Focus your strength training on large muscle groups for maximum burn, such as the thighs, arms, abdomen, back and chest., The more you move throughout the day, the more calories you will burn. Add small bursts of exercise throughout your day to increase your overall calorie burn. Park further away from the entrance at the mall, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or do some lunges or crunches during commercial breaks when watching TV., Studies show that lean people fidget for about 150 minutes a day more than obese people do. That kind of low-grade activity (tapping feet and fingers, twirling hair, gesturing while speaking, etc.) can burn 350 calories a day, which translates into 10 – 30 pounds a year! It's called Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) and it includes any movement that isn't intended as exercise. You can burn an extra 100 – 150 calories an hour by increasing NEAT.Here are some ideas:   Standing burns 50% more calories than sitting. Stand while talking on the phone, using the computer, or reading the paper. Pacing is even better. By pacing, you can burn 90 more calories an hour than if you were sitting still. Make it a habit to pace whenever you use the phone. Buy a workstation or desk that you can stand at or, if you can, set up a desk over a treadmill. By walking 1 mile (1.6 km) an hour while you work, you'll burn an additional 100 calories per hour which, if you do this for two to three hours a day, you could lose 44 – 60 pounds in a year. It's recommended that you start slowly, though, walking 15 minutes every hour and then increasing gradually. Alternatively, you can use a mini-stepper under a tall desk, or while watching TV to achieve the same results.	Incorporate at least 30 minutes of cardio into your daily routine. Add strength training to burn more calories while your body is at rest. Look for little ways to burn more calories. Fidget.
There are a lot of aspects of your appearance that you cannot control. Luckily, however, attraction is based more on those parts of your appearance that you can control.Staying neat, clean, and paying attention to your appearance will attract your husband more effectively than undertaking any drastic makeovers.Be sure that you:   Brush your teeth twice a day Shower regularly Shave or trim as appropriate Keep your hair combed and neat; , You shouldn't have to change your style to please your husband. However, having clean clothes that fit your body are key to seeming attractive.It also helps to wear clothes that are a bit more formal, so avoid sweatpants or ripped jeans.Look for comfortable, natural fabrics that are easy to care for such as cotton, wool, and silk: this will help you keep your clothes in great shape.   If you struggle to find clothes that fit, consider finding a store that specializes in your body type. The clerks should be able to guide you to well-fitting clothes that suit your tastes.  Men tend to be more attracted to women wearing red than women who wear other colors.Red evokes passionate feelings and emotions, so buy some special red clothing, undergarments, and lingerie if you want to make an impression.  Age does not do the human body any favors. You don't need to be supermodel skinny or have a six-pack to look attractive to your husband, however.Simply manage your weight through a nutritious diet and moderate exercise to keep yourself healthy and in shape.   Maintaining a healthy and moderately fit physical appearance will also help you feel more self-confident. Self-confidence is often an attractive quality. A little will usually go a long way. Take a brisk walk 20 minutes each day. Cut back on portion sizes and high calorie foods.  Good posture makes your body look its best and inspires feelings of attraction in others.Stand up straight, sit up straight, and resist the urge to slump or slouch. Keep your head up and your shoulders back in order to appear your best.  Once in a while, buy some sexy lingerie or a similarly sultry piece of clothing. Show it to your husband and let him know that you made the purchase with him in mind. You can also consider purchasing something eye-catching in his favorite color.   The way you deliver the message can have just as big an impact as the message itself. For example, casually slip your newest piece of lingerie into his hand, then silently walk away with a slight sway in your hips. Your body language can convey more meaning than the words alone would.  You don't need to completely transform your appearance: changing even one quality in a subtle way can be enough to catch your husband's eye again.Consider getting a new hairstyle, adding highlights to your hair, or treating yourself to a day at the spa to give your skin a new glow. If you don't want the expense or permanency of a bigger change, try something as simple as buying a new shade of lipstick or eye makeup.  Smiling is one of the most significant acts you can do to catch a man's eye when you're single, so it's little wonder that smiling at your man once you've married him will move him in the same way. Looking friendly, pleasant, and happy are keys to making your husband feel attracted to you.	Stay well groomed. Buy nice clothes that fit. Wear red. Stay moderately fit. Have good posture. Buy with him in mind. Give yourself a mini makeover. Smile.
Food is the primary resource required to move your way up the ages in Age of Empires 2, so make it your mission to gather as much and as quickly as you can.   At the start of the game, you are provided with a cavalry scout. Use the scout to quickly explore the area near your Town Center for food by moving him around the unexplored areas. There usually are a few sheep in the unexplored areas close to the Town Center. Send those back to the Town Center so villagers can gather food from them while easily storing it there. Also be on the lookout for cherry bushes, which are another source of food.; , Have 2 of the 3 villagers you are provided with at the start of the game gather food while the third builds two houses with the 200 Wood you are initially provided with. The houses will allow you to accommodate extra population as you try to create more villagers.   As soon as the houses are built, reassign the builder to food gathering.  Using the food gathered by the initial 3 villagers, create at least 6 more villagers.   Assign 4 of these to food gathering and 2 to woodcutting. Now you have 7 villagers gathering food.  You had 200 Wood at the start of the game, and at this point, 60 has been used to build 2 houses. Together with the Wood gathered by the two villagers assigned to the woodcutting, you should by now have around 300 Wood.   Explore the area using the scout cavalry to find the sea. Use 150 Wood to construct a fishing dock and the remainder to create two fishing ships (at 75 Wood each). Command the fishing ships to fish. You can do this by left-clicking the ship to select it and then right-clicking a part of the sea with fish (you will see them jumping about in the water).  Assign any spare villagers you have to gathering, and as soon as you have more than 500 food, go to the Town Center and click the “Age Up” button. This will start the process of advancing your colony to Feudal Age (Age II).  This resource will be needed to level up to higher ages. Just select or create a few more villagers and have them mine the boulders with yellow streaks on them, which you will find in areas nearby.  The next ages after the Dark Age that your colony is initially in are Feudal Age (costs 500 food), Castle Age (costs 800 food and 200 Gold), and finally, Imperial Age (costs 1000 food and 800 Gold). Continue having your villagers gather resources for the cost of aging up, and once you’ve had enough resources, just go to the Town Center and click the “Age Up” button.   Advancing your age in AoE2 costs significant amounts of resources (food and Gold), and the more resources you spend, the more the Tech points you will have at the end of the game. Advancing your age also makes more technologies available for researching. The more technologies you research, the more the resources you will use up, and the more the Tech points you will earn.	Use the scout to find . Assign your existing villagers to food gathering and building a few houses. Create at least 6 extra villagers. Build a fishing dock and start fishing. Advance to Feudal Age (Age II). Start gathering Gold. Advance to later ages.

Authentic logos are usually placed on the lens, arms, or inside the ear piece and use consistent size, font, and colors. Any slight error or variation could indicate your sunglasses are fake. Misspelled brand names (e.g. "Guci" instead of "Gucci" and logos are also an indication that the glasses may be fake. Before you purchase sunglasses, go to the manufacturer website and look at the markings and logos. This will help you when you make a purchase.; , Model number are consistent worldwide no matter whether you purchase the sunglasses online or in a store. Go the manufacturer website to verify the model number of the sunglasses. The model number is usually found on the frames of the glasses. Fake sunglasses may have model numbers that are not listed on the manufacturer website.  Authentic sunglasses are usually sold by an authorized website, boutique, or store. Street vendors are most likely selling counterfeit items.If the price is deeply discounted and sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stay away from websites that do not take returns and offer no way (e.g. phone number, email address, etc.) for you to contact them.   China is hotbed for counterfeit production. Be careful when purchasing items made in China. If you purchase from a website, check out the buyers rate and the sellers' reviews. A web site selling authentic sunglasses will often have a guarantee of authenticity. Your sunglasses should look and feel like they are well made.  Words like "high quality," "cosmetic," "replica," "inspired by," are often used to when glasses are not authentic. Take note if you see any of these words being used to describe the seller or the glasses. In addition to the glasses being fake, they may shatter easily and not offer you UV protection.  There is not one simple formula to determine if the sunglasses are authentic. Use common sense and your best judgement. Adequately research the company you are purchasing the sunglasses from. It is possible to find a really good deal on authentic sunglasses. If the price is really low, examine the other factors before you make a purchase.	Examine the label and logo. Look for a model number. Buy from a reputable seller. Recognize key words. Follow your gut.
, Meanwhile, pour your heavy cream into another heat-proof bowl. In a pot, heat some water to just under boiling point. When the water is hot enough, place the bowl of cream on top. Make sure that the bowl is not touching the water.  Let it simmer there for a few minutes before bringing off the heat. Set it down and pour the chocolate into the cream. The cream will melt the chocolate due to the heat. Leave the cream-chocolate mixture for about 5 minutes.  Try to stir it together as best as you can.    The butter is optional, therefore you do not need to use it. You should add the butter if you are planning to whip the ganache to make it a thicker, more spreadable frosting-like consistency. Of course it will thicken up in the fridge (if you choose to put it in), but this entirely up to you. If you want to put your ganache in the fridge, do this now. Let it chill for about 4 hours. Then, let it come to room temperature and use for whatever you need it for.  If you want to go that extra step to make your ganache silky smooth and a perfect frosting consistency, follow through! You will need to use either a hand mixer or some kind of mixer to do this step. Whip it for a few minutes, and you're good to go!	For this decadent icing, you will need:   1 cup of chocolate, roughly chopped 1 cup of heavy cream 2 tbsp of butter  , Place your chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and set it aside. Bring the cream to a simmer. After 5 minutes, use either a wooden spoon or spatula to mix the ganache. The ganache should still be a little warm, so stir in the butter. If you want to use your ganache as it is now, feel free to do it.

Several schools, programming companies or other sources have created websites that will very easily calculate covariance values for you. Using any search engine, enter the search term “covariance calculator.” , Read the instructions on the website carefully to make sure that you enter your data properly. It is important that your data pairs are kept in order, or you will generate an incorrect covariance result. Different websites have different styles for entering your data.  For example, at the website http://ncalculators.com/statistics/covariance-calculator.htm, there is a horizontal box for entering x-values and a second horizontal box for entering y-values. You are instructed to enter your terms, separated only by commas. Thus, the x-data set that was calculated earlier in this article would be entered as 1,3,2,5,8,7,12,2,4. The y-data set would be 8,6,9,4,3,3,2,7,7.  At another site, https://www.thecalculator.co/math/Covariance-Calculator-705.html, you are prompted to enter your x-data in the first box. Data is entered vertically, with one item per line. Therefore, the entry on this site would look like:  1  3  2  5  8  7  12  2  4   , The attraction of these calculation sites is that after you enter your data, you generally need only to click on the button that says “Calculate,” and the results will appear automatically. Most sites will provide you with the intermediate calculations of the x(avg), y(avg), and n.	Search the Internet for covariance calculators. Enter your data. Calculate your results.
To ensure accurate results, you need to take the following precautions in the hours leading up to the test:   Ask your healthcare provider which medications you should avoid on the day of the test. Do not smoke within 24 hours of the test. Do not drink alcohol within 4 hours of the test. Do not exercise strenuously within 30 minutes of the test. Wear comfortable clothing that allows you to breath easily. Do not eat a heavy meal within two hours of the test.; , A history of smoking, chronic coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath are a few of the symptoms that are important for the medical staff to consider as they analyze your spirometry test results., They may show you one or more breathing techniques that you will use during the test. Pay attention to the type of breaths they take and be ready to try them yourself., This clip closes your nostrils, ensuring that all of the air you expel during the test will exit through your mouth to be measured by the spirometer., A tight seal is necessary to prevent air leakage.It is important that all the air you are about to exhale goes into the spirometer for accurate measurements., Your lungs should feel filled to their maximum., Think of this as trying to get all of your air out as quickly as possible. It is important that you exhale quickly for an accurate measurement of the volume you can expel within the first second., Your lungs and throat should feel empty. It is important that you discharge all the air for an accurate measurement of how much you exhaled in one entire breath., The test can make you feel lightheaded, so make sure to breathe evenly when appropriate to prevent dizziness., Although breathing this way may feel unnatural, this pattern allows the spirometer to measure pulmonary functions such as lung capacity and airflow.  You might need to increase your inhalation, the speed of your exhalation, or the duration of your exhalation for the next attempt.  Multiple measurements give you a chance to correct performance errors, and provide the necessary data for the test results., The medical professional who administered the test may not be able to give you the results right away. It depends on the type of medical professional who is administering the test. You may have to wait to speak with your doctor about the results after they’ve been reviewed by a specialist., Your height, weight, age, and sex are some of the variables the specialist considered when comparing your test results against the standard measurements. Your doctor should be able to answer questions about how these variables factored into their diagnosis., Diagnoses may include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, . Test results might also be used to determine eligibility for surgery. Your doctor will work with you to determine the right medications and lifestyle changes necessary to maintain and improve your pulmonary health.	Avoid activities which might affect your normal lung function. Report smoking and medical history to the medical staff. Watch the demonstration by the medical staff. Continue breathing normally through your mouth once the soft clip is placed on your nose. Wrap your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Take as deep a breath as possible. Exhale hard and fast. Continue exhaling, until no more air will come out. Breathe normally between attempts. Breathe using the same pattern you did during the practice test. Listen to any notes the medical staff give you on your breathing pattern. Repeat the breathing pattern at least 2 times, with breaks in between. Wait a few days to hear from your referring doctor. Review the results with your doctor. Create a treatment plan if you’ve been diagnosed with a condition.

Infants with cradle cap often have other symptoms related to dry, easily-irritated skin. Use a humidifier in your baby's room to keep the air moist and humid so his or her skin doesn't get too dry., Applying a moisturizer while the scalp is still slightly damp and warm after bathing can help trap moisture in the skin, preventing it from becoming dry and scaly. Use a lotion or ointment formulated for babies' sensitive skin.  Cradle cap is in some cases caused by an allergy to baby formula. If your baby has red patches on his or her face and experiences diarrhea and other allergy symptoms in addition to cradle cap, talk to your doctor about switching to a formula that is healthier for your baby.	Humidify your home. Moisturize the baby's scalp after bathing. Consider the baby's diet.
Cats are drawn to furniture for a variety of reasons. A cat may jump on a couch near a window or get on a kitchen counter in search of food. Make your furniture less appealing by eliminating the built-in rewards cats seek by climbing on furniture.Keep blinds closed if you have furniture near windows. This way, cats will not be drawn to furniture to sunbathe or look out windows. Remove any excess padding from furniture when it's not in use. For example, after you get done lounging on your couch to watch a movie, remove any blankets or pillows you used. Keep surfaces in the kitchen free of food and other debris that cats will be drawn towards.; , Cats dislike slippery surfaces. When not in use, line furniture with tinfoil. This will deter your cat from jumping up on the furniture as they will dislike sliding around.This tends to work best with small bits of furniture, such as coffee tables.  For non-fabric surfaces, place double-sided sticky tape in stripes or criss-cross patterns on things like coffee tables, mantels, and kitchen counters. If your cat finds their feet get sticky after jumping on a piece of furniture, they're more likely to stay off that furniture.Do not place double-sided sticky tape on leather furniture. It will leave residue behind that's difficult to get off.  Repellent sprays often work great for fabric surfaces. If you want your cat off a couch or a chair, spray that surface down with a commercial cat repellent spray. Commercial sprays will not harm cats, but will contain oils and other scents that repel them from furniture. Follow the directions on a spray bottle closely and apply it to your furniture to keep cats down.Always test a spray on a small, unnoticeable patch of furniture first. Make sure it does not cause any damage or discoloration to the surface before applying it all over your furniture.  Plastic floor mats can be turned upside down and laid over furniture when it's not in use. Floor mats have small knobs on the bottoms that irritate a cat's feet. These knobs will not harm cats, but will be uncomfortable enough that your cat will be deterred from jumping on furniture., Cats respond better to built-in punishment. Rather than punishing your cat after it gets on the furniture, leave something on the furniture to startle your cat. Place some lightweight cookie sheets on the edge of the couch or chair, for example, that's balanced near the edge. When your cat jumps up, they'll land on the trays and be startled. With time, this may discourage your cat from getting on counters.	Make the furniture less appealing. Line furniture with tinfoil. Try double-sided sticky tape. Use a spray. Lay plastic floor mats over furniture. Create built-in punishment.
If you are taking care of someone after an episode, it’s important for the person to feel safe and secure in the environment. This alone can help recover memories.A safe environment can help create a sense of calm, which can allow for memories to resurface. You may return the person to his home, or create a safe space elsewhere.   Consider including blankets, pillows, and other soft items. Add familiar items or cherished items, such as photos of pets or children. Part of feeling safe and secure includes feeling supported by other people. Let the person know that you are there to help — offer to listen, to attend therapy with the person, or to offer comfort in other ways. Assure the person that it is safe for him to come to you when he feels upset and needs emotional support. As a friend or family member, you may feel frightened by what happened, or perhaps betrayed or upset by the person's behavior during the period of dissociative amnesia. Your safety is important, too. Working with a therapist — either on your own or as part of family therapy — can help you address these concerns.  Dissociative amnesia is usually the result of a traumatic or highly stressful event or situation, such as an accident, witnessing abuse or being abused, rape, natural disaster, financial crisis, or war.You should never attempt to address trauma without the assistance of a mental health professional, so make sure you are working with your therapist. Under the direction of your therapist, you will carefully deal with the trauma or conflict, learn new and productive coping skills, give meaning to the trauma, and work on ways to move forward with your life.Dealing with the trauma and learning coping skills for future times of stress can help you get back to living a functional life.  Stress can be a trigger for dissociation.Avoid de-stressing with activities such as drugs, alcohol, zoning out with tv/video games, bingeing on food, or oversleeping. To decrease dissociative episodes, find more effective and positive ways of coping. Manage stress by exercising regularly, engaging in positive social relationships, and relaxation.Start a meditation practice, yoga, or qi gong to help relax the body and mind.

Wear glasses in the meantime.If you can’t throw away the pair of contacts you have been using, purchase a contact disinfectant. Standard saline solution will not remove the bacteria that cause eye infections.  Your hands contain oils and bacteria that can plug up the gland further and make it worse. Always wash your hands before applying a compress or ointment to the stye.  Eyelid hygiene and warm compresses are the mainstays of stye treatment. Apply gentle baby shampoo to a clean washcloth and let it soak in for a few seconds. Lightly scrub the infected area with the washcloth, then rinse with warm water. Repeat twice per day.   Wash your hands before handling the washcloth to avoid spreading infection. If baby shampoo irritates your eyes, call a local ophthalmologist’s office to inquire about special eye soap that may be available for purchase.  Soak a clean washcloth with hot water. Wring out the washcloth, fold it, and press it over the stye.Add more hot water to the cloth if it cools down.   Use the compress for 10 to 15 minutes each time, up to four times a day. Use a clean washcloth each time. Excessive heat can damage the skin around the eyes. Don't use a washcloth hot enough to cause pain.  A normal stye will be a small red bump on the eyelid. If it becomes excessively large, if your vision becomes blurry, or if it is accompanied by fever or chills then it has become infected and you’ll need to see a doctor.Many styes are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, which may require topical ointment or drops. If the stye gets worse and involves surrounding tissues, you may need oral antibiotics.  If the condition does not improve with home treatment, a doctor may need to remove an eyelash or drain the stye.Visit your doctor promptly if you experience any of the following:   Multiple styes Spreading redness around the stye Eyelid swelling quickly Changes to your vision Photophobia (pain from bright light) A stye that does not disappear within 10 days.

This mainly applies to mascara because it is applied so close to the eye but sharing blush or concealer can cause infections as well.   Mascara wands can develop bacteria after three months so be sure to replace it regularly. Replace your old eye mascara after you had a stye. It may be infected with bacteria from the stye. Don’t wear make-up until the infection clears.  Use disinfectant on your contact lenses every few days. Throw the contacts away when they are past their suggested expiration.Always wash your hands before putting in contacts. Do not put your lenses in your mouth to wet them. Saliva is not sterile.

You might choose to cancel your card because the terms are no longer friendly.For example, the interest rate may be too high or the issuer might charge an annual fee. If so, you can call and ask the card issuer to change the terms.   Point to your history of being a good customer. Mention that you have never missed a payment. It costs lenders more to find new customers than to keep old ones, so don’t be shy about asking for a break on your interest rate or fees.All they can say is “no.”  , Sometimes, it’s better to just bite the bullet and cancel the card. For example, you might want to cancel a joint credit card because you are getting divorced. In this situation, you can suffer a temporarily drop in your credit score.   Credit utilization makes up 30% of your FICO score.Accordingly, a small bump up in utilization will hurt your score, but you can take actions that will send your score higher.

The tactics and logistics are necessary, and you may need to teach them if you are coaching beginners.   Teach the rules. Your players cannot play well if they do not understand the rules of volleyball, and you risk losing points, not to mention games. Make sure your team knows what they can and cannot do, what gets them points and what results in penalties.; , Talk to your players supportively, and if you are coaching children, talk to parents openly so they know what is going on at practice.   Keeping your communication positive rather than competitive will demonstrate that you have the best interests of the players in mind and provide a model of good sportsmanship. This is especially important if you are coaching kids.  The Socratic method of coaching uses questions to get players to think critically on their own. This may be a slower method, but it yields better results. Ultimately, players need to make high-level decisions themselves when on the court. For example:   "Carl, what do you think you can do differently to make your serve stronger?" "OK, everyone, what do you think we're going to focus on in this drill?", Including players in decisions builds trust and encourages them to think critically about the game.For example, during a timeout you can ask the team for feedback on their opponents and suggestions for strategy., For example, "We need to . . ."Keep it pithy. You can easily lose your players' attention if you talk too much, too generally. Concentrate your verbal feedback on helping each player focus on what's important in the moment., Whether you are coaching kids or adults, professionals or amateurs, the physical court needs to be safe. Inspect the practice and competition courts before every practice and match.   The ground should be free of sharp objects and glass. Check what's above the court. There should be 23 feet of overhead clearance. Remove objects like portable basketball goals, lighting fixtures, and tree limbs from the space above the court. If you're using a net supported by wires, they should be covered with soft material. Players should never grab the net or hang on to supports; this can cause the net to overturn and fall on them. To reduce risk of collision, players should "call" the ball to reduce the chance of colliding with another player. Having knowledge of first-aid is vital. You should know how to treat common minor injuries like facial cuts, bruises, or minor tendinitis, strains, or sprains. Have an emergency contact plan for more serious injuries that require a medical professional., Planning can be time-consuming, but it is important to figure out in advance what to do during practice.   Decide what warm-ups, drills, and/or practice games you're going to do. Decide how much time to leave for each element. Writing out your plans not only gives you something to refer to during practice, but also serves as a reminder of what you've done and what you're going to do. Some websites provide downloadable planners for volleyball coaches. These templates might help you get organized., This shouldn't be intense: go from 40% heart rate gradually up to 60%, then follow with a 5-minute recovery period.  Dynamic stretches are done during movement. Research suggests they are much more effective than static stretches (e.g., touching your toes for 30 seconds) in reducing the risk of injury. Some ideas:   Straight-leg march (hamstrings and gluteus muscles): Kick one leg straight out in front with the toes flexed upwards, and meanwhile reach the opposite arm to the upturned toes. Lower the leg and do the opposite leg and arm. Repeat 6-7 times. Scorpion (lower back, hip flexors and gluteus muscles): Lying on the stomach with arms outstretched and feet flexed so only toes are touching ground, kick right foot upward toward left arm, and then left foot toward right arm. Work slowly, repeat up to 12 times. Handwalks (shoulders, core muscles, hamstrings): Stand straight with legs together and then bend over, putting the palms of hands flat on the ground. "Walk" hands out in front until back is almost extended. Keeping legs straight, walk your feet towards hands. Repeat 5 or 6 times., Drills are focused and repetitive movements and plays that players need to be comfortable executing quickly, without thinking. There are three types of drill:   Skill- and movement-specific: This most common type of drill employs repetition to improve skills like blocking and setting. Use these drills to build good habits and correct bad ones. Tactical, systematic and strategic: These drills practice combinations of playing skills and should be incorporated after your players have developed their basic skills. These types of drills are also the time to teach the team how to communicate on the court. Conditioning: These drills build strength and stamina. Note that the energy required for conditioning drills may detract from the execution technique. For that reason, keep conditioning-oriented drills separate from skill-specific drills during in-season practice.Keep drills focused and fun. Make your practice plan based on skills you want to improve and/or the problems you want to solve. For each drill, set a goal and focus, and communicate these to the players. Knowing what to concentrate on helps them get the most out of the drill.Find what works for you. You don't need to constantly incorporate new drills; instead, focus on finding a handful of drills that you and your team enjoy, and use these in rotation, adding variation where necessary., Divide your players up and have them play against one another. This will give new players a feel of the rhythm to a volleyball game and will allow seasoned players to practice where they need it.  This will be essential when your volleyball team begins competing against other teams. A good coach will be tactical and able to strategize based on the players' strengths and weaknesses.  A large part of this decision involves your qualifications: coaching professionally requires a high level of experience and expertise, while recreational coaching is a less competitive field.  The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) oversees volleyball programs at all division levels in colleges and universities.   You will need to have years of volleyball playing and coaching experience in order to apply for a job with a college program. The school's athletic director is often responsible for hiring coaches.  Many high school teams have men and women's volleyball teams. Whether these positions are paid or volunteer will depend on the school and the budget.  Local park and recreation departments and community associations use professional and volunteer coaches for youth programs.   Check out nationally popular programs such as I-9 Sports, Diversity Youth Sports and We Play Sports. Express interest to youth sports leagues that are specific to volleyball, such as the United States Youth Volleyball League or the Youth Volleyball Association. The national leagues can put you in touch with your local chapters.  If you are better at coaching than at playing, you can coach an adult single sex or co-ed team. Check with your local community college, recreational center or YMCA for leagues and teams.	Make sure everyone on your team understands the game. Be communicative. Coach Socratically. Coach democratically. When talking to players, use "I" and "we" rather than "you," which puts them on the defensive. Provide a safe practice environment. Plan your training sessions in advance. Start each practice with a light jog for 5-10 minutes. Incorporate dynamic stretches. Teach your players drills. Play practice games. Develop starting lineups and substitution plans. Decide whether you hope to coach professionally (for payment) or recreationally (volunteer). Coach volleyball professionally with a college or university team. Coach at the high school level. Look for opportunities to coach youth leagues. Join an adult recreational league.
; , This is optional. Removing the existing fabric can be time-consuming, using a screwdriver and pliers to pull up each staple. Unless there is an odor or padding has escaped the cushion, it is not recommended that you remove the base layer of fabric on your seat. Recovering a bare seat pad is trickier and may require additional steps. If the batting or foam cushion is decaying, for example, you may need to replace it.  If the seat is rounded or curved, measure the longest length and the widest width. Add three times the depth to the length and the width, and that is the size of fabric you will need for a single seat. For example, if the seat is 10" x 12" x 2" (25cm x 30.5cm x 5cm) then you will need a piece of fabric that is 16" x 18" (40.5cm x 46cm).  Look for upholstery fabric that will hold up to daily use. You can also use fabric from an old jacket, skirt, or tablecloth, as long as it's durable. If you use the chairs only occasionally, or if you like to recover to meet different needs year to year, a lighter, stretchy fabric can make your job easier.  Place the seat on it, with the side you sit on against the wrong side of the fabric. Align the seat with the pattern on the fabric if necessary, especially if there are stripes.  Usually, between two to three times the thickness of the seat will do. Save any leftover fabric for other projects (see Tips below).  Make sure the fabric is smooth and tight, without bunches between your staples. See the Tips below for an alternative stapling technique.  Pull firmly against the first row of staples to be sure you've gotten rid of any wrinkles or bunches. Again, start stapling at the center and spread outwards. When you encounter curves, fold the fabric, making sure all the bunching occurs under the seat and is not visible from the top. Secure the folds with staples. If you make a mistake, pull out the staples and start over. ,   Point the corner towards the center of the seat (along the diagonal). Fold one side down so that the folded edge runs along the diagonal. Fold the other side down in the same manner so that you now have a pleat along the diagonal. Staple.  Hammer down any staples that aren't flush.  Set up some milk crates or other support structure outside and spray the seats according to package directions. Let them dry overnight in a protected but well-ventilated area. If you can put them in a porch or garage this will protect you from the vapors while also protecting your shiny new seats from dangerously well-fed birds. ,	Unscrew the seat from the bottom of the chair. Remove the existing upholstery. Measure the width, length, and depth of the seat. Purchase the fabric. Place the fabric wrong-side up on a flat surface. Trim the fabric so that there is enough all the way around to fold over the edge. Fold a flap of fabric along the straightest side and staple from the center working toward the corners. Repeat with the opposite side of the seat. Continue along the sides, still tugging firmly to make sure the fabric is tight over the top of the seat.  , Pleat the corners. Trim any excess cloth. Stain protect the seats. Return seat to the chair and screw the base back in.  , Finished.
Watch for people who might instigate office feuds or spread gossip. Observing without interfering will give you the opportunity to see how office politics play out in your department. You will also notice who the problem employees might be.; , As a supervisor or a manager, you are not expected to befriend your employees. Do not get drawn into any gossip or petty arguments.   Keep your tone and topics professional and work-related when you deal with your employees.  Your team needs to know that gossip, rumors, backstabbing and undermining each other's work will not be tolerated.  Calmly explain that you expect each employee to do the job he or she was hired for and to stay on task.   Remind your employees that the way they interact with other members of the team will be noted in performance reviews.  Set a good example by treating everyone in a professional and respectful manner.  When back office politics comes to a head, assess the situation and make a judgment based on the information you have and the behavior you have witnessed.	Observe your team members and how they relate to one another. Maintain strict boundaries. Assert your authority when necessary. Hold private conversations with the people who are involved. Encourage respect among the members of your team. Do what is right.
The wrong type or size can be a waste of money. The types available are varied in the materials they are made of and their size.   High impact plastic tool boxes come in a variety of sizes and setups. The most common found - and bought - are 18 x 8 x 9 inches (40.6 x 20 x 20 cm) with a plastic tote tray that sits inside. You can buy toolboxes in many sizes up to multiple-level and some are attached together with hinges with wheels for ease of moving about. Toolboxes made from sheet metal are often made in first-year shop classes and highly valued by their makers. You can find metal toolboxes that start in the same size range as plastic toolboxes. These go up to tool cabinets with multiple-sized drawers mounted on casters. Another type is not really a toolbox, but rather a tool bag. This heavy-duty cloth bag has its limits, but is popular for its light weight, multiple pockets and quick access to tools. This type makes a good toolkit to carry in the trunk of a car or behind the seat of a pickup.; ,   Assemble all of your tools, and then lay them out in the way you want to group them. As an example, put your SAE and metric sockets and wrenches in 2 different groups with special-purpose tools like flare nut wrenches, for high pressure lines, in another. Some tools need to be stored separately for special purposes, such as woodworking or mechanical tools. A carpenter's toolbox, for example, is designed to carry the saws, squares and chisels that a carpenter or woodworker might use on a job site.  Now, decide if there are any you transport frequently while others you use only occasionally. Divide these tools into separate groups.	Buy the right toolbox for your needs. Decide on the type and size of toolbox you need by considering the tools you will store in them as well as how you will use those tools. Stand back and look at the assembled tools.
You may have to go to the courthouse to view the calendar, or it may be available online.   If you want a hearing for a motion, be aware that many courts only hear civil motions on specific days of the week. You'll have to pick a "motion day" that works for you. Arrive at 9 a.m. on that day and be prepared to stay all day.Courts typically close their motion day dockets a week or two before., Once you've chosen the date you want, call the clerk and have your motion scheduled on that date.  You must draft a notice of hearing along with your motion that includes the date you've scheduled the hearing.

It can also help with your popularity. If you find you have a crush on a class-mate, then just take a deep breath. For guys, just treat her nicely and never tease her!

You can obtain a watering can from Isabelle, the mayor’s secretary, by repeatedly asking her for “advice living here” and then completing the tasks she gives you. Asking Isabelle questions will be covered in the following steps.   Try to do this early on in the game so that you keep maintain your town and keep your citizens happy.  Isabelle can be found in the town hall, which will be in a determined place depending on your map. The map of your city is displayed on the bottom screen of the DS. Look for the purple building icon on your map, which represents the town hall.  In order to talk to Isabelle, you must approach the front counter that she is standing behind. There is a green mat that you can step on; once you’re there, press “a” to initiate the conversation.   Isabelle will then ask if there is anything she can help you with today. Respond by choosing “advice for living here”.  Isabelle will give you advice in the form of tasks. For the first task, she will give you stationary (a consumable item that goes to your inventory) and suggest that you send someone a letter. Go ahead and use the stationary to send a letter to complete the task. It does not matter what you write or who you send it to.  If you need to know more about sending letters, Isabelle will explain—all you have to do is ask her. Otherwise you can talk to her again and ask for new advice. This time, she’ll talk about seashells on the beach and subtly request that you bring her one. To do this, head to the beach and pick up a seashell. To pick up the seashell, stand next to one and press “b”.   Return to Isabelle with the seashell in your inventory; she’ll be delighted and hand you a basket of non-native fruits, which you can then plant. If you’re carrying a shovel, she will explain how to plant trees. To plant any fruit, equip your character with the shovel and then find a spot of ground that you like. When you find a spot, press “a” to dig a hole with your shovel. Then, go into your inventory and find the fruit you want. Tap on the fruit and click the option “bury”. This will cause a sapling to appear and in a few days it will be a full tree that produces three of that fruit every day.  If you do not have a shovel to plant the fruits discussed in the previous step, you can ask Isabelle for advice again and she will ask whether you’re interested in fishing or bug catching. The answer you give will determine your next task.   If you already have one tool and not the other (a fishing rod, but not a net, for example) you may want to pick the task you’re prepared for. However, if you don’t have either or want the other one, you can talk to Isabelle again. Tell her you’re missing the fishing rod or bug net and she will sell you one for 500 bells, which is the standard price.  If you picked fishing, Isabelle will ask you to catch three different kinds of fish. She will explain how to fish if you don’t know. If you picked bug catching, she will ask you to catch three different kinds of insects. Again, if you don’t know how, she will give you a brief explanation.   Once you’ve caught either three types of fish or bugs, you will have finished all of Isabelle’s tasks. She will reward you with the watering can and consider you suitably prepared to go forth. Once you have the watering can, read Method 3 to find out how to water your plants.	Understand that you will have to talk to your secretary to get a watering can. Find Isabelle. Ask Isabelle for advice. Complete the tasks that Isabelle gives you. Ask Isabelle for new advice if you know how to write a letter. Ask for advice again if you are not carrying a shovel with you. Catch fish or bugs.
If you want to sleep on the floor as a lifestyle choice, then you might want to try it out a few times first. It takes time for your body to adjust to the new position and the absence of a soft mattress. You may be uncomfortable for the first few days, but after that you should get used to it. You may even wake up feeling refreshed once you’re in the routine of sleeping on the floor.In some cases, sleeping on the floor might be a necessity, such as if you do not have a bed.  In the beginning especially, you may want some type of cushion to help you transition from the bed to the floor. A yoga mat is great for this because it is already designed for you to lay down on at length and provides a slight cushion between you and the floor.You can also provide some cushioning for yourself by placing a few doubled up blankets on the floor.  While you might have another preferred sleeping position when in bed, the best position for the floor is on your back. Otherwise, you won’t get the benefit of the back support the floor provides. Sleeping on your side while on the floor may cause back pain.	Try sleeping on the floor a few days before making up your mind about it. Use a yoga mat or other thing cushion between you and floor. Sleep on your back.
