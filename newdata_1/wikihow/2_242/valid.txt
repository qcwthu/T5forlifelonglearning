Since this recipe contains syrup find an area that is not carpeted, near anything valuable or easily stained.; , The mixture will produce a fizzing noise. Continue mixing until that noise stops. (You may want to mix these ingredients over the sink as the mixture may bubble up.)         , Stir well until the starch has dissolved.  Fill each compartment only halfway as you will eventually allow the mixture to dry before adding water to create the watercolor.  If you're working with a set of primary colors, you may need to mix a few colors together to create a wider palette. When combining colors, only use a few drops at first and continue adding until you reach the color you desire.  Be aware that drying times will vary dependent on the ambient temperature. In some instances, this step could take up to two days to complete. However, if you find a good location to allow the paint to set and it's not too humid, this process could take as little as overnight.  Use these paints in just the same way you would approach using watercolor paints.          Dip your brush in the clean water before rubbing it over the chosen paint color. Then apply to the paper. Allow to dry as usual.	Identify a suitable area for painting. Combine the baking soda and vinegar together first. Add the corn syrup and corn starch to the baking soda and vinegar mixture. Pour into the container/muffin tin or ice cube tray. Add food coloring to each paint-filled compartment. Place the filled paint container in a cool, dry spot to dry. Fill a separate cup with clean water.
There are a number of good freebie sites out there that exist to spread the word about free stuff. Sometimes, the site may have you watch an advertisement, enter your email, or fill out a survey before you can place an order for the free sample, or download a coupon for a free sample.   Try FreeSamples.org, My Free Product Samples, GoFreebies, ScamFreeSamples, or Sample Buddy. Most of these sites collect links from other companies and organizations.

You need the right equipment to melt gold. A crucible is a container that is specifically designed to hold gold as it melts because it can withstand the extreme heat.   A crucible is usually made of graphite carbon or clay. Gold’s melting point is at about 1,943 degrees Fahrenheit, which means you will need temperatures that hot to melt it. Thus, it's very important that you don't just choose any container.In addition to a crucible, you will need a pair of tongs to move the crucible and hold it. These need to be made out of heat-resistant material. If you don't have a crucible, a homemade method uses a potato to melt gold instead of a crucible. To use this method, cut a hole into the potato, and place the gold in it.; , Flux is a substance that is mixed with the gold before melting it. It is often a mixture of borax and sodium carbonate.You need more flux if the gold is impure. You can use many different formulas for flux mixtures. One method involves mixing borax and sodium carbonate. Add two pinches per ounce of clean jewelry scrap and more for dirty scrap. You can use regular baking soda or bicarbonate purchased from the store. When you heat it, it forms sodium carbonate.Flux helps hold together the fine gold particles, and it also helps remove impure materials from the gold as it heats. When using the potato method, add a pinch of borax into the hole in the potato before melting the gold., It can be dangerous to melt gold because of the extreme heat needed to do it.   Consult a professional if you have no training in melting gold at all. You also should find a place in your house to melt gold that is safe, such as in your garage or a spare room. You will need a work bench to put your materials on.Make sure that you wear safety goggles and a face shield to protect your face. You should put heat-resistant gloves on your hands and wear a heavy apron too. Never, ever melt down gold near something that is flammable. It can be very dangerous, and you don’t want to cause a fire.	Buy a crucible container to hold the gold as it melts. Use flux to remove impurities from the gold. Be very careful of safety at all times.
Wear acid-proof gloves, goggles, and an NIOSH-approved respirator equipped with the appropriate acid-grade filter when working with acid. You can find this safety equipment at the hardware store or online. Lay plastic sheets down at the base of the wall to act as drop cloths for the acid.Keep a box of baking soda around to pour it on yourself if acid splashes onto your skin. Caustic chemicals from the muriatic acid could cause chemical burns.  Read the information and warnings provided with the product that you've purchased. Follow the dilution amounts and process on the back of the packaging. Typically, you'll want to create a solution that is one part muriatic acid to nine parts water.   Never mix muriatic acid with other chemicals. Do not use acid for lightly colored or cream-colored bricks. The acid can discolor them and weaken their joints., Fill an acid-resistant bucket up with water first, then add the muriatic acid. This will prevent splashback which could potentially spray acid onto you., Before you apply the acid to the wall, it's important that it's fully saturated with water. Applying the muriatic acid directly on a dry brick may damage your wall., Purchase an acid resistant brush online so that the bristles don't disintegrate while you apply it to the brick. Dip the brush into the acid solution that you created and apply it in a layer over a small portion of the brick that you want to clean. Apply the acid in a small area to make sure that there isn't an adverse reaction with the brick in your wall., Allow the acid to soak into the mortar on the bricks and break it down. If the acid is working, it will start to bubble and fizz when it comes into contact with the mortar. Do not let the acid fully dry on the brick or it could damage them.If you notice that there is discoloration on the brick, stop using the acid.  Use a medium bristle brush and scrub the face of the brick vigorously. Avoid scrubbing in the joints of the brick or you may weaken the mortar that holds the brick in place. Scrape the sludge that's created from the mortar and acid onto your drop cloth. Continue to scrub until all of the dried on mortar is removed., As you work, make sure that none of the acid dries to the brick. Dried acid can weaken the brick and discolor it. Always keep a garden hose or a bucket filled with water close by and rinse away the acid after you're done scrubbing away the mortar.	Wear the proper safety equipment. Read the instructions on the back of the acid. Dilute the muriatic acid. Wet down the brick with water. Apply the acid with an acid-resistant brush. Let the acid sit for five minutes. Scrub the mortar away with a brush. Rinse the acid off with several gallons of water.
Before trying to clean the spill, you'll need to soak up as much grease as possible. Do this by blotting the spill with disposable rags or paper towels.          If you're on a porous surface, avoid pushing down too much. You don't want the surface to absorb the grease before you soak it up. Make sure to have a trash bag nearby so you can dispose of the rags or paper towels without causing a bigger mess., After you’ve collected as much excess grease as you can, you’ll need to sprinkle absorbent powder on the grease. The powder will soak up the grease, thus making it easier for you to clean the spot. Pick your powder appropriately (based on fabric or material) and use as much as you need. Some powders you can use include:          Corn starch Oatmeal Kitty litter Powdered detergent Peat moss, After your absorbent powder has soaked up any remaining grease, it’ll be time to brush or sweep it up. While this won’t be the quickest thing to do, it’s the best way to clean your grease up.          If you’re working with a spill on some sort of fabric, you’ll likely want to use a brush. If your grease spill is on your kitchen floor, drive way, or another hard surface, use a broom. If you want, use a shop vacuum to suck up the greasy-powder mixture. Sweep or brush up all the powder into a dust collector.	Soak up excess grease. Sprinkle absorbent powder on the grease. Brush up the grease and powder.
; , Scrub lightly and do not make the carpet wet, just damp.  As it is drying, this mixture will be loosening the grime deep within the carpet.  Sift the baking soda (bicarbonate of soda), cornstarch, and essential oil into a container. Keep sifting until any clumping is removed. , The vacuum cleaner will pick up the mixtures, which will also have soaked up the grime and oils out of the carpet.	Mix together the vinegar and water in a container. Use this mixture to scrub over the carpet. Let this set on the carpet until dry. Create the second mixture. Sprinkle the mixture over the carpet and leave on it for an hour.  , Vacuum.
The video is stored on the DVR's Hard Drive. H.264 Compression DVR is the new compression industry standard. The H.264 Compression DVR stores 3x longer video than the older MPEG and MPEG4 Compression DVR's. I is old technology with less video storage. H.264 DVR's will enable higher video quality both live and over the internet.; ,, Remote viewing should be free and work with a dynamic IP address, as that is what you will use to access your cameras. To remote view you enter in a web address (ip address), type in your user name and password, and you can view your cameras. Dynamic IP addresses are free, so there should be no extra monthly fee - just your high speed internet. Ask whether multiple people can view the cameras remotely at the same time.  If you choose, you can set up your DVRs to record on motion, to prolong the storage of the video on the hard drive. If preferred, you can record 24/7 all the time. You can record on schedule. All video channels have an address that you assign Such as (Outside Front Yard) and is time and date stamped and video is digitally watermarked to prevent video and/or evidence tampering.  Also, it is important to have a good amount of video storage (ex. 250 gigabyte Hard Drive, 500 gigabyte Hard Drive, 1 Terabyte Hard Drive. Generally speaking, the longer video storage, the better. With H.264 compression digital video recorders, you will notice large hard drives are included for plenty of storage time. H.264 is the "state of the art" in the Surveillance Industry. And don't worry, after the hard drive is filled with video, the DVR simply loops around and starts from the beginning.  When it comes to burning video make sure the DVR has at least one USB if you wish to burn video to a USB flash drive. Ensure that the DVRs are compatible with your PC's in the home or office. What this means to you is that you can view your camera system conveniently, with any of your computers on the network as it is compatible with Windows.	Be aware that the DVR (Digital Video Recorder) is what records the video cameras. Look for DVRs that have remote internet viewing from any high speed internet connection in the world as well as mobile phones such as the iPhone, or any phone with the 3G Network.  , Check that they work with Symbian and the WinCE networks as well. Look for digital video recorders that have sophisticated motion detection with object masking, making it easy for you to review the most important events on each camera. When purchasing a DVR, be sure you pick one with H.264 compression. Consider the burning capacity. Make sure your DVR is in a safe place or locked area as you do not want the DVR to be stolen.
Heat high enough to shrink polyester is also high enough to cause colors to fade. Turning your garment inside out before washing will help protect it..Avoid washing multiple garments together. Turning the garment inside-out will reduce fading but won’t prevent the colors from bleeding.; , Set the washing machine to the hottest water setting and the longest wash cycle. Make sure to use both a hot wash and a hot rinse, since hot water is much more effective for shrinking polyester than cold water.You don’t need to add detergent to the washing machine, but it won’t interfere with the shrinking process. Only add detergent if you’re looking to wash the garment as you shrink it., Dry the polyester garment using the hottest heat setting and the longest drying cycle. The extreme heat is what will do the most work in shrinking the garment.  Pull it out of the dryer and let it cool to room temperature. If additional shrinkage is necessary, repeat the washing and drying steps to further reduce the size.Note that the more often you wash and dry the garment, the more color fading you may notice. Only attempt this a few more times. If you still cannot achieve significant shrinkage, consider using an iron.	Turn the garment inside-out. Wash the garment in extremely hot water. Transfer the garment to the dryer immediately. Check the garment for shrinkage.
This will be your squirrel’s head and body.    To do this, draw two circles. One should be bigger (the leg joint) than the other one. The circles and the head should form a slanted row of figures.    Add two curved figure for the ears. Depending on the breed, you can also modify the ears a little. Some squirrels have longer and pointier ears. for the legs, add some trapezoids at each circle. There should be one trapezoid at the base of the hind leg circle, another connected to the arm/foreleg circle and a small trapezoid for the body. The smallest trapezoid is for the leg hiding behind the squirrel’s body.    Draw a big flipped “S” from the body. This would be the squirrel’s tail. At the end of each trapezoid, add small triangles for the paws. For the face, add two small circles: one for the eyes and another for the nose.    Put in mind the overlapping lines and parts that should be hidden. The line art might not look perfect and crisp but it should look neat when the pencil is erased.    You can add details like the ears, eyes, mouth, nose and fur. You can also add extra lines to emphasize the paw and the fur.    Squirrel can go in different shades from orange to red or even brown or gray, all depending on the breed.	Draw a big circle and a tear shaped figure on the side. Add arm and leg joints. Add ears and legs. Add tail, paws and face. Using a pen, draw on top of your sketch. Erase the pencil sketch and add details. Color your squirrel.
If you want a colored background on the canvas, paint this first.  The stencil design will need to fit on the canvas. If you're overlaying stencils, plan this out in advance.  If your stencil is made from a thinner material (like printer paper), be sure to cut the edges precisely. Use thin slivers of tape under any edges that may fold over or stick up during the paint application, to avoid smearing or paint bleeding over the edges.  Always add less rather than more; top up as needed., Dip into the acrylic paint but here is the trick––only dip just the edge of the brush and do not apply too much paint. Thin layers are the most effective for acrylic paint stenciling. Rub off any excess paint if needed, using paper towel or an old rag.  A stencil brush has a wide, flat surface. It's ideal for picking up a thin layer of paint. A soft stencil brush with natural bristles is the best choice; do not use synthetic ones or any other sort of paintbrush. Use a large stencil brush for large canvas areas, a small one for daintier and smaller areas.  Take a lot of care at the edges; do not push the brush under the stencil., Remove the brush., Apply other colors or areas only after the first one has dried, to avoid accidental smudging from your hand movements. Fortunately, acrylics dry quickly., Carefully pull away. The stenciled print will now be completed.	Set up the canvas you want to print on. Choose a stencil. Squeeze a little bit of paint onto a palette or a foam plate. Use a stencil brush. Dab the brush over the canvas, inside the stencil. Continue until you've covered the stenciling area on the canvas. Allow to dry completely. Remove the stencils when done.
Use a microfiber cloth. Microfiber is soft enough to keep the surface from getting scratched. It's also very good at preventing dirty and grimy buildup. A few simple strokes will remove dust and water stains., Opt for a mild detergent to keep the shiny surface intact. Apply the detergent to a damp cloth. Wipe the surface to remove stains made from water, toothpaste, soap scum, etc., If you see calcium deposits (also known as limescale) on your faucets, you have hard water. To tackle this problem, mix equal parts water and white vinegar. Dip a cloth in the solution. Lay the cloth on the stains or deposits and let it sit there for five minutes. Wipe the area when the five minutes are up., Move in a gentle circular direction to shine the surface. Continue until the nickel is completely dry. Do this after you have finished cleaning. If you have hard water, dry the surface any time it gets wet., Apply a small amount of nickel polish to a clean cloth. Aim for a dollop, about the diameter of a nickel or ten-pence coin. Buff the surface in gentle circular strokes. This will give the nickel an added shine and reduce the risk of staining in the near future. Do this about once per week.	Wipe the nickel down daily. Use dish soap for routine cleanings. Remove hard water stains with a vinegar solution. Dry the surface with a microfiber cloth. Polish the nickel.

The most effective time to reseed a weedy lawn is early fall when warm days and cool nights provide a good environment for grass seed germination.   If you cannot reseed your lawn in the fall, you can also reseed it in the spring. Summer and winter months are not ideal for reseeding.; , You can have your soil tested by a local Extension Office or garden center about one month before reseeding. Ask them to determine the pH of the soil and nutrient levels. This will reveal any problems with the soil that may have contributed to the weed problem.If you do not want to go to a garden center, you can also determine the pH yourself. To learn how to do this, read ].  Good soil preparation is an important step in the reseeding process. Remove the weeds first using a post-emergent weed killer. In general, reseeding can be done about six weeks after applying a weed killer, but this varies, depending on which herbicide is used.   Select an herbicide that will kill the weeds growing in the lawn and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations carefully.  Mow the remaining grass to a height of ¾ inch, using a catcher on the mower to catch the grass clippings.Cutting the grass this short will help for the seeds to take root and grow.  A dethatching machine or power rake can be rented from an equipment rental company, which is the easier way to go, or it can be done by hand with a dethatching rake.  If the pH of your lawn was off and led to weed growth, you will likely have to add some soil amendments to your lawn to keep the weeds from coming back.   Soil amendments will make your lawn either more acidic or more alkaline, depending on where you live and what weeds you are dealing with.  Use a broadcast spreader to apply starter fertilizer over the lawn. This fertilizer will help your new seeds to grow strong and healthy. You should spread the fertilizer at the rate of 20 pounds per 1,000 square feet.The fertilizer should have one of the following ratios:   10-5-5. 10-6-4. 16-8-8.	Know when to reseed your lawn. Test the pH of your soil before you reseed the lawn. Get rid of the weeds on your lawn. Mow the remaining grass so that it is roughly three-fourths of an inch tall. Dethatch your lawn. Add soil amendments to your lawn if necessary. Lay fertilizer down.

Some fabrics, such as silk and chiffon, will not hold up well to harsh scrubbing and hot temperatures. Instead, cover the stain with baby powder, cornstarch, or talcum powder. Leave the garment in a dry, warm place for a few hours (overnight if necessary), then brush the powder away. Keep repeating this step until the powder no longer clumps up and the stain is gone., As their name suggests, dry-clean-only fabrics should not get wet. This means that you cannot use things like dish soap and water to remove the stain. Instead, sprinkle some baby powder, cornstarch, or talcum powder over the stain. Let it sit for a few moments, then brush it off. This may be enough to get the stain out. If the stain is still there, take the garment to the dry cleaner., Sprinkle some cornstarch over the stain and let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes. Pour some dish soap over the cornstarch and rub it in. Do not rinse the dish soap or cornstarch off. Instead, toss the garment into the washing machine, and was as usual according to the tag.You can also try using cornmeal or cornstarch on its own, without the dish soap. The powder will help absorb the oil., Simply cover the stain with some hair spray. Wash and dry the garment according to the care instructions on the tag. Hairspray contains alcohol, which will help loosen and dissolve the oil.  Soak the stain with some hydrogen peroxide, then sprinkle a thick layer baking soda over it. Cover the baking soda with some dish soap, and sprinkle on a light layer of more baking soda. Scrub the entire area with a toothbrush, then let it sit for 30 to 60 minutes. Do not rinse the treatment out. Instead, wash the garment as you normally would in the washing machine. Be sure to follow the instructions on the tag.Hydrogen peroxide should not stain dark fabrics, but it may. If you are worried about this, it might be a good idea to test it out on an inconspicuous area, such as a hem or cuff.  Then, squirt some aloe vera, dish soap, or shampoo onto the stain. Use an old toothbrush or a manicure brush to rub the stain into the fabric. Let the stain sit for a few minutes.Don't rinse the aloe vera, dish soap, or shampoo off. Instead, toss the garment into the washer, and wash according to the instructions on the tag., Start by blotting up the excess oil, then cover the stain with the stain remover. Wait 30 minutes, then wash the garment according to the tag.	Be gentle with delicate fabrics. Know how to handle dry-clean-only fabrics. Treat the stain with cornstarch and dish soap. Use some hairspray to dissolve the stain. Try using hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and dish soap. Use some aloe vera, dish soap, or shampoo as a pre-wash stain remover.Blot any excess oil using a clean cloth or a paper towel. Try using a store-bought pre-wash stain remover.
Some people use the term 'double-brewed' tea to refer to concentrated tea that has been steeped twice, but the phrase can also be used to mean tea that has been brewed with reused teabags. Simply leave the teabags in the water for 2-3 minutes longer than usual to account for the loss of effectiveness.   You should not reuse teabags in this manner more than once or twice. If you are not planning on reusing them right away, put them in the refrigerator in enough water to keep them completely wet. Storing used teabags at room temperature or in dry conditions can cause mold growth and invite unwanted bacteria.; , Old teabags can be reused quite easily during cooking. Experimenting with old teabags in the kitchen may impart color and flavor to foods. For instance, adding chamomile or jasmine tea to rice can infuse it with a delicate fragrance, and Chai or cinnamon tea can boost the flavors in a simple bowl of oatmeal.   Place old teabags in the water you are using to boil pasta or rice for added flavor. Add old teabags to the water you have just used to boil eggs for added flavor and color. Add tea to your meat smoker for tea-infused smoked meats., Mixing teabags into soil has a great number of beneficial effects, including increasing nitrogen and acidity levels, attracting good bacteria, lowering the pH level of the soil, and giving earthworms something good to eat. You can also add old teabags to your compost pile, as long as they are not made of plastic and you remove any metal staples first., Because teabags are absorbent and aromatic, they can be used to mitigate offensive smells. Peppermint and cinnamon flavored teas in particular have a very strong and pleasant aromas.   Place used teabags in the trashcan and refrigerator to dispel bad odors. Scrub your hands with used teabags to remove unpleasant scents like those of garlic or fish. Turn old teabags into air fresheners by waiting until they are completely dry and adding a couple of drops of essential oil, like lavender or peppermint.	Make double-brewed tea. Add flavor to food. Care for your garden. Disguise bad odors.
Heat up a mixture of vinegar and water for few minutes and wipe it with a towel for cleaning.  Vinegar can effectively clean kitchen counter tops, stove tops, and the tops of refrigerators and other appliances. Spray undiluted vinegar over the surface of appliances and counters in your kitchen, then wipe away using paper towels or a soft, clean rag.  Pour half a cup of white vinegar into the food processor bowl or blender jug. Add a quarter teaspoon of your usual dish washing detergent. Pour in warm water to near the top of the food processor bowl or blender jug. Place the processor or blender lid on and set aside. Leave for an hour or two. During this time, the vinegar will absorb the food odor from the plastic or glass. Tip the water and vinegar solution out. Wash the processor or blender as usual. Give it the sniff test; if it's odorless, you're good to go. If not, repeat but allow the soaking to occur for 8 to 12 hours, then rinse. That will usually be sufficient to remove the odor.  Mix together 1 part salt with 4 parts vinegar, then moisten a rag with the solution. Use the rag to rub away built-up soap scum from bathroom and kitchen faucets.  Place 2 cups of vinegar in the bottom of your dishwasher and run it on low, or the energy-saving setting. Halfway through, stop the dishwasher and let the vinegar soak on the bottom for 15 or 20 minutes. After the time is up, turn it back on to finish. If it's really bad, you can let it soak overnight. If smell is an issue, sprinkle 1/2 - 1 cup of baking soda around the bottom and run the washer as normal.  Dilute it with water in a 1:1 ratio. Pour into the kettle and leave it in the kettle for 1 hour, without boiling. Tip it out after the soaking time. Rinse. Fully rinse the kettle with fresh water at least 5 times before using again.	Clean your microwave using vinegar. Use vinegar as an all-purpose surface cleaner in the kitchen. Use vinegar to clean odors out of food processors and blenders. Remove soap scum from kitchen faucets. Periodically run the dishwasher with vinegar. Use vinegar to descale a kettle.
This method only works for wood-burning fireplaces since it requires the leftover ash from the fuel source, which gas fireplaces do not leave behind. Open the glass doors to access the sooty glass.  You can use plain water if you wish, but adding the white vinegar helps break down the sooty carbon residue.Adding the mix to a spray bottle will make it easier to apply, and the mixture makes a good cleaner for other household surfaces as well.  You don’t need to soak the towel or the cloth. Simply dampen it with the solution.  Find a spot of fine ash in the fireplace and dip the cloth in it to get a light layer over the damp portion.Ensure that you only pick up the fine ash and not anything larger on the towel. Anything more abrasive than the fine ash can scratch the glass.  The fine ash makes the perfect slightly abrasive material to scour the carbon residue on the glass. Scrub in small circles, but don’t worry about scrubbing too hard. You will likely have to apply more of the solution and dip the towel back into more ash several times as you go.   The soot and ash will work into a paste as you scrub along each section of glass. This is how you can tell when you’re adding enough of the solution and ash. If any large pieces of residue are stuck to the glass and won’t budge, use a razor blade to break it down to something the paste can manage.Be very careful to contact the residue but not the glass with the razor blade. Otherwise, you risk scratching the glass.  Once you have scrubbed the soot off all portions of the glass, wipe away the ash/solution scouring paste. You can use another paper towel to wipe it away.  With the sooty paste wiped away, you can use the warm and vinegar solution and clean paper towels or a microfiber cloth to finish bringing the glass to a sparkle.	Open the fireplace doors. Mix a solution of equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Spray the solution onto a paper towel or a clean cloth. Dip the cloth in the fireplace ash. Scrub the sooty glass. Wipe away the paste. Use the solution to clean the glass.
Asbestos cannot move through a plastic trash bag. Place all debris into a bag (you may need several). Avoid overfilling the bags. You do not want any tears in the bags., Once a bag is full, you want to seal off the top so that no asbestos can escape. Use duct tape to make sure that the top stays closed and has no openings. If you tear the bag, patch it with duct tape or double bag it., Some asbestos probably got on the outside of the bags. Wipe them down with soap and water to remove the asbestos. This will prevent you from inhaling the asbestos while you transport the bags., Call local landfills until you find one that accepts asbestos. Then you can either drive the asbestos to the landfill, or pay a waste collector to take it for you. Keep in mind that not all landfills accept asbestos.	Place all materials in a trash bag. Seal the bag. Wipe down the bags. Move the waste to a landfill.
Place them on a flat work surface, like a countertop or the bed. Position the panties so that the waistband is pointing away from you. Smooth out any wrinkles with your hands.; , Fold the left side toward the center, then fold the right side over the left. The folds are similar to those you'd use to fold a business letter into thirds. Smooth out the wrinkles.  The bottom edge of the crotch and the top of the waistband should be aligned. Smooth out the wrinkles.  The panties are now folded and ready to stack in your underwear drawer.	Lay the panties face-up. Fold the panties in thirds. Fold the crotch up to the waistband. Flip the panties so the waistband is showing.
Establish what you hope to achieve with the help of a marketing consultant. Some companies simply want to reach more clients, others hire a consultant to plan and execute a detailed marketing strategy.; ,   Talk to your professional network about marketing consultants they have used, or if they know marketing experts who might be looking for work. Word of mouth is powerful in the marketing field.  If you have a marketing director or a team of marketing staff members, ask for their input.   Remind them that they are not being replaced. Staff might feel threatened by the use of consultants, but if they are involved in choosing and working with the consultants from the beginning, the relationship will be far more harmonious and productive.  You can get the names of local marketing consultants by searching for them online.   Use the Internet to explore the online reputations of different consultants as well. Spend some time on their websites and reading testimonials and reviews before you select a few of them to interview.	Determine your goals. Ask for referrals. Include any marketing professionals you have on staff. Conduct an Internet search.

You can either simply set it on a table, counter, any other completely flat surface, or attach it to a tripod using rubber bands or tape. Because of the sensitivity of the shutter, you need the camera to be extremely still as you take photos.  For film, you only need to expose the camera to light for a few seconds, but photographic film can take up to a few minutes.   If using film, the duration of exposure depends on the ISO of the film. The higher the ISO, the shorter the exposure time. For 400 ISO film, you will expose it to light for between 2 and 12 seconds depending on the brightness of the external light. For 100 ISO film, the exposure time can range between 8 and 48 seconds, and for 50 ISO film, the exposure time may range between 16 seconds and 1 minute and 36 seconds.If using photographic paper, the exposure time will most likely range from one minute to several minutes, though there are photo paper products made specifically for longer exposures, even up to several months! You will have to practice to determine the exposure time that works for you, but remember the general rule of thumb for exposure time: the brighter the external light, the shorter the exposure time.  Remember to account for the distance between the pinhole and the viewfinder by aiming a bit lower than you might perceive.  Pull the bottom tape up to allow light to stream through the pinhole. Do so very carefully so as not to shake the rest of the camera.          If your exposure time is several minutes or hours, you can carefully tape the shutter open so that you don't have to hold it open manually. You can also place some sort of weight such as a rock or a shoe on top of the camera if it is windy where you are photographing.  Once you've held the shutter open for the desired exposure time, retape the flap down to prevent any more light from entering through the pinhole. During the time that the shutter was open, an image was created on the film or photographic paper. All that's left to do is develop your photo.	Place the camera on a flat surface. Determine the exposure time. Point the camera at your subject. Open the shutter flap. Close the shutter.
You have the best search engine at your fingertips: the internet. When searching for someone’s history, be sure to put quotation marks around the person’s name. A number of websites allow free searches:   Google.com, Whitepages.com, Friendfeed.com, Facebook.com, LinkedIn.com, Twitter.com, nsopw.gov, Glassdoor.com, and Bing.com. Always be mindful of the fact that the information found by performing a basic internet search may not be verified and could easily be false.  To uncover information about arrests, convictions, and incarcerations (a criminal background check), most information will be in the public record. To find this information, visit court and other government websites to access these documents. Type “criminal records” and then your state in a search engine.   Remember to search documents in all states where your subject has lived. If you do not know where a person has lived, you can search on a website such as Intelius.com, which will often list the states a person has lived in. Don't forget to search county and city websites for records of convictions on the local level. Additionally, some counties do not maintain online databases: in this case, you will need to pull the records from the county courthouse, where there should be hard copies. Some counties charge a small fee for copies of the records, while some offer copies for free.  There are a lot of records you cannot legally access without the permission of the subject—such as a credit report, school records, or military records. If you want to obtain certain information about someone, you may need to ask them to provide you with the information.   If you are considering a new roommate, for instance, you may want to simply ask if they have ever been arrested or in trouble before making your decision. Understand that they do not have to give you access to or copies of their information. However, if they are not forthcoming with information, then you can certainly base your decision on your lack of information. For example, if a potential roommate refuses to state whether he or she has been arrested, then you can choose not to live with that person based on the lack of information.  Many online companies, such as Intelius, US Search, and Net Detective, will search for someone’s address as well as their criminal background records. You can search by typing in the person’s first and last name, as well as current city and state.   Prices vary, but you can expect to pay over $30.These companies may return “false positives.” For example, a bankruptcy filing might appear although the person never filed for bankruptcy protection., Unlike landlords and employers, a private citizen is allowed to hire any legal service to run background checks, including criminal background checks. Nevertheless, you should research any company before hiring them.   You can find investigators on the web by typing “private investigator” and the name of your city. There are a lot of scam artists out there. Read online reviews of any background check company that you may want to use and see if people are satisfied with the results.	Search online. Pull public records. Ask for information directly from the person. Use a commercial web-based search engine. Hire a professional.
Look up recipes online that use the type of food you don’t like. There may be a dish that sounds delicious to you that you would never expect would contain that food. Try a dessert recipe that sneaks in a vegetable, or add an offending food to a casserole or soup so it’s mixed in with other things.   If it’s a vegetable you don’t like, try any number of desserts that use vegetables in their recipe, like a carrot cake, zucchini bread, or avocado milkshake.This may not help you get used to the taste of the food you don’t like if it’s highly disguised by other ingredients, but it will get you accustomed to the idea that it can be used to make something tasty.  Try preparing or eating the food with new seasonings or sauces, without overdoing it to the point of disguising the food. Get ideas for good seasonings to pair with the food from cookbooks or online. Try several different types of ethnic restaurants for a good way to try different preparations and flavors of the same food.  Talk to friends, family, or the host of the dinner you’re at about the food you don’t like and how they like to prepare it. Try these new ways to find one that you like better.  Try taking the recipes you’ve found in cookbooks, online, or from friends and family to prepare dishes with the food you’re learning to like, or just experiment with it on your own! Test out what it tastes like when you prepare it in different ways, like sauteing, steaming, roasting, or even deep-frying. Experiment with whatever seasonings and sauces you have around the house, or try new ones that recipes suggest.  If there are multiple types of the food you don’t like, give them all a try to see which one you like best. Try both fresh and canned versions, and try getting produce from a farmer’s market instead of the grocery store if it is a fruit or veggie that you don’t like.  Learn everything you can about the food you don’t like from the internet or books. Understanding more about the nuances of the food and understanding its differences from other foods will help you to appreciate it more., However you choose to prepare or eat it, have the food you don’t like in happy situations when you’re surrounded by people you enjoy. This will help change your emotional response to the food to a positive one., Even if you haven’t found a way to enjoy the food you don’t like, continue to eat it as much as possible, even if you have to completely disguise it with other things. You can actually psychologically condition yourself to like a food in this way.	Add it to other things. Add seasonings or other flavor. Talk to others about the food. Cook the food yourself. Try different varieties. Become an expert on the food. Eat around people you like. Eat the food as much as possible.
Your love and knowledge have to be combined with business acumen if your bookshop is to succeed. This is even truer in a High Street climate, which is less conducive than ever to the independent trader. The home computer has removed many of the reasons people might once have had to read, while a host of other electronic entertainment media are providing more options when it comes to what to do with leisure time.; , Nevertheless, book sales are continuing to increase at a steady 6% per annum and stood at £2.4 billion in 2003 – a figure that might surprise the casual reader.  Unfortunately, High Street chains like Waterstones and Ottakar’s account for more and more of the market each year. In 1993, those two companies, together with Borders and WH Smith, occupied 1.3m sq ft of Britain’s retail space; that figure had grown to 5.6m sq ft by 2002. Together, they have almost a 50% share of the UK’s book market – a total sales value of £1.1 billion. The abolition of the net book agreement in 1997 was the major catalyst for the rise of the chains. Suddenly, shops could sell stock at below cover price – enabling the bigger enterprises to take advantage of economies of scale and undercut the smaller operator, often through a variety of special offers and deals.  Even when large regional booksellers such as James Thin or Foyle’s are taken into account, independent ventures still account for a substantial chunk of the market – around a quarter of all book sales. This represents a total market of just under £284m – demonstrating that the local bookshop is still a force to be reckoned with, no matter how hard the financial realities might seem. Wholesalers typically give a discount of around 35% to bookshops – but 30%-33% of the cover price is usually swallowed up by rent, rates, utilities, staff costs, shop fitting and advertising, leaving only 2-5% of that figure as actual net profit. So to earn profits of, say, £20,000, a shop would have to sell at least £400,000 worth of stock – that’s over 40,000 paperbacks.	Combine love of books with business savvy. Be aware of the sales figures for books. Be aware of the competitors' share of the market. Have heart in being an independent bookseller.
Accurately budgeting your start-up is crucial to making your business successful. Precisely itemizing your start-up expenses makes it easier to communicate with banks and investors. Also, it helps you to correctly forecast your profitability in the first year of your business, which has tax ramifications. Finally, your start-up expenses and any debt you incur become part of you financial projections for your business plan. Start-up expenses may differ from business to business, but include the following categories.Expenses for structuring your business. If you have to consult a CPA or lawyer, include those expenses. Include fees for registering your business with your state and for obtaining your tax identification number with the IRS. Cost of obtaining licenses and permits and for complying with state and federal safety and environmental regulations. Purchase or lease of your business location. Purchase or lease of equipment. Purchase of start-up inventory. Before you ever make a sale, you will need to purchase materials such as wood, glass, metal and textiles to make your initial pieces of furniture.Advertising and marketing expenses. Wages and benefits for your employees.  Whether you’ve been doing woodworking as a hobby in your home or have worked in a more commercial setting, you probably already own some equipment. However, if you plan to grow your business by offering new products or getting into a new market, you may need to upgrade your equipment. Don’t waste time and money rigging your already-existing equipment to make new pieces.For example, Tom Dolese of Terra Firma Design in Bellingham, WA states that his investment in a horizontal mortiser allowed him to do complicated joinery precisely and efficiently.  Choose from a variety of methods for funding your business. You may have enough in personal savings to invest in your business. Or, you might have friends, family or other business associates who would be willing to invest in your furniture making store. You would either make plans to pay back their loan or offer them a share in your company, depending on your business structure. Finally, you can finance your business with a loan.The Small Business Administration (SBA) partners with banks and lending institutions to offer loans to help business owners. Other funding sources include a personal line of credit from your bank, peer-to-peer lending sites like Prosper, tapping into your retirement account, using credit cards, getting a home equity loan or using a crowdfunding site like Kickstarter or GoFundMe.

"Jeopardy!" is intended as a test of general knowledge. Except for specialized versions of the game, such as "Rock and Roll Jeopardy!" and "Jep!" (a version of "Jeopardy!" for preteens), the categories selected for each round of the game should cover a broad range of knowledge without overlapping with one another.  Even though "Jeopardy!" is a test of general knowledge, the show is creative with its category names and how it pairs categories in its games. Some of the methods are described below:   Theme boards. On a number of occasions, the 6 categories have names that suggest a common theme. For example, the Jeopardy! round of a game that aired in 2004 had a Shakespearean theme, with categories "Richard III" (about the king, not the play), "Much Ado About Nothing" (questions related to nothingness), "Measure for Measure" (covering units of measure), "Hamlets" (related to small towns), "The 'Temp'-ist" (all correct responses included words with the letters "temp"), and "Shakespearean Actors." Paired categories. When an entire board is not devoted to a single theme, categories may be paired creatively, such as a category named "St. Paul" about the apostle, followed by a category "Minnesota" about the state of Minnesota. On occasion, the same or a very similar category name may be used in the Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds to cover different subjects, such as "Notions" used in the Jeopardy! round for a category about ideas and in the Double Jeopardy! round for a category on sewing items. Gimmick categories. In recent years, "Jeopardy!" has developed a few gimmick categories that test players' knowledge beyond simple recall. In "Stupid Answers," the key word of the correct response appears somewhere in the clue. (For example, "While Billy Batson says 'Shazam!' to become Captain Marvel, Freddy Freeman says these words to become Captain Marvel, Jr." "What is 'Captain Marvel'?") In "Rhyme Time," the correct response must include a pair of rhyming words. (For example, "What is a green bean?") In "Before and After," the correct response is a name or phrase composed of 2 parts made into a portmanteau. (For example, "Longtime host of 'American Bandstand' who is secretly Superman." "Who is Dick Clark Kent?") Traditional category names. "Jeopardy!" has established traditional names for some of its categories, such as "Name's The Same" for 2 or more items with the same name, "Unreal Estate" for fictional places, and both "Potpourri" and "Hodgepodge" for general knowledge. Category names that include quotation marks about part of the name indicate that correct responses will include the letters or word enclosed in the quotes. Category name puns. "Jeopardy!" category names frequently are plays on words, such as "See What the CAT Scan Dragged In" or "I'll Be Your Waiter," about people who waited for something. The show has frequently punned its "Potpourri" category name with such categories as "Poe-Pourri" (about Edgar Allan Poe), "Pope-Pourri" (about popes), and "Pan and Pot-Pourri" (about cooking).	Study how the show assigns categories to its games. Be aware of the show's category gimmicks.

Having standard policies for handling I-9s and following those policies consistently lessens the risk of losing required documents.   Your business must keep an I-9 on file for every employee hired after November 6, 1986. If you terminate an employee, you must keep his or her I-9 on file for three years from the date of hire or a year after termination, whichever is longer.Each new hire must complete the top section of his or her I-9 on the date of hire. Section 2 should be completed and the appropriate documents verified within three days of the employee's date of hire.It is not specifically required to photocopy documents provided to verify an employee's work authorization.However, if you decide to photocopy those documents this should be done for every employee consistently.Keep two separate files, one for current employees and one for terminated employees. This makes the process of purging old I-9s more efficient.Your I-9 files should be kept separately from your other personnel files so you don't have to spend time sorting them out when you perform annual self-audits, or if you get an inspection notice from ICE.; , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) publishes an I-9 handbook which explains the forms and how to comply with federal law.You can download the I-9 employer handbook at http://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central. In addition to the handbook provided by USCIS, you should have written documentation of your company's specific policies and procedures, including the names and contact information for administrators in charge of immigration compliance.Check the information in your handbook and update it regularly.    Make sure your administrators have reviewed the USCIS handbook and Form I-9 itself. They should be able to recognize common errors employees make in filling out the forms so your I-9s are correct the first time, rather than waiting for an audit to identify inaccuracies or incomplete forms.If you have a small staff, you can designate a single manager to be in charge of I-9s, even if you have several managers who have the power to hire new employees. The administrator in charge of I-9s should create reminders when you hire employees with temporary work authorizations, so their forms can be updated when those authorizations change or expire., Regularly scheduled training and refresher courses for administrators provide an important defense in the event discrepancies are discovered during an audit.   Ideally, you should schedule training sessions after you complete your annual self-audit, so you can inform appropriate administrators about any errors that were found.Ensure administrators in charge of I-9s also understand the anti-discrimination provisions of federal law. Any policies should be consistent, and you shouldn't require additional or different documentation from an employee simply because he or she has a foreign-sounding name., A third-party service with experience auditing I-9s may find errors someone on your own staff would miss.Using a third-party auditor can go a long way toward establishing that you made a good faith effort to comply with federal immigration law.Some companies provide attorneys for audit defense as well as performing auditing services.Search online or talk to other small business owners to find a service that best suits your business's needs and budget. ICE includes annual self-audits as part of its best practices. In the event an ICE inspection uncovers errors, evidence of regular self-audits provides a defense that you are serious about immigration compliance.If you don't use an outside audit company, you should have an employee not normally involved in the hiring or I-9 process audit your I-9s., You must have an I-9 for all current employees as well as those who have been terminated in the past three years.You may want to create a spreadsheet with your employee roster so you can keep track of each I-9 as you conduct your audit. Make a row for each employee that needs an I-9, and then create columns for a complete and accurate I-9, an I-9 that requires correction, or a missing I-9. This enables you to review your entire staff at a glance.  Pull all the forms you have and compare them to your list of employees to ensure you don't have any missing I-9s.You also must keep up-to-date I-9s for inactive employees – anyone who has been laid off but is eligible for reinstatement, or those currently on a leave of absence.For terminated employees, check to see whether you must retain them. If the employee was hired more than three years ago, or was terminated over a year ago, you can destroy that employee's I-9.Make a note of all I-9s you purge from your records with the employee's name and the date the I-9 was purged. Then shred the I-9., Carefully check each section of every form using the guidelines laid out in the I-9 handbook published by USCIS.The employee must complete Section 1 of his or her I-9, providing name, address, maiden name, and date of birth. The employee then must provide his or her Social Security number and sign or date the form.If a form isn't filled out correctly, you should talk to the employee immediately about correcting the error or deficiency.Review the information on the form about the documents supplied by the employee. If those documents have expired or need to be updated, ask the employee to provide current documentation.Make sure the documents checked have been listed on the form properly and that photocopies of the documents checked are included with the employee's I-9.Make a note on your roster or spreadsheet that re-verification of the employee's documents is required. When you receive and review current documents, update your spreadsheet with the date the documents were re-verified.Although making photocopies of documents is not required, if photocopies are made they must be readable and must be retained along with the I-9 form to which they relate., Rather than simply having the employee fill out a new form, you must follow the specific processes established by USCIS to correct an erroneous I-9.   Some forms may need to be updated – for example, if an employee has married and changed his or her last name. In most cases, you can simply correct the information on the original form. Strike out the inaccurate information and add your correction. Then initial the correction and write the date of the correction.Make a note on your roster of the correction and the date it was made.If the error cannot be easily corrected, such as by simply striking through the incorrect information and writing the correct information above it, you should have the employee complete a new I-9. Attach the old, incorrect I-9 to the new, correct one. Do not destroy or throw away the old I-9, and don't back-date the new one., If a current employee hasn't completed an I-9, require him or her to fill out the top of a form and submit the appropriate documentation.If an employee doesn't have an I-9 and you create one to cover the deficiency, take care not to back-date it. Rather, you should use the date the employee's supporting documents are reviewed.Note the creation of the new I-9 on your employee roster as a corrective action, and include the date the new I-9 was completed.If there is a missing I-9 for an employee who has been terminated, make a note regarding the absence and keep that note with your I-9s for the same length of time as you would need to keep that employee's I-9., The ICE inspection process begins when you are served with an NOI that compels you to submit your I-9 forms for auditing.   Your notice will indicate how the inspection will take place. In some instances, you may have an ICE officer appear at your place of business to conduct the inspection. In others, you simply have to mail your forms to the appropriate ICE field office.You may receive a subpoena or warrant demanding your forms rather than a notice. While you have three days to submit the documents required by an NOI, you must produce documents demanded in a subpoena or warrant immediately., If you're concerned that the I-9s you submit will not pass scrutiny, you should contact an experienced attorney as soon as possible to discuss your options.   Look for an attorney who has experience working with ICE and USCIS, and who understands I-9 legal requirements and procedures., You only have three business days from the date you're served with a NOI to submit your I-9s to the auditor.ICE may request additional supporting documentation, such as a copy of your payroll, list of your current employees, or business documents such as your operating licensees or Articles of Incorporation.After ICE receives your documents, an auditor will analyze them for completeness and accuracy.If you conduct annual self-audits, you may want to consider submitting the results of these audits to ICE along with your I-9s. This includes any notes you made about missing or corrected I-9s, and spreadsheets you created during your self-audit. These reports demonstrate you've made a good faith effort to comply with the law.If you store your I-9s electronically, you must provide the officer with access to your forms along with any software or hardware necessary to view them., Once the audit is completed, you'll receive a notice from ICE explaining what the auditor found and what actions will follow.If the auditor finds no problems with your forms, you will receive a compliance letter stating that you are in compliance with federal immigration law.The auditor may find discrepancies that raise suspicions a particular employee may not be authorized to work. In this cases, you and the employee have the opportunity to present additional documentation proving the employee is authorized to work.If the auditor finds significant verification violations, you may receive a Notice of Intent to Fine. This notice is reserved for paperwork discrepancies in which the auditor has additional evidence or reason to believe the errors were knowing and intentional.Keep in mind that fines may be assessed for inaccurate or incomplete paperwork that doesn't comply with federal immigration law, even if all of your employees are authorized to work in the U.S., If the auditor finds any technical or procedural failures, you typically will have ten days to correct those forms.If the forms aren't corrected within ten days, the errors will be considered substantive violations and you will be sent a Notice of Intent to Fine.For example, you may have an employee who is a U.S. citizen and is authorized to work in the U.S., but the driver's license he provided for identification is now expired. This I-9 should be updated after verifying that the individual has renewed his license by including the new expiration date., If ICE sends you a Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF), you have the option of either negotiating a settlement or requesting a hearing.You have 30 days from receipt of your NIF to request a hearing. Read your NIF to learn the procedural requirements and deadlines for filing your response.Even though you request a hearing, you can continue negotiating a settlement.Keep in mind that fines typically are assessed only for knowing violations.You can defend yourself during an immigration audit by proving that you made an effort in good faith to comply with federal law, even if some mistakes slipped through the cracks.  At your hearing, you will have the opportunity to defend yourself against the auditor's claims.   Documentation of self-audits as well as your written policies and procedures serves as evidence for a good faith defense. You can argue that you made a good faith effort to comply with the law provided self-audits and written policies were created and operational before you received a notice of inspection from ICE.Other factors also can be argued to mitigate the fines assessed against you. The judge will take into account the size of the business, whether you operate seasonally, and the degree of employee turnover.	Establish policies for the creation and retention of I-9s. Provide a written handbook. Designate specific administrators to complete I-9s.Only allowing certain administrators to complete I-9s who have been fully trained can help you control the process and avoid errors. Hold training sessions yearly. Consider contracting with an outside audit company. Compile a list of all employees. Gather I-9s for all employees. Evaluate each I-9. Correct any errors. Work with employees to complete missing I-9s. Receive your Notice of Inspection (NOI). Consider consulting an attorney. Gather your I-9s. Receive your notification of inspection results. Make any required corrections. Request a hearing. Argue your case.
In the moments after a spill, grab a sponge, paper towels, or a cloth towel that you don’t mind staining. Use this to blot the affected area, working from the outside in. Be careful just to blot the wine, though, since rubbing it can spread the wine over a wider area, as well as deeper into your jeans’ denim., If you’re able to take your jeans off, do so. Grab some fresh towels or something similar. Stuff them into your jeans’ legs and/or waist, underneath the stain. Create a barrier that will stop the wine from seeping through the front of your jeans to its back, or vice versa., Blotting the wine with towels will get rid of excess liquid, but expect some of the wine to have already penetrated the fabric. To deal with that, cover the stain with salt. Use that to draw as much moisture back out of the denim before it has a chance to dry., Open a bottle of white wine. Pour it liberally over the stain. Do so in order to neutralize the red wine’s pigments and possibly lift the stain out entirely., Of course, you may not have white wine on hand, or you may not be too keen to waste any more on top of what you spilled. In that case, pour distilled white vinegar over the stain instead. This will also weaken the red and purple pigments and, like the white wine, could possibly remove the stain on its own., This may be easier to do with a partner, so ask someone for help if you can. First, boil some water. Once it’s ready, hold your jeans over the sink and pull the stained area taut between your two hands. Then have your partner pour the water onto the stain from a height of roughly 12 inches (30 cm) to wash the stain out.Wear rubber gloves while doing this so you don’t scald your hands.  With sparkling water, don’t worry about boiling it as you would with plain water. Also, don’t worry if it’s gone flat and lost its carbonation. Simply pour it over your jeans to lift some or all of the stain out., Pouring the liquids above works best on fresher stains, so if yours has already dried into your denim (or if you spilled a lot of wine over most of your jeans), don’t worry if that didn’t get the job all the way done. Fill a container with enough vinegar, white wine, or club soda to soak the stained area, and let your jeans sit in it until the stain fades.Don’t use boiled water to soak your jeans. Warm water can actually make the stain settle in faster if your jeans are just sitting in it., Mix baking soda with just enough water to turn it into a thick paste. Spread this over the stain. Let it sit until it absorbs all, most, or some of the stain. If it didn’t lift all of the stain out, wash it off and repeat as needed., Before you use this method, be aware that hydrogen peroxide can bleach some fabrics. Be sure to test your mixture on a small, out-of-the way spot on your jeans, like behind the waistband. If it has no adverse effect, simply pour it over the stain. Let it soak in and repeat as needed until the stain fades.Because of the bleaching risk, start with a weak mixture that’s equal parts dish soap and hydrogen peroxide. If no bleaching occurs, feel free to double or triple the amount for a stronger solution., Whether the other methods seem to have totally or only partially removed the stain, follow them up by running your jeans through their regular cycle in the washer. Use cold water in case any wine is still present, since warm water can cause it to settle in further. Air-dry them afterward for the same reason, since a machine dryer will only make any lingering stain tougher to get rid of., If none of these home remedies are able to get rid of the stain entirely, buy a product that’s specifically designed to do so. Follow its directions regarding use. Such products include:Bac Out Stain & Odor Remover Carbona Stain Devils Ecover Stain Stick Spot Shot Wine Away	Soak up the excess liquid. Stuff your jeans with absorbent material. Pour salt over the stain. Neutralize the red wine with white wine. Do the same with white vinegar. Pour boiling water over the stain. Pour club soda over the stain. Soak large or dried stains. Apply a baking soda paste. Do the same with a dish soap and hydrogen peroxide mixture. Machine-wash and air-dry. Use a stain remover.
Photographs can be damaged from exposure to water, sunlight, heat, and moisture in the air. Humidity can cause photographs to stick together, while high temperatures cause photographs to become very brittle. Store your photographs in an environment that has low humidity, is not exposed to direct sunlight, and does not experience extreme temperature fluctuations. Ideally, the temperature should be below 75° Fahrenheit.Do not store photos in a hot attic or in a garage or basement where the images may come into contact with water. Keep your photographs in a temperature-controlled section of the house, like a bedroom or hallway closet.  Archival boxes and albums provide a safe environment for your photographs that keep out humidity, pests, and dust. You can find these items from online vendors and from a stationery or office supply shop. When browsing for archival boxes or albums, be sure that they are intended for photo storage and are free from acid and PVC, or polyvinyl chloride.Place a silica gel packet in the box to help offset any excess moisture.  If an album or storage box is packed to the brim with photos, it may not close properly, leaving the photos susceptible to environmental damage. A box that is not filled enough may also cause damage to the photographs. When there are only a few items in the container, the images may slide around, causing damage to the edges. Be sure that the photographs are secure and that the storage bin can properly close.	Store photos in a climate-controlled environment. Keep photos in archival boxes and albums. Properly store the photographs in a bin or album.
Credit sales are distinct from cash sales in that the customer is not required to make a full payment on the date of sale. Instead, they purchase their order on account and are allowed a set amount of time in which to make payments. From a business's perspective, this transaction is recorded as revenue, even though payment has not been received. In addition, the amount of the sale is added to "Accounts Receivable," an asset account that records the amount of money owed to the business by its customers.  When orders are paid for, the Accounts Receivable account is reduced for the amount of the order and cash is increased.; , The simplest method used to find total credit sales is to maintain your Accounts Receivable account and to update it for each sale made on credit. This method is most accurate as it accommodates for changing product prices as well as all cash sales. If you want a total for annual or quarterly credit sales, you can simply start recording a credit sales amount at the beginning of that period. Then, each time you update accounts receivable, you can add to the sale amount to your credit sales amount for that period.  Remember that sales tax is included in credit sales amounts., Total sales can be calculated as number of goods sold multiplied by the selling price. However, this can be complex if you offer different products at different prices. For example: If a company sold 100 unites of laptops at $100 a piece, its sales would be 100×100=$10,000{\displaystyle 100\times 100=\$10,000}.  To calculate credit sales, start by finding the cash received. Lets assume that the customers on an average paid $60 in cash for those 100 laptops, so cash received would be $6000.  Then, you can calculate credit sales by reducing total sales by total cash received. The credit sales would be equal to total sales minus cash received, which in this example is $10000−$6000=$4000{\displaystyle \$10000-\$6000=\$4000}., The initial value at the start of the year can be seen from the balance sheet of the company. Let's assume the value to be $10000. Start by finding the ending accounts receivable. It is the value at the end of the year which can also be found out from the balance sheet itself just like initial accounts receivables. Let's assume it to be $5000.  Then, determine the cash received. This should be in the company's records. Let the cash received for the year be $20000.  Finally, calculate credit sales by finding the difference. So the credit sales can be calculated as (cash received - initial accounts receivable + ending accounts receivable). In the example above, it would be $20000 - $10000 + $5000 = $15000. So the credit sales would be $15000 for the year.	Understand credit sales. Sum up individual credit sales. Calculate credit sales from total sales. Calculate credit sales from accounts receivables.
Your face is the first giveaway that could cost you a game of poker. Keeping your emotions and reactions in check regarding hands dealt to you is a key part of poker. Any type of expression sacrifices your power in situations with your opponents. Clear your mind, wiggle your face to loosen the muscles, take a deep breath, and relax.You want to be in control of the situation and if you’re too stressed, you can lose that control. Hiding your reactions is power, because no one knows what you’re thinking or what you’re about to do.; , You can win the upper hand by showing people you are confident and intimidating by locking eyes with them. Meeting people’s eyes also shows that you have nothing to hide so they don’t know what to expect from you. Look at the bridge of their nose to stare them down and keep your focus., Staring into space or focusing too hard on your cards is also how your poker face can be compromised. It either shows that you aren’t paying attention, or that you’re concerned for your hand and chances. Remind yourself to blink so that your eyes don’t dry out while you concentrate.Excessive blinking can also show nervousness, so don’t go overboard. There’s a balance between blinking enough to keep from staring and keeping your eyes focused so they don’t flit around. Staring too hard can also cause your shoulders to bunch up and posture to suffer. Focusing too hard on one thing visually can also distract you and you may miss an important play.  Your mouth is the main support for your face muscles and any tension, smile, frown, or smirk will influence the rest of your face. Relax your jaw first by letting it go slack, creating space between your back teeth.Open and close your mouth a few times to help relax as well.   Avoid showing your teeth. Whether it’s for a small grin or grimace, visible teeth means your mouth is moving and movement can give you away. Don’t grind your teeth. Your jaw will show the pressure your teeth are under.  Don’t look up or to the left or right out of the corners of your eyes. These are all tells which are little clues to your opponents that you have something to hide, whether it’s a good hand of cards or bad. It’s hard to do, but minimize your eye movements. Even squinting or excessive eye brow raises can give away your reaction.  In order to protect yourself, wear sunglasses so you don’t have to worry about giving anything away with your eyes. Sunglasses won’t be a problem indoors if you have enough lighting., Take a deep breath, raise your shoulders up to your ears, and let them drop down. Arch your back and then let it settle into a natural, upright position. Shake out any tense limbs and roll your head around on your neck. All of these will help you get back to a proper posture and break up any tension you have built up that will reveal your anxiety., Whether you’re excited or nervous, small twitches are a big giveaway to your emotions.Take a mental note to see if you’re exhibiting any little movements that come from nervous energy. Pay attention to yourself to make sure you’re not demonstrating any of these tics:   Knuckle cracking Fingernail biting Tapping fingers Pulling on your collar or tie or shirt sleeves Rubbing your face, hands together, or arms, Hold a stress ball or curl your hand into a fist to take any tension your body is storing. It can be hard to make yourself relax your entire body, so if you have to tense up, try allowing only one part of your body to hold that stress.   Conceal any movement or tension that you have. For example, hold your fist under the table or press your knees together to redirect any tension to where no one can notice it. Don’t grip your cards too tightly or you’ll have white knuckles which will show.  Your voice is also capable of revealing your emotions. A quiver in your voice or jumping to another octave while speaking is an easy tell for your opponents. Clear your throat or take a full breath before speaking so that you have enough air to talk in a neutral register., Stick to the facts of what’s happening and you won’t need too many words. Stumbling over your sentences, stuttering, or saying “um” too many times shows that you are nervous or unsure of yourself. Short, sweet, and to the point is how you should talk when in high-stress situations.   One word answers are acceptable, especially in high-stakes games like poker. You need to concentrate more on the game anyways rather than shooting the breeze with your opponents. If you're playing a game with friends and there isn't a real money at stake, the atmosphere may be a little more relaxed so talking may more appropriate. Just watch yourself when examining your hand.  When asked a question by the dealer or someone else, it’s acceptable to simply answer “yes” or “no” by nodding or shaking your head. If you don’t feel comfortable opening your mouth because you’re afraid that your voice will give you away, simply use relaxed body language to convey your answer.To distract yourself and keep from speaking, chew gum or keep snacks at the table. It helps to think about what you want to say before you speak. That way you can keep yourself from sounding excited or disappointed.  To be completely counter-intuitive, instead of staying silent you can comment on every hand dealt or result. You can pepper in false reactions too to throw your opponents off. Constantly talking can also distract your opponents by diverting their attention from the game to whatever you're saying.   Bluffing is an important part of poker. For example, you can receive a bad hand and pretend like you just got a winning hand. If you're consistently inconsistent with your reactions, no one will be able to guess your true reactions. This is much harder to do but can work in your favor.	Relax your face. Maintain eye contact with others. Blink occasionally to avoid staring. Keep your lips together and jaw relaxed. Look straight ahead. Wear sunglasses to conceal where you are looking. Relax your posture. Avoid fidgeting or adjusting your body or clothes. Divert any tension to something else. Speak with an even and balanced tone. Keep your words few and simple. Nod your head if you aren’t comfortable speaking. Confuse your opponents by talking constantly.
Most cryptograms or cryptoquotes are basic substitution ciphers, meaning that the letters of the alphabet are being represented by other letters. In some ciphers, different sorts of symbols may be used. The rules should be described somewhere on the particular cipher you're attempting to solve. A cryptogram in Klingon wouldn't be any more difficult than a cryptogram in Cyrillic, because the symbols act as patterns in the end. Find the patterns and you'll crack the code.   In general, the better you can divorce yourself from the letters themselves and look for the patterns underneath the letters, the closer you'll be to solving the puzzle. Try to disassociate yourself as much as possible from the letters you're looking at. Cryptograms don't try to play tricks on you, however difficult they may be. In almost all cryptograms, letters will never stand for themselves. In other words, the "X" in the puzzle you're trying to work out definitely doesn't stand for "X" in the alphabet.; , It's unlikely that you'll recognize one mess of jumbled up nonsense letters as a particular word right away, no matter how long you look at it. try to figure out the most likely single letter words, then carry that substitution through the rest of the puzzle, filling in as many blanks as possible with educated guesses, then filling in the remaining blank spaces.   Completing a cryptogram is a slow process that'll require lots of guessing. You'll weigh lots of possibilities and make the best guess at the time. If, later, that guess turns out to be wrong, then change it.  When you've got a bunch of blanks in the words, you'll eventually have to start plugging and chugging. You might exhaust all the short words and the obvious single-letters relatively quickly, meaning you'll have next-to-nothing to work with. Learning to recognize common patterns can help you to make the most high-probability bets, so you can learn to play the odds and increase your chances of making the right guess.  Even if you're a code-crackin' pro, the name of the game is guess-and-check, making it almost a sure thing that you'll have to change things up at some point. The best way to work a cryptogram is to do it on paper, in front of you, with a pencil.   It's a good idea to also keep handy a dictionary, to look up the proper spelling of words, and some scrap paper on which to scratch out possibilities. Write out all the letters in order of their most common use in the language on your piece of paper, so if it comes to blind guessing, you can use the most common guesses first. The English alphabet organized in frequency of use, reads like this: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U, C, W, M, F, Y, G, P, B, V, K, J, X, Q, Z. As you discover the value of each letter, write it above corresponding letter on your scratch key.  Working on a wrong assumption can be a good thing. If you've been cruising along on a puzzle, then find out you've been working with the wrong substitute for "G" for the last hour, celebrate! You know one more letter that you can eliminate as a possibility, meaning that you're one letter closer to having the cryptogram cracked. Any time you find yourself in a position in which you're sure about something, it's a good moment for a code-cracker.  No, it's not a shadowy puzzle organization with decoder rings and secret handshakes. The letters e, t, a, o, i and n appear more commonly than any other letters in the English language, making this an extremely useful collection to learn to recognize. If you learn to quickly and efficiently recognize the patterns in which they appear, you'll be a pro cracker in no time.   Do a quick count of the most commonly-recurring letters in your cryptogram and circle them. There's a much-higher probability that that letter will be one of these. Learning to combine frequency of appearance with pattern recognition will reveal the substitutions.  Because cryptograms often use quotes from people, the word "I" is almost as common as the word "a," so be careful before making assumptions about words you see appearing alone. The trick to figuring out if it's "I" or "a" is to experiment with the letters in other words and look for common patterns.   If there is a three-letter word beginning with that same letter, the letter is almost certainly the word "a." There are a number of common three-letter words beginning with "a" and very few which start with "i." If a possible three-letter word doesn't give you a good indication, try "A" first, since it's the third-most-common letter in the language. Substitute it through the rest of the puzzle and start working it. If it turns out to be wrong, you'll at least know it's got to be "I".  Another secret-weapon in helping to get your first couple of letters cracked is the existence of the apostrophe. Signifying either a contraction (can't) or a possessive (hers), apostrophes give you an excellent indication of what's behind the apostrophe, or at least help you narrow down the possibilities.   An apostrophe with one letter behind it has to be either t, s, d, or m. Apostrophes with two letters behind, have to be either "re," "ve," or "ll." To distinguish between possessives and contractions, look at the letter before the apostrophe. If it's always the same, you almost definitely have the "n't" combination. If not, then you're more likely dealing with the possessive., Using what you know about the frequency of letters appearing and what you've gathered from context clues about individual-word letters and apostrophes, you can get cracking more by starting in on the short two-letter words.   The most common two-letter words are: of, to, in, it, is, be, as, at, so, we, he, by. If you find two two-letter words where the letters are reversed, you've got either "no" and "on." You just have to figure out which is which!  , The word "the" is extremely common and can be measured against "that" for a good indication of letters. For instance, if a sentence contains both "BGJB" and "BGD," you can be pretty confident that you're on the right track, and B = T. In the same cryptogram, "BGDL" would most likely be "then" and "BGDZD" would be "there."   The most common three-word letters in English are: the, and, for, are, but, not, you, all, any, can, her, was, one, our, out, day, get, has, him, his, how, man., Words longer than 5 or 6 letters will most of the time include some kind of common prefix or suffix, of which you can learn to look for, to make discovering the substitutions much easier.Common prefixes include: anti-, de-, dis-, en-, em-, in-, im-, pre-, il-, ir-, mid-, mis-, non-. Common suffixes include: -able, -ible, -al, -ment, -ness, -ous, -ious, -ly.  Digraphs are two-letter combos in English that result in one sound, and most often one of the letters is an "h". These are especially useful if you find an "h" in the last position of a word, because you know only so many letters can combine with it in the correct way. It's likely either a c, p, s, or t.   Other common digraphs include: ck, sk, lk, ke, qu, ex. Related two-letter combination lucky breaks include double-letters. These won't show up too often in cryptograms, but they're extremely helpful when you find them. "LL" is the most common double-letter combo, shortly followed by "ee".  Vowels are present in every word in English and represent almost 40% of the words in a given text. They'll almost never come three-in-a-row, or four. To narrow down the vowels and start filling in more blanks, you can learn a few vowel tips.   The most common vowel is "e"; the least common is "u". Unless the text is about skiing or vacuuming, a doubled vowel is probably "e" or "o". A pattern of repeating letters in a long word usually indicates vowels, like the "i" repeating in the word "civilization." However, if adjacent letters repeat, they're more likely to consonants.  If your cryptogram includes any punctuation, pay particularly close attention to the words on either side of it. Commas, periods, and other punctuation can clue you into several possibilities and help you start narrowing it down from there to make more educated guesses.   Conjunctions like "but" or "and" will often follow commas. A question mark often implies a "wh" somewhere in the clause preceding it. Start looking for possibilities, if you've got a question mark at the end of the cryptogram sentence.  Like crossword, word search, and other puzzle-makers, cryptogram writers have a particular sense of humor, and know the rules and the difficulties of solving the puzzles inside and out. Look for the following relatively common words that appear in cryptograms with identifiable patterns.   That (or high, says, else, dead, died) There/Where/These (in any case you've identified "h" and "e") People Always Everywhere Somewhere William or Kennedy (if a name, otherwise look for "million" or "letters") Never (or state, fewer, color, level)  , Most puzzle cryptograms are relatively obscure quotations, usually aphoristic statements about "people" or "society," meaning cryptograms are small compact little philosophies. Because you know this for sure, you can sometimes start narrowing the focus in terms of the content of the cryptogram to make more educated guesses about the words. Big concepts and abstracts are the order of the day for most cryptogram puzzles.   Comparative and superlative words like "always" and "everywhere" will often appear in cryptograms because of the nature of the content. Other common words in this category include more, less, nobody, usually, better, worse, everything, often, and rarely.  Cryptoquotes usually will usually end with the name of the author of the quote. Authors are usually identified as "first name last name", but some exceptions can be exploited."Anonymous," for example, wrote a lot of great quotes.   A two-letter word at the beginning of the author's name is probably Dr. A two-letter word at the end of the author's name is probably a suffix like "Jr" or "Sr" or a Roman numeral as in "Pope Paul VI" A short word in the middle of a name might be a common nobiliary particle like "de" or "von."  , You probably don't need to diagram out the sentence in your cryptogram, but if you can anticipate the placement or definite and indefinite articles, linking verbs, and other common constructions, you'll be a lot closer to the answer.   Look for nouns after personal pronouns like "his" or "hers." Recognize helping verbs, like am, be, been, or have, which precede another verb, in a sentence like, "I am helping you learn to solve cryptograms." They are usually never more than 5 letters.  Many sentences will work in some kind of parallel structure, recalling a different form or iteration of the same word somewhere later in the line. Since cryptograms are often taken from quotes and speeches, this is especially common in those rhetorical devices.   Many aphorisms will include binaries to compare and make a rhetorical point. If the word "truth" appears, you might also look for "lie" somewhere later in the sentence. Look for alternate forms of the same word. "Pleasure" and "pleasurable" might both show up in a cryptogram. Don't bang your head against the wall trying to figure out what other word it could be that looks almost exactly the same.	Understand the way a cryptogram works. Solve one letter at a time. Make the best guess, then guess again. Work in pencil. Embrace your mistakes. Join the E.T.A.O.I.N tribe. try to pin down the one-letter words. Look for contractions and possessives.

Try to take off a little time in order to show your relatives that they matter.It will help you be less stressed if you don't have to juggle work when they arrive, even if you do have to work during the visit.  Welcoming people into your home or city can involve an array of things, but almost always including washing and/or eating. If they are staying at your home, ask them whether they would like to wash up or eat first, and then make that happen. Discuss your plans for the visit after they’ve been fed and/or showered, and shown to their room or hotel.  Putting a little thought and effort into making your annoying relatives’ sleeping area cozy and inviting for them will disarm them, in a good way.Sometimes you will be lucky enough to have a spare bedroom, but even at a hotel you can stop by and bring them some water and snacks, a bottle of wine and a wine opener, or some nice magazines that they would find interesting.  Planning a few meals and few activities can help structure the time.   Don't feel compelled to produce elaborate dinners to impress your family, but if you like cooking and it makes you happy, do it. Downtime is just as important, so don't forget to include that. Plan meals or dining out alternatives that will fit everyone's checkbook.	Take time off when they arrive. Welcome them properly. Plan and personalize where they will stay. Plan a few meals and activities.
Use paper towels to blot grease and remove food spatter. Removing stains as quickly as possible prevents them from setting. Acidic food such as tomato sauce or lemon juice can damage metal over time, so don’t let those stains linger., Pick a non-chloride glass cleaner or all-surface cleaner such as Windex. Use it between washings to remove minor stains like fingerprints. Spray the cleaner across the surface of the metal. Wipe the fingerprints off with a cloth, then wipe up excess cleaner or allow it to air dry., To give the backsplash a shine, add a tablespoon of olive oil to a soft cloth. Spend a few minutes rubbing in the oil along the grain. Leave the oil alone and it’ll protect your backsplash from stains for a few weeks.Commercial metal polish can also be used, but olive oil works well and is less expensive. Other oils, including baby oil, may also work.	Blot stains immediately. Spray glass cleaner to remove fingerprints. Buff the metal with olive oil.
Your website should be easy to navigate and have information about your company and its products or services. Capture customer information through a form that asks them questions about their needs. A price quote form is a good way to do this. You'll receive an email with the potential customer's contact information.   Make sure your website is listed with major search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. This is the bare minimum for being noticed online. Practice searching for your site on each popular engine as well to see what comes up.; , To sign up for an auto-responder, potential customers simply enter their email address. There are various types of auto-responder services that vary in complexity, and some are geared specifically toward generating leads. Types include welcome emails, responses based on specific online activities, and product recommendations., These sites are where millions of people are already gathering to connect with each other. So, establishing a meaningful presence there is a good idea. You can create a page on these sites to promote your business. When a customer "friends" you or "becomes a fan," the people in her network can learn about your company as well.   Use different modes of social media. You might start with a general site like Facebook, a business networking site such as LinkedIn, or a microblogging and all-purpose site like Twitter. However, consider expanding to picture-based sites like Pinterest or Instagram. Also look for any types of social networking platforms specific to your industry, like Glozal for real estate, Lawyrs for law, or Architizer for architects and designers.Don’t forget about your social media. Many companies put up a social media page and then neglect to update it. Once you have a page, schedule regular weekly or daily updates. And don’t just try to amass followers; try to engage them. Use giveaways and promotions. Respond to their comments, and address any concerns in a timely manner.  SEM involves using paid ad words to drive clicks and increase traffic to your company’s website or its online promotional landing pages. SEO is a type of SEM in which you produce content that helps move your site “organically” to the top of searches for companies like yours.   Give potential web leads something to do. When someone does arrive at your page via your SEM efforts, they should have some clear options of what to do. Make it easy for them to leave their contact information or purchase your product or service through ecommerce. Your web content management system might already have an ecommerce plugin or application, such as WordPress’ MarketPress, or you can add ecommerce capabilities through a third-party provider, such as PayPal.  Social media sites usually have their own tracking mechanisms, or third-party apps can track your traffic for you. Pay special attention to which ad words are working for you and which aren’t, especially since you pay for those.   Look for trends and patterns. Are there particular times of the day, week, or month that you experience more or less travel? What about the geographic regions your visitors come from? Try to figure out why. Determine which ad words give you the best bang for your buck. Also identify weaknesses. Maybe you don’t have that many followers on social media, or maybe your online sales are sluggish. This is all information you can use. Isolate potential leads. Notice who comments on your social media posts. Look for people who have used your coupons, taken action on your website, or replied to your newsletters. These are all people that are leads.	Create a website that can capture leads. Set up an email auto-responder. Promote your business on social networking sites. Conduct Search Engine Marketing (SEM) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Track your traffic on all your web platforms.
There are professional carpet cleaners who will come to your home and steam clean carpet and upholstery, or you can purchase or rent steam cleaning machines to do the job yourself. Stores offer cleaning solutions that are specifically formulated for odor removal, or you can try other solutions such as Oxyclean, vinegar or bleach.Do not steam clean for at least a month if you are using a microbial solution. Use the solution for 4 cycles before steam cleaning. Avoid using regular vacuums and cleaners such as baking soda or carpet shampoos because it doesn’t clean down to the carpet pads where odors could be trapped. Professional carpet cleaning costs vary greatly because it depends on the size of the home and how many rooms you will be cleaning. Overall, you can expect to pay an average of $51 per room. Some companies may also charge by the square foot.Steam cleaner rentals usually have an hourly minimum for rental, but also allow you to rent per day. You can find the cleaner and products at your local hardware store., Ozone (O3) is a reactive particle which chemically attracts and reacts with molecules in the air and on surfaces. The oxygen in ozone chemically changes the structure of the molecule to eliminate the odor.You can purchase ozone generators online or at your local hardware store for anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars.Instructions usually suggest to let the generator run for an hour in a closed room, but you can allow it to run for 3-4 hours.Ozone is effective in removing odors because as a gas, it is able to penetrate anywhere that air can go: walls, ceilings, vents, carpets, upholstery fibers and more. You can read online consumer reviews that discuss various features of ozone generators such as cost, size, noise, durability, and effectiveness.Ozone generators are typically purchased for places where ozone is needed, such as places where there is gaseous pollution (like the smell of curry). They should not be used to remove allergens, as they have been known to cause greater health issues., Contact a company that has machines that use an Advanced Photocatalytic Oxidation (APO) process. This process utilizes air and water to create vaporized hydrogen peroxide, and reactive hydroxyl particles. This process cleans both air and surfaces in a home. Not only does it clean, but it breaks down compounds which hold odors.Most homes can be completed in 12 hours or less and clients, furniture, clothing, and rugs can remain in the home. You can also purchase photocatalytic air purifiers that use the same technology to zap odor-causing particles.Purifiers and filters can be found online for about $200., Use turpentine to break down grease from kitchen surfaces. Then, strip the current paint off your walls by grinding, applying heat, or using chemicals. Next, apply an odor blocking and sealing primer which will both keep current odors from seeping out, and keep new odors from penetrating the paint.Lastly, choose your paint and mix in additives that have been known to block odors such as vanilla or chemical additives.   To remove grease, mix equal parts turpentine, linseed oil, and white vinegar, and use a light cloth to wipe the grease off kitchen surfaces. There is no need to rinse when done. Simply allow to dry and buff with a cloth.Turpentine can often have a noxious smell so be sure to use in a well-ventilated area, and use rubber gloves and a mask to protect yourself, and line your work area with cloth or cardboard. When mixing additives to your paint, add two tablespoons of vanilla extract to every gallon of paint.Or, you can mix in odorless additives (found at your local hardware or paint store) that actually remove odors, as opposed to just blocking them.	Try steam cleaning your carpet and upholstery. Opt for an ozone generator to destroy molecules. Opt for a photocatalytic air purifying process. Repaint your walls.
Acid-free cardstock is a staple of scrapbooking. It is a stiff, heavy paper that can withstand the weight of embellishments, photos, and memorabilia. These characteristics make it ideal to use as a background for your album’s pages. Cardstock is available in every imaginable solid color, texture, and finish. When you select your cardstock, pick out colors, textures, and finishes that complement your scrapbook’s color story—the palette of colors you choose to use in the album.   You may also use cardstock to mat photos, frame pictures, and create embellishments. Finishes include: iridescent, glossy, matte, and glitter.80 pounds is the most popular cardstock weight. It is similar in thickness to a business card.; , Scrapbookers rely on acid-free patterned paper to help them tell their narrative, express their theme, and unite their album. The patterns you select should reflect your theme and align with your color story. This lightweight paper is perfect for accents and use as a background.   You may choose patterns that clearly expresses your theme—palm trees for tropical vacations or ballerinas for a dance recital—or you can pick paper with an abstract or geometrical pattern that will work for a variety of pages within your album. If you struggle to mix and match patterns and colors, you can purchase sets of printed paper., In addition to using solid and patterned paper, scrapbookers also incorporate transparent sheets of acetate paper into their albums. Transparency paper may be completely see through or contain a printed pattern. You may use this paper as an overlay or for a background.   In an effort to keep your album cohesive, the transparency paper you purchase should match the cardstock and patterned paper you select for your project. Do not purchase transparency paper that is unrelated to your theme and/or color palette., Scrapbooking aisles provide consumers with a myriad of options, but don't allow the seemingly endless options to overwhelm you. If you are struggling to mix and match patterns, colors, and even paper types for you backgrounds, opt to purchase a curated pack of paper. Every pattern and color was carefully selected to complement the other options within the pack. A collection of paper will give you a good starting point.   Most packs of curated paper have a line of matching embellishments.	Select plain cardstock paper that supports your color story. Purchase patterned paper that supports your theme. Experiment with transparency paper. Purchase a curated paper collection.
Use a dry towel or paper towel to dab the stain, removing all that you can in this manner. Avoid rubbing it into to the rug, since this could cause the stain to grow larger., If you cannot treat the stain immediately, sprinkle some salt to the area after blotting it clean. The salt can help to absorb the wine stain.When ready to treat the stain, simply vacuum the salt off of the carpet before beginning.  Mix together ¼ teaspoon (1.2 milliliter) of dish soap with one cup of warm water. Spray this directly onto the carpet, and let it sit for about five minutes before rinsing with warm water.  If you are unable to remove the stain with soapy water, try using 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of white vinegar with warm water. Dab or spray this directly onto the stain. Then, rinse using a paper towel dampened with warm water.	Blot the stain with a paper towel. Add salt to the stain. Create a mixture using soap and water. Use a stronger mixture of vinegar and water.
The first order of business is getting out as much beer out of the upholstery as possible. Getting the beer out will help lessen the stain. Use clean, white paper towels to blot the area, as colorful paper towels could stain the upholstery with dye.While you're blotting, make sure you've found all the stain. Look for other spots on the upholstery beyond the main spill, as beer has a tendency to splash everywhere.  You'll need a basic cleaning solution to clear up the stain. You can make one from items you have at home, and you have more than one option when deciding what you want to use.The first solution uses rubbing alcohol and white vinegar. Measure out 2/3 a cup of rubbing alcohol. Add a tablespoon of white vinegar to it, and mix it together. The second solution uses dishwashing detergent and water. In 2 cups of cool water, add a tablespoon of dishwashing detergent. Stir it together. Either solution will work, so just choose one based on what you have on hand. You may want to test the solution in a discreet area to make sure it doesn't discolor the fabric, as different fabrics may react differently to the solutions.  Dip a clean cloth into the solution. A white cloth is best so it doesn't stain the upholstery. Apply the cloth to the upholstery. Press it in to help absorb the beer from the upholstery., Continue to reapply apply the solution to the stain. As you do, the stain should begin to lift. You may need to repeat the process 3 or 4 times before you absorb all the beer from the upholstery. Make sure the stain is completely gone before moving on to the next step., Using a new clean cloth, apply cool water to the area. Blot a few times to make sure all the cleaning solution is gone. Once it is, use a dry, clean cloth to blot the area until it's mostly dry.	Blot the stain with a paper towel. Create a cleaning solution. Apply the solution. Keep pressing. Sponge cool water onto the area.
The current drywall is in direct contact with the ceiling joists. This allows sound from the floor above to pass directly through the joists with little resistance. Once the old drywall is removed, you can install a new ceiling with an air gap between it and the floor above.  Decoupling alone is very effective at reducing the sound of conversation and high-pitched noises, but it can make low frequencies (such as stomping feet) sound louder! To get the best of both worlds, apply damping compound to a new sheet of thick drywall and screw it onto the subfloor from below.See above for detailed instructions. Take care not to use screws that break through the floor above. Alternatively, complete the rest of this method first, then reinforce the new ceiling with a second layer. Reinforce both ends if extreme soundproofing is required.  Standard R19 fiberglass insulation is just as good as the more expensive "acoustic" insulation. Fill the gaps between the joists, but avoid over-compression, which can carry vibrations through the floor.Cellulose, mineral fiber, cotton, or polyester are effective alternatives. Do not use foam insulation.If you choose the floating ceiling joist approach (see below), install the joists before you insulate.  This is the most effective decoupling method, but may not be feasible if the ceiling space is taken up by ductwork. To do this, install a new joist between each pair of ceiling joists. The new joists should extend 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) further down than the original joists.Ideally, the floating joist can rest on the inside layer of a decoupled wall. This creates another air gap between the joists and the outside layer of the wall. If you choose this approach, you do not need to follow the rest of the instructions. Just install more drywall over the joists, then fill in the perimeter with acoustic caulk.  Installing hat channel (furring channel) and sound clips is less effective than floating joists, but uses less vertical space. For best soundproofing, choose furring channel marked "087F125-18" or confirm that it meets these specifications: ⅞" (22.2mm) depth; 25 gauge; hemmed long edge. Twenty gauge channel is more common, but significantly worse for soundproofing.Alternatively, you can purchase resilient channel, which is designed for soundproofing. However (at least in North America), resilient channel is not standardized, so it's difficult to guarantee it will work.Read customer reviews before purchasing.  Install the channels no more than 24" (61cm) apart, and position the end channels within 6" (15cm) of the wall. If there is a vent in your ceiling, end the channel flush against the frame of the vent on either side. Place additional short lengths of channel on either side of the vent to increase stability.If the channel is not long enough to reach across the ceiling, overlap channel lengths by at least 6" (15cm) and screw together. Do not install sound clips onto overlapped areas. Place the channels within 16" (41cm) of each other if you plan to support a triple layer of drywall.  Hat channel alone is not very effective, especially under non-dampened drywall.Install soundproofing clips through the hat channel as follows:Place clips around the perimeter of the ceiling, within 6" (15cm) of each wall. Fill in the first channel with sound clips spaced 48" (122cm) apart. For best results, shift the next row's sound clip placement by 16" and fill it out, spacing clips 48" apart as before. Repeat the shift for each row. To save money (using about 10% fewer clips), arrange clips in a grid pattern instead, using the same positioning as the first channel. See your clip product instructions for how to fasten. Avoid over-tightening, which can reduce soundproofing.  Install drywall sections perpendicular to the channels for maximum strength. Fill in gaps around the perimeter with acoustic caulk.   Applying damping compound and adding a second layer of drywall is recommended, especially if you did not reinforce the subfloor above.	Remove the existing ceiling drywall. Reinforce the floor above (recommended). Install insulation between the ceiling joists. Consider floating ceiling joists. Purchase hat channel instead. Install the hat channel perpendicular to the joists. Screw in resilient sound clips. Install drywall over the channel.
A popular way to pay for home repairs and renovations is through a "cash-out refi," which is simply a way of swapping your existing mortgage for a new one and converting some of your home equity to cash in the process. Your current mortgage lender can help you understand your options for refinancing. Note that liquidating your equity in this way will generally cause your monthly payments or mortgage term to increase.; , A home equity line of credit functions like a credit card, with an open-ended term, a credit limit, and a minimum monthly payment based on your outstanding balance. This type credit makes sense for financing home repairs or remodeling projects because these projects tend to increase your home equity anyway.  A second mortgage can be an unattractive option as it can tend to overburden you with debt, but for home repairs with an end in sight they are helpful. A second mortgage is a loan secured on your accumulated equity. The interest rate will be higher because your primary mortgage lender is given preference over your new lender in case of insolvency; for this reason, try to keep the size of your second mortgage as small as possible.  In the United States, the Federal Housing Administration runs a loan program called Title 1 for homeowners with very little equity. These loans are made by banks and backed by the federal government, and can be used to finance essential repairs such as structural and electrical problems.  While credit cards typically carry higher interest rates than loans secured on your home equity, they make sense for funding small home repairs. A credit card is available for use immediately and requires no paperwork, unlike other financing options.  Many employers allow borrowing from your 401(k) to fund home repairs and renovations. This option is low-hassle because the money is already yours, so there is no paperwork or credit check. However, you are required to pay the borrowed money back into your 401(k) before leaving the company.	Refinance your mortgage to obtain cash for home repairs. Obtain a home equity line of credit. Seek out a second mortgage. Determine if you qualify for a government loan. Use a credit card for small, emergency repairs. Borrow from your 401(k).
Individuals are generally required to do so if they meet the following criteria: You carry on a trade or business as a sole proprietor or independent contractor. You are part of a partnership that carries on a trade or business. You are otherwise in business for yourself.; , You need to do this by subtracting expenses from your profit.Calculate your net expenses by adding up all of your expenses from the past tax year relating to your business. Add up all profits from your business from the past year. Subtract your business expenses from your profits. This figure is your net profit. For example, if you made $1000.00 in profits and had $200 dollars in expenses, your net profit would be $800.00  , The IRS has income guidelines regarding self-employment tax. Self-employed individuals with a net profit of $400 or more must file self-employment tax. If your net profit was less than $400 you do not need to file self-employment tax. If you do need to file self-employment tax, you will need to use Form 1040 Schedule SE to calculate your self employment tax.  There is a short form and a long form on Schedule SE. Use the flow chart on the front to determine which one you will use.   Follow the instructions step by step on the form to calculate the tax.Use a calculator to do your math. Trying to do this by hand can be time consuming and unnecessarily difficult. To fill out this form you will need Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ to be completely filled out, receipts and documentation of your expenses and losses, and any other income information.  Follow these steps: On line 1a, enter net farm profit or loss from Schedule F, line 34. Income from farm partnerships can be found on Schedule K-1, box 14 Code a. If you did not have farm profit, enter 0. For line 1b, enter any social security retirement or disability benefits from the Conservation Reserve payments section on Schedule F, line 4b or Schedule K-1, box Z. For line 2, enter net profit or loss from Schedule C (line 41), Schedule C-EZ (line 3), or Schedule K-1 (box 14, code a and box 9, code J-1). Combine lines 1a, 1b, and 2 and enter this value in line 3 of the form. For example, if you had zero farm income (line 1a), zero social security retirement or disability benefits (line 1b), and $800 profit (line 2), you would enter $800.00 for line 3.  To do this simply multiply the amount from line 3 by .9235.Enter this figure on line 4. For example, if you had $800.00 profit from self-employment, you would multiply 800 by .9235. 800 x .9235 = 738.80. You would enter 738.80 on line 4 of the Short Schedule SE form. If this amount is less than $400 you do not need to pay self-employment tax. If this amount is $400 or more, proceed to line 5 of Short Schedule SE. In our example, $738.80 is greater than $400. You would need to proceed to line 5.  To do do this calculation look closely at the figure you entered on line 4.If this amount is $117,000 or less, multiply line 4 by .153 and enter this figure in line 5. If the amount you entered in line 4 is more than $117,000, you would need to multiply line 4 by .029 then add $14,508 to the result. You would then record this figure on line 5. For example, if you had $738.80 on line 4, you would multiply it by .153. 738.80 x .153 = 113.04. You would enter $113.04 on line 5 of the form.  You will need the information you entered on line 5 to complete this.Multiply line 5 by .50. This figure is what you should enter on line 6. This is the deduction for self-employment tax. For example, if you had line $113.04 on line 5 of the form, you would multiply this figure by .50. 113.04 x .50 = 56.52. You would enter $56.52 on line 6.  These are the same as in Short Schedule SE (See Part II, Step 1).Enter the sum of 1a, 1b, and 2 on line 3 of Long Schedule SE. For example your farm income was $0 (line 1a), you had no earnings from social security retirement or disability (line 1a), and your business had a profit of $800 (line 2). $0 + $0 + $800 = $800. You would enter $800 on line 3 in this example.  The total from line 4c will tell you if you have to pay self-employment tax or not.For 4a, if the figure you entered in line 3 was more than $0, multiply this figure by .9235. For example, if you entered $800 in line 3, you would multiply this by .9235 for line 4a. $800 x .9235 = 738.80. You would enter $738.80 for line 4a. Fill out 4b using the optional methods on the bottom of the page only if you had farm income. Otherwise enter $0. For 4c, add lines 4a and 4b. For example if you had entered $738.80 in line 4a, and $0 in line 4b, your total for line 4c would be $738.80. If line 4c is $400 or less, you don't need to file self-employment tax. If line 4c is greater than $400 you will need to proceed with the rest of Long Schedule SE.  If you do not have church related income, enter 0 for both lines 5a and 5b.Enter church related income on line 5a. Multiply line 5a by .9235. Enter this amount in line 5b. If the amount is less than $100 enter $0.  This combines earnings from self-employed income and church related income.   To complete this step, add together the values from 4c and 5b. For example if you entered $738.80 on line for 4c, and $0 on line 5b, you would enter $738.80 on line 6. Make sure you have done your calculations correctly before moving on.  You will need any information from your W-2 forms for this line, as well as information on tips not reported to social security and any other wages subject to social security tax.For line 8a, enter social security wages and tips (boxes 3 and 7 on your W-2 forms). For line 8b, enter any tips not reported to social security. For line 8c, enter any wages subject to social security tax. For line 8d, add line 8a, 8b, and 8c. Enter this value for line 8d. Subtract line 8d from line 7. The value for line 7 is $117,000. Input this value on line 9.  You will need to look at line 6 and line 9 of this form to do this.Line 10 states to multiply the smaller of these two figures by .124: Line 6 or Line 9. Multiply line 6 or line 9 by .124. Let's assume that line 6 is the smaller of the two. In our example, line 6 was $738.80. $738.80 x .124 = 91.61. You would enter $91.61 for line 10.  You will need the value of line 6 for this step.You will need to multiply the value of line 6 by .029. For example, if line 6 were $738.80 you would multiply that value by .029. 738.80 x .029 = 21.43. Therefore, in this example, you would enter $21.43 as the value for line 11.  To do this you would simply add lines 10 and 11 together.For example, line 10 was $91.61. Line 11 in the example was $21.43. $91.61 + $21.43 = 113.04. Therefore, in this example you would enter $113.04 for line 12.  This is the final step and here you would calculate the self-income tax deduction.Multiply line 12 by .50 to calculate this value. For example, the value for line 12 is $113.04. 113.04 * .50 = $56.52. You would then put in $56.52 for line 13. You have now calculated self-income tax deduction.	Understand who has to file self-employment tax. Calculate your net profit from your business. Determine if you have to file self-employment tax. Use Form 1040 Schedule SE to calculate self-employment tax. Complete the first portion to determine net profit. Multiply the figure in line 3 by 92.35%. Fill out line 5 of the Short Schedule SE form. Complete line 6 of the Short Schedule SE form. Complete lines 1a, 1b, and 2 on Long Schedule SE. Complete line 4, parts a, b, and c. You will need the information from 3 to do this. Complete section 5 for church related income. Complete line 6. Fill out section 8 and 9 of the Long Schedule SE form. Complete line 10 of the Long Schedule SE form. Complete line 11 of the Long Schedule SE form. Fill in line 12 on the form. Complete line 13 of the Long Schedule SE Form.
These are designed to prevent heat loss and withstand great deal of heat. Kiln bricks, magnesia blocks, or charcoal bricks are all common options.; , Any metal alloy designed to melt and join metal together is called a "solder," but most solders will not work to join gold. You can buy gold solder, designed for this purpose, as sheets, wire, or in 1 mm (~1/32 inch) chips. Cutting larger pieces of solder into chips is recommended, to make it easier to control the precise amount of solder being applied.   Solder with a higher gold content is stronger, but takes more heat to melt. It is recommended for joining two pieces together. Use "plumb solder," "medium" or "hard" solder, or solder with 14 karat and above. Solder with a lower gold content will melt more easily, and is recommended for small repairs. Use "repair solder," "easy" solder, or solder below 14 karat.Check the label before buying pink or rose gold solder, as it may contain highly toxic cadmium., A small oxy-acetylene gas torch is a good choice, but butane or other high-temperature torches will work as well. Soldering irons are not recommended for precious metals or other high-temperature soldering tasks., Before soldering gold, or most other metals, a chemical product called "flux" should be applied to clean the metal's surface and help the soldering process go smoothly. Find a flux at a hardware or jewelry store that is safe for use on precious metals. This is sometimes called "brazing flux" due to the technical term for this high-temperature joining process. Flux comes in paste or liquid form, or as a powder that creates a paste when mixed with water.   While brazing is technically a different process than soldering, even jewelers usually call this process "soldering." A flux labeled "soldering flux" may work, but check the packaging to see if it is appropriate for gold.  Use fans or open windows to create a light breeze over the work area, moving potential fumes away from you. Strong breezes may make the soldering process more difficult, due to the cooling effect., Copper will not corrode in the acidic pickle solution described below, unlike steel. You'll also need any tool that can hold the gold objects in position, usually tweezers. A clamp or vise can also be used, but tighten lightly to avoid bending the gold.   The other tools do not need to be made from copper.  Safety goggles are vital to protect your eyes from molten droplets. A thick canvas apron is recommended to prevent burns on your clothing. Roll up long sleeves and tie back long hair as an additional precaution.  Set a container of water out for cooling and rinsing the gold. Purchase a "pickle" solution for cleaning oxidization off metal, and prepare it according to the instructions on the packaging. Most pickle manufacturers sell it as a powder, which can be prepared in small amounts by dissolving with water and heating.   Never place the pickle solution in a steel container, or put it in contact with a steel utensil. Never heat pickle in a microwave or container that you intend to use for cooking. The pickle can leave an unpleasant smell or even traces of harmful materials.  The gold surfaces to be joined need to be clean of dirt and grease for the solder to chemically bond them together. Soak them in the pickle solution briefly to remove surface contamination, then rinse in water to remove the acid. Scrub the surfaces with detergent or soap for additional cleaning.   Some people neutralize the acidic pickle by adding baking soda to the rinse water, but this is not necessary unless your pickle is unusually strong., Place the gold objects on a soldering block, and hold in place with tweezers or a clamp. The areas to be joined together should fit together as closely as possible; this process cannot typically fill large gaps., Flux will help remove additional impurities, and prevent discoloration to the surface. Applying the flux only where the pieces will be joined may reduce the amount of solder that flows to the wrong area, but some people prefer to apply the flux over the whole piece to minimize discoloration., Use the torch to briefly heat the flux wherever you applied it, until the water boils away and leaves behind protective solids, which inhibit the formation of copper oxides. If you applied flux to the entire object, be sure to perform this step thoroughly before you add the solder.  Place a chip of solder on one end of the seam to be joined, and heat the surrounding gold objects. If you are using an appropriately high-temperature torch, you should be able to heat that area sufficiently to melt the solder without having to heat the entire object. Move your flame back and forth slowly as you heat, to apply the heat across the length of the seam to be joined. The solder should melt and flow across the seam, visibly joining the two sides together.  Once the solder has flowed along the joint, and the metal surfaces have been heated sufficiently to join together, turn off the torch and let the gold cool. After a couple minutes, quench it further in the water bath. Use copper tools to lower the gold slowly into the pickle bath, and wait a few minutes for most of the discoloring fire-scale on the surface to be removed.  Remove the gold from the pickle, rinse in the water bath, and inspect. You may need to polish or file off excess solder or fire scale to achieve the appearance you desire. The two gold objects should now be joined together with a strong bond.	Use any type of soldering brick. Purchase gold solder. Select a precision torch for melting the solder. Find an appropriate flux. Ventilate the work area. Acquire copper tongs and tools for holding the gold in place. Follow safety precautions. Set up one water bath and one pickle bath. Clean gold thoroughly. Hold the gold in place. Apply a small amount of flux to the parts being soldered together. Heat the flux slightly. Apply a small amount of solder and heat. Treat the joined piece with water and pickle. Make final adjustments if needed.
There are 6 situations in which a land survey should be performed.   Get a survey done if you are buying a new piece of property. The reason is simple: you need to make sure that what you think you're buying is actually what you're buying. Most lenders will require a survey anyway. Get a survey done if you are constructing anything new on your property. Most zoning ordinances and neighborhood codes will specify a required setback from your property line. If you don't know precisely where your property line is, you won't be able to adhere to this regulation. Get a survey done if your property has any access easements. All property owners are entitled to access their property, and this often requires getting easements to allow the use of a neighboring land parcel for access. Easements should specify very clearly the centerline and width of any access corridors. Get a survey done if you are selling your property. Having a current survey on file will greatly improve the marketability of your home. Buyers will be more interested in your property if you give them the confidence that a proper survey has been performed. Get a survey done if you need to verify the acreage of your property for tax assessments. Your local jurisdiction may require you to have a current survey on file to correctly assess property taxes. Get a survey done if your neighbor starts building anything new. If you suspect your neighbor is encroaching on your property or violating setback regulations, you need a survey on your own property to initiate any legal action.; , Have your deed ready, because surveyors will generally not give an estimate unless they have a copy of your deed. Explain the reason why you need a survey and any other concerns you might have.  Good surveying firms will do their research before providing a bid. Make sure that they've checked for any previous surveys done on your property by government offices or private surveyors. Surveys will cost less if some of the boundaries can be quickly verified through previous surveys.  When you're happy with a company's bid, sign the contract included with the bid and return it to the company. You will generally have to pay a retainer fee at this point. Make sure that you clearly understand how long it will take the surveyor to complete the survey before contracting with them.  When the job is done, you should receive a signed certificate from them certifying that the survey has been recorded.	Determine if you need to have a survey done. Contact several local surveying firms to get cost estimates. Compare the estimates from the surveyors you contacted. Select a surveyor. Allow the surveyor to perform the survey.
You’ll have the most success removing spray paint from fabric if you can treat it while it’s still wet. If you’ve simply dusted fabric with spray paint or if it’s dried, you can just start cleaning it. However, if it’s soaked with wet paint, you’ll want to run it under cold water to flush out as much paint as possible.Hold an article of clothing until the water starts to run clear. If you’re dealing with a carpet or upholstery stain, blot the affected area with a cold, damp cloth or towel.  Hairspray contains alcohol, which breaks down the paint’s bonds. You can also use other alcohol-based treatments, like nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. Test by applying the cleaner to an inconspicuous area, then spray the affected area liberally., Once you’ve saturated the area with an alcohol-based cleaner, rub it down with a dry cloth. You should start to see some of the pigment transfer from the fabric to the cloth. If necessary (such as for thick layers of paint), repeat spraying and rubbing the area.If you’re dealing with carpet or upholstery, keep spraying and rubbing until you’ve removed the stain and dried the fabric.  If you’re dealing with an article of clothing, you can machine wash it once you’ve started to break down the paint’s bonds. Check the garment’s label to ensure it’s marked safe for machine washing. Apply a pre-wash stain remover, and run it through the washing machine on a cool setting.Be sure to use a cool setting, since warm or hot water will set the stain. If a stain still remains, let the garment air dry, then repeat the spraying, rubbing, and washing process. If repeating the process doesn’t work, take the garment to your professional dry cleaner.	Flush away excess wet paint. Spray the stain with hairspray. Rub the stain with a dry cloth. Run the item in the washing machine on a cool setting.
If your laundry is in a giant pile, it’s a good idea to check each item as you sort it. This gives you a chance to make sure that a red sock doesn’t end up coloring your beautiful whites and see if articles have special laundering instructions.   Make sure to read the care instructions on each article of clothing the first time you wash it. Look at it again during the sorting process in case you forgot the care instructions or to see if you can put the item with other articles. Consider checking each item you’ve sorted as you put it into the washing machine to prevent mishaps.; , The first category by which you should sort is color of the items. This can prevent dye transfer problems during washing that often ruin or damage white or lighter colored clothing.Make piles for white, light, and dark clothing.Your white pile should be for articles like socks, underwear, t-shirts and other sturdy white cotton items. The light-colored pile should have colors like pink, lavender, light blue, light green, and yellow. Finally, your dark pile should have gray, black, navy, red, and purple articles. Consider separating out denim into its own pile. You can either wash this as an individual load or together with your dark pile.  Chances are that you have items made of different fabrics and textures. Sorting these out after you’ve put the articles in color piles can ensure everything from the quality of your delicates to preventing lint from sticking to certain fabrics.It can also help the drying process go more quickly and evenly.Put any delicates in piles by color. Delicates are items such as lingerie, pantyhose, washable silks and anything that you want to keep from harsh agitation in the washing machine.Segregate items that are “lint-givers” and “lint-receivers.” For example, you shouldn’t put towels with corduroy articles.Consider sorting out synthetics and natural fibers if you want to run another separate washing cycle. This can further prevent lint transfer.Separate out lighter and heavier weight clothing items. For example, you don’t want to have heavier cotton pants with thin t-shirts. The heavier fabric can damage lighter and more delicate articles by scratching during washing., If you have articles that are very soiled or stained, consider assigning them to a separate pile altogether. These items may require pre-treating stains or washing on a specialty cycle that is too harsh for other articles. In addition, it prevents soils or stains from redepositing on less dirty articles.Pretreat any stains or soils with a stain remover before putting it in washing machine. This can prevent further transfer or redepositing of stains.  If you’re committed to washing your clothing and other articles in the most effective way, you may want to consider creating sub-categories as separate cycles. For example, items like towels and bedding are often heavier than articles of clothing while newborn or baby clothes are light colors. Creating these type of sub-categories can further protect your clothing and other articles from damage., Although it might sound like a lot of work, sorting doesn’t have to be. Consider sorting a part of your regular laundry routine. Depending on how often you do laundry, you can either sort as you put them into a hamper or do it immediately before you throw items in the washing machine.   Presort laundry as you throw it into the hamper if you do multiple loads per week. If you only do one or two loads per week or are just one person, it may be easier and more time efficient to sort before putting the clothes into your washing machine., If you do multiple loads of laundry a week or want to make loading different types of articles easier, get a laundry sorter at a local home store. This can speed up and simply the sorting and washing process.Figure out exactly what how many categories of laundry you are doing before you purchase a laundry sorter. For example, you might want a sorter with different sections for whites, lights, and darks. Purchase your sorter or divided hamper at a local home store. Get a sorter that has as many compartments as you need. Most stores will have options with anywhere from two sections to six or seven.  If you don’t want to spend money on a laundry sorter or divided hamper, you can fashion one by using items around your home. Homemade sorters are as effective as store bought products in easier the process of doing laundry.   Use items you have around the house such as boxes, shopping bags, or bins as hampers. Have one for each load of separate laundry you plan to wash. Purchase individual hampers at a local home store. You can set these on the floor of your laundry room with an individual label for each hamper. Another option is to purchase separate hampers in white, a light shade, and a dark color. You may also want to have a “right away” hamper for items that need immediate attention.These can guide you and your family members know exactly what items go in which hamper. Consider giving each family member a hamper for the person’s room. Although this doesn’t necessarily sort by color, fabric, or dirtiness, it can streamline your sorting process. You may want to give each person a color-coded hamper to further ease your sorting efforts.  If you wash delicates and socks, invest in lingerie bags for each family member’s delicates and/ or socks. This can protect your delicates and keep pairs of socks from getting mismatched or lost.Make sure to keep socks and delicates in individual bags since they are often different colors and fabric weights. Try using zippered pillowcases for delicates and socks if you don’t want to invest in lingerie bags.Pin together pairs of socks as you sort them. Buy lingerie bags made of a simple mesh. Make sure the mesh openings don’t allow any articles to escape while washing. You can purchase these bags at most home and grocery stores.  If you have smaller loads of laundry that need washing immediately, consider combing multiple loads into one. Washing compatible clothing types can reduce the work you have to do and save energy, water, and detergent.   Check the two loads and make sure they’re compatible. For example, you wouldn’t want to wash delicates and jeans. However, you could wash jeans with darker towels since they are both heavier fabrics. Remove any articles that are different fabric or require different laundering. For example, if you have jeans mixed in with dark colors, remove any t-shirts or lighter items from a load of jeans and dark towels.	Check each item. Separate by color. Sort by fabric weight. Assign very soiled clothes to another pile. Create sub-categories. Strategize your sorting. Invest in a laundry sorter. Make your own laundry sorter. Use lingerie bags. Combine loads whenever possible.

If the tool is part of a larger machine, such as a table saw, disassemble your unit. Wash all of the tools or parts to be treated for rust in a mixture of grease-cutting dish detergent and warm water to remove the oils and dirt., You can use a plastic container, pot, or tub, as long as it’s large enough to submerge the tools. Choose a container that you can set aside for one to three days., White vinegar is acidic, so it will cut through the rust, making it easier to remove. While the amount of white vinegar will vary depending on how many tools you are cleaning and how big they are, track how much you add to the container so that you can properly measure your salt., You should add roughly ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of salt for each quart (1 liter) of vinegar. The salt will increase the acidity of the vinegar so that the solution dissolves the rust quicker. Spread the salt evenly over the vinegar soak., The vinegar and salt need time to break down the rust so that it can be scrubbed from the tools. The longer you allow your tools to remain in the vinegar, the easier it will be to remove the rust.Place the container in a secure location so that children and animals won’t get into it. For example, you could lock it in your garage or shed.  After you remove the tools from the vinegar solution, vigorously rub your tools to buff away the rust. Continue to scrub the tools until they are completely free of rust.   If the rust is thick, use a metal bristle brush., Pour out the vinegar solution and wash out the tub. Fill the tub with enough clean water to match the amount of vinegar solution that you’d used., The baking soda will neutralize the acid from the vinegar so that it doesn’t remain on your tools. Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda for each quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the baking soda into the water to create a solution., Make sure that your tools are submerged in the baking soda solution. Allow the tools to soak for ten minutes before removing them. Dry them well with a clean towel., Use 0000 steel wool to buff the tools and remove any remaining spots. Your tools should be free of rust., Apply denatured alcohol to a clean cloth and rub it onto the tools. The alcohol will help you make sure that no water remains on your tools. Water could cause more rust.Polish the tool with camellia oil to prevent more rust.	Prepare your tools for treatment. Place your tools in a large container. Cover the tools with white vinegar. Add salt to the white vinegar. Allow your tools to soak for one to three days. Scrub the tools with a scouring pad. Rinse out the container and fill it with clean water. Add baking soda to the water. Place the tools in the water. Scrub the tools with steel wool. Wipe the tools with denatured alcohol.
Each state has an Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) board. You will have to work with your board to get approved for a liquor license. Many states also have local ABC boards, which also must give you approval before you can operate in the locality.To find your state’s board, search online. Type “your state” and “beverage control” into your favorite search engine. Your state board should have a website. The state board may also have links to each county or local ABC board.  States offer a variety of licenses. For example, Texas alone offers over 70 permits or licenses. You should visit your state’s ABC website to find out what license you want. For example, you might want one of the following in order to sell to restaurants:   Distributor’s license. You can sell alcoholic beverages in the unbroken original packages to retailers and private clubs.Salesperson permit. This permit allows you to take orders from wholesalers and retailers.Wholesaler’s permit. Allows you to import alcohol and then sell it to retailers and wholesalers., You might be confused and not know which license to get. In that case, you should meet with ABC staff to discuss your options. Look for a phone number or an email address and contact the ABC board with any questions that you have.  Each state sets its own requirements for obtaining a license. The requirements could be extensive, depending on the license. For example, in Florida, you must have the following in order to get a distributor’s license:You must have a warehouse to store your alcoholic beverage, and you must store a certain amount of your beverage in the warehouse. You need to keep an inventory of all alcoholic beverages and have a certain amount in storage. You must sell to licensed vendors generally instead of only to a few.  You can get a paper application from your state or local ABC board. You might also be able to download the application from the ABC board’s website. If so, you can enter your information directly into the PDF forms, which makes for a neat presentation.   In some states, such as Massachusetts, you can apply for all licenses and permits online., You will have to submit supporting documents along with your application. The exact documents you need will depend on the type of license you want and your state. For example, if you apply for a salesperson license in Massachusetts, you will need to supply the following documents:proof of residency, such as a driver’s license or a state-issued ID card certificate of employment  , Provide all information requested. If you don’t know how to answer a question, then contact your ABC board and ask. Enter information using a typewriter, if available. When you finish your application, make a copy for your records.   Remember to pay your fee. The amount will depend on the type of license you get. Make sure to include the check or money order with your application. Submit the application to the address provided. In some states, you will need to submit it to your local board first for approval. In other states, you will submit it directly to your state board.  You may need to meet with the ABC board to go over your application or to provide additional information.Be sure to take a copy of your application with you and arrive on time. ABC board staff are usually busy and overworked, so be prepared.   Generally, you can’t start acting as a distributor or salesperson until your application is approved. However, some states might let you get a temporary license so long as nothing on the face of your application disqualifies you.	Find your state’s board. Identify the license you want. Meet with ABC staff. Find out requirements. Pick up an application. Gather required documents. Submit your application. Meet with the ABC board.
Rinse the citrus peel under running water and scrub the outside with a vegetable brush to remove dirt and impurities. Pat the peels dry with a clean towel, and carefully chop the peels into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes. The pieces have to be small enough to fit into the opening of a pop bottle.   You can use a variety or mixture of citrus peels to make your homemade enzyme cleaner, including lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange. It’s important to use fresh citrus peels that aren't dried out or rotting. Dried peels won’t contain enough citrus oil for cleaning, and rotten ones will cause the mixture to mold.; , Insert a wide-mouthed funnel into the mouth of a clean 2-liter (67.6-ounce) pop bottle. Pour the citrus peel chunks in a handful at a time until they’ve all been added to the bottle. Add the sugar, yeast, and water. Remove the funnel and screw the cap on tightly. Shake the bottle vigorously for a few minutes, until all the sugar is dissolved.Its important to use a pop bottle for this recipe, because they're designed to hold liquids that are under pressure.  After the sugar has dissolved, unscrew the cap to vent any pressure that’s built up inside the bottle. Screw the cap back on. Repeat this process at least three times a day for two weeks to prevent the bottle from exploding.   After two weeks, reduce the venting to once a day, as most of the sugar will have been converted, so less carbon dioxide will be produced.As the yeast eats the sugar in the mixture, it will convert the sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide. This gas will build up in the bottle when the lid is on. It’s important to leave the cap on and tight during this process, because the yeast needs an oxygen-free environment to ferment properly. Oxygen will also allow bacteria and mold to grow in the mixture.  The optimum temperature for yeast fermentation is 95 F (35 C), so you have to keep the mixture somewhere warm while it ferments.A good place for the mixture is on top of a refrigerator.   The yeast will take about two weeks to ferment, but you can leave the cleaning mixture for up to three months for a stronger solution.  Over time, the solids in the mixture will sink to the bottom. Every day, vent the gasses, screw the lid back on, and shake the mixture gently to stir up the contents. Vent the gas again before screwing the lid back on.Continue swirling daily until you decide that the mixture is ready.  After two weeks, the mixture will become opaque, and this means it’s ready to use and strain. You can also leave the mixture for another two and a half months if you have the time and want a stronger cleaner. When the mixture has fermented for long enough, pour it through a strainer and into a bowl to remove the solids.   Discard the citrus peels once they’ve been strained.  Transfer the strained cleaning liquid to an airtight container for storage. Exposing the mixture to oxygen will cause it to lose its potency, and it won’t clean as effectively.To make ready-to-use cleaner, store small amounts of the cleaner in a spray bottle and keep the rest in an airtight container.  In a spray bottle or other container, mix one part enzyme cleaner with 20 parts water. Shake or stir to combine. This mixture can be used to wash cars, wash floors, and for other jobs around the house that don’t require a super-powered cleaner., Measure ½ cup (118 ml) of enzyme cleaner and transfer it to a clean spray bottle. Mix in 4¼ cups (1 L) of water. Screw on the spray nozzle and shake the mixture to combine the water and cleaner. Shake before each use.   This all-purpose cleaner can be used on all surfaces to clean bathrooms, carpets, kitchens, for minor stains, and other cleaning needs., For a stronger all-purpose cleaner, mix one part apple cider vinegar with four parts homemade enzyme cleaner. Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle and use to clean kitchens, bathrooms, and tough stains., For tough stains, caked on grime, odors, and built-up dirt, apply the homemade enzyme cleaner directly to the affected surface. Let the cleaner sit for a couple minutes, and then wipe the area with a damp sponge or cloth.   Enzyme cleaners are great for cutting grease, and this cleaner can be used undiluted around the kitchen and the garage. You can also try this method for removing scale and lime buildup on things like dishwashers, kettles, shower heads, and other appliances and fixtures., You can use the enzyme cleaner as a replacement for laundry soap or as a booster that you add to your regular detergent. Add ¼ cup (59 ml) of enzyme cleaner to your washing machine drum or detergent compartment. Set and run your washing machine as normal.	Wash and chop the citrus peel. Combine the ingredients. Vent the gas multiple times a day. Place the bottle somewhere warm to ferment. Shake daily while the mixture ferments. Strain the mixture. Store in an airtight container. Mix a diluted cleaner for delicate jobs. Make an all-purpose cleaner. Mix with vinegar for an even stronger cleaner. Use the cleaner undiluted for tough jobs. Wash laundry with it.
An idea is only as good as your ability to bring it to fruition. From the moment you get your first ideas for your side business, you need to realistically assess what you're capable of doing yourself so you know what kind of help you'll need.If you haven't yet decided what you want to do, or if you have several ideas in mind, knowing your own strengths can help you choose the right one for you. For example, if you enjoy working with kids, you might consider offering a babysitting or tutoring service. One of the benefits of this side business is that you can do it with little to no monetary investment, and it typically won't conflict in any way with your day job. Identifying your strengths is only half of the picture. You also need to brainstorm any possible problems or difficulties you might have with a particular side business. For example, you may have an extra room that you're thinking about renting out to tourists or business guests in your town. However, if you have a strong desire for privacy or if you are an introverted person who needs ample time alone to recharge, this might not be the best fit for you.; , Many side businesses don't require a lot to start, while others will demand a substantial investment. When calculating your start-up costs, you also need to assume your side business isn't going to turn any profits for the first few months.Consider whether you'll need to lease office or retail space, or whether you can operate your business from your home. If you're thinking of running your side business out of your home (whether long-term or just at first), you need to check the zoning regulations in your city or county and make sure home-based businesses are permitted. This may be a problem particularly if you plan to invite customers or clients into your home on a regular basis. If you need to lease space, you'll need to factor that into your start-up costs, along with any expenditures you'll want to make for starting inventory, supplies, and advertising. As you plan your budget and evaluate start-up costs, it's often a good idea to go ahead and create a full-scale business plan. This step is especially important if you anticipate you'll need a loan to cover some or all of your start-up expenses.  Starting a side business can be trickier if you also need to raise money to cover start-up costs. Work on a business plan so you can figure out how much you'll need to start as well as how you'll handle growth.If you intend to grow your side business to the point that you can one day quit your day job, you also want to look at the potential costs associated with scaling your business as it grows. For example, you may plan to start your business in your house, then lease office space once your client base grows to the point that you need to hire one or more full-time office employees. In that case, the cost to lease an office as well as the salary for an employee would need to be figured into your budget. If your idea is more along the lines of a small home-based side business and you only need a few thousand dollars to start, you might consider crowd-sourcing your start-up on the internet, or asking close friends or family members for a small loan. Seek advice from a professional before you take more drastic measures such as taking out a second mortgage on your house or cashing in a retirement account. There may be significant tax consequences that you didn't take into account that could change your decision.  Once you start a side job, you'll have little if any time to devote to other activities. Make a list of everything in which you're currently involved and understand how you spend your time so you'll have a better idea of how you can fit your side business into your normal routine.Include the frequency of events so you can make a better decision on whether you'll have to get rid of activities or whether you can fit them in even with a side business. The easiest activities to eliminate will be the ones in which you have the least amount of involvement or responsibility. You may want to keep activities for which you have a significant amount of involvement, or which are relatively prestigious positions for you to have. For example, you might want to eliminate a community organization if you only participate sporadically, but keep the group in which you've just been elected treasurer. Write down exactly how much time these activities take each day or each week, and be honest. A community organization that only meets once a month for an hour may be a different sort of commitment if you're expected to make a presentation at each of those monthly meetings that takes you approximately four hours to prepare. Making an inventory of the way you spend your time will help you understand how much time you can make available each week to devote to your side business. This in turn can also help you narrow down a list of possible options so you choose the side business that best fits your schedule and the level of commitment you can realistically make.  Before you take any concrete steps to start your side business, take a look at your employee handbook and any contracts or other documents you signed when you started your day job to make sure there are no conflicts.In the strictest situation, you may have signed a non-compete agreement that forbids you from opening a side business that would compete with your employer. Understand that "competition" can be construed fairly broadly by your employer, and may include businesses you think bear no direct relation to your job or your employer's business. This could turn into a legal issue. Many employers frown upon employees starting side businesses, mainly because they fear divided loyalties and divided attention during the workday. If your employer falls into this category and you want to start a business, you need to be certain that your work won't suffer as a result. In many situations, your immediate supervisor will have a lot of discretion, and may not want employees to start side businesses for personal reasons – whether because of a previous bad experience or because they value loyalty above all else.  If you had to sign any non-compete or similar agreements as a condition of your employment, an attorney can help you understand if your business idea conflicts in any way with your employer's interests.Many courts don't look upon non-compete agreements favorably, so even if you signed a fairly strict agreement you may be able to get out of it. An attorney would be able to assess the chances of this in your jurisdiction. You may want to enter into additional agreements with your employer to protect their interests and reaffirm your commitment to them. This is especially important if you hold a relatively high-ranking position at work. If you have any serious questions about how your side business will affect your day job, or if you fear you'll get fired if you start a side business, get legal advice as soon as possible so you can make an informed decision and be adequately prepared.  Even if you know you're in the clear, and that your business doesn't violate any of your employer's policies or any of the agreements you signed, there are still good reasons not to tell your boss about it.Some employers may question your commitment to your job, despite your assurances that your side business won't interfere with your workday duties. Particularly if your side business overlaps with your job (or with your employer's business), you need to be prepared to explain how you won't take clients or business from your employer, or use your day job as a way to gain an unfair advantage. In some cases there's really no point in mentioning your side business to your employer at all, particularly if you don't intend to build it up beyond a side gig and it has nothing to do with your employer's products or services. For example, if you've decided to sign up with a ride-sharing company and provide transportation for people during your off-hours, there's typically no reason this would interfere with your day job – unless perhaps you work as a taxi driver.  To successfully run a side business while employed elsewhere, make sure you keep the two absolutely separate. Don't use any of your employer's supplies or time for your side business.This means you shouldn't take phone calls or answer emails related to your side business while you're on the clock at your day job. This time division can get tricky if you're paid salary and frequently take work home from your day job, but at least try to avoid dealing with side-gig business while you're physically in the office. Don't use supplies from your employer for anything related to your side business either. This means if you have a computer provided by your employer for work, you should leave anything related to your side business off of it, including checking emails or drafting documents. Don't provide clients or customers of your side business with your work phone number, and if you have a mobile phone provided by your employer, avoid using it for anything related to your side business as well. In most cases, you also should avoid discussing your side business with clients or co-workers during business hours – even if your side business is entirely unrelated to your employer's business. You don't want your employer to get the impression that you're simply using your day job to market and promote your start-up.  How you prioritize your day job depends on what you want to do with your side business. If you don't envision using your side business for anything more than supplemental income, take steps to ensure it won't interfere with your primary source of income.Side businesses such as ride sharing, renting out a room in your house, babysitting, or selling goods online typically won't interfere with your day job at all. They also probably won't grow to the point that you would consider quitting your day job and devoting all of your time to them. However, suppose you've always been interested in photography and want to start a side business offering your services as a photographer for weddings and other special events. Depending on your work schedule, this could potentially interfere with your day job – and your day job also could interfere with your side business. For example, you might get offered a well-paid and prestigious photography gig to shoot an event that takes place at a date and time when you're scheduled to work. Knowing your goals for your side business enables you to prioritize your side business and your day job more easily. If you intend to grow your side business to the point that you can quit your day job, you might take a day off work so you can shoot the event. However, if you need the stability of your day job and its benefits more, you'd probably want to turn the event down.  Even if you're just starting a side business that you don't think will ever grow large enough for you to quit your main job, you still need to treat it as a serious business and follow the necessary formalities to keep it separate from your personal income and assets. In the United States and many other countries, you have the option of organizing your side business as a corporation, a limited liability company (LLC), or a sole proprietorship.Generally, a corporation is going to be too complex and expensive for a side business, especially at first. You might consider incorporating later on, if you plan to grow your business, but during the start-up phase it typically will be too much unless you're anticipating seeking capital from investors. An LLC will work well for you if you want to gradually grow and build your business, because it will enable you to create more separation between your business and your personal income and assets. You also may want to start an LLC if you own a home or other significant assets that you don't want to be vulnerable to business debts or losses. If you're just starting a basic side gig for a little extra money, such as babysitting, odd jobs, or ride sharing, you should be fine running your business as a sole proprietorship. You won't be seeking outside financing or investment, and your expenses will be minimal.  Once you've decided how you want to structure your side business, choose an official name for the business. Depending on where you live, you may need to register this name with a government authority.Registration of your name is important to ensure that businesses have unique names that won't be confused with each other by potential consumers. You need to wait until after you've chosen your business structure to finalize your name, since you may have to put an abbreviation after your name to symbolize that structure. For example, if you decide to create an LLC for your photography business, you may decide to name it "Pholly Photos," but if you've organized your business as an LLC the official name would have to be "Pholly Photos, LLC." You'll have to pay a small fee to register your business name in most cases, typically less than $100. Once you've registered it, it's yours – it doesn't mean you have to start your business right away. You may need to renew your registration each year.  If you're starting your side business in the US, you need to apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for your business from the IRS, even if you don't plan on having any employees. You typically need a separate tax ID for your business in most countries if you want to keep your side business legal and above-board.For example, to get an EIN from the IRS, all you have to do is visit the IRS's website at irs.gov and answer a few questions to apply for the number. If you do this online, your unique number will be generated immediately. There is no fee to apply for an EIN. Once you have your EIN, you'll be able to set up a bank account for your business, as well as file taxes. Make sure you register for taxes with your state or national government as necessary after you've obtained your tax number. If you're operating your business as a sole proprietorship in the United States, you don't technically need an EIN for the business – you can file taxes for your business along with your personal taxes. However, you may want one if you want to open a bank account for your business, or if you don't want your Social Security number to appear on business documents.  All of your business transactions should be done apart from your own personal finances, which means at the very least you'll need to set up a separate bank account for your side business.In some situations this may not be strictly necessary. For example, if you're simply joining a ride-sharing service as an independent contractor, it may be fine to use your personal bank account. Use your own judgement when deciding whether to open a separate business account, and err on the side of caution. Even with a smaller side business, it's typically easier at tax time if you have everything separated. You definitely want to open a business bank account if you plan to seek outside investment, or if you want to open a business credit card to cover small expenses.  The licenses and permits you'll need to legally operate your side business can vary widely depending on where you live and what sort of products or services you're offering to the public.Check with your local small business association or agency to find out what kinds of licenses and permits you need. They typically have a website online that provides this information. In the United States, you can find a lot of information relevant to small businesses in all 50 states by visiting the website of the federal Small Business Association (SBA) at www.sba.gov. Click on the "Starting & Managing" tab to find information specific to starting a business in the United States. For example, some states require specific permits if you want to rent out a room in your house to tourists or other travelers on a regular basis. You also may be required to get a permit if you want to operate a business out of your home.  Depending on how you've structured your side business and how it operates, it may be in your best interests to have a professional handling your bookkeeping and preparing the tax returns for the business.Know your own limits and the amount of transactions you can comfortably handle on your own. You definitely want an accountant if you're seeking outside investment, making long-term purchases, or planning to hire several employees. If you just have a simple home-based business for which you are the only employee, you typically can get by with doing the accounting yourself using web-based accounting software. Link it up to your business bank account and it will auto-populate your transactions for you.  If you want to get your side business off the ground, you need customers. Think about your target customers and what makes your product or service unique. Then you can focus on how to reach those customers with your message.Traditional advertising, such as television spots, magazine or newspaper ads, and billboards can be expensive – especially for start-ups – and likely won't generate the interest you want. Instead of going the traditional route, look to build word of mouth about your side business, starting online. You can set up basic social media accounts for your business for free. Once you have your social media accounts and website up and running, keep them active to build the buzz about your business. Don't just make them promotion machines – you also want to share information and articles that are likely of interest to your target customers. Build relationships with people online by interacting with them and responding to comments or complaints in a timely fashion. You also might consider offering a referral bonus for customers who recommend your product or service to friends and family.	Identify your strengths. Budget your start-up costs. Assess your resources. Be realistic about your schedule. Review your employer's policies. Consult an attorney. Consider whether to disclose your business to your employer. Build a firewall between your day job and your side business. Evaluate your goals. Create a formal business structure. Choose a business name. Get a tax ID number. Set up your business finances. Get all required licenses and permits. Hire an accountant or tax professional. Plan your marketing strategy.

There are a litany of organizations available you can join or donate to that are dedicated to reducing cruelty towards animals worldwide. Do some research and find which organization appeals to your views.   The Humane Society of America is one of the world's largest animal advocacy organizations. They target puppy mills, animal fighting, factory farming, seal slaughter, horse cruelty, and the slaughterhouse trade. The organization works through both large-scale political initiatives and hands-on efforts to rescue and care for unwanted animals.The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is another one of the better known animal advocacy organizations. Much like the Humane Society of America, they oppose most forms of cruelty like slaughterhouses and puppy mills and also help curb animal population by encouraging spaying and neutering of house pets. They also encourage the development of no-kill shelters and provide practical assistance such as transporting adopted animals to new homes.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a well-known but somewhat controversial animal rights organization. PETA focuses primarily on factory farms, the clothing trade, laboratory testing of animals, and use of animals in the entertainment industry. PETA often conducts investigations of companies and labs and encourages direct political action in the form of protests, petitioning, and boycotts.PETA, however, has met criticism for being more dedicated to publicity stunts than actually reducing cruelty to animals. In 2013, allegations surfaced that PETA had euthanized many of the rescued animals at their Virginia headquarters.You can also find a local animal shelter in your area and volunteer there.  If no existing organization appeals to you personally, you can always start a neighborhood watch in your area. Invite your friends and neighbors to get to know the animals in your area and keep an eye out for suspicious behavior.   Be aware of the animals in your area. By being vigilant, and encouraging others to do the same, you'll be likely to notice potential problems, such as a formerly friendly dog suddenly becoming aggressive or skittish around people.There are many signs of animal abuse. Physical signs include collars that are too tight, open wounds or signs of recently healed wounds, fur infested with fleas or ticks, patches of missing skin or rashes, and extreme thinness. Pay attention to the animal's environment. Are they tied up alone frequently? Are they kept outside despite poor weather conditions, like intense heat or cold? Is an animal kept in a small kennel, or one crowded with many other animals, for extended periods? Encourage all members of your watch to stay vigilant, and if you notice any of the above signs of cruelty report it to your group and decide as a group how to proceed.  Animal cruelty is a crime, and if you see abuse happening do not hesitate to report it to the proper authorities.   Where to report cruelty depends on your state. Contacting the local humane society is a good first step, as the workers there usually know what law agency to contact. You can also visit a local police station and ask for help.When you know who to contact, provide concise written statements that includes the dates of the incident or incidents, and any other witnesses besides yourself. If possible, get photographic evidence of the abuse., One of the most important things you can do to endorse animal welfare is being a model for friends, family members, and co-workers.   Share your views. Do not be shy about explaining your opinions on animal cruelty and welfare. Many people are not informed about the conditions of slaughterhouses, animal testing facilities, and puppy mills. If animals come up in conversation, take this as an opportunity to keep others informed. Use social media to your advantage. Post lists of animal-based ingredients hidden in many products, links to petitions to end animal testing, and local listings from your animal shelter of dogs at-risk for euthanasia. If you have kids, talk to them about treating animals with kindness and respect. Young children often do not differentiate between a living dog and a plush dog. Explain to them animals have feelings and thoughts similar to our own, and need to be treated with compassion and care.	Join or donate to anti-animal cruelty organizations. Start a neighborhood watch. Report animal cruelty. Be a model for others.
There are various waterless car cleaners on the market. Take a look at critical and user reviews for different brands. Relate customer experiences and choose the brand that you trust the most. Waterless car cleaners can be purchased at some department stores, most major automotive retailers, and online.   Some popular brands of waterless car wash include, Meguiar’s Wash & Wax Anywhere, WOW Classic & Sports Box Kit, and Eco Touch Waterless Car Wash.Some car washes like Eco Touch Waterless Car Wash use eco-friendly or biodegradable ingredients that aren't harmful to the environment.; , Soak a microfiber tower with a cleaning solution produced specifically to clean cars. Waterless cleaning solutions allow you to wash your car with minimal or no water. Make sure that cloth is completely saturated before beginning to clean your car.   Microfiber cloth is non-abrasive and works better than regular rags at cleaning your car and preserving its paint.Do not use a household soap or dish detergent because it could strip the protective wax from your car., Fill a spray bottle or use one that comes with your product to moisten a small section of the car that you want to clean. You should only need three to four sprays for this. Do not spray over the entirety of the car because the solution could dry before you get to wipe it. Work in small concentrated sections of the car before moving onto another section.   Get a car cleaning solution that helps break down dirt rather than moving it., Take the cloth saturated with your cleaning solution and work it into the surface of the car.You should start to see the solution start to sud or streak across where you are wiping. Go over each area for around 10-30 seconds.   Start in small areas and move around the car. For example, you can start on the hood of the car then move your way to the passenger side door.  Place your microfiber cloth in a bucket filled with a cup of water, or run it under your sink for five seconds. Once it's saturated, go over the areas that you scrubbed with your cleaning solution. Continue to do this until the remainder of the solution is off your car, and there is no leftover residue or fogginess., Once the area is rinsed, work the area in a circular motion with a dry microfiber cloth. Once you're done drying it, the area that you've cleaned should look shiny and reflective. Make sure that you dry each section thoroughly so that you aren't leaving any chemicals behind on your paint.   As an alternative, you can also use a squeegee to help dry areas of your car., Repeat the process and move to different portions of your car until the entirety of the car is clean. During this process, you may have to use a lot of microfiber cloth, so make sure to be as conservative as possible and reuse them when you can.	Purchase a waterless car cleaner. Dampen a microfiber towel with a waterless car cleaning solution. Spray your car with the same cleaning solution. Wipe your car in a circular motion with your cloth. Rinse off the cleaning solution with a damp microfiber cloth. Dry the area with a dry microfiber cloth. Repeat until your car is completely clean.
Mix 3 parts of baking soda to 1 part water to make a thick paste. This versatile cleaner will work with all colors of grout, but vinegar can be harmful to some natural stones such as marble or limestone.   Apply the paste to the grout lines with your finger. Although the baking soda isn’t harmful, wearing rubber gloves can help prevent scratches or irritated skin from the abrasive grout and baking soda.; , Spray the baking soda paste you applied with the vinegar solution. You should immediately see bubbling which lets you know the natural cleaning process has begun.  The bubbling action is a chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar. The reaction generally lasts a few minutes. After the bubbling has stopped the chemical cleaning action is done.  Use a nylon bristled scrub brush, or a toothbrush, to scrub along each grout line. Pay close attention to corners and edges to make these areas clean as well., Use a mop and plain water to remove the baking soda and vinegar residues. Rinse your mop and change the water often during the cleaning process so you do not continue to spread the residue around the floor.	Make a paste of baking soda and water. Make a 1:1 solution of white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Wait for the solution to stop bubbling. Scrub the grout lines with a brush. Mop the floor with plain water.
, Gently scoop solid debris from the rug using a spoon, but take care not to scrape the fibers of the rug. Any scraping motion may tear the silk fibers.    Absorb as much liquid as possible by pressing the affected areas gently with a clean, white cloth.       Apply club soda to remove color from stains. Pour the club soda onto a clean cloth and blot the stain. Use a dry cloth to absorb any excess club soda. Allow the area to air dry. Do not use heat, such as a hair dryer, to dry the area because heat may damage a silk rug.       Apply a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water to remove stains. Pour the vinegar and water solution on a clean cloth and blot the stain. Use a dry cloth to absorb the excess solution and allow the area to air dry. Do not use heat to dry the area.       Avoid commercial cleaning agents, which may permanently discolor a silk rug.	Cleans stains immediately before they set in and attach to the silk fibers.  , Remove solid spills. Remove liquid spills.
Shoes are very susceptible to salt stains, especially in the winter when salt is everywhere. A protectant spray is necessary to keep your shoes resistant to salt stains.You can buy a protectant spray online or at a local shoe store. You should spray the protectant spray 8 to 12 inches away from the shoe. Add two coats. Check the label to make sure the spray is safe to use on your specific shoe type.  In months where streets are being salted, water damage is also a major concern. Take steps to waterproof your shoes to keep them safe. A waterproof spray can help create a protective layer that will minimize water damage over the colder month.Choose a spray that's safe to use on your specific type of shoe. It should say somewhere on the bottle which materials a spray works for. Make sure to read and follow the instructions of any water proof spray carefully. You usually spray it on in a similar fashion to which you would spray on a protectant spray.  The longer you let stains sit, the worse they will be. If you notice a salt stain on your shoe, treat it right away. Putting off treating a stain can cause permanent damage to your shoes.	Use a stain protectant spray. Waterproof your shoes. Treat stains immediately.
Use a tape measure to get the height and width measurements of the space on the wall where you will hang or mount your mirror. Mirrors in the store will often look smaller than they do when you get them home and into your bathroom.   Keep the mirror from 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) from the ceiling. The mirror should not be taller than your vanity. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of wall space on each side of the mirror as well.; , Depending on the size and simplicity, the cost of a bathroom mirror can range from under $50 to over $1,000.   Set a budget before shopping so you know how much you can spend on the mirror. If you are buying a mirror just to update the space, decide on a range or a specific dollar amount that you will not go over. Cut your budget in other places if you are remodeling the whole bathroom and you find an expensive mirror that you love. Reduce the amount you plan to spend on paint, lighting, or other fixtures to accommodate your mirror budget.    Create a custom frame using a designer at a frame shop or specialty store. You can select separate glass and frame details to create a unique look to the full mirror. Choose a mirror without a frame if you prefer. Bathroom mirrors can be unframed, with only the mirrored glass to hang. Purchase a mirror with the frame already built around it. The frames can be constructed of wood, metal, glass or other materials. Choose something that matches your bathroom décor. If you are looking for a small, framed mirror that will mainly be used for shaving or applying makeup, you can purchase a mirror with extendable arms. It can be pushed against the wall to be out of the way, and pulled out into the position of your preference.  Buy a simple mirror if you want it only to provide a reflection as you use your bathroom. If you want a mirror that does more, consider those that allow for storage, additional lighting, even a built-in television that reflects its picture on the mirror.  This will keep the entire bathroom looking uniform and organized.   Adopt a current trend by selecting circular, unframed and beveled mirrors. This style will work well in a modern, updated bathroom that has neutral colors and polished brass or steel fixtures. Use a wood or metal finish on your mirror and frame that coordinates with what you already have in your bathroom. If other parts of the bathroom are a light wood or a deep cherry color, match that with the mirror frame. If you have wallpaper, consider a painted frame that matches the pattern.  If you plan to keep your mirror on the wall for a long as you are in the home, use permanent installation, such as glue or liquid nails. Use wire or mirror brackets if you plan to change the mirror or move in the near future. The hardware is less expensive, and much easier to install and take down.  Check out hardware stores, bathroom design showrooms, online retailers and home and garden magazines.   Read product reviews, and talk to design professionals and sales associates in stores. Ask about return policies and warranties. If you get the mirror home and into your bathroom and you hate it, or it breaks before you get it installed, you will want to be able to exchange it for something else.	Measure the space you have for your mirror. Determine your budget. Consider what kind of frame you would like. Remember the mirror's purpose or function. Keep the style and shape of your mirror consistent with the bathroom décor. Decide on a mounting style. Before you buy, shop around.

There are three ways to go here. Either cut straight back into the hillside, and use retaining walls behind the structure to hold the earth back. Or put retaining walls around the lower side of the site, and build up with fill. You will be ordering at least a truckload of dirt here (not that costly, under a $100), and once it's in, it will need a month or so to properly settle. Usually heavy rains will do the trick. The last option is to split the difference - choose a final grade midway between the low and high elevation of the slope. You will need a lot of retaining wall here, both around the low side of the structure, as well as behind it to hold back where you cut out. But with this option you will not be paying for dirt nor waiting for it to settle, and only digging half as much back into the slope.; , Grading is hard work and it's easy to get overheated. A tarp of this size will need nailed down or heavy objects laid across the top to keep it from flying off in the wind. Merely tying it down along the edges will cause the grommets to rip out.  The key low-tech tool here is the spading fork. It's like a mini-pitchfork (about $15). Lunge at the root-base of the sod, pry around, and yank. Heap all the sod up into a wheelbarrow, and cart it off to any barren spot on your land. Even if the sod doesn't establish itself (it will need heavy watering in the beginning to do so), it will at least help rebuild the soil.  Mark where the final grade will be with masking tape.  Use a heavy-duty pick/mattock - the heaviest pick you can comfortably swing down with from above your head. Use the mattock end to break up the soil. At the end of your stroke you can pull the dirt towards you and up out of where you're digging. There's a lot of technique to swinging a pick. With the right stroke you can 'pop' quite a large hunk of soil loose. Any rocks you encounter can be used in your foundation. Try swinging the pick from the side and other motions to use different muscle groups.  Shovel the dirt into a wheelbarrow and dump and tamp it using a hand tamper ($20). If you're simply trying to build the grade on the low side, not much tamping is necessary. A good heavy rain will settle your fill. Final tamping will be done after the grade is level and raked out.  The retaining wall can double as a stem wall.  Lay boards across your grade with a 4' to 6' level to get everything smooth and even. The tamping is not that critical if the site will be exposed to the weather for a while. All the hand-tamping in the world will not compare to the settling effect you will get after several rains.	Choose your grade. Rig up some shade, if there is an existing structure. Remove the sod. Use a laser level and stakes (if there are no existing posts) to pinpoint your exact grade throughout the site. Start cutting out the back.  Move the loose dirt over to the low side. Build the retaining wall if there's fill within the structure to hold back.  Rake out the grade and tamp. Here is the final grade, after the driveway was begun:
Some cleaners may strip your marble of its finish. Check the label of all cleaners to ensure they are suitable for marble. Abrasives in cleaners and abrasive cleaning tools, like scouring pads, steel wool, or scrubbers, can also cause damage to the marble.   The surfaces cleaners are intended for should be clearly marked on the label. Abrasives, too, are generally marked on the label., Even if the label says a cleaning product is suited for marble, it’s always a good idea to test the cleaner first. Choose an out of sight location on the marble, like under a stationary appliance, and use a small amount of cleaner on the marble. If the finish or color is affected by the cleaner after it dries, refrain from using the cleaner., Although bleach is a generally accepted cleaning agent for marble, it’s relatively harsh. Only use bleach sparingly to clean your marble. Same as when using vinegar or hydrogen peroxide, dampen a clean, soft rag with bleach, wring out excess, and drape the rag over stains.   Only use this technique for marble that is light in color. Bleach may cause discoloration in dark colored pieces., If you’ve cleaned a spot time and again with various cleaners, it’s likely the stain you are attempting to clean is engrained in the marble. To remove spots like this, the marble will have to be buffed and refinished. For the best results, this should only be attempted by a professional.	Avoid harsh cleaners and anything abrasive. Test cleaning products on an out of view part of the marble. Soak stubborn stains in bleach. Identify engrained stains in your marble.
