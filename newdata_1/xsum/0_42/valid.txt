Carr left his post as Newcastle United's chief scout in June after seven years with the club. The 72-year-old previously worked for Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur in scouting roles. He played for Northampton in the 1960s and as manager led them to the Fourth Division title in 1987 during a five-year spell in charge of the team. "When he retired from Newcastle it seemed an obvious move to get him on board with us," said Cobblers chairman Kelvin Thomas. "His knowledge and experience will be beneficial in general and I'm sure he will also be helping (head of recruitment) Andy Melville along the way too, watching some games here and there."	Former Northampton Town manager Graham Carr has returned to the club as an associate director.

Sergio Garcia and Rafa Cabrera-Bello beat JB Holmes and Ryan Moore 3&2, with Rory McIlroy and Thomas Pieters beating Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar 3&2. But Brooks Koepka and Brandt Snedeker won 5&4 against Danny Willet and Martin Kaymer to ensure the US remain ahead. "I would definitely say it's better to have a small deficit with some momentum because we didn't have much at lunchtime," said Europe captain Darren Clarke. "The guys went back out there and they showed just why I'm so proud of them. They showed a massive amount of desire and the fight in them to get themselves right back into it again." US captain Davis Love said: "Obviously I'm happy to be 5-3. I like being ahead but I keep telling our guys there's eight points a day and then there's 12 points on Sunday." After failing to win a point in a session for the first time since 1981, Europe improved dramatically - especially on the greens - to ensure their quest for a fourth successive Ryder Cup was not effectively ended in just one day at Hazeltine. Still, the hosts hold a healthy advantage as they look to win the event for only the third time in 23 years, though it will not be lost on visiting captain Darren Clarke that Europe trailed 5-3 after the first day of their remarkable comeback win at Medinah four years ago. Both the 3-1 scoreline and margin of European victories in the fourballs not only quelled the rowdy home crowd, but also reversed the momentum of the 41st Ryder Cup, leaving the contest delicately poised for Saturday morning's foursomes. Media playback is not supported on this device Stenson and Rose trailed Spieth and Reed for almost all of the morning foursomes and looked set for a long afternoon in the Minnesota sunshine as the Americans began with more electric putting. But after the US putters finally failed on the fourth, Sweden's Open champion Stenson dragged his team along, making birdie on the seventh when Rose went in the water, then knocking his tee shot on the eighth to gimme range. Though Rose was below his best, Spieth and Reed became erratic after falling behind for the first time in 25 holes, their first Ryder Cup defeat as a pair engineered by the imperious Stenson. If the European turnaround was sparked by their most experienced pair, it was continued by Spanish rookie Cabrera-Bello, who was relaxed enough to be seen encouraging his vastly experienced compatriot Garcia on the way to the first tee. Cabrera-Bello, who sat out the morning, promptly birdied the first then, after a Garcia birdie for two up, put his team another hole to the good with a par on the seventh despite finding water off the tee. Garcia faded in the morning session but found life in his putter in the afternoon - and though Holmes cut the lead from four to two, victory was sealed on the 16th. Belgian Pieters improved throughout the morning, despite being on the end of a heavy defeat in partnership with England's Lee Westwood. Paired with Europe's leading player McIlroy in the afternoon, he found a team-mate to share the load, with two birdies each giving the visitors four successive holes on the front nine. Pieters drained an 18-foot putt on the 13th to draw a roar from McIlroy, before a birdie each from Johnson and Kuchar cut the lead to two. But, with American momentum growing, McIlroy produced a wonderful approach to reach the par-five 16th in two, then bowed to the crowd as he holed the eagle putt that completed the win. If Pieters benefitted from his more experienced partner, fellow rookie Willett - lightly booed on the first tee after the controversy caused by a magazine article written by his brother - was let down by two-time major winner Kaymer. Not once on the front nine did the German provide the better ball for his team, who were subsequently overrun by big-hitting American debutant Koepka and the precise-putting Snedeker. Media playback is not supported on this device Europe captain Darren Clarke on Sky Sports: "I'm massively proud of them. They were bitterly disappointed at lunchtime but the guys came out this afternoon and the golf was scintillating." United States captain Davis Love: "You know it's going to be a close match. We had a great morning, they had a great afternoon. We shot low scores, just got beat by a team playing unbelievable golf. We need to start over again tomorrow. It's another day and we try to win every session." Europe's Rory McIlroy on BBC Radio 5 live: "The consensus at lunch was we have to chip away at the lead. I don't think we could have dreamed it any better this afternoon and we are probably going into our locker room a little bit happier than they are this afternoon." Europe vice-captain Ian Poulter: "The team was pretty low at lunchtime. It's been a long time since it's been 4-0 in a morning session, but the guys dug deep. That morning session was painful, but the afternoon was incredible. We can hear our crowd now." BBC chief sports writer Tom Fordyce It was a dramatic opening day in a competition that specialises in the sort of see-saw excitement that few other sporting events can match. At midday the course was a sea of Stars and Stripes, McIlroy and Sullivan's foursomes defeat on the 18th to Mickelson and Fowler, having been two up with four to play, was perhaps the most chastening European moment of all. Yet in the afternoon the vast galleries were silenced by a European charge that brought back stirring memories of Medinah four years ago, and nothing epitomised that better then McIlroy's eagle putt on the 16th to see off Johnson and Kuchar with the impressive Pieters.

The boarding boat at St Davids RNLI Lifeboat Station takes crew to and from its lifeboat. But the vessel has recently become a regular sunbathing spot for a 7ft (2.13m) long bull seal. Dai John, St Davids RNLI coxswain, said: "His presence doesn't impact on our ability to save lives at sea at all so he is a welcome visitor." The boat is currently being kept on a mooring until the charity's new lifeboat station is completed next year.	A volunteer RNLI crew have been given the seal of approval from an unlikely passenger.
An early favourite with bookmakers, the band's album beat rapper Plan B, The Maccabees, Richard Hawley, Django Django, Jessie Ware and Field Music. BBC Sound of 2012 winner Michael Kiwanuka, Ben Howard, Lianne La Havas, Roller Trio and Sam Lee also lost out. Alt-J thanked their parents for helping them to win the Â£20,000 prize. "We might just thank everyone in team Alt-J who has ever made a difference to us. And our parents... thanks for not making us get jobs!" said the band as they accepted their award. The four-piece, who met at university in Leeds in 2007 but are now based in Cambridge, said the award would probably give them "a level of security". "The Mercury Awards puts us in the hall of fame for sure, because it's such a well respected award," said frontman Joe Newman backstage. Alt-J also rubbished the idea of the so-called 'Mercury curse', a term coined after previous winners such as Speech Debelle failed to live up to the hype. "This kind of curse isn't dependent on whether you win the Mercury. It's dependent on the material that you have after you win the Mercury," said Newman. "We feel as a group we have a real strong set of songs, future songs. It's about the artist." The band revealed they would be celebrating by getting drunk. However they did add they would spend some of the prize money taking their parents out for a slap-up meal, after their families had watched the awards on TV while hosting their own Mercury-themed parties. Each of the 12 nominated acts performed live at this year's ceremony, in its new home, the Roundhouse in north London. Plan B, real name Ben Drew, opened the show with the title track from his nominated album Ill Manors, which is the soundtrack to the film he wrote, directed and starred in. He performed from the top of a new-look double-decker stage in the Camden venue, the same spot where The Maccabees later brought the show to a close with a high energy rendition of Pelican. BBC 6 Music presenter Lauren Laverne replaced longtime host Jools Holland as coverage of the event moved from BBC Two to Channel 4. Radio 1's new Breakfast Show host Nick Grimshaw fronted the backstage coverage. Other standout performances came from La Havas, who silenced the room, and Ware who like many of the nominees said they were happy just to be nominated. Most have already enjoyed a sales boost while the act behind this year's 'token jazz album', Roller Trio, said they received a host of new bookings and got a new agent the day after being nominated. HMV's Gennaro Castaldo predicted Alt-J's win could result in a "five or sixfold" increase in sales. Last week, fellow nominees Django Django, who met at art college in Edinburgh, won Q magazine's best new act award. However they admitted they were a little nervous as the Mercury's evening kicked off. "It feels a bit like we're all about to get married. To each other," said Django drummer and producer Dave Maclean. He had designed the band's matching shirts especially for the event, but afterwards insisted there were no hard feelings and they were glad Alt-J had won as it was "a good album". Last year PJ Harvey became the first act to win the Mercury Prize twice, when her album Let England Shake took the prize. This year bookmakers William Hill had reported a late surge of betting for Sheffield troubadour Hawley, who received his second nomination for Standing at the Sky's Edge. He said the Mercury Prize, which has faced criticism for becoming too predictable, was "massively important" as it celebrated the album as "an art form". "It's a thing in culture that we're losing," he explained on the red carpet, likening buying MP3s to "buying a bucket of steam". "An album is a sequential series of musical events that elicits an emotional response - all you need to do is give it your time." Hawley continued: "I'm the oldest guy nominated here and I like the album as something that you engage with, it gives you so much. "Our relationship with music has changed so massively in such a short space of time. Music is something we need, it's not a luxury." Recent figures from Music Week show that sales of artist albums are down by 15.3% year on year, while single sales are rising. However this year's winners Alt-J are also proud to call their debut record "an album-y album", designed to be listened to in its entirety. "That's why we were so happy to be nominated for the Mercury, because we're album people I think," said the band's keyboard player Gus Unger-Hamilton. "I'm not saying we made the album thinking, 'this is going to win a mercury', but just 'I hope people appreciate this as a single body of work'." However, as An Awesome Wave was five years in the making, fans may have to wait a while for the follow up. "We didn't rush anything, we were patient and we took our time," explained Newman. "That's certainly something that we're going to consider for our second album. You can't rush creativity, and you can't rush working with a group of guys."	Indie rock band Alt-J have been named winners of this year's prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize, with their debut album An Awesome Wave.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has issued dozens of warnings, most of them in Tayside. People in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway have been asked to pay close attention to the weather forecast over Christmas Day into Boxing Day. Warnings were also in place on Christmas Eve covering Strathglass and Callander. Storm Eva is expected to bring further bad weather to areas which have already been badly affected. A weather warning of heavy rain is in place for much of southern Scotland from 15:00 on Christmas Day through to 23:45 on Boxing Day. Many roads across Dumfries and Galloway were affected by surface water or flooding on Christmas Eve and drivers were asked "slow down and take care". The A76 Dumfries to Kilmarnock road near to Drumlanrig Castle was reported as "flooded but passable". The B724 Annan to Dumfries "low road" was flooded with a road closure in place west of Cummertrees. In Dumfries itself, the Whitesands car parks were closed due to flooding in the area. High winds also affected the north of Scotland on Christmas Eve with gusty of 60mph to 70mph forecast and up to 80mph over the Western Isles. Eleven out of 26 Caledonian MacBrayne routes were disrupted but the situation was improving. Passengers were asked to check on the website, on Twitter @calmac_updates and also on the freephone number 0800 066 5400 for regular updates.	Many parts of Scotland are at risk of flooding over Christmas after more heavy rain affected the country.
The back-row forward, a product of the Chiefs' academy, has spent time on a dual registration deal at Championship side Cornish Pirates this year. Simmonds, 22, will make his first Premiership appearance for Exeter against Wasps on Sunday. "He has shown an awful lot of very, very good qualities," said head coach Rob Baxter.	Exeter Chiefs forward Sam Simmonds has signed a new two-year deal with the Premiership club.
The 53-year-old was given the job on a temporary basis in February, following the sacking of Claudio Ranieri. Shakespeare, who has only worked as caretaker or number two, was Ranieri's assistant after joining the club under former Foxes boss Nigel Pearson. "This is a really exciting opportunity for me to continue along this new path in my career," said Shakespeare. "Our preparations for pre-season and the new Premier League campaign have been ongoing for some time, but we can now move on with certainty and ensure we are well equipped to compete at the levels now expected of a club like Leicester City." Shakespeare won eight of his 16 games in charge last season, leading the club to the Champions League quarter-finals. As reigning Premier League champions, Leicester were one point above the relegation zone with 13 matches left when Ranieri departed. But Shakespeare collected 23 points, including wins in all his first five games, to guide the club to 14th place. Leicester beat Sevilla in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition, but were knocked out in the next round by Atletico Madrid. City vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha added: "Craig has shown all the qualities in leadership, motivation and talent management that are required to be successful in this role. "Those qualities, aligned with his first-class coaching acumen, his knowledge of Leicester City and its philosophy, and the respect he has earned at every level of the club make him the ideal choice to help take us forward."	Leicester City have named caretaker boss Craig Shakespeare as their permanent manager on a three-year deal.
The 41-year-old Oscar-winner was recognised for services to the film industry and to charity in last year's Queen's Birthday Honours. Zeta Jones was accompanied by her husband, US actor Michael Douglas, and their children Dylan and Carys. The former Darling Buds of May star has appeared in such films as Chicago, Traffic and The Mask of Zorro. When the announcement of the award was made last summer, the actress said she was "absolutely thrilled". "As a British subject I feel incredibly proud," she continued. "At the same time it is overwhelming and humbling." Her husband Douglas, who was diagnosed with throat cancer last year, announced in January that his tumour is gone and he is beating the disease. Veteran actor Burt Kwouk, best known for his Kato role in the Pink Panther films, received an OBE at Thursday's investiture ceremony. The 80-year-old actor appeared in three James Bond films and was most recently seen in BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine.	Welsh actress Catherine Zeta Jones has been made a CBE by Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace.
With more than 40 firms now offering gas and electricity deals it warns of the danger of one becoming insolvent. At present anyone who is in credit with their energy supplier could lose out. The watchdog wants the cost of a safety net to be paid for by customers, which would have "a small impact on bills", it said. Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, Rachel Fletcher, said: ""We are proposing a safety net to protect customers' credit balances in the unlikely event of a supplier failure." Under current rules, if a gas or electricity supplier becomes insolvent Ofgem appoints a replacement to ensure that customers continue to be supplied with energy. But it warns that "there may be financial implications for the failed supplier's customers". That is because as direct debit energy payments spread the cost evenly across the year, customers are often in debit during the winter and build up credit in the summer. Ofgem reckons that a typical customer's credit balance peaks at a little over Â£100 each year. But it warns that without regulatory intervention, customers are unlikely to receive all - or possibly any - of their money back if their supplier fails. Some industries already have a financial safety net for consumers. If a financial services firm goes bust, for instance, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects people's savings with authorised firms up to Â£75,000. The scheme is paid for by a levy on all financial services companies. Meanwhile if a travel company collapses, customers are protected if it was a member of travel trade association ABTA.  The scheme is funded through a bond on members. Ofgem wants similar protection for energy customers and is proposing to allow, on a case-by-case basis, the costs of reimbursing credit balances to be spread across all energy customers. "This would better protect customers' money and have a small impact on bills," it said. The watchdog was keen to stress that it does not expect any suppliers to go out of business. "These proposals are for reassurance and to give customers the confidence to shop around and get the best energy deal," Ms Fletcher said. But it points out that while competition benefits consumers, it can lead to suppliers to fail in the same way as companies can in other markets. More than one in six - 17.4% - dual-fuel households are now with an independent provider, according to research from Cornwall Energy. It says 7.1 million customers have switched to one of the energy market's newest players since 2011.	The energy watchdog Ofgem has proposed adding a small levy to bills to ensure that consumers do not lose out if their supplier goes bust.
It has launched a plan to update and co-ordinate national tax laws. There was criticism in the UK earlier this year when it emerged that Google, Starbucks and Amazon paid little tax despite having big UK operations. Following that criticism Starbucks agreed to pay more tax. The OECD came up with the plan at the request of the G20 group of leading nations. Finance ministers from the G20 are meeting in Moscow. OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria said: "International tax rules, many of them dating from the 1920s, ensure that businesses don't pay taxes in two countries - double taxation. By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent It's a plan to produce a plan. At a time when there's much controversy about corporate tax, the OECD has certainly succeeded in grabbing the headlines. But will it produce any real results? There is significant political support for the idea of a crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and several other European finance ministers have been pushing this agenda. In the United States there is political capital to be earned by being tough on multinationals. Nonetheless, the OECD still has to come up with the detailed proposals and then governments have to choose to implement them. Some probably will be co-operative. But the OECD has no power to compel those who are not. "This is laudable, but unfortunately these rules are now being abused to permit double non-taxation." It is calling for greater international co-operation to close gaps that allows income to "disappear" for tax purposes. The OECD also said that tax income should reflect the economic activity it generates. That would address some of the criticism aimed at big companies. Earlier this year, Google was fiercely criticised by UK MPs for routing Â£3.2bn of UK sales through Dublin and paying little tax as a result. Starbucks has been questioned for transferring money to a Dutch sister company in royalty payments. And Apple's chief executive Tim Cook was questioned by US lawmakers about the billions of dollars his company keeps in its Irish divisions. The companies point out that these schemes are legal and they have a duty to their shareholders to minimise their tax bills. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "delighted" the OECD had produced the report. "Taxpayers, governments and businesses all suffer when some companies manipulate the tax system to avoid paying their fair share of taxes," he said. The OECD hopes its recommendations will be put into action over the next two years and is working on an international legal structure that would help countries introduce the new rules quickly. "Multinationals still have not grasped that tax honesty is an integral part of corporate responsibility," said Florian Wettstein, professor of business ethics at the University of St. Gallen, based in Switzerland. "As a result, the public increasingly perceives them as hypocritical and untrustworthy." Campaigners say that aggressive tax policies are particularly hard on poorer nations, who need all the tax revenue they can generate. ActionAid tax campaigns manager Chris Jordan said: "For the developing countries that lose billions of dollars each year to aggressive tax avoidance, the stakes couldn't be higher. "It's vital that they have a seat at the table, so global tax rules aren't stitched up by the major powers."	Existing tax rules need updating as they can be "abused" by multinational companies, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Wishaw General in North Lanarkshire experienced the power cut between 08:45 and 16:00. It meant one emergency patient was redirected to Hairmyres Hospital. NHS Lanarkshire said IT systems were also affected. The hospital was powered by back-up generators until mains power was restored. NHS Lanarkshire chief executive Calum Campbell said: "In the interest of patient safety and as a precautionary measure, we took the decision to reschedule a small number of surgical procedures based on clinical priority. "The power interruption impacted on our diagnostic and IT systems, which have now been fully restored. "As a result, some outpatient clinics have been affected and one emergency patient was redirected to Hairmyres Hospital. "This is in line with our business and emergency continuity plans which worked to good effect." He added: "All patients affected by the interruption have been rescheduled and we would like to apologise for any inconvenience this will have caused."	A hospital was forced to reschedule operations after losing power for more than seven hours.
Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust said funding offered by central Norfolk clinical commissioning groups (CCG) does not meet the "volume of demand". A trust board meeting was told the CCGs were "not commissioning sufficient capacity" in beds or staffing levels. The central Norfolk CCGs said they were still in negotiations. At the meeting Andrew Hopkins, director of finance, said funding arrangements had been agreed with all its CCGs apart from central Norfolk. The meeting heard the plans put forward by central Norfolk CCGs did not provide enough funds for out of area placements, when no beds can be found in the area. There were also issues surrounding staffing levels. In previous years, the trust has been criticised over the need to send patients outside of Norfolk and Suffolk due to a shortage of mental health beds. The BBC revealed that in November last year the cost of sending Norfolk and Suffolk mental patients to other parts of the country almost tripled to Â£600,000, from an average of Â£200,000 a month in December 2013 to September 2014. In December, the trust said the number outside the counties had been cut to 24 from a high of 50 earlier in the year. Non-executive director John Brierley said: "The issue is the commissioners are not commissioning sufficient capacity to the volume of demand." If no agreement is made the dispute will go to arbitration where a final decision is made by NHS England and health watchdog Monitor. Trust chief executive Michael Scott said after the meeting: "We don't think there is adequate funding for mental health. It remains the Cinderella service. "In some areas such as Suffolk and Great Yarmouth and Waveney we have managed to agree funding. "Unfortunately across central Norfolk we are unable to agree and we have to go to arbitration." A Norfolk CCGs spokesman said: "CCGs across Norwich, South Norfolk and North Norfolk are still in discussions with the trust regarding the 15/16 contracting year. "All parties are hopeful of a swift conclusion to current negotiations." In February, this year the trust became the first of its kind in England to be put in special measures due to it not providing a "safe service".	Cash for future mental health provision in Norfolk and Suffolk has "fallen short" of what is needed, prompting a dispute with an NHS trust and a funder.
At the end of an even first half, Fabio Borini buried a penalty following Andre Wisdom's rash challenge in the box. The Italian put in an excellent cross for Jermain Defoe to turn in a second after the break before Duncan Watmore scored a third in injury time. Nathan Redmond hit a post and Norwich had penalty appeals turned down - but the comeback never gathered real pace. Instead Sunderland could easily have increased their winning margin before Watmore darted onto fellow substitute Sebastien Larsson pass and finally made the hosts pay for the space left behind as they committed numbers forward. Relive Sunderland's crucial victory Relegation fight 'going down to the wire' Sunderland rely heavily on Defoe for goals. Fortunately for the Black Cats, he has managed 16 in 30 games this season and they had success as they repeatedly tested the Norwich defence against the 32-year-old striker's pace with long balls forward. It may have been one-dimensional, but that direct style paid off as Borini chased up on a swift counter-attack and was clumsily fouled by Wisdom in the box as he controlled Defoe's return ball. After the break, another fast transition after a dawdling Sebastien Bassong was robbed by Jan Kirchoff  saw the roles reversed with Borini threading a perfect delivery to the far post for Defoe to slide in and convert. Sunderland's goal difference is now seven superior to Norwich's and they might have increased that advantage further with Watmore wasting a fine opening before belatedly adding a third. Norwich had 19 shots to the visitors' eight and 14 corners with Sunderland unable to force a single one. But for all their industry, endeavour and possession, they lacked the cutting edge and ruthlessness that the Black Cats showed. Instead they were largely restricted to long-range efforts, with Martin Olsson, Bassong and Wisdom bringing saves out of Vito Mannone. Redmond then struck the base of a post with a skimming effort, while referee Andre Marriner turned down a trio of weak penalty claims to the home crowd's disgust. The two clubs have competed for the Friendship Trophy in their league meetings since they played each other in the 1985 Milk Cup final, but with the far greater prize of Premier League survival on the line there was little cordial about this encounter. Norwich's Robbie Brady nudged DeAndre Yedlin into the advertising hoarding in front of the Sunderland bench, sparking a shoving match in which Black Cats' boss Sam Allardyce and Norwich substitute Cameron Jerome jostled each other. Relations were not improved by Borini's goal celebration which finished with him sliding on his knees in front of the home supporters, some of whom returned fire with the paper clappers that had been distributed before kick-off. The closing stages of the match played out to the travelling fans' taunts that Norwich are heading to the Championship with their north-east rivals Newcastle. If that prediction proves true, this result will feature heavily in Norwich's post-mortem of the season. Media playback is not supported on this device Norwich boss Alex Neil: "The two teams are still chasing us, we're still a point ahead. We need to win games and that's always been the case. "That second goal cost us the game.

To come here and win 3-0 shows you what a massive result it is." Both teams play Arsenal next.

There were delays on Monday at airports in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels, where visibility reportedly dropped to just 100m. The situation was worsened at Duesseldorf Airport by the discovery overnight of an unexploded World War Two bomb. A controlled explosion closed the airport to flights for an hour. According to Eurocontrol, the European air safety agency, there were more than 120,000 minutes of flight delays across the continent on Monday morning, with 94% due to adverse weather conditions. Cancelled flights: Why does fog cause chaos at airports? A Eurocontrol spokesman told the Guardian it was "unusual situation to have such widespread low visibility for such a long period". Airports in Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and the UK were among the worst affected, according to the agency's Twitter feed. Easyjet said it was suffering "major network disruption today due to poor weather conditions throughout Europe causing low visibility". "This has resulted in a large number of aircraft and crew out of place for flights today," the airline said in a statement. "In addition we are seeing a lot of Air Traffic Control restrictions which has resulted in some delays, diversions and cancellations." In Paris, the top half of the Eiffel Tower was obscured by a thick blanket of fog. Several airlines warned on Twitter that delays were expected to continue throughout Monday. There were widespread delays at UK airports. Heathrow airport said it expected to cancel around 10% of flights on Monday, while London City was forced to close to all traffic. Other affected airports include Manchester, Leeds Bradford, Glasgow, Belfast and Cardiff.	Heavy fog is causing disruption across western Europe, with low visibility leading to significant flight delays.
A total of 28% had not talked about the symptoms, the University of Aberdeen paper revealed. Lead author Dr Peter Murchie said it highlighted the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis. Cancer Research UK said it was a complex area. The study - published in the British Journal of Cancer - said that, of those who had previously flagged symptoms to their doctor, 81% had been appropriately referred on by their GP for further treatment or investigation of their symptoms. However it said 19% could be viewed as missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis. The study, funded by the Scottish Chief Scientist's Office, involved a review of the case notes from 1,800 patients diagnosed with cancer in northern Scotland and registered at GP surgeries across NHS Grampian, Orkney and Shetland. Dr Murchie, a GP and researcher at the University of Aberdeen, said: "This study sheds light on the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis and how quickly circumstances can change for the patient. "It's vital we do more to ensure people with persistent or unusual symptoms feel confident about getting them checked out by a doctor without delay. "And it's equally important to give GPs better access to the tests and specialist advice they need to help them spot potential cancer symptoms at the earliest stage." Jodie Moffat, Cancer Research UK's head of early diagnosis, said: "For some patients, emergency presentation may be difficult to avoid, but for others there are often things that could have been done differently. "Studies like this help us to understand this complex picture and identify what needs to change. "Cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency are more likely to have late stage disease and poorer survival. So it's vital we do all we can to break down barriers to people visiting their doctor with symptoms that could be cancer. "Cancer Research UK is also working with GPs in Scotland to help improve early cancer diagnosis and ensure they have the freedom to refer patients for further tests and access specialist advice if cancer is suspected."	More than a quarter of cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency in the north of Scotland had not discussed any relevant symptoms with their GP beforehand, according to a new study.
The comments were made in a statement the day after the BBC reported workers at Scotland's largest container port are set to go on strike on Tuesday in a row over rotas and pay. The spokeswoman insisted changes to shift patterns were needed to reflect the needs of customers. But the Unite union has said the new rotas amount to a "de facto pay cut". A spokesman for the Port of Grangemouth said: "The strike action proposed by Unite the union is unjustified. "We are proposing alterations to shift patterns in response to the changing needs of our customers, whose vessels call at the port seven days a week. "Our staff and their union accepted the need for such flexibility, and that shift patterns may require to change in the future, when this element of their employment contracts was agreed in 2011. She added: "We have decided to close the port's quayside container operations from midnight on Monday 14th March. All other operations at the port will remain open. "We sincerely hope that our staff, and their union, will cancel this strike and work with us to implement the changes necessary to enable us to meet the changing demands of our customers." The union Unite has said all but two of 75 "operatives" based at the Port of Grangemouth voted for the action in a ballot. The workers include crane drivers and loaders. It is understood that about 20 engineers who are also based at the site are not involved in the action, which is due to start at 00:01 on Tuesday. Unite said the action had been called after port owner Forth Ports announced changes to shifts. Grangemouth handles more than 150,000 containers annually, with daily sailings to Rotterdam, Antwerp, Felixstowe and Hamburg.	A spokeswoman for Forth Ports has called the planned Grangemouth strike "unjustified".
Taylor, 31, the first Kiwi double centurion against Australia, reached 290 before he was the last man to fall. His score surpassed that of England's Tip Foster, who scored 287 against Australia in Sydney in 1903. New Zealand made 624, their first 600 against Australia, but the hosts added 258-2 to lead by 193 with one day left. Resuming on 235 in Perth, Taylor made the third-highest score by a New Zealand batsman. Brendon McCullum got a triple century against India in Wellington last year. Taylor batted for nine and a half hours, facing 374 balls and hitting 43 boundaries before he was caught at deep square-leg by substitute fielder Jonny Wells. That denied him becoming only the second batsman to score a triple century against Australia, after England's Len Hutton, who made 364 at The Oval in 1938. It was New Zealand's fifth-highest Test team total, the record being set as recently as last year with 690 against Pakistan in Sharjah. Having begun day four on 510-6 at the Waca, New Zealand were soon reduced to 587-9 before last man Trent Boult helped Taylor guide them past 600 and a first-innings lead of 65. Australia lost Joe Burns for a duck in the third over but Steve Smith hit his fourth hundred as captain in only his fifth Test in charge. He shared an unbroken partnership of 212 in 55 overs with Adam Voges (101) who became the sixth centurion of the match. Taylor celebrated both his century and double century on day three by sticking his tongue out in a message to his daughter. He added he was "undercooked" going into the first Test, which New Zealand lost, after he was sidelined for six weeks by an injury to his testicles sustained in the nets in Zimbabwe in August. "I felt I just needed to get back in the groove," Taylor said. "You can either graft it out or go out and play your shots and the latter probably comes more natural to me. "It's surprising what happens when you hit a couple off the middle, the feet start moving and the confidence comes flooding back." Some observers highlighted the fact that Taylor was not congratulated by the Australian players at the end of his innings. Australia opening batsman David Warner took to Twitter to explain that as Taylor was the last player to be dismissed, the home batsmen had to leave the field to prepare for their second innings.	New Zealand's Ross Taylor struck the highest Test score by a visiting batsman in Australia as the runs continued to flow in the second Test.

Crashes similar to those suffered by Fernando Alonso in Australia on Sunday will be part of a risk assessment into the 'halo' device, planned for 2017. The Spaniard's McLaren came to rest upside down after his 180mph crash at the season-opening race in Melbourne. "We need to see if it could become more difficult to get out," he said. Even if the halo made it more difficult for a driver to get out of his car in such a situation, that would not be enough to prevent its introduction. The device is being investigated on a holistic basis and the FIA will weigh any potential extra problems with a driver's ability to remove himself from the cockpit against the increased safety. But only if the cons outweighed the pros would head protection be delayed. Alonso's team-mate Jenson Button said after the race that there was "no need for him to get out in that situation", adding: "It's better to have a halo system. They [safety workers] would tip the car over of course to get him out, so it takes a bit longer. But he was OK so it doesn't matter." Governing body the FIA is aiming to make a final decision on the adoption of the halo by the end of May, following the completion of the risk assessment. Its F1 director Charlie Whiting has told teams the device will be introduced if the process does not throw up any unanticipated risks and that he expects no opposition. Even if a team did object, the FIA could force it through on safety grounds. The FIA is still waiting for all the data to be recovered from the accident data recorders on Alonso's car before investigating exactly what happened. The 34-year-old double world champion sustained a peak force of 46G during the crash, which he described as the biggest of his career. It was triggered when Alonso's right front wheel caught the left-rear wheel of Esteban Gutierrez's Haas as he was trying to overtake on the approach to Turn Three. All cars are fitted with a high-speed camera pointing back towards the driver's head to analyse its trajectory during an accident. The device works at 400 frames per second - 16 times faster than a normal camera - and it will reveal whether there would have been any danger to the driver's head had a halo been fitted. This is considered highly unlikely, as the halo has been designed to be well out of reach of the helmet even in extreme scenarios. These cameras, along with in-ear accelerometers worn by the drivers and data from sensors on the chassis, mean the FIA can build up a detailed picture of the events of an accident. Alonso, who is one of the vast majority of drivers backing the introduction of extra head protection, said it was important to look into what would have happened in his accident and its aftermath had a halo been fitted. The risk assessment into the halo will focus on the potential negatives of the device, and whether they are worse than what would have happened to the driver if it had not been fitted. If the positives outweigh the negatives more often than not, that will be considered a satisfactory situation for the introduction of the halo. Driver egress is only one of about nine different potential dangers that are part of the assessment. The halo, which was tested by Ferrari during the final pre-season test in Spain, is not the only head-protection system under consideration. Red Bull has proposed an alternative solution, which has a similar elliptical loop above the driver's head but differs from the halo in having two side supports rather than one at the front and a screen around it. But Whiting says that is "considerably further behind in development, it's never been tested, but it could offer additional protection". The device may be ready for the FIA to test its efficacy in protecting against a flying wheel by the end of April. The test fires a 20kg wheel and upright assembly at the car at 225km/h. The device has to deflect it without breaking. The screen is one of the biggest potential problems with the Red Bull device - it is unclear whether this would cause visibility problems as a result of collecting debris or in wet weather.	The ease with which drivers can get out of an upturned car will be investigated before finalising the introduction of head protection next year.
"Hockey?" suggested a teenager uncertainly. "Basketball?" ventured  another. Most people simply shook their heads. "Sorry," said one middle-aged  man, sipping on a glass of tea. "We don't play that game here." For fans of rugby union, Kolkata - formerly called Calcutta - is synonymous with the Calcutta Cup - the annual game played between England and Scotland that had its origins here in the 1870s. The city remains India's rugby capital - and although about 40,000 people nationwide play the game according to the sport's administrators - that lack of recognition is its biggest struggle. "Rugby is basically not known as a sport," says Noomi Mehta, president of the  Indian Rugby Football Board - recalling the game's comically-inaccurate portrayal in a local Tamil film - a clip of which is now doing the rounds on the internet.  "It was basically gang warfare on a field." He can see the funny side, but says the lack of understanding is making it hard for the sport to attract the money needed to spread the game and encourage promising players. "Getting sponsors is hard. We have had them in the past, but they stay for a year or two years and then they look elsewhere," Mr Mehta says. Indian rugby remains fully amateur - with power centred around just two clubs - one in Kolkata and another in Mumbai. Both are members-only establishments - set up way back under British rule. The welcome is warm and friendly, and the oak-panelled clubhouses and trophy cabinets carry an air of history and tradition - or elitism - depending on your point of view. But even having basic facilities, like changing rooms, make them the go-to venues for almost all the country's major tournaments. Shaking off that stuffy image - and showing more international rugby on Indian television - would be a good way to popularise the game says Mr Mehta, who thinks rugby's future lies in India's rural hinterland. The Calcutta Cup The Calcutta Cup is the trophy presented to the winner of the England versus Scotland rugby union match which takes place during the annual Six Nations Championship. After the introduction of rugby to India in 1872, the Calcutta (Rugby) Football Club was set up by former students of Rugby School in January 1873. It joining the Rugby Football Union in 1874, but with the departure of a local British army regiment interest in the sport waned.  The members decided to disband and withdrew the club's funds from the bank, which were in Silver Rupees. These were then melted down and made into a cup which they presented to the RFU in 1878, on the understanding that it should be competed for annually. And like football, hockey, badminton and (Indian sport) kabaddi have already done - Mr Mehta says rugby could learn from the success of cricket's Indian Premier League - creating a made-for-television short format tournament with Bollywood owners, music, and razzmatazz that attracts international players by making it financially worth their while. "You can find sponsors at that level," Mr Mehta confidently predicts. Not that the game is totally devoid of backers. Vehicle specialist Birla Tyres sponsors an annual Kolkata tournament - though the sums involved remain quite small. "On the face of it there's no business reason to sponsor the sport of rugby,  because it's a very closed circle of people who really watch the sport, play the sport," says Birla Tyre's chief executive Arvind Singh. "But we didn't want to be just another company that sponsored cricket and were looking for other opportunities. "The Rugby World Cup gets watched in India - perhaps not as widely as the football or the cricket but it does get watched. Rugby will have a revival and our participation in the sport of rugby means that as the sport revives, our association with it will mean our visibility around rugby arrives and grows." Getting more youngsters playing the game is one obvious way to grow rugby's appeal. And in the Wattgung suburb of Kolkata, a slum area and one of the city's best-known red-light districts, I find dozens of boys and girls who are picking up a rugby ball rather than a cricket bat. Their "pitch" is a yard full of shipping containers, reached by climbing a ladder and shimmying over a wall - but that is no deterrent. And that enthusiasm is down to schemes like Khelo Rugby - run by another Kolkata club Jungle Crows. "Finding the next Jonah Lomu would be great", says former British diplomat turned project founder Paul Walsh.  But this is as much about supporting some of the city's poorest children, helping them stay in school, and steering them away from drugs and prostitution as it is about coaching rugby. Every Saturday morning there are training sessions on a well-cared-for field close to the city centre, with youngsters tackling crash pads, and running through passing drills, often in bare feet. But standards are improving - and players regularly go on to play for clubs and even their country (India is currently ranked 74th in the word and 12th in Asia). All the coaches are volunteers - often graduates of the project themselves - but not surprisingly things are also tight financially at the grassroots. "Cricket sucks in all the money, football is very popular, then you go to hockey, kabbadi," says Mr Walsh. "Rugby is at the end of a long line of other sports. And perhaps, it will never be the most popular sport in India, but in a way that's nice as well. The kids love the fact that they play something that perhaps friends at school don't play, so it's special for them." The 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan will be the first time the event has been held in Asia. And while India has very little chance of reaching the tournament anytime soon, creating a generation of players who have absolutely no trouble recognising a rugby ball is not a bad start.	On the streets of Kolkata, I carried out a fairly unscientific experiment - showing passers-by a rugby ball and asking if they knew which sport it was used for.
Burberry reported pre-tax profits of £166m for the year to March. A year ago it made a loss of £16.1m, hit by charges at its Spanish operations. In the past year it has opened 21 new stores and closed nine. It plans to open 20-30 stores this year worldwide. The group has also focused on promoting the Burberry brand online. Sales rose 7% to £1.28bn, with the company recording double-digit sales growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. Adjusted profit rose 23% to £215m, taking into account one-off items and a favourable exchange rate. Stores in London in particular benefited from favourable currency movements and increased tourism. "Looking forward, while mindful of the economic environment, Burberry plans to build on its strong financial position by accelerating investment in growth initiatives in retail, digital and new markets, while continuing to enhance the brand," said chief executive Angela Ahrendts. Burberry shares were up 7.6% at 659 pence in afternoon trading.	Luxury fashion designer Burberry has returned to profit after opening new stores and spending more on online marketing
For a start, they do not have to wait for the new year. Many retailers started advertising cut-price deals well before Christmas. Despite the advance of internet shopping, the image of snaking queues outside department stores is still how we picture the sales season. Yet, it is not just High Street retailers that are offering bargains for cash-strapped consumers. And, with the looming prospect of a hefty credit card bill arriving in January, people are trying to save money by looking for cheaper options. So what discounts and money-saving tactics are around in the first month of the year? Love is blind to everything but the calendar. Official statistics show there are usually about a sixth of the number of weddings in January that there are in August. With only about 6,000 or so weddings in England and Wales in the first month of the year, there is room to haggle for good deals on venues, photography and cars. Civil partnerships are a little more spread out over the year, according to quarterly data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Yet, overall, good offers are available for these events, according to Sandy Moretta, director of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners. "Suppliers who only work in the wedding industry will come up with good offers in January, and they expect people to negotiate and haggle now," she says. Although there is a specific cost to some services, such as food or a wedding dress, there are often deals available as "some work is better than no work", she adds. Table displays can be cheaper if there is a winter feel of sprayed twigs, rather than much more expensive flowers. The cost of drinks is also generally lower, with couples often choosing to serve mulled wine and hot chocolate to guests rather than champagne. And Mrs Moretta says that January weddings can be great fun for guests. "January is one of those months where people are not doing a lot, they might need a lift after Christmas, and they are less likely to be shattered or hungover as they are in December," she says. Cut-price tickets are available for West End shows from the start of January to mid-February, The Get Into London Theatre scheme, an annual promotion that has run for more than 10 years, sees discounts of between 25% and 55% on the face value of 45 productions. "We want to make theatre as inclusive as possible. We want to see people who have not necessarily been to the theatre before," a spokesman for the scheme says. There is no booking fee or packaging charges for these tickets. However, theatregoers may have to be flexible over which show they want to see and when. Each theatre production decides individually what proportion of tickets will be made available for the cut-price promotion. It may be the quietest time of year for the theatre, but some shows are still very popular. As a result, it is extremely unlikely that the cheaper tickets will be available for shows on a Friday or Saturday night. Flights from the UK are far less packed with holidaymakers and business travellers in the first weeks of January - a time sometimes referred to as the "dead zone". But the lack of demand means that flights can be cheaper, although this depends on whether the destination is in low season for tourists. Some of the seven-day deals on offer for the start of January have included four-star self catering in Madeira for £195 and four-star all inclusive deals in Egypt for £405. The end of December and start of January is traditionally the time that the travel industry launches its best deals for the summer, according to Sean Tipton, of travel association Abta. These can include discounts and free places for children. "It is very much a buyers' market," he says. Shoppers may have flocked to charity shops to pick up Christmas cards in early December, but they might not necessarily put these stores on their list of January sales destinations. Yet, figures from the Charity Retail Association show that like-for-like income has been increasing in the first quarter of the year, compared with previous years. The latest figures show that, in 2012, the average weekly turnover per charity shop from January to March was £2,087, compared with £2,038 for the same charities in the same quarter a year earlier. A spokesman says that specific January sales are usually limited to the bigger charity stores. In 2013, the British Heart Foundation said it had turned to opening larger furniture and electrical shops to build profits. Meanwhile, the spokesman says that local charity shops are trying new measures in January to get themselves noticed on the High Street. With house prices starting to rise sharply again across the UK, there are unlikely to be many bargain basement deals in the housing market. However, estate agents say January is the time when the a whole host of new properties are put up for sale. Seller behaviour means that the free time over Christmas is when many families come to a final decision about whether to put their home on the market, according to Jan Hytch, president of the National Association of Estate Agents. That means that the new stock in the new year feeds through to increased sales a few months later, known in the industry as the "spring bounce". In contrast, very few properties are marketed in November and December, which means very few sales are completed in January. Transaction figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that sales in January and February are around two-thirds of the levels seen in the summer. It is surely the most seasonal of stores, but the owner of the Nutcracker Christmas Shop says he has never needed to have a sale in January. Robert Newman founded the business in 2001 and has opened all-year Christmas shops in Crieff, Edinburgh, and Callander in Scotland, and Stratford-upon-Avon in England. He says he can ensure the stock comes in at the correct time of year, but there is always demand from shoppers. "Not everyone has to have a sale," he says. "We have never had one, and we have no plans to change."	Gone are the days when the January sales season offered a welcome but narrow window for shopaholics to hunt for bargains on the High Street.
The 25-year-old, who is yet to play in a competitive international, has won two caps, both in friendly matches against the Netherlands. "He doesn't want to play international football, which is a disappointment from our point of view," said Wales manager Chris Coleman. "But he's made that decision, and we have to abide by that." Media playback is not supported on this device Wales are third in World Cup qualifying group D, four points behind leaders Serbia. They travel to Serbia for their next qualifier on Sunday, 11 June after naming a youthful pre-match training camp that included Exeter's 16-year-old Ethan Ampadu. Coleman added: "We'll get on with the squad of players, the squad who want to play and represent Wales. "There's nothing we can do with Paul, who's decided that international football is not the path he wants to go down." Newcastle-born Dummett was included in a pre-Euro 2016 training camp but was not selected in the squad for the tournament in France. He has not featured at all during the current World Cup qualifying campaign. "Sometimes you have to be patient especially because the team we have at the moment has been hugely successful," Coleman added. "It's a shame because he's a good player. I haven't spoken to Paul. His agent rang me up to give me the news. "I was disappointed, but if he doesn't want to persevere with it then that's his choice. We've got to look after the players who want to play for us."	Newcastle United defender Paul Dummett has made himself unavailable to play for Wales.
The government said any decision should await a report being written by the former bishop of Liverpool James Jones. Andy Burnham, who called for the law, criticised the failure to include it in the Policing and Crime Bill. He said it was wrong Margaret Aspinall had to use compensation for her son's death towards the "fight for justice". The shadow home secretary said Ms Aspinall, whose son James died in the 1989 disaster, had to put the Â£1,000 she received in compensation towards legal fees and was then "living on the breadline" trying to cover the cost of fighting for justice. The Leigh MP said the 27-year fight Hillsborough families had to endure showed how the odds were stacked against families seeking the truth. It has been revealed South Yorkshire Police spent at least Â£2.1m on legal fees representing its suspended Chief Constable David Crompton during the inquests into the deaths of the 96 fans who were killed. The Labour MP said: "This Bill was an opportunity to make this country fairer, to even up the scales and tip them in favour of ordinary families and away from the establishment. "I fear we have failed to do that." He said Ms Aspinall, who is chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, watched the debate from the public gallery, and was "disappointed" by the government's refusal to accept equal legal funding in to the Bill. The Policing and Crime Bill gives police stronger powers and hands responsibility for fire and rescue services to elected police and crime commissioners. It creates so-called super complaints which will allow organisations like charities to bring a large-scale complaint against the police and strengthens protections for whistleblowers so identities are protected while investigations are conducted. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Bill would allow police to go "further and faster" and "radically reform" the complaints and disciplinary systems. However, Mr Burnham said it was a "mixed bag" that included improvements but also missed opportunities including the equal legal funding for victims as well as a second Leveson Inquiry into the relationship between police and the press. The Bill will now pass to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. In April, jurors ruled the 96 victims of Hillsborough were unlawfully killed. The Rt Rev James Jones, the former Bishop of Liverpool, led the Hillsborough Independent Panel now acts as the home secretary's adviser on Hillsborough.	A decision on a "Hillsborough Law" to ensure legal funding for bereaved families at inquests where police are involved has been put on hold.
The four-match contest should have begun in Brisbane on Thursday, but that Test will now start on 17 December. The traditional Melbourne Boxing Day Test is unchanged, but the Sydney Test is put back three days to 6 January. The changes have been made because of welfare concerns for Australia's players grieving for Hughes, 25, whose funeral will take place on Wednesday. The left-handed Australia opener died on Thursday after being struck on the neck by a ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield match. The funeral service will take place in the sports hall of Macksville High School, which Hughes attended, and will be broadcast live in Australia and on big screens at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Adelaide Oval. "Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now," said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland. "These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief. It's very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly. "While this wasn't done by design, it is somewhat fitting that the first Test will take place in Adelaide at Phillip's adopted home ground where we hope the match can be a seen as a celebration of his life." The India squad, currently in Adelaide, were supposed to fly to Brisbane on Monday but missed their flight. Their two-day warm-up match against a Cricket Australia XI in Adelaide, scheduled for Friday and Saturday last week, was cancelled. It has been reported that the Indians may now play a tour game in Adelaide on Thursday and Friday. After the Test series with India, Australia then face the tourists in a triangular one-day international series that also involves England. Two of those games have already been switched. Australia and England will now open the series in Sydney on 16 January, with the Aussies taking on India in Melbourne two days later.	Australia's Test series with India will now begin in Adelaide on 9 December following the death of Phillip Hughes.
Carl McHugh was red-carded for a lunge on Don Cowie early in the second half. Hearts went ahead when Alexandros Tziolis' shot took a deflection off Keith Lasley and looped over goalkeeper Craig Samson. And Esmael Goncalves struck twice late on, the striker scoring his first goals for the Tynecastle club. Goncalves had an early low shot just wide before Louis Moult's header hit the bar, but the flag was up - wrongly - for offside against the Motherwell striker. The hosts had started the match with a back three in an attempt to stymie the Hearts attack, but as the half wore on the away side became more dangerous. First, a great run from left-back Lennard Sowah forced a save from Samson. Media playback is not supported on this device Then Jamie Walker threatened with a couple of fierce efforts which were just off target. He perhaps should have had a penalty when it looked like he had his shirt pulled in the box. Malaury Martin then stung the palms of Samson with a free-kick from 25 yards, but Motherwell would finish the half strongly. From a corner Lionel Ainsworth fired in a shot which was cleared off the line by Anastasios Avlonitis. McHugh then fired an effort over the bar. Moult was wrongly awarded awarded a free-kick at the edge of the box, having actually been tripped by team-mate Ainsworth. Referee Andrew Dallas even mistakenly booked Hearts midfielder Martin. Moult took the free-kick himself and the ball flew narrowly wide of Jack Hamilton's goal. Red cards defined Motherwell's match with Rangers last weekend and another sending off played a massive part in this match. This time it was McHugh who lunged in, catching Cowie painfully. There were echoes of Scott McDonald's red card tackle on Rangers' Kenny Miller, and it looked like the right decision by Dallas. Just minutes later Hearts opened the scoring. The impressive Greece international midfielder Tziolis fired in a shot from 20 yards which took a massive deflection off Lasley and beat Samson. But Lasley almost levelled moments later, his effort narrowly off target. Goncalves has shed 8kg and with his improved conditioning and professionalism it's intriguing to ponder what he can do for this Hearts side. The management at the club clearly believe in the talents of this mercurial player, and that belief will give Goncalves added confidence. He looked determined to get his first Hearts goal and caused Motherwell problems all afternoon. It finally came as he fired home with a composed finish. It clearly meant a lot to him as he celebrated with the travelling fans - for which he was duly booked. Goncalves restrained himself from a second yellow after he scored again as Hearts made it two wins in four days following Wednesday's 4-1 defeat of Rangers.

Northern Pride is billed as one of the largest LGBT festivals in the UK and is now in its ninth year, with organisers hoping to top last year's record crowd of 71,000 people over its three days. One of the highlights is the parade from the Civic Centre to the Town Moor. Fun fair, stalls and musical performances will feature at the festival, which is on all weekend. Mark Nichols, chair of Newcastle Pride, said: "We keep thinking we can't grow any more, and every year it has grown. "We started off nine years ago in Leazes Park, we outgrew that, so moved to Exhibition Park, and outgrew that, so we're now over the fence on the Town Moor." He added: "We grew from a one-day event to a three day one three years ago just because the numbers have grown so much. "Last year we had a total of 71,000, and 10,000 people marched in the city centre."	Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Newcastle for the annual Pride event.
Bridgend County Borough Council apologised following complaints after the new system was introduced on 5 June. But residents said bags of rubbish are still being left on the street by contractor Kier. The council said collections were getting back to normal again. A stream of complaints has continued to appear on social media, with some residents saying rubbish - including bags of nappies - have not been picked up for more than two weeks. Even First Minister Carwyn Jones took to Twitter to complain his collection was late. Gareth Davies, from Brynmenin, said: "It's absolute chaos. We've had loads of delays - at one point there were ripped up bin bags everywhere in the street. "We had the last collection yesterday on time but for some reason they didn't pick up all the purple nappy bags so now they are left out on the street." Stuart Vaughan, from Newton in Porthcawl, said the situation was "ridiculous". "In my street the collection is supposed to be on Friday. They turned up three days late but only picked up from half the houses. "The rest of the street had to wait until the following Friday for their collection." "Recycling has been left out on Porthcawl High Street for the past two weekends," he added. "It's absolutely disgusting. It's a resort - the council should be promoting it not leaving rubbish on the street." The new scheme aims to recycle almost all rubbish, with different coloured sacks for cardboard, paper, plastics and nappies and caddies for glass and food waste. Homes with fewer than five occupants are limited to throwing out two bags of non-recyclable waste every fortnight. But Mr Davies filmed refuse collectors throwing pre-sorted recycling altogether in the back of a bin lorry at a friend's house in the Broadlands area. He said: "Why are they asking people to separate their rubbish but then it all gets chucked in together anyway? It's very frustrating." A spokesman for Bridgend council said: "Kier put a number of short-term measures in place to deal with the backlog and help them get up to speed on collections, including bringing in extra staff and vehicles and working across the weekend. "A few residents questioned why recycling was temporarily collected in some areas using a refuse truck, but Kier had made separate arrangements for this to be re-sorted. "Despite issues experienced in the first few weeks of the scheme, collections are getting back to normal again. "The new system is being carefully monitored and evaluated, and further changes will be made over the next few weeks to ensure that it has bedded in properly and is running efficiently."	Bridgend's new recycling scheme is still in "absolute chaos" more than three weeks after it was introduced, residents have claimed.
The 19-year-old suffered the injury during the second half of Saturday's win at Swansea. "We're very disappointed, but that's football and that can happen," Koeman said. "It's unlucky but OK. "The boy has to keep going and it's difficult because he had a great start to the season, but it's part of the football and he will come back." Up until the injury, Ward-Prowse had played for Southampton in every fixture this season. Meanwhile, Koeman said that another young English player, Nathaniel Clyne, should be called up by the national side. The 23-year-old scored Southampton's second in their 2-1 win at Arsenal in the League Cup, with a brilliant 35-yard strike. "I think he's ready [to play for England]," Koeman said of Clyne, who has played at under-19 and under-21 level. "He has a lot of experience, he is playing very well from the beginning of the season. "He scored a great goal. I think his performance was very good and I think it's an option for the national coach and I'm very happy to have Clyney in our team because he brings a lot of experience. "He brings a lot of spirit and I like to have and play with offensive full-backs. He shows that quality and it's very important for the team."	Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse has been sidelined for 10 weeks with a fractured foot.
Lee Johnson, 45, had been a voluntary patient with depression at Maelor Hospital when he hanged himself in February 2016. The witnesses were asked to spell out changes in their working practices following his death. A narrative verdict was recorded and the health board said it fully accepted the coroner's findings. Sgt Johnson, of Pantymwyn, near Mold, served with the West Mercia force and was based in Oswestry. The two day inquest in Ruthin previously heard he had been under investigation for alleged misconduct by the police watchdog, although coroner John Gittins said it was "not of any great consequence". He had told his wife Barbara Johnson that he felt safe in the Heddfan unit and was described as a "model patient" and eager to engage with anything that would help him get better. But he spoke of suicide when under the influence of alcohol. Sgt Johnson was known to have taken alcohol on two occasions while in the unit, and was suspected of drinking on several other occasions. Mr Gittins said the unit had "entirely failed to address the risk" Sgt Johnson posed to himself, especially after consuming alcohol, and that the policy on patients taking alcohol needed to be far more robust. "As an outsider it is hard to understand how a person can be intoxicated in Heddfan," he said. Earlier, Dr Stuart Porter, interim clinical director with Betsi Cadwaladr health board, outlined improvements introduced in an action plan, including more one-to-one sessions, better documentation and liaison with family members. Asked whether the risk to Sgt Johnson had been underestimated in the light of previous incidents when he had been drinking, Dr Porter said: "Potentially yes, but predicting a risk is difficult." Recording his narrative conclusion, Mr Gittins said he felt existing policies were good and would work in practice. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Johnson, herself a police officer with North Wales Police, said her husband had been desperate to get help. She said she was encouraged by the health board's review but said she felt "they have not recognised the failings in his care that I believe contributed to his death". "I appreciated the coroner seeking reassurance from those staff that the lessons have, in fact, been learned," she said. Dr Porter extended the health board's "sincerest condolences to the family" and said they "fully accepted" the coroner's findings.	A coroner recalled six witnesses at the inquest of a police sergeant who died while in a psychiatric unit in Wrexham.
Mountaineering Scotland and the Scottish Gamekeepers Association have jointly written to Scotland's environment secretary. The Scottish government wants woodland cover to go from 17% to 25% by 2050. It said there would be "appropriate consideration of Scotland's distinctive upland landscapes." Scottish Natural Heritage said Scotland had a low percentage of woodland cover compared with other European countries. A commitment to plant 10,000 extra hectares of trees between now and 2022 was made in the government's draft Climate Plan. But, in an unusual alliance, Mountaineering Scotland and the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA), said they were concerned about the impact of the Scottish government's forestry targets on wild moorland. The letter states: "Our concern is whether adequate weight is being given to the significant changes this will have on the landscape of Scotland and in particular the dramatic open views and vistas which have come to signify to the outside world that which is unique about our country. "Until a vision and strategy for Scotland's uplands is in place, there is an obvious failure to join up what is required from the land to meet forestry targets and what we might want to keep in terms of internationally rare and valuable landscapes and ecosystems." The two organisations are calling for an urgent policy statement which protects moorlands. Neil Reid, from Mountaineering Scotland, told BBC Scotland: "It is a serious issue for both of us and that's why we have come together in this way. "There are many things we do disagree about, and will continue to disagree about, but the key thing is that we both need a coherent policy and an overall vision for the landscape of Scotland." The group, which represents hill walkers and mountaineers, wants moorland areas to be left untouched as a wild landscape for tourists. Those tourists, they argue, are an important contributor to the local economy. Mr Reid added: "They talk about this landscape, they don't talk about going for miles long wanders through woods. "You can see the hills around you, you see the shape of the landscape and it's also relatively benign for walking across." The two groups have invited the Scottish government to share its thinking on the relative value placed on woodland and moorland. Gamekeeper Bob Connelly said: "Heather heathland is one of the rarer types of habitat in the world. "We, in Britain, have a very large percentage of it and to cover it in trees is just ecological vandalism." Both groups emphasise that they are not opposed to tree planting but that sites have to be well chosen. Ecologist Dr James Fenton, who has written a document called "A Future for Moorland in Scotland" for the SGA, has echoed the calls for moorland protection. He said: "It's disparaged rather than being recognised as important so they'd be quite happy to get rid of our finest landscape. "[We would] lose them by attrition, one bit is lost to trees here or a dam there or a wind farm there and we are just losing our wild, wide open spaces which characterise Scotland, and that concerns me." Stuart Goodall, from the forestry body Confer, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "When we are creating woodland, it's not just about how can we pack in as many trees as we can in a block. "It's about how do we design that new woodland into the landscape, how do we create opportunities for wildlife." A Scottish government spokesman said: "The increased woodland creation targets announced by the Scottish government as part of its Climate Change Plan will be taken forward in a sustainable way, including working closely with a range of stakeholders. "This will include appropriate consideration of Scotland's distinctive upland landscapes."	Scotland's "dramatic open views and vistas" could be threatened by plans to increase woodland cover, according to mountaineers and gamekeepers.
There will be no Gatwick Express service and most Southern services will be diverted via London Bridge. Gatwick passengers will be able to use alternative services from Blackfriars or London Bridge. No services will operate between London Victoria and Brighton, but trains between the city and London Bridge will run in the early mornings and evenings. On Sunday, buses will replace trains between Gillingham and Faversham, and between Sittingbourne and Sheerness in Kent. Southeastern said rail replacement buses would also operate between Shepherdswell and Dover Priory on Monday. Network Rail has advised passengers planning to travel over the three-day holiday weekend to check timetables.	Rail passengers using the Brighton Main Line will face disruption over the bank holiday weekend from engineering work.
Mason has joined Championship rivals Wolves on a three-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee. Hudson played alongside Mason, who scored 22 goals in 60 league starts since joining Cardiff from Plymouth in 2011 "I wouldn't want to see him leave my squad," Huddersfield's Hudson said. Former Republic of Ireland Under-21 forward Mason had been a target for Wolves in the summer. "For me it's a strange one why they would need to sell to a rival club, especially another team looking to push into the play-offs," Hudson added. "I think he's a great player, his movement and the way he ghosts in and out of games. He always hits the target when he gets a chance. "If he's playing week in, week out I think he's probably going to be one of the top-scorers in the league." Wolves' Wales midfielder Dave Edwards, who will be out for 12 weeks after having surgery on a foot injury, says Mason would be a "much needed addition" to the squad. "We're a bit low on numbers at the moment, especially in the forward areas," Edwards told BBC Wales Sport. "I've always been impressed every time I've seen him. "I thought he played very well at Molineux a few weeks ago when we were beaten 3-1 [by Cardiff]. "He works hard for the team and hasn't got a bad goalscoring record either. He'll be great for us."	Former Cardiff City captain Mark Hudson does not understand why striker Joe Mason has been sold to Wolves.
The club has not been able to buy players since January this year after breaching Financial Fair Play rules. The news came the day after the club removed Russell Slade from his position as manager to take up a new role as the club's head of football. Slade will be in charge of the team for the last time when they play their final match of the season against Birmingham City at home on Saturday. The sanction will be lifted after the game, and means the club can start looking at potential summer recruits with the transfer window due to open on 10 June. Chief executive Ken Choo insisted the club would not rush appointing Slade's replacement. "We will take our time - we need to get the right person into the role," he said.	Cardiff City's transfer embargo has been lifted by the Football League.
In the Daily Telegraph, Lord Hague said he was asked the question "for months... everywhere I went abroad" if "we would lose heart" about leaving. He said he explained to them that "this really is a democracy". Lord Hague also backed a "transitional" withdrawal from the EU saying it had "immense" attractions. Lord Hague - who campaigned to remain in the EU - stood down as foreign secretary in 2014, and left the House of Commons in 2015. He wrote in Tuesday's Telegraph: "The electorate voted to leave the EU, and therefore we leave. "What is more, the number of people who voted to do so was higher than the number of votes cast for any government in our history. "To me and many of my former colleagues in government who preferred to remain, the argument was over. "In the recent general election, both main parties were clear that they were committed to the referendum outcome. "Globally, the message has now got through." But Lord Hague added that "just as the message was accepted, the voters pulled off another surprise and refused to give a majority to the ministers negotiating the exit" [in the general election]. He said there was the clear potential for Brexit to become the "greatest economic, diplomatic and constitutional muddle in the modern history of the UK, with unknowable consequences for the country, the government and the Brexit project itself". And he said the Chancellor Philip Hammond deserved "great credit" for putting forward a possible solution. Lord Hague said: "He has evidently been trying to persuade his cabinet colleagues that we should be seeking to stay in the EU single market and customs union during a transition and 'implementation' phase lasting to 2022, followed by a free trade deal with our former partners after that. "This is seen by longstanding advocates of leaving as a 'soft' position or a climbdown. "But in reality it is a plan to rescue Brexit from an approaching disaster." Mr Hammond has said any transitional deal in the period after Brexit must end by June 2022, the time of the next general election. But the chancellor said there must be "business as usual, life as normal" for Britons as the UK left the EU. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning	Business leaders and politicians asked former Foreign Secretary William Hague how the UK would "get round" the EU referendum result, he has revealed.
Peers backed a government bill paving the way for gay couples to marry. It is set to become law by the end of the week, with the first weddings in 2014. Labour's Lord Alli said its passage meant "my life and many others will be better today than it was yesterday". But Tory peer Lord Framlingham said the "ill-thought through" change had been "bulldozed" through Parliament. Peers approved the principle of same-sex marriage last month, despite efforts by opponents to "wreck" the legislation. MPs had earlier done the same, in the face of opposition from many Conservatives, the Church of England and other faith groups. Supporters of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill wore pink carnations during Monday's proceedings in the Lords, during which a series of minor amendments - including one relating to pension benefits for same-sex couples - were proposed. Government minister Lady Stowell said the bill "puts right something which is wrong" and had been improved by detailed scrutiny in the Upper House. "I can't claim to be a gay rights campaigner, but I am a firm believer in justice and fairness," she said. But the Gay Marriage No Thanks group claimed it had been prevented from mounting an advertising campaign around Parliament after its truck was vandalised and its driver threatened. After clearing the Lords, the bill will return to the Commons for a short debate on government amendments before the Commons begins its summer recess on Thursday. The bill must then receive Royal Assent before it becomes law.	Same-sex marriage in England and Wales is a step closer to becoming law after the House of Lords approved the change.
The General Penitentiary of Venezuela in central Guarico state was closed in October after violent clashes between inmates. The bodies, which are in an advanced state of decomposition, were found during works to refurbish the jail. So far none of the remains have been identified. The grave was discovered on Thursday and the number of bodies found since has risen from seven to 14. Forensic experts are continuing with their search and have not ruled out finding more bodies buried on the prison grounds. On Friday, prison minister Iris Varela wrote on Twitter that she had contacted the relatives of two inmates to ask for their help identifying the remains. The two prisoners disappeared when inmates were relocated from the General Penitentiary of Venezuela to other jails in October. An estimated 9,000 prisoners were locked up in the jail near the town of San Juan de los Morros prior to its closure, according to non-governmental organisation A Window on Freedom. The NGO says Venezuelan jails are woefully overcrowded and that last year 173 inmates died while in custody. But Ms Varela told Venezuelan state broadcaster VTV that the country had taken huge steps to improve the conditions of its prisons. She said that all of the country's women's and youth prisons had been brought up to new standards set by the Venezuelan government. "This is an achievement without precedent of the Bolivarian Revolution and the government of our president, Nicolas Maduro," she said. She said that President Maduro had asked her in 2014 to "impose maximum discipline" in Venezuelan jails. "Well, here I am fulfilling the president's orders," she said. She did not refer further to the remains found except to say that forensic tests were being carried out.	The number of bodies found in a mass grave in Venezuela's largest prison has risen to 14, the public prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Mobile phone footage taken by a visitor to Marwell Zoo in Winchester showed the moment one of the Sulawesi macaques ran into a food shop. Visitors took to social media to say they were locked inside shops while keepers tried to locate the pair at about 12:40 BST. The monkeys were returned to their home within 30 minutes and no one was hurt. Kevin O'Donnell posted on Twitter calling it a "great escape" and recorded one of the monkeys running around the zoo. One visitor posted: "Monkeys have escaped at Marwell Zoo currently hiding out with the giraffes". Another said Marwell staff acted "quickly and professionally". A spokesperson for the zoo said guests and staff were asked to remain indoors while keepers dealt with the situation, which took about 30 minutes. "We are grateful for the way in which our guests cooperated and thank them for their understanding," the spokesperson said. "Our thanks to our animal management team who responded swiftly and carried out a model response. "The two macaques have rejoined the rest of the family and all five will remain in the indoor part of their enclosure until a full investigation has been carried out. "Our vet team has carried out checks and we are happy to report that the animals came to no harm. The zoo remains open as usual."	A zoo was put on lockdown after two adult monkeys escaped from their enclosure in Hampshire.
The Tower of Refuge will be lit up in recognition of Rotary International's Thanks For Life campaign. The Rotary Club in Douglas is holding fundraising activities across the Isle of Man over the next seven days. Purple was chosen because medical teams stain children's little fingers with a purple dye to show they have been immunised. The campaign is the final push in the club's campaign to remove polio from the four countries where it is prevalent. Howard Callow is the chairman of club service at the Rotary Club of Douglas. He said: "Purple is the chosen colour and thanks to the help from the Department of Infrastructure we will see the Tower of Refuge turning purple, which will be quite a sight. "It's not the first time that important landmarks have been used, as part of a campaign, the Houses of Parliament in Westminster have been used, Table Mountain in South Africa has been used, so the Tower of Refuge is up there with the world's greatest heritage sights." Over the last 20 years, polio cases have been cut by 99%, and the condition is close to being eradicated. It is still endemic in Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. And it is present in more than 12 countries altogether.	An Isle of Man landmark will be bathed in purple light as part of a campaign to eradicate polio.
Poachers broke into a zoo in Paris and killed a rhino for its horn. The zoo's two other rhinos weren't hurt. ZSL Whipsnade is home to a herd of greater one-horned rhinos and white rhinos. They're kept in secure enclosures guarded by full time security teams who do regular patrols. They told us: "Our security teams at ZSL London Zoo and ZSL Whipsnade Zoo are aware of this tragic incident, and will be increasing their on-site patrols." Rhino horn can be sold illegally in places like China and Vietnam for huge amounts of money. It's believed this is the first time poachers have targeted a rhino in a European zoo. Newsround spoke to several other zoos across the UK who told us they're also looking at increasing or reviewing their security measures. Read Newsround's guide to poaching here.	The UK's biggest zoo has told Newsround they are increasing security patrols for their animals, after an incident at a French zoo.
The change, introduced on 1 May, means google.ps now displays "Palestine" in Arabic and English under Google's logo. Using the word Palestine is controversial for some. Israeli policy is that the borders of a Palestinian state are yet to be agreed. In November, the UN gave Palestine the status of "non-member observer state". The decision by the General Assembly was strongly opposed by Israel and the United States. Previously, Palestine only had "observer entity" status. It followed an unsuccessful Palestinian bid to join the international body as a full member state in 2011 because of a lack of support in the UN Security Council. Palestinians in general seek recognition for the state they are trying to establish and the adoption of the name Palestine. Israel considers any formal use of the word Palestine as pre-judging the outcome of currently stalled peace talks. In much of Israel's official terminology the West Bank is referred to as Judea and Samaria. In a statement given to the BBC on Friday, Google spokesman Nathan Tyler said: "We're changing the name 'Palestinian Territories' to 'Palestine' across our products. We consult a number of sources and authorities when naming countries. "In this case, we are following the lead of the UN, Icann [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers], ISO [International Organisation for Standardisation] and other international organisations." The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed Google's decision. "This is a step in the right direction, a timely step and one that encourages others to join in and give the right definition and name for Palestine instead of Palestinian territories," Dr Sabri Saidam, advisor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, told the BBC. "Most of the traffic that happens now happens in the virtual world and this means putting Palestine on the virtual map as well as on the geographic maps," he added. Dr Saidam said that since the UN vote on 29 November, the PA had written to international companies, including Google, asking them to replace their usage of "Palestinian Territories" with "Palestine".	Internet giant Google has changed the tagline on the homepage of its Palestinian edition from "Palestinian Territories" to "Palestine".
Life "would be boring without gossip", he told Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev at talks in St Petersburg. The 62-year-old appeared relaxed and smiled before the television cameras. His disappearance from public view had sparked rumours that he might have fallen ill, died, been removed in a coup, or once again become a father. Earlier on Monday, Mr Putin ordered the Russian navy's Northern Fleet on to a state of full combat readiness in the Arctic. It came as more than 45,000 troops, as well as warplanes and submarines, started major military exercises across northern Russia. A brief video of Mr Putin's meeting with his Kyrgyz counterpart at the Constantine Palace in Russia's second city was broadcast by state television without sound. There was no obvious sign that Mr Putin had been or still was suffering from any medical condition, says the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow. Asked by reporters about the speculation on his health, the Russian leader replied: "It would be boring without gossip." Finally the mysterious Mr Putin has been found. It is now official: he is neither dead nor would it seem has he been stricken by some life-threatening illness. In fact he looked reasonably healthy in the video broadcast of the meeting with his Kyrgyz counterpart Almazbek Atambayev in St Petersburg. But while the Kremlin press office is having the last laugh about all the wild rumours of the past week, it's still saying nothing about why he cancelled meetings and was not seen in public for what was, for him, a long absence. And so at least some of the rumours may persist about what was happening behind the scenes. What is known is that on this the day of his return to the limelight, he has ordered the northern fleet of the Russian navy to conduct a massive combat readiness exercise. This comes as the US continues to deliver military equipment to the Baltic states and Poland, and while Nato navy exercises continue in the Black Sea. So it's straight back to business as usual. Where has Putin been? The best of the memes Mr Atambayev, for his part, said Mr Putin had driven him around the palace for 20 minutes before the meeting. "I can confirm that he's in excellent form," he was quoted by one journalist as saying. Mr Putin's last public appearance was on 5 March when he met Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Last week, he cancelled a number of scheduled events, including a visit to Kazakhstan that was due to take place on Thursday and Friday, and the signing of an agreement with South Ossetia. As speculation about Mr Putin's disappearance mounted, the hashtag #Putinumer (#Putinisdead) trended on Twitter. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was forced to counter questions about each rumour, dismissing them as "March madness". "So everyone has now seen the paralysed president captured by a general who has just returned from Switzerland where he was delivering a baby?" Mr Peskov asked journalists sarcastically on Monday. He said Mr Putin and Mr Atambayev had met at the Constantine Palace because the Kyrgyz leader's daughter was studying nearby. Mr Putin's reappearance coincides with the first anniversary of a controversial referendum in Crimea, which Russia used as justification for annexing the Ukrainian peninsula. In a pre-recorded interview which aired on Sunday, Mr Putin said he had been ready to put nuclear Putin laughs off absence rumours weapons on standby at the time. The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, issued a sharp statement on Crimea on Monday, condemning Russia's actions. "The EU reaffirms its deep concern at the continuous military build-up and deterioration of the human rights situation in the Crimean peninsula, including the denial of free speech and the persecution of persons belonging to minorities," she said in a statement. The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko urged the European Union on Monday to renew its threat of further sanctions against Russia if Moscow does not implement the Minsk agreement. The accord calls for a ceasefire and demilitarised buffer zones in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed rebels. Mr Poroshenko was speaking after talks in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had helped negotiate the ceasefire deal. He said if the commitments were not fulfilled, he hoped that EU leaders would say very clearly at their summit on Thursday that sanctions would "be stepped up".	Russian President Vladimir Putin has laughed off speculation about his health after making his first appearance in public since 5 March.
"Is it always sunny here?" asked The Van T's from the stage during a pause between songs. The reply from the audience inside the big top to the Glasgow band's question was wry laughter. Outside the sun was blazing, as it had done the previous day, but at the back of the tent were muddy puddles. The marshy patch was a reminder of the heavy rain and gale-force winds that battered the north-west Highlands only a few days earlier. But this year's Loopallu, a two-day festival in the picturesque town that every year is officially opened by Ullapool and District Pipe Band, was blessed with some cracking weather. Colourful wellies, today's must-have festival footwear, looked as out of place in the sunshine as the t-shirts and sunburns did on Friday's last day of September and Saturday's first of October. Back in the big top, young guitar band The Van T's powered through the rest of their set. On the very same stage the night before, Feeder, who were probably writing chart hits before The Van T's were even born, closed Friday's first day of Loopallu. Earlier that day had seen performances by acts such as Lional, Manran and Fatherson. Feeder packed out the big top late on Friday night. Even the much avoided soggy corner of the tent had music fans jumping up and down on it as they belted out Buck Rogers. It was a chilly night for those under canvas in the festival campsite, with the clear sky dropping temperatures to close to zero. Going to the toilet in the middle night also came with an unusual, and slightly hazardous distraction. With Ullapool's low light pollution, the stars glittered brightly in the clear sky and it was hard not to look straight up to gawp. However, this meant not paying attention to the maze of trip wire-like tent guy ropes. Saturday dawned with a yet another cloud-less blue sky. It was mirrored in the milk pond still waters of nearby Loch Broom. Little groups of festival-goers gathered on the loch's pebbled shore to drink coffee or tea and to skim stones across the loch's waters. Everyone paused to watch the arrival of the Stornoway to Ullapool ferry the MV Loch Seaforth. From the other end of the beach came two locals. The men harvested mussels from among long strips of kelp washed up on the shore. The shellfish they gathered in a bucket were in shells the size of their fists. Gradually, the nearby festival site started coming to life. The Van T's were among the first acts up and they were later followed by the Little Mammoths. During their set, the Little Mammoths paid tribute to Gord Downie, the lead singer of Canadian band The Tragically Hip. The band recently finished a farewell tour of Canada after rock musician and writer Downie was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Back outside in the sunshine, folk did a double take as a pirate walked among them. The man in the frock coat and tricorn hat was Mark Radcliffe, the BBC Six Music DJ and drummer in the sea shanty singing band Galleon Blast. Radcliffe was making his fifth appearance at Loopallu with one his bands. It was Galleon Blast's debut appearance at the festival and they closed the beer tent on Friday night and were on the main stage on Saturday. Miles Hunt, lead singer of The Wonder Stuff, also wandered among the crowds in Saturday's afternoon sun. The Wonder Stuff, whose hits include 1991's Dizzy, were second to last on the bill that night following earlier performances on the stage by Lucy Spraggan, Eliza and the Bear and The Selecter. Bringing the night, and the festival, to a formal close were British rock veterans The Stranglers, who kicked off their set with Tank and finished on No More Heroes. And with that Loopallu - and its heroes - were done for another year.	The Loopallu music festival was held at the weekend in Ullapool, bringing together well-known acts, newcomers and several thousand music fans.
Harrold has scored nine goals in 68 games for Crawley since signing from Bristol Rovers in June 2014. The 32-year-old acted as player-manager in the Reds' final game of last season following Dermot Drummy's departure. "I feel like I've got a bit of a point to prove after my injuries and the tough season last year," he told the club website.	Crawley striker Matt Harrold has signed a new contract to stay with the League Two side until the end of next season.
The Xylella fastidiosa bacteria also threatens citrus fruit and vineyards. The Commission says at least 10% of the 11 million olive trees in Lecce are infected. It wants Italy to destroy infected trees and restrict any trade in species vulnerable to the disease. New emergency measures are to be proposed by the Commission this week. Thousands of hectares of olives are affected by the outbreak - a major worry for Italy, which is the EU's second biggest olive oil producer after Spain. The Commission set out a range of measures to contain the outbreak last July, but says the situation has deteriorated since then and more action is needed. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) says the disease, which kills trees by desiccation, is spread by various sap-sucking insects. An EFSA spokesperson told the BBC that there remain "a lot of uncertainties" about the Italian outbreak, despite a comprehensive EFSA study of it published in January. "Even trees not showing symptoms might carry the bacteria, which makes it really difficult. Just cutting down trees with symptoms might not be enough," he said. Italian officials in Lecce say 15km-wide (nine-mile) buffer strips will be created around plantations which have infected trees. Those strips should be free of species vulnerable to the disease, so that the blight is contained. Local officials, quoted by Italy's AGI news agency, suspect the disease entered Italy through ornamental plants imported from Costa Rica. The Xylella blight has previously ravaged vineyards in California and citrus groves in Brazil, EFSA says. A local campaign group called Peacelink disputes the EU data on the disease, however, arguing that a fungal infection is most likely to blame. In a letter to EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis, Peacelink says more than 500 olive trees treated for fungi have recovered since spring last year. It says research by the University of Foggia pointed to fungi, rather than Xylella, as the cause. Peacelink urged the EU not to destroy olive trees en masse in the affected area, saying such a move would be "totally unnecessary".	Italy must step up efforts to contain a bacterial disease blighting olive trees in the southern province of Lecce, the European Commission has warned.
Their study of more than 7,000 people suggests exposure to bleach and other chemicals is a factor in one in six cases of adult-onset asthma among British people in their mid-50s . The study, in Thorax, identified 18 high-risk jobs - four of which involved cleaning. Top of the list were farmers, followed by aircraft mechanics and typesetters. General cleaners, office cleaners, domestic helpers and care workers all featured on the list. So too did hairdressers and laundry workers. Experts say a person's working environment is to blame rather than their occupation per se. Hundreds of occupational agents have been linked to asthma. This includes flour and grain as well as detergents. Fine particles can be inhaled into the airways and cause irritation. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Ghosh said cleaning products were starting to be recognised as a potential cause of asthma. She said there were specific Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) guidelines relating to cleaning products. Employers are expected to control exposures to hazardous substances and report any cases of occupational asthma. "Occupational asthma is widely under-recognised by employers, employees and healthcare professionals. Raising awareness that this is an almost entirely preventable disease would be a major step in reducing its incidence," Dr Ghosh said. Malayka Rahman, of Asthma UK, said: "We advise anyone who works in the industries highlighted in this study and who have experienced breathing problems to discuss this with their GP, and we urge healthcare professionals to make sure they consider possible occupational causes in adult-onset asthma and tailor their advice to people with asthma accordingly."	People who work with cleaning products risk developing asthma, believe UK experts who have explored the link.
The watchdog is working with social media and leafleting every household about signing up. It has backed Facebook's new "life event" feature enabling people to tell friends they have registered to vote. The ballot on 18 September will ask the "Yes/No" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" More than 4.1m people had registered to vote by 10 March 2014, according to the Commission's most recent figures. Those eligible to vote in Scotland include British, Irish and all other EU citizens as well as Commonwealth citizens. For the first time in the UK, the minimum voting age in the referendum has been lowered to 16. On 18 September millions of voters in Scotland will be able to decide whether their country should become independent. But how do voters register and then cast their ballot? BBC Scotland reporter Andrew Black takes you through the steps in this interactive guide. The Electoral Commission says that people must register to vote by 2 September. Scottish Facebook users who visit the social network site over the next few weeks will see posts in their newsfeed about an interactive referendum guide from the commission. Facebook politics and government specialist Elizabeth Linder said: "Millions of people from all walks of life use Facebook in Scotland, and have turned to Facebook in recent weeks to share their views on the independence debate. "But participating in the debate online isn't enough to get your opinion counted on September 18. "If you're not registered, you can't vote. It's that simple. "We hope that by enabling millions of people in Scotland to see this guide in their Facebook newsfeed, more people will know how to cast their ballot and have their say." As well as targeting young voters, the Electoral Commission is targeting other groups who are less likely to be registered to vote, including students and the homeless. Alex Robertson, director of communication at the commission, said: "We're working hard to make sure we reach all potential voters with our information campaign but we don't want to take any chances. "We're asking people to help spread the word and make sure that no one misses out on having their say. "We've produced lots of resources that people can use to do this. "They are free to use and anyone can get them from www.aboutmyvote.co.uk or by calling our helpline on 0800 3 280 280."	The Electoral Commission is intensifying efforts to encourage people in Scotland to register to vote in next month's referendum.
The grey and white mammal became stuck on sandbanks on Thursday at Saltney Ferry, near Chester. An RNLI lifeboat hoisted the dolphin out of the water before carrying it out to sea, according to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue. The dolphin, in the river since Monday, will be taken three miles off the coast of Rhyl. Alan Forrester, lifeboat operations manager with Flint RNLI, told Radio Wales the rescue boat was launched at Connah's Quay after the dolphin was seen "floundering" on a sandbank. It was hoisted onto the lifeboat and carried down the river towards open water. An animal welfare officer is also onboard. "We've got what we call an ambulance pouch, which is a rolled up stretcher," Mr Forrester added. "They laid that on the sandbank and rolled the dolphin into the stretcher and lifted it into the lifeboat. "It's rather a large dolphin. It's lying there nicely, they've got buckets of water to keep it cool - everything seems to be ok at the moment." The mammal was originally spotted by the public on Monday in Connah's Quay docks and became stranded briefly on Tuesday after turning to make its way to Flint and towards the sea. Liverpool coastguard wanted to hold off a rescue attempt for as long as possible to avoid coming into physical contact with the mammal in case it is rejected back at sea. A coastguard team was earlier deployed to the area to try to ensure the safety of spectators trying to catch a glimpse of the dolphin. It is thought the dolphin swam up the river during the high spring tide. It is rare for dolphins to be seen in the River Dee but a pair of porpoises were reported near  Queensferry Bridge eight years ago.	A dolphin has been rescued after swimming miles up the River Dee in Flintshire four days ago.
The three-day tie begins on 7 April, five days after the Miami Open, which is played outdoors on a hard court. World number one Andy Murray, who sat out Britain's 3-2 victory over Canada in the Davis Cup World Group first round, is expected to play in Miami. Britain beat France in the quarter-finals in 2015, when they won the title for the first time in 79 years. Murray, 29, said earlier this month he expected to return against France after a break following his fourth-round exit from the Australian Open. Rouen's Palais des Sports can accommodate 5,200 spectators.	Great Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final against France in April will be played on an indoor clay court in Rouen.
Using pictures from the Cassini probe, the researchers have detected and tracked a slight wobble in the moon. After seven years of study, they have concluded this flutter would be much less if the icy crust was connected directly to Enceladus's rock core. It is strong support for the idea of an intervening, global mass of liquid. "If the surface and core were rigidly connected, the core would provide so much dead weight that the wobble would be far smaller than we observe it to be," said Matthew Tiscareno, a Cassini scientist based at the Seti Institute but previously affiliated to Cornell University, US. "This proves that there must be a global layer of liquid separating the surface from the core." Activity on Enceladus has been one of the great discoveries on the Cassini mission, which arrived at Saturn in 2004. The first clue that something interesting was going on was some low-resolution images showing a plume coming off the south pole that had the space-interested internet all abuzz. Shortly after, Cassini detected a disturbance in magnetic fields produced by the presence of what appeared to be an atmosphere. Scientists then established that the moon was actually venting huge jets of water vapour through south polar surface cracks dubbed tiger stripes because of their resemblance to the big cat's fur coat. Models were subsequently produced to explain how liquid water could be maintained on a 500km-wide body in the outer Solar System, and how that water might be feeding the jets. But there has always been a debate about how large the hidden reservoir might be. Early thinking suggested it might only be a relatively small lens of water. This new result, published in the journal Icarus, is the best evidence yet that the sub-surface sea is not regional in nature, but encircles the entire globe. It is significant because it makes it more possible that Enceladus is a habitable world.  In those jets, Cassini has also detected salts and organic molecules.  The chemistry has scientists intrigued, and fired up to send a dedicated mission to the moon. When that might happen is unclear.  Both the US and European space agencies are only planning currently to send probes to Jupiter, and even they are not likely to get to their destination until the 2030s. Cassini itself is winding up its observations in the Saturn system.  It has another couple of close passes of Enceladus this year before it then starts to manoeuvre towards disposal in the ringed planet's atmosphere in 2017.

He says there was no talk of heroics in the songs the soldiers were singing in the trenches or in the music halls back in Blighty. "Another surprise was that there were very few songs with any animosity towards the Germans, who they were fighting," says McCalman. "It was quite unbelievable that the wrath of the soldiers was directed at their own Command." Last week, England's education secretary Michael Gove sparked a heated debate when he hit out at "left-wing academics" and TV comedies and dramas which had led people to view the conflict as a "misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite". McCalman, whose show Far Far From Ypres will be performed at Celtic Connections later, says the theme of disillusionment with their situation and their commanders carries through all the songs, the poetry and the letters of the time. One song - Hanging on the Old Barbed Wire - asks why various army members are not to be found in the combat zone or anywhere near the trenches. The popular song has the quarter-master "miles and miles behind the line", the Sergeant-major is "stealing the privates' rum" and the Commissioned Officer is "down in a deep dug-out". The final line of the song asks, where are the "old battalion"? It answers poignantly: "They're hanging on the old barbed wire." It is a simple song, says McCalman, but one of the saddest in the show. Far Far From Ypres began life as an album of songs and poems from WW1, which were recorded by Scottish folk singers. McCalman, who says he is "not very proud" to admit that he knew very little about World War One or its songs before he began the project, was then inspired to write a narrative around the songs. It tells the story of Jimmy MacDonald who "comes from any village, town or city" in Scotland. Everyman Jimmy is full of enthusiasm and joins up as soon as he can, as so many did. Jimmy gets his basic training on Salisbury Plain before heading off to the trenches of Flanders field. The show, which is narrated by broadcaster Iain Anderson, features 28 of the finest singers from the Celtic Connections family, such as Barbara Dickson and Dick Gaughan. It will play out at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall against a backdrop of images from the war. It was such a success when first performed in 2012 that it has been brought back to the festival to mark 100 years since the start of the "war to end all wars". McCalman says the show is a labour of love for the performers, whom he jokes are "appearing for World War One wages". The songs, simple as many of them are, give a vivid insight into the attitudes and concerns of the troops in the trenches, he says. "They survived on bitter humour. They just had to grin and bear it. "The simplest song of the whole lot was called 'We are here because we're here'." This song just repeats its title over and over, betraying the trapped, futility of their situation. "There was nothing else, there were no other words that they could say. They were stuck there," McCalman says. Another song shows a surprising amount of solidarity with the German soldiers in the opposing trenches. 'Keep your head down Fritzie boy' has British troops in the trenches "up to their eyes in clay" when they spy a German "sticking up his snout". Remarkably the Tommies shout at their enemy, warning him he is going to get shot if he is not careful. Other songs such as Gassed last night bemoan the shortage of equipment, in this case respirators to survive the chemical gas attacks. The bitterness and disillusionment in the songs continues for those who survive the war. "I wore a tunic, a dirty khaki tunic" is about the perception that people who had not gone to the war had done much better by it. It contains the line "You were with the wenches/While we were in the trenches/Facing an angry foe". McCalman says despite the bitter tone of the songs they leave him, the singers and the audience with nothing but admiration for the sacrifices of the thousands of Scots who went to war. He says: "If I had been there I would have been shot in the back by the Sergeant major because I would have been the first to run. "So there is an element of hypocrisy in my admiration because I could never be as brave as they were."	The songs of World War 1 often speak of disillusionment, bitterness, boredom and a very dark sense of humour, says Scottish folk singer and producer Ian McCalman.
He worked under Billy Reid at Hamilton Academical, and advised Reid to move to Swansea City when the club wanted him to replace Paulo Sousa five years ago, but Reid chose to stay. He is now an assistant manager in Sweden's second tier. Neil is ambitious, and has always indicated a desire to test himself at the highest level. So he was always likely to accept the offer to succeed Neil Adams at Carrow Road. Reid was his friend, but also the man who shaped his career. Neil was a right-back when he pitched up at Hamilton from Mansfield Town in 2005; Reid restored him to a holding midfield role because of two significant qualities: his tenacity and his ability to read the game. Those traits have served Neil well. He only became Hamilton player-manager in April 2013, when Reid stepped down. Since then, he has guided the club to promotion - via the play-offs last summer - and to an eye-catching campaign in the Premiership, which has included topping the table in October. For perspective, no side in the top division has a lower wage budget. Hamilton regularly field a team in which half of the players have come through the youth ranks, and he led the team to their first win at Celtic Park since 1938. Following that 1-0 win, Neil gathered all of the players and club officials in the dressing room and urged them to make the most of the moment, and to build on it. The display and result were typical of Neil - not least because he was booked in the second half, while still amongst the substitutes. He has a steely edge, and can occasionally be overly aggressive. That tends to generally be controlled, though, and the spikiness will be required as he tries to impose his authority on the Norwich squad. Many of the players will be around the same age as Neil - who is 33 - and most will have played at a higher level and earned more money from their careers. In a world where wealth and kudos are commodities, Neil must find a way to display leadership and motivation without compromising his principles. "He's very calm and won't be fazed," said the former Rangers midfielder Derek Ferguson, who regularly reports on Hamilton games for BBC Scotland and whose youngest son is a youth player at New Douglas Park. "I did my B coaching badge with him. He has an edge and that's really important." The victory over Celtic was also typical of Neil because he was not prepared to limit his players or alter his tactical approach. Reid would often make Hamilton more defensive when they played bigger clubs, but Neil urges his players to have belief in their abilities and to trust in their game plan. The approach has worked, which is why Neil became Norwich's choice to replace Adams. Reid believes that his protege will succeed, remarking on him being "grounded" and that there is "no chance he will be overawed by the challenge down there". Reid has also spoken about his decisions being challenged by Neil in the dressing room, but with his captain asking questions "in the right way". Reid tasked him with personally overseeing the development of James McCarthy and James McArthur, who broke through at Hamilton as teenagers and now play for Everton and Crystal Palace respectively. Neil will become the second youngest manager in the Football League. Norwich even had to technically sign him as a player, since his registration needed to be transferred to the Football Association from its Scottish counterpart. As a manager, he is clear-sighted and principled. His Hamilton side played passing football, initiating swift, incisive counter attacks that were built upon well-organised and strategically shrewd tactics. Always in a 4-1-4-1 formation, with forward-thinking players out wide. Accies' approach is so ordered and sound that individuals can fit seamlessly into different positions because they all know what is expected of them. Neil, like all of the new generation of managers, relies on comprehensive analysis of his own team's performance and those of opponents. The Norwich players will be used to that kind of approach, but Neil does face challenges. At Hamilton, he had coached the younger age group teams before becoming manager, so had worked with many of the players already. They were also well-versed in the club's style, and most were young, so open to technical coaching and instruction. The players at Norwich will be more established in their ways. Even so, Neil is a strong character. "I'm a very secure person," Neil has said. "I have very few insecurities in terms of confidence, speaking to a group and putting my message across. "I don't mind demanding the most out of them or booting someone up the backside if I feel they aren't pulling their weight. All these sides to the job don't really bother me. It's something that comes naturally." Like Reid, he is able to inspire players. Neil has spoken of his willingness to risk long-term injury to play for Reid, and the guilt he felt whenever he wasn't playing for the team, because he felt he was personally letting Reid down. After the news broke that Norwich and Hamilton had agreed compensation, many of the players leaving New Douglas Park looked visibly shaken and upset. It is a small, close-knit club and Neil made sure to know the partners and families of his players. He will have to adapt to the size and demands of Norwich, but he is good at sizing up challenges. Following Reid might have daunted lesser characters, but instead of trying to copy his predecessor, Neil altered Hamilton's approach, so that the players were more focused on their own playing style, rather than countering the tactics of the opposition. Neil also capably handled the challenges of combining playing and management. He was often Hamilton's best player, and understood how to juggle the two roles. He once fined himself for indiscipline on the field, by taking 24 players out for a three-course lunch. Neil is a talented and capable manager. His inexperience will test the limits of his potential, and the job at Norwich is of a very different stature to Hamilton, but in his own mind he is ready.	New Norwich City manager Alex Neil has learned from the successes and mistakes of his mentor.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is believed to have deployed about 30,000 fighters. US-led coalition warplanes will support the offensive and Russia has also given its backing. The SDF did not mention any plan to take Raqqa, the de facto capital of the "caliphate" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The alliance, which is dominated by the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia, has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition over the past two years, leading the fight against IS on the ground in northern Syria. With the help of US airpower, it has taken control of about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles) of territory, including a 400km (250 mile) stretch along the Turkish border. On Tuesday, SDF fighters were seen moving south from Tal Abyad near the Turkish border towards Ain Issa, a town about 60km (37 miles) north-west of Raqqa, according to UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Clashes were reported nearby, it added. SDF commander Rojda Felat wrote on Twitter that the goal of the new offensive was to "liberate northern Raqqa" and those living under IS "oppression". "The campaign is aimed at repelling terrorist attacks on Shaddadi, Tal Abyad and Kobane, ensuring the security of our people," she added. An SDF source told the Kurdish news agency, Rudaw, that fighters would be "advancing to the villages of Big Fatiseh, Small Fatiseh and Tishi, in order to clear them of [IS] militants first". BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville says IS fighters are digging in, ready for the assault. As well as defensive placements in Raqqa, they have constructed an extensive network of tunnels, he adds. A Baghdad-based spokesman for the US-led coalition, Col Steve Warren, said the SDF operation was aimed at "putting pressure on Raqqa", but not taking the city. The SDF fighters had so far met little resistance, he added. The anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), reported that there had been air strikes on IS positions north of Raqqa on Tuesday, and that intense fighting had erupted around the village of Heisha. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Moscow was ready to co-ordinate with the SDF and the US on the offensive. The SDF's announcement followed a meeting between officials in the alliance and a top US commander in northern Syria on Saturday. Gen Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, made the secret trip to check on the 200 US military personnel who were advising the SDF on the ground. The US wants to increase the number of Arab fighters in the SDF, which currently consists of at least 25,000 Kurds and between 5,000 and 6,000 Arabs, before trying to retake Raqqa. Col Warren said about 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters were inside Raqqa. IS seized the city in August 2013, five months after it became the first Syrian provincial capital to fall to rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad. The jihadist group quickly established its headquarters there and began imposing its vision of a state, implementing a strict interpretation of Islamic law.	A US-backed alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters has begun a campaign to expel Islamic State (IS) militants from land north of Raqqa.
The girls ate othalanga, a local fruit, at the Water Sports Centre in southern Kerala state, reports said. The girls, all rowers, were allegedly being harassed by senior athletes and their trainer, their families allege. The government-run Sports Authority of India which runs the centre has ordered an inquiry into the incident. "They had left behind a suicide note. The jurisdictional magistrate has also recorded the statement of one of them. The police investigation is also on," SAI (Sports Authority of India) director general Injeti Srinivas told reporters in Delhi. SAI official G Kishore, who has been asked to conduct the inquiry, told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that the condition of one of the girls admitted to hospital was critical while the other two were out of danger. The athletes were taken to hospital on Wednesday evening after they were found unconscious in a room of their hostel.	A 15-year-old Indian athlete has died and three others are in hospital after allegedly consuming poisonous fruit in what is suspected to be a suicide pact.
Media playback is not supported on this device You hope the call to abandon the match never has to be taken Referees' chief Mike Riley on racism A BBC Panorama programme highlighted racism incidents at grounds in Poland and Ukraine, who co-host Euro 2012. Manchester City and Italy striker Mario Balotelli threatened to walk off the pitch if he believed he was a victim. But Platini said: "It's a yellow card. It's not a player - Mr Balotelli - who's in charge of refereeing." Platini insists officials will deal with any racist incidents that occur during the tournament, which begins on Friday. "It's the referee who takes these decisions. Referees can finish the game. They have this power in case of racism," Platini told the BBC sports editor David Bond. "That is, I think, the best way to protect the game against racism. "The referee has been given advice and he can stop the game if there are problems." But both Premier League referees' chief Mike Riley and executive director of Football Against Racism in Europe, Piara Powar, say the situation should not arise. Piara said: "[Euro 2012 Respect ambassador Pierluigi] Collina was clear that if a player did approach a referee and was looking for help, that the referee would then facilitate the player leaving the field of play. "There would be no question of yellow or red cards being issued." Platini dismissed suggestions his reputation would be tarnished if there is racial abuse at Euro 2012. "Are you joking? You think I am responsible for the racists in the rest of Europe or in England or in France?" he said. Platini said Uefa had done a lot to tackle racisim, backing such initiatives as 'Never Again', but said he was "not responsible for society". He added: "Society is not so easy. You have some problems and we have to organise these Euros from the beginning with some problems because these two countries never welcome so big an event in the past. "Over the next month Ukraine and Poland will be in the spotlight in a way they have never encountered before. Should it go wrong then the reputation of Uefa and its ambitious French president will also be on the line." Read the rest of David's blog here "It was a big challenge for Poland, big challenge for Ukraine, a big challenge for Uefa, and we have done our best." Asked about the footage shown in Panorama's documentary, Platini said: "We are shocked about racists but we are trying to do something; we have to fight against that. "I feel bad. Of course I feel bad because I am not a racist." The 56-year-old former France international midfiedler also insisted the issue of racism is one that extends far beyond the two host nations of Euro 2012. Platini, who has been Uefa president since January 2007, said: "If you want to have a programme on racism you can go everywhere now because there is an increase in the nationalists in many, many countries. "It is not just a fact only in Poland and Ukraine. "You can go in France, United States, in England and you will find the problem of racism. "You have more nationalists in many, many countries in east of Europe - that is true." The Uefa president has previously criticised the host nations, describing Ukrainian hoteliers as "bandits" for the rising cost of accommodation and bemoaning the quality of pitches in Poland. The Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, has downplayed fears over racist attacks in Ukraine, saying hooligans were known to the authorities and security services "will be watching all the matches closely".	Uefa president Michel Platini says that any players who walk off the pitch at Euro 2012 due to racial abuse will be booked.
The 21-year-old had already been absent earlier this season with a knee problem that had limited him to just one first-grade appearance. The Warriors have also lost prop Tony Clubb for an indeterminate spell while he undergoes an routine operation. Clubb, 29, has a medical condition but is expected to make a full recovery. He has played nine games this season, including the World Club Challenge success against NRL premiers Cronulla Sharks in February. "Unfortunately sport can be cruel and this is definitely the case for both Tony and Jake," rugby director Kris Radlinski said. "It's a tough pill to swallow but we will give them all of our support, as I'm sure will the Wigan fans and we look forward to seeing them back out on the field playing for Wigan."	Wigan Warriors half-back Jake Shorrocks is likely to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury sustained in non-contact training.
South Yorkshire Police hopes to build the 50-cell suite in Shepcote Lane, near to Meadowhall shopping centre. It will replace suites in Ecclesfield, Sheffield and Rotherham, saving more than £1m a year said the police. Ch Supt Rob Odell said it was hoped the new suite would be completed by the summer of 2016. He said: "We anticipate that replacing three existing properties within Rotherham and Sheffield with one purpose-built facility will deliver annual savings of approximately £1.2m. "The majority of this will come from a reduction in staffing, but there will be other revenue savings and energy efficiencies too. "We are consulting regularly with the staff affected, who are mainly custody sergeants and detention officers, and we hope to achieve the savings through natural wastage." A public consultation on the plans has begun.	Plans for a £19m police custody centre to replace three "outdated and inefficient" suites are being submitted to Sheffield City Council.
And the guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) were well placed to profit from the illegal drugs trade. Today, there are still small fields of bright green coca cut from the virgin jungle, but the rebels have found a more lucrative, and far safer, source of income: gold. It was here the US military aid package, known as Plan Colombia, which has amounted to some $8bn (Â£5bn) since 1999, was concentrated. Since 2000, fleets of spray planes have dropped glyphosate chemicals over the coca bushes, managing to reduce, but never eradicate, drug production. What the chemicals have done is push local farmers into the new, informal industry of gold mining. "We estimate that the Farc here make 800m pesos ($450,000) a week from illegal gold mining," said Jhimmy Calvache, the acting mayor of Mocoa in Putumayo province. Colombia has vast gold deposits, especially along the rivers that wash down from the Andes Mountains. It was gold that drew the Spanish conquistadors here in the 16th Century, and now, with prices high for precious metal, gold fever has returned. Mechanical diggers operate along the riverbeds and banks in Putumayo, protected by heavily armed rebels who allow no access to the sites and impose huge "taxes" on production. In March, police sought to send in investigators to find out how much gold was being extracted. They ran into trigger-happy guerrillas and it was decided that, without massive army support, there was no chance of making any meaningful inquiries. The operation was abandoned. While the illegal exploitation of gold in Putumayo is still in its infancy, it is well developed in other parts of the country. In the northern department of Antioquia, the Farc have established a series of extortion schemes on the gold miners, legal and illegal. For every mechanical digger that enters their territory, the rebels charge an initial "tax" of up to $3,000 and another $2,000 per piece of heavy machinery for every month of operation. In the gold-rich municipality of Anori in Antioquia, authorities believe there are up to 120 diggers operating, earning the local Farc unit a monthly income of at least $240,000. There are 125 municipalities in Antioquia. "Gold is now more lucrative than coca," says Antioquia Governor Sergio Fajardo. The guerrillas are not just extorting money but running some mining operations themselves or demanding a percentage of all production. The advantage of gold is that it is perfectly legal to transport and sell, unlike cocaine. Indeed, legally registered mines have become a favourite acquisition for drug traffickers as well, as they are perfect vehicles for laundering money. The mining companies can claim any amount of gold is being extracted and then traffickers put all their money from cocaine sales through the books. On condition of anonymity, a mine worker in Anori played the recording on his telephone of a call he said was from the Farc demanding payment. "Don't try my patience this month," growled a low voice, "don't make me look for you, or the machines will be burnt and you may become a military objective [this is guerrilla speak for becoming a target for assassination]." He paid, and continues paying, even during the rainy season when the rising water levels make extracting gold from the river bed almost impossible. In Putumayo, there is clear evidence that the rebels are strengthening themselves thanks to the cash from gold. In the remote municipality of Puerto Guzman, 400 people were called in April by the rebels to attend a political meeting, where they said they were forced to listen to Marxist doctrine. These meetings are increasingly common. In Piamonte, accessible only by canoe, the rebels run football tournaments for the young people, to hook them in and prepare them for recruitment. "We had a rebel incursion last month," said Piamonte local councillor Carlos Martinez, who moved his children away for fear of Farc recruitment. "The guerrillas came into the town, to within 30 metres of the police station. The policemen did nothing, they never left their base." The police station is a series of bunkers connected by trenches. Resupply is done by US-supplied Blackhawk helicopters. Their landing is covered by a helicopter gunship hovering over the town, the gunner's finger never leaving the trigger of his machine gun that is capable of firing 800 rounds a minute. A young policeman offered a few words from the barrier to the base, refusing to come out or let me in. "We don't get much co-operation from the local community here. We never leave the town," he said, glancing nervously at the high ground within sniper range. Putumayo used to produce up to 100 tonnes of cocaine a year. Now it produces around 40 tonnes. But the shortfall in Farc revenue has been more than made up with illegal mining of gold. As Colombia's conflict enters its 49th year, the 9,000-strong rebels are looking to gold to fund new offensives against the state.	A decade ago, the Colombian region of Putumayo was the main production centre for coca, the raw material for cocaine.
Officials say Scott Stockert - who is from the state of North Dakota - was planning to snatch one of the dogs, either Bo or Sunny. Police in Washington DC found weapons in Mr Stockert's vehicle, including a shotgun, a rifle and a machete. Agents say he made several outlandish claims during his arrest, including that he intended to run for president. He also said he was the son of former President John F Kennedy and actress Marilyn Monroe, according to court documents. Mr Stockert has been charged with violating the District of Columbia's gun laws. The First Family acquired Bo in 2009, with Sunny, referred to by the family as Bo's "little sister", following in 2013.	US police have arrested a man who allegedly plotted to kidnap one of President Obama's two pet dogs.

Some might see  the claim by care home operators that there could be a "catastrophic collapse"  because of the higher costs associated with the National Living Wage in such a light. The residential care providers might be accused in some quarters of crying wolf after their warnings that homes might close if ministers don't agree to fund increases in the bills paid by local authorities. They have written to the Chancellor George Osborne just weeks after a similarly worded missive from the UK Homecare Association, which represents providers of social care to people in their homes. And yet... There is a sense that the latest warning letter is reflecting deeper problems in the world of social care. Care home operators have complained for some time that their finances have been severely squeezed because of cuts in real terms in the fees paid by local authorities on behalf of elderly residents. Staff wages account for about 60% of their total costs, so any pay hike will have a significant impact on each business. Increases in costs, such as higher wages, can be passed on in the shape of higher fees to residents who pay for some or all of their care. But that's not possible for places wholly funded by local authorities - which account for nearly 40% of the total at the five care home companies which wrote the letter. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The "care calculator" covers both residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website with news stories, analysis and video. That has led to the operators' demand that central government should provide ring-fenced funding for councils to raise their fees. The backdrop to this argument is the ageing population and the changing role of residential care homes. A few decades ago they fulfilled the role of "retirement homes" with mostly healthy residents. Now with the prevalence of dementia and people living longer, often with multiple conditions, care homes have a more challenging role in society. How they are resourced is an important policy issue.  The division between health, funded by central government, and social services run by local councils is widely regarded as out-dated and inappropriate for the 21st century. While NHS funding was a dominant issue in the election campaign, little was heard from national politicians about the state of social care. Labour criticised the coalition for cuts in social care funding in England over the last parliament but the argument did not seem to resonate in the same way as the repeated spats over "billions more for the NHS" pledges. Since polling day, a commitment to introduce reforms proposed by the commission headed by the economist Andrew Dilnot has been shelved until 2020. These included a lifetime cap on care costs, limiting an individual's liability and reducing the need to sell a family home to pay the bills. A widely praised reform plan was seen to have been postponed because of the immediate problems with social care funding. This is, of course, ultimately about the quality of life of the elderly. About 400,000 of them in England are looked after in care homes. The residential home operators are warning of closures and - even if that proves to be exaggerated - it's hard to see where the funding for improved or better quality care will come from. The response from the government to the letter has been muted. Apart from noting that the National Living Wage will benefit tens of thousands of workers in social care, a spokesperson said the funding issue would be considered in the Chancellor's spending review later this year. At a time of continued spending restraint, its difficult to identify where significant extra investment in social care will come from. As Chris Ham of the King's Fund think-tank put it on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: "Unless there's a sea change between now and the spending review, the prospects for adult social care, publically funded, for the most vulnerable in society,  are pretty bleak."	It is easy to be cynical about companies who do business with the public sector warning of dire consequences if their income is not increased.
Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 36, will be flown on a chartered plane to Mumbai where bariatric surgeon Dr Muffazal Lakdawala plans to operate. The Indian embassy in Cairo initially denied her visa request as she was unable to travel there in person. After the surgeon tweeted to India's foreign minister that changed. India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is herself in hospital awaiting a kidney transplant, was quick to respond with an offer of help. Ms Abd El Aty's family says she hasn't been able to leave home for 25 years now and claims she weighs 500kg. If the claim about her weight is true, then that would make her the world's heaviest woman alive as the current Guinness record holder is Pauline Potter of the United States who weighed 292kg (643lb) in 2010. Dr Lakdawala, who has performed weight reduction surgeries on Indian minister Nitin Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu, told the BBC that from looking at Ms Abd El Aty's medical reports and photographs, he believes that she weighs at least 450kg. Ms Abd El Aty's family says she weighed 5kg (11lb) at birth and was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition in which a limb or other body parts swell due to a parasitic infection, Dr Lakdawala told the BBC in a phone call from Mumbai. "They said when she was 11, she had gained immense weight because of which she could not stand up and would crawl. "And then she suffered a stroke which left her bedridden and she has not been able to leave home since then." Ms Abd El Aty is cared for by her mother and sister. Dr Lakdawala said Ms Abd El Aty's sister got in touch with him in October and he began raising money to bring her over to Mumbai as her family was too poor and unable to bear the costs of chartering a flight. "We are expecting to fly her to Mumbai next week as soon as the formalities are over," he said. Dr Lakdawala believes that Ms Abd El Aty does not have elephantiasis, but suffers from obesity-related lymphoedema which causes gigantic swelling of legs. "She would need to remain in Mumbai for two to three months for the surgery and treatment after which she would be able to return home, but it would take two to three years to bring her body weight under 100kg," the surgeon said. "I'm hopeful that I will be able to help her, I won't say I'm confident because I think that would be an exaggeration," he added. Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese and carrying an excessive amount of body fat. In the UK, this type of surgery is available on the NHS only to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments have not worked. Around 8,000 people a year in the UK currently receive the treatment. The two most common types of weight loss surgery are: Where are you on the global fat scale?	An Egyptian woman, believed to be the world's heaviest woman at 500kg (1,102lb), will soon be flown to India for weight reduction surgery.
The singer had forgotten about the work, entitled Little Electric Chair, presented as a gift in the 1970s. "It was a rock 'n' roll time, none of us thought about anything," Cooper's long-time manager, Shep Gordon, said. A similar version of the Warhol artwork sold at Christie's in New York in 2014 for $10.5m (Â£8m). Cooper's find, a red silkscreen on canvas, was part of Warhol's Death and Disaster series and was discovered "rolled up in a tube" in a locker along with a collection of 1970s stage props, Mr Gordon told BBC Radio 5 live. It was the decade that Cooper and Warhol met and became friends. "It was all a swirl of drugs and drinking," said Mr Gordon, who has been the singer's manager for more than four decades. Cooper, real name Vincent Furnier, moved to New York with his late girlfriend Cindy Lang, where they were introduced to Warhol and spent time together in New York's famed Studio 54 nightclub, according to Mr Gordon. Ms Lang, who appeared on the second cover of Warhol's magazine Interview, later asked Mr Gordon to purchase the work on her behalf for about $2,500 as she planned to present it to Cooper as a birthday gift. "He was a very heavy drinker in those days," Mr Gordon told the BBC, adding that Cooper's career was "like a rocket ship taking off back in the early 70s - he was working 100 shows a year". Mr Gordon said the rock singer was "getting electrocuted" at the time in his live shows using a prop electric chair that looked "very much" like the chair in the painting. He said that Cooper later entered rehab as a result of his drinking and "never really moved into his apartment in New York". The painting, he said, was forgotten. "Nobody really ever thought about it, life went on," Mr Gordon said. Years later, Mr Gordon was having dinner with friends, one of whom happened to be an art dealer, when the conversation turned to a piece of work by Warhol that had sold for a large sum. "So I got hold of Alice and I said: 'Do you still have that Warhol?' And he said: 'I don't think so'." Mr Gordon said it was months before they tracked it down to the storage facility. "And then we found a tube, like the type you keep posters in, and there it was - oops!" He said that back in the early 1970s the artwork was not considered particularly valuable. "Andy Warhol was not 'Andy Warhol' back then," he said. The artist died in 1987 at the age of 58. In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Gordon said that Cooper had a vague recollection of discussing the artwork with Warhol. "He thinks the conversation was real, but he couldn't put his hand on a Bible and say that it was," Mr Gordon said. The work has been confirmed as authentic by Warhol expert Richard Polsky. "You should have seen Alice's face when Richard Polsky's estimate came in," Mr Gordon said, adding: "His jaw dropped and he looked at me: 'Are you serious? I own that!'"	US rock musician Alice Cooper has found a classic Andy Warhol artwork rolled up in storage after more than 40 years tucked away alongside tour equipment.
The Fox Valley shopping centre at Stocksbridge, north Sheffield, started construction more than two years ago. It has been built on the 28-acre former Outokumpu steelworks site. The development, which features a large mural by local artist Pete McKee, was opened by the actress Joanna Lumley. McKee has also collaborated on a large bronze statue called Granddad Fox at the site. Samuel Fox founded a wireworks in Stocksbridge in 1842 and the name has been adapted by the new centre. The artworks feature umbrellas as the site was a base for their manufacture. More than 100 houses are also being built on a neighbouring site. The site close to the A616 Stocksbridge bypass has been developed by Dransfield Properties Ltd, with a further phase to be opened in September.	A £50m shopping centre has opened on the site of a former steelworks creating up to 900 jobs, according to the developers.
