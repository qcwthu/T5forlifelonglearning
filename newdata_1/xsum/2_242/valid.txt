The News Letter's lead focuses on what they are calling a "huge cash request at Stormont talks". The paper has seen a leaked document detailing a proposal submitted to the political talks process aimed at restoring the Northern Ireland executive. The suggestion from the chief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency, Ian Crozier, to the head of languages at the Department of Communities, proposes an additional Â£140m in funding for Ulster-Scots culture. Mr Crozier is a former special adviser to DUP MP Nigel Dodds and remains a member  of the party, according to the News Letter. His paper outlined his belief that "the Ulster-Scots community is facing discrimination" and that the Irish language receives 10 times more funding than all Ulster-Scots culture combined. Staying with politics, the News Letter reports that the DUP South Antrim MP Sammy Wilson is "fed up" with MLAs "gurning", which is, incidentally, Ulster-Scots for complaining. His remarks come as a complaint against his DUP colleague Edwin Poots for allegedly breaching the Northern Ireland assembly's code of conduct was dismissed. "Why can they not just be grown up and accept that, look, in the rough-and-tumble of politics, people will say things you don't like, and you just have to live with it, rather than running to granda or daddy to reprimand people you don't like," Mr Wilson said. "Hero policeman dies in Thailand," is the front page headline in the Belfast Telegraph, the story billed as exclusive. 50-year-old Heath Taylor died in what the paper describe as a "freak accident". Mr Taylor was a friend of PSNI chief constable George Hamilton, the Telegraph reports. Devoting two pages of coverage to Mr Taylor's death, the paper reveals that Mr Taylor received a citation while a serving officer in the RUC. The Telegraph also gives two pages to political coverage as issues around Brexit and the crisis in Northern Ireland's political system begin to re-emerge after the summer break. The Irish News leads with a question for health authorities: "Why did ambulance take 10 hours to reach Jimmy (79), leaving him to die alone?" Jimmy Cassidy was found dead in his home at Brookvale Fold in north Belfast on Sunday, the paper reports. A friend, Michael O'Reilly, found him collapsed at about 19:00 BST on Saturday and called an ambulance, which, he said, did not arrive until 05:00 BST on Sunday. The ambulance service told the Irish News that it could not comment on the issue as an internal investigation in the circumstances  is under way. The paper's editorial is a call to "root out sectarianism" following recent events in Londonderry, a city which has been, according to the Irish News, "a strongly positive example" for other area in recent years.	There is an eclectic mix of stories on the front pages of Northern Ireland's daily papers this morning.
David McLean, 30, and Ryan Gilmour, 24, deny the charge, allegedly committed at Banner Drive in Glasgow on 23 October last year. They have lodged court papers blaming another man for the crime. The men are accused of reversing a Nissan Quashqai at PCs Deborah Lawson and Robert Fitzsimmons and repeatedly striking them. The charge further states that the police officers were trapped behind the open driver's door and dragged backwards and knocked to the ground. It is claimed that Mr McLean and Mr Gilmour then drove forwards at PC Lawson, who was lying injured in the road, causing her colleague PC Fitzsimmons to seize her and drag her out of the path of the car to avoid further injury. The men also deny later setting fire to the Quashqai at Lennox Gardens in the Scotstoun area of the city and attempting to defeat the course of justice by doing so. It is also alleged that the car had false plates and had been reset by means of theft. Mr Gilmour is also accused of driving while disqualified and having no insurance. Both men are also alleged to have committed a breach of the peace in Banner Drive by brandishing bottles, shouting and swearing, attempting to force entry to a flat and pouring liquid through a letter box. Mr McLean and Mr Gilmour deny all the charges against them and trial was set for June at the High Court in Edinburgh. Both men have lodged special defences of incrimination. The trial is expected to last for eight days.	Two men are to face trial accused of attempting to murder two police officers by driving a car at them.
The result saw the Cumbrians slip to 10th in the table, but they remain just one point outside the play-off places with two games remaining. Carlisle, 2-0 down after 25 minutes, were level before the interval and led through Reggie Lamb before Smith had the final say. Carlisle midfielder Jamie Davitt fired against the post and Jamie Proctor put a good chance wide before Crawley took the lead in the 11th minute. Leading marksman James Collins opened the scoring in superb style by smashing a tremendous shot into the top corner from 20 yards. Collins was on target again after 25 minutes from the penalty spot, sending Mark Gillespie the wrong way after the goalkeeper had brought down the striker. Striker Jabo Ibehre, put clean through by Danny Grainger, reduced the deficit four minutes later with his fourth goal in four games. Crawley keeper Glenn Morris was then hurt as Ibehre put the ball in the net and had to be replaced by Yusuf Mersin. Carlisle were level three minutes before the break when Proctor, on loan from Bolton, struck with a bullet header following a Gary Liddle cross. United seized the lead on the hour through Lambe, who clipped the ball past replacement keeper Mersin after latching onto Proctor's cross. Josh Payne fired just wide late on for Crawley and Collins also headed over before the hosts levelled in the second minute of stoppage time when Smith fired in following a pass from Joe McNerney.

The Shire belied their status as basement battlers and kept Jim Chapman's men at bay in the first half. Ryan McStay cleared Ross Fisher's header off the line, while Thomas Orr got on the end of a pinpoint cross, but headed just over the bar. Despite Shire's bright start to the second half, Annan led when Todd flicked home Ben Jago's long shot.	Annan Athletic had to work hard for a gritty 1-0 win at East Stirlingshire with Josh Todd bagging the only goal.
The Fed is expected to keep borrowing costs on hold but its economic commentary will be closely scrutinised for hints about future moves. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.8% at 16,974.45. Shares of Japanese consumer electronics firm Sharp slumped nearly 12% on reports a takeover deal may be delayed. According to Reuters, Taiwan's Foxconn - also known as Hon Hai Precision - may postpone its $6bn (Â£4.2bn) purchase of Sharp after receiving "new material information" and is requesting more guidance on its latest quarterly performance. In China, the Shanghai Composite index rose 0.2% to 2,870.43 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.15% to 20,257.70. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index ended 0.15% higher at 5,119.03 even though falling iron ore prices dragged on mining shares. South Korea's Kospi closed up 0.3% at 1,974.90, despite data showing the unemployment rate hit a five-year high. The rate rose to 4.1% from 3.5% in February, which was higher than economist expectations, due to a contraction in the manufacturing and construction sectors. However, analysts say most global investors are focusing on the outcome of the Fed's meeting. "Another hike is sharply at odds with Fed concerns about increased uncertainty around global/China outlook and market turbulence tightening credit conditions," said Vishnu Varathan from Mizuho Bank. He added that attention was focused on any hints the bank might make about the frequency of interest rate rises this year.	Asia markets were mixed on Wednesday as investors waited for the outcome of the latest Federal Reserve meeting.
Pro Rugby America, in a statement, described Pro12 as an "interloper" and claimed the league "does not have a legitimate business plan." Pro12 officials held talks about US and Canadian sides being involved, which had been backed by World Rugby. "It's ridiculous. What they're doing is just disrespectful," Pro Rugby America chief Doug Shoninger told BBC Wales. "I understand Pro 12 is under a lot of stress, a lot of problem, but it's not our problem. And they need to solve that problem where they sit." Pro12 is made up of four teams each from Wales and Ireland plus two each from Scotland and Italy. Pro Rugby America is sanctioned by governing body USA Rugby to run a professional rugby division in the United States. The US league started in April with five teams based in Denver, Ohio, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco and Shoninger told BBC Radio Wales they were negotiating a deal with the southern hemisphere Super Rugby league. "We're bidding on a Super Rugby team," he said. "We're talking to big established countries, ones I feel that have player exchange at academy levels. "We're very honest about who we are - we have the potential great commercialism and we need the support of the rugby world to build up our infrastructure." Pro12 is commercially smaller than the English and French professional leagues, and in August, Scottish Rugby chief Mark Dodson said they were "seriously investigating" the possibility of expanding into the American market. The two Italian teams that compete in the league, Zebre and Treviso, have faced calls to be dropped from the Pro12 and were almost expelled in 2015 over money owed to the rest of the teams. Pro12 Rugby declined to comment.	Plans for American sides to join the Pro12 have been dismissed by the company running the pro game in the US.
Tourists may have caught a glimpse of the future monarch in uniform riding his horse Wellesley in The Mall. As Colonel of the Irish Guards, Prince William inspected the troops ahead of the parade on 17 June. More than 6,000 spectators watched the inspection in Horse Guards Parade. There were more than 200 military horses on parade and 400 musicians. Trooping the Colour has commemorated the birthday of the sovereign for more than 250 years. It also functions as a display of army drills, music and horsemanship. The Duke of Cambridge became the Colonel of the Irish Guards in 2011. The last time the battalion trooped the colour in front of the Queen was in 2009.	The Duke of Cambridge has taken part in the military rehearsal for the Queen's Birthday Parade, also known as Trooping the Colour, for the first time.
Before his latest trial, in Germany, he was famously deported from the US to Israel in 1986 to face allegations that he had served as a camp guard nicknamed Ivan the Terrible at Treblinka. He was convicted and sentenced to death. But he was reprieved a few years later after new evidence appeared. But back in America, decades later, an immigration judge ruled there was enough evidence to prove he had been a guard at other Nazi camps, and he was sent abroad for trial again in 2009. The Munich case, in which he was given a five-year jail sentence, is expected to be Germany's last big war crimes trial. Born Ivan Demjanjuk on 3 April 1920 in the Ukrainian village of Dubovi Makharintsi, he was raised under Soviet rule. A burly man, he worked as a tractor and lorry driver on a Ukrainian collective farm. Little can be said with certainty about Mr Demjanjuk's activities during World War II. He joined the Red Army like millions of others, and was serving in eastern Crimea in 1942 when he was captured by the Germans. At least three million Soviet soldiers are believed by historians to have died in German prison camps, many of them left to starve. "I would have given my soul for a loaf of bread," Mr Demjanjuk said later in court. At his trial in Israel, he testified that he had been held at a camp in Chelmno, Poland, until 1944 before being moved to another camp in Austria where he joined a Nazi-backed unit of Russian soldiers fighting communist rule. But according to German prosecutors, between March and September 1943, he was in fact involved in the murders of tens of thousands of Jews at the Nazis' Sobibor death camp in Poland. They said they had obtained hundreds of documents and a number of prosecution witnesses. "For the first time we have even found lists of names of the people who Demjanjuk personally led into the gas chambers," said Kurt Schrimm, head of the special office investigating Nazi crimes. After the war, Demjanjuk lived in southern Germany, working as a driver for various international refugee organisations, according to Germany's Spiegel magazine. In 1952, he emigrated to the US with his wife and child, eventually settling in Cleveland, where he worked as an engine mechanic at a car plant. He was naturalised as a US citizen but his citizenship was temporarily removed after a US judge ruled in 1981 that he had lied in his citizenship application about his wartime activities. Israeli prosecutors requested his extradition in 1983. They believed Mr Demjanjuk was Ivan the Terrible - one of the most infamous guards at Treblinka. Ivan had helped operate the gas chambers and personally murdered hundreds of prisoners, hacking many of his naked victims to death with a sword, according to witnesses. A US court rejected his appeal against deportation in 1985. The court dismissed doubts cast over the authenticity of an ID card, which the defence said was a forgery. The card showed that Mr Demjanjuk belonged to the Trawniki unit - an SS-trained section of non-German volunteers which was tasked with persecuting and murdering Jews. In Israel, Mr Demjanjuk's lawyers argued that he was the victim of mistaken identity and challenged the accuracy of the memories of five Treblinka survivors who identified him as Ivan the Terrible. However, the Trawniki ID card helped sway judges in the prosecution's favour and in 1988 he was found guilty of crimes at Treblinka and sentenced to hang. Five years later, the conviction was quashed in 1993 by Israel's Supreme Court, after evidence emerged in post-Soviet Russia that another Ukrainian - Ivan Marchenko - had in fact been Ivan the Terrible. However, Israel's chief justice was careful to avoid declaring Mr Demjanjuk innocent, noting that there was ample evidence that he had served as a guard in other camps. Mr Demjanjuk had his citizenship restored upon his return to the US as a free man but in 2002 it was revoked once again. A district court judge ruled that there was sufficient reliable evidence to prove that he had been a concentration camp guard, if not at Treblinka. Appeals followed but a court eventually ruled that he should be deported to his native Ukraine, Germany or Poland. In November 2008, state prosecutors in Munich announced they had enough evidence to prove his involvement in the murders of Jews at Sobibor. He was formally charged in Germany with 27,900 counts of being an accessory to murder. He fought extradition - protesting that he was too ill to travel. He turned up in court in a wheelchair or lying motionless on a stretcher. But the court was shown secretly recorded evidence of him walking unaided, and ruled against him. He was deported to Germany in May 2009. His defence there again questioned the authenticity of the Trawniki ID card - but the German court rejected its request to suspend the trial.	John Demjanjuk, an elderly former Ohio car worker who was born in Ukraine, was finally convicted of Nazi war crimes after decades of fighting attempts to bring him to justice.
This is the principle that all websites and apps should be equally accessible. Travel portal Cleartrip.com and media giant Times Group both announced they would be withdrawing from the service, citing competition fears. But Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defended Internet.org's aims. The service aims to extend internet services to the developing world by offering a selection of apps and websites free to consumers. Telecoms firms absorb the data costs associated with handling Internet.org traffic. But many companies fear this distorts the market and makes it harder for small companies to get their products seen by the public. Currently, Indian visitors to Internet.org can access nearly 40 stripped-down services, including job, healthcare, news and education sites. Times Group blogged that it was appealing "to all publishers to jointly withdraw from Internet.org" and said that the Times of India newspaper would also withdraw "if its direct competitors - India Today, NDTV, IBNLive, NewsHunt, and [the] BBC - also pull out". The BBC has yet to respond to the call. A Times Group spokesman said: "We support net neutrality because it creates a fair, level playing field for all companies - big and small - to produce the best service and offer it to consumers. "We will lead the drive towards a neutral internet, but we need our fellow publishers and content providers to do so as well, so that the playing field continues to be level." Cleartrip said the debate around net neutrality had given it "pause to rethink" its approach to Internet.org. "What started off with providing a simple search service has us now concerned with influencing customer decision-making by forcing options on them, something that is against our core DNA," wrote Subramanya Sharma, Cleartrip's chief marketing officer. In India, the issue hit the headlines this week after telecoms provider Bharti Airtel said it would allow mobile app developers to pay data charges enabling users to access the apps for free. Start-up developers with little funding could therefore be at a commercial disadvantage, tech firms argue. Facebook launched Internet.org in India in February after partnering with Indian telecom carrier Reliance Communications. India has the world's third-largest internet population and is the first Asian country to get the service. Mr Zuckerberg defended the initiative in an article for the Hindustan Times newspaper, saying: "Net neutrality is not in conflict with working to get more people connected. "We will never prevent people accessing other services, and we will not use fast-lanes."	A group of Indian technology and internet companies have pulled out of Facebook's Internet.org initiative, fearing it threatens the principle of "net neutrality".
Luke Mallaband, 23, was caught after a woman at the University of East Anglia (UEA)'s library in Norwich realised she was being recorded and reported it. Mallaband admitted six voyeurism offences at an earlier hearing. He was given the three-year ban and a six-month curfew at Norwich Magistrates' Court. Mallaband, formerly of Norwich but now of Yew Tree Road, Walsall, was found to be at "high risk of posing serious harm to females", a probation report found. Prosecuting, Louise Mantell-Sayer told the court a woman noticed a plastic bag in the gender-neutral toilet cubicle in UEA's library. The bag had a hole in it which lined up with a hole in a box inside containing an iPhone set to record video. The woman said she felt "disgusted" and "violated" by what happened. In defence, Dave Foulkes said Mallaband had no previous convictions and had referred himself to a mental health team in the Midlands. Police found 38 voyeurism videos on his phone filmed between July 2013 and February this year. He will also carry out a three-year community order, a 200-hour sex offending behaviour programme and was told to pay Â£170 in costs at Norwich Magistrates' Court.	A former student who secretly filmed women using showers and toilets has been banned from entering female and gender-neutral loos.
Rescuers were continuing to clear fallen rock to get to the area where the two missing miners were thought to have been working, officials said. They were trapped 150m (490 feet) underground by a cave-in on Friday. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has offered his help, three days after the dramatic rescue of 33 miners in Chile. Deputy Mining Minister Jorge Espinosa said the searchers had hopes of finding the two missing men alive. "We hope to find the two other miners alive because they were in a spot that probably was not affected" by the cave-in, he told Associated Press news agency. Mr Espinosa identified the two workers who had been confirmed dead as Walter Vera and Paul Aguirre. He said the two missing men were Pedro Mendoza and Angel Vera, Walter's brother. President Rafael Correa promised to do "everything possible" to save them. "God willing, we will find them alive." The collapse at the Casa Negro gold, silver and copper mine, near the town of Portovelo, is thought to have been caused by a water leak which eroded structural supports.	Rescuers have found the bodies of two of four miners trapped underground in a gold mine in southern Ecuador.
An application for £6.8m has been made to the UK Government for a station and interchange, including parking and bus stops, at Bow Street near Aberystwyth. The Welsh Government has provided £1.7m, including expenditure, to date. The station closed as a result of the Beeching cuts and there have been campaigns for it to be reinstated. Proposals for a new station have been shown at a public event and it is hoped it will open in 2019. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: "We've been working very closely with the local authority, local interest groups and the railway industry to ensure that proposals result in the station and interchange development starting on the ground in April 2018."	A village in Ceredigion could soon have a new railway station if the Welsh Government is successful in its funding application.
After four weeks in the White House, he said "incredible progress" had been made, having signed some two dozen executive actions and put his signature to several bills. He also fired his scandal-hit national security adviser and an acting attorney general, who defied his seven-nation travel ban, which later suffered an appeals court defeat. So what has President Trump achieved so far? In the weeks and months to come, we'll be tracking the progress he makes on his agenda and how it is received by the American public. One way President Trump is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders and memoranda, which allow him to bypass the legislative process in Congress in certain policy areas. He wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege, quickly moving to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, cut business regulations and push ahead with completing the construction of two controversial pipelines. While it may appear that President Trump has been signing executive actions at an unprecedented rate, he has signed less than President Obama did during the same period in office. Mr Trump has used many of these actions to deliver on some of his campaign promises, but many of his promises cannot be fulfilled by executive action alone. For example, his first executive order was designed to limit the effect of the Affordable Care Act, better know as Obamacare, but his promise of repealing and replacing it can only be enacted by Congress. In-depth: The executive actions Trump has taken What are presidential executive orders? When Mr Trump took the oath of office on 20 January he did so with the lowest approval rating of any incoming president. He dismissed those polls as "rigged" but the strength of the opposition to him was evident when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets the day after his inauguration. Most presidents begin their term with strong approval numbers, but President Trump has bucked that trend. While both George W Bush and Barack Obama were enjoying approval numbers in the 60s after one month in office, Mr Trump is around the 40% mark. Donald Trump: Unchained and unapologetic Mr Trump won the election with low approval numbers so it's unsurprising they're still low, but the scandal over his team's contacts with Russia and his controversial travel ban have kept them falling. Do the numbers matter? Maybe not, for now. Republicans control both the House and Senate so in theory he can pursue his legislative agenda without worrying about his ratings - as long as he keeps his Republican colleagues on side. But if his ratings stay low or fall further, expect some dissenting voices to emerge in the party as Republicans start to worry about midterm elections in 2018. For now though, there are signs that many of Mr Trump's supporters are happy with his progress - some we spoke to in Pennsylvania said he was doing "a fabulous job". You can hear their views here. Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake How and why did Trump's key adviser resign? When Barack Obama became president in 2009, the US was in the midst of its worst recession since the 1930s, with the economy shedding 800,000 jobs in his first month. But after a few dips later that year, the US economy saw its longest ever period of job creation. In total, 11.3 million jobs were created under President Obama. President Obama and the tale of US jobs Despite those strong numbers, President Trump described the economy as a "mess" and said he had "inherited many problems" from his predecessor. He has vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become "the greatest jobs president... ever". We'll track the monthly jobs report to see what progress he makes. President Trump has cited the strong stock market as a sign that his policies are already having an effect, saying there has been a "tremendous surge of optimism in the business world". The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes all closed at record highs on 15 February in a partial sign at least that investors were encouraged by Mr Trump's planned infrastructure projects, deregulation and tax cuts. But the president will need to avoid the backlash that followed his ban on immigrants coming into the US from seven mainly Muslim countries if he wants the stock market to continue hitting new highs. All of the three major indexes fell slightly after Mr Trump's controversial executive order caused protests at airports across the country - and Silicon Valley lashed out at the president as well. Latest news on the US economy Immigration was President Trump's signature issue during the election campaign and he signed two executive orders on 25 January designed to fulfil his promises. The first declared that the US would build a "physical wall" or similar "impassable physical barrier" - to the delight of all of those Americans who spent 2016 chanting: "Build the wall!" It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay it, although he has repeatedly insisted that the US will recoup the costs from the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise. There is already some 650 miles of fencing along the border, but we'll monitor what progress President Trump makes in turning it into what he has called the "Great Wall". Who is going to pay for Trump's border wall? Mr Trump's second executive order on border security said 10,000 more immigration officers would be hired to track down illegal immigrants - but extra funds will need to be signed off by Congress before this can happen. His talk of a crackdown on illegal immigrants makes it sound as if they had an easy ride under President Obama, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest the opposite is true. Between 2009 and 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals - leading some to label President Obama the "deporter-in-chief". At one point, Mr Trump pledged to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - but he backed away from that after the election. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has launched a series of raids across the country since Mr Trump was elected, but it's still too early to say if deportation arrests have increased. Has Trump started a new deportation drive? Is arrest of 'dreamer' a sign of things to come? Healthcare was an early test for President Trump and the Republican Party. President Obama's Affordable Care Act helped more than 20 million previously-uninsured Americans to finally get health cover - but Mr Trump said he would act quickly to "repeal and replace" it. While the Republican-controlled Congress has started efforts to repeal what's know as Obamacare, it is unclear whether they will try to replace it completely or just repair elements of it. Can Obamacare be repealed? US patients await Obamacare's fate The scheme has faced several problems along the way and premium hikes in 2016 helped the Republicans frame it as a failure during the election campaign. But a report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that 18 million people could lose their insurance within a year if Congress repealed parts of it without having a new system in place. Senior Republicans have said legislation to replace it will be unveiled in March.	Donald Trump came into office promising to change the face of American politics and transfer power "back to the people".
They believe a Canadian lynx was prowling around the fields of the South West in 1903 before being shot after attacking two dogs in Devon. Tests on the animal revealed it had probably spent some time in captivity before escaping or being set free. The animal had been donated to Bristol Museum at the time of its death and kept in its stores for decades. The scientists' findings are published in the journal Historical Biology. Dr Ross Barnett, a molecular biologist from the University of Copenhagen and the University of Durham, said:  "I've seen one of these cats in the wild. "They are pretty impressive cats - they are a reasonable size, and they have lots of fluffy fur which makes them look even bigger. They have sharp claws, teeth and strong muscles." From blurry photos of the Beast of Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, to reports of a lion on the loose in Essex in 2012, the UK has a long tradition of spotting big cats. Most of these claims are dismissed as misidentifications, hoaxes or even hallucinations, but not in this case. In 1903, the unusual cat was donated to the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The museum's records state that it had been shot after attacking and killing two dogs close to Newton Abbot in Devon. Unsure of exactly what it was, the exotic beast was stuffed, its skeleton preserved, and then the remains were tucked away in the museum's stores. More than a century later, the cat was unearthed by a scientist who thought the find might be significant. An analysis of the skeleton and mounted skin revealed that the animal was a Canadian lynx, which is about two to three times the size of a domestic cat and is usually found in Canada and the northern states of the US. The researchers found that the animal's teeth were badly decayed. Dr Barnett said:  "We think it had probably been in captivity at some point in its life. "It had lost all of its incisors, which would have been a pretty debilitating injury for a wild cat, but not a problem for one in captivity. "It also had massive amounts of plaque on its molars, which are indication of it not having a wild diet - something with lots of wet cat food, essentially ready-processed meat like steaks." The researchers believe that the lynx had been in captivity for some time, but they were unable to find any records of the cat's owner. "Was it someone's pet? Was it part of a small menagerie that was travelling through the area? There aren't really any zoos nearby where it could have escaped from," Dr Barnett said. The team is also unsure how long the animal had been at large in Devon before it was killed. Its decayed teeth would have limited its chances in the wild, but the lynx is an adaptable animal, and may have been able to survive by preying on small mammals. While many big cat sightings remain unverified, sometimes the rumours do turn out to be true, and the team believes that the Canadian lynx is the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK. Another case relates to a live puma that was captured in Inverness-shire in 1980 and had been living in the wild for a long period of time. It was called Felicity, and placed in a zoo. But Dr Barnett said that these cases were few and far between. He said: "It's all very good saying you saw a lion in Essex or a tiger in Shropshire, or wherever. But it is very difficult to estimate size of a species from a distance - especially if you are unfamiliar with them. "So I would argue for continued scepticism, unless you have a body or specimen you can analyse."	A "big cat" was on the loose in the English countryside at the turn of the last century, scientists say.
Matthew Sanchez was reassigned after the incident in New Mexico on 23 June, but quit on Tuesday after a recording of the call was released. He was dealing with a friend of Jaydon Chavez-Silver, 17, who had been shot in a drive-by shooting in Albuquerque. Officials said an ambulance was sent to the scene but Chavez-Silver later died. In the recording the panicked caller, 17-year-old Esperanza Quintero, is heard swearing at Sanchez after he repeatedly asks whether Chavez-Silver is breathing. During the call, Mr Sanchez asks the young woman if Chavez-Silver is breathing, to which she replies: "Barely!" She is then heard encouraging her friend before Mr Sanchez asks the same question again. An exasperated Ms Quintero responds using an expletive to which Mr Sanchez says: "OK, you know what ma'am? You can deal with it yourself. I am not going to deal with this, OK?" From the tape it appears that Mr Sanchez hangs up as the caller says: "No, my friend is dying". Earlier this week, Ms Quintero told the local KOAT-TV network: "It was his job. I don't understand why he would have hung up." A statement released on Tuesday evening from the office of Albuquerque's chief administrative officer said Mr Sanchez has resigned from the local fire department. He had worked there for 10 years, originally as a firefighter. He had been assigned to the emergency dispatch centre for nearly three and a half years, officials said. Albuquerque police have made no arrests over Chavez-Silver's death and have not named any suspects.	A 911 dispatcher in the US has resigned after telling a frantic caller who was trying to save the life of a shooting victim to "deal with it yourself".
Just hours before its day in court - in the town of Riverside, California - the most unexpected twist yet: the trial had been postponed, perhaps indefinitely. The FBI said it had, "this past weekend", been shown a way to unlock the iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook. The FBI has until 5 April to let the court know how it gets on. If the method doesn't work, and the phone is still locked, we'll probably return to Riverside for the hearing. If it is successful - then, well, who knows what will happen? Uncharted waters. The case, already the most fascinating tech legal tussle for years, enters murky territory. And here's why. Let's say, for arguments sake, that the FBI does indeed have a new, credible method of getting into the iPhone. Where on Earth did it come from? Apple's bewilderment is understandable given that, right up until the final hour, the FBI had insisted it had exhausted every possible route. It told Congress as much. In a hearing earlier this month, FBI director James Comey stood firm as Congressman Darrell Issa gave him a dramatic dressing down for not pursuing a technique known as mirroring - essentially, and I'm simplifying here, duplicating the phone so repeated attempts can be made to unlock it without disturbing the original. Mr Comey said he'd look into it - though that was 20 days ago. Also during that congressional hearing, Mr Issa pressed Mr Comey on whether he had asked the National Security Agency (NSA) for its help. In response, Mr Comey, making reference to the particular model of iPhone and the software contained on it, said: "We have engaged all parts of the US government to see does anybody have a way, short of asking Apple to do it, with a 5C running iOS 9 - to do this, and we do not." Had Tuesday's hearing gone ahead, we were expecting to hear the witness testimony of Stacey Perino, an FBI electronics engineer, and Christopher Pluhar, a computer forensics professor from California State University. Both were due to underline that Apple, and only Apple, would be able to break into the phone. Prof Pluhar, who is a supervisory agent for the FBI, had in the past said he had been "unable to identify any other methods feasible for gaining access to the currently inaccessible data stored within the subject device". But we're being told to put all that aside for a moment because the FBI has said it is "cautiously optimistic" a new method suggested by an as-yet unknown "outside party" could solve all its problems, allowing investigators access to the iPhone without Apple's help. Apple's legal team has said it has no idea what that vulnerability could be - but it, of course, didn't rule out the possibility it existed. After all, it's software - and no piece of software ever written has even been watertight. Every time you update your phone, computer, tablet, it's often to plug a few new security holes. So if, come 5 April, the FBI says it no longer needs Apple's help, it would mean the US government has knowledge of a cybersecurity vulnerability that potentially affects each and every iPhone out there. Now, typically when something like this is discovered, and it happens fairly often, security researchers engage the company affected in a process called "responsible disclosure". They tell the company privately about the flaw, and then agree how to make the issue public. When the responsible disclosure system works, the problem is fixed before the public finds out. It makes devices safer, and shares the discovery among everyone involved in computer security. So keen are companies to encourage this kind of approach that many offer "bug bounties" - cash prizes for people who report new critical bugs. Hackers that operate in this way are known as "white hat". The good guys. The alternative - black hat - is to not tell the company about a flaw and instead sell the vulnerability on the black market to any buyer, be it for secret, state-sponsored activity, or simply for criminal means. If the method proposed by the "outside party" works, here's the question: will the FBI engage in responsible disclosure with Apple after it has accessed the iPhone used by Farook? If it does, Apple will surely seek to fix the flaw immediately, putting us back to square one when the inevitable next case comes around. But if the FBI doesn't share the method, what will that do to the reputation of Apple's products if it's known the US government is openly in possession of a security flaw of this magnitude?

Amar Hussain, 29, was involved in a hoax 999 call claiming an officer would be kidnapped by a radical Muslim with links to so-called Islamic State. The call led to West Midlands Police putting in "unprecedented" measures to check officers' safety, jurors heard. At Stafford Crown Court, two other men were convicted of the same charges. Live updates on this story Hussain, along with civilians Adil Bashir, 26, and Muhammad Ali Sheikh, 31, were all found guilty of two counts of perverting the course of justice. Judge Michael Chambers QC said Hussain, of Yardley, Birmingham, was guilty of a "vast breach of trust". All three defendants were remanded in custody and are due to be sentenced on 27 May. During the trial, the prosecution told the court how all police on the West Midlands force had to call to report getting home safely due to the threat made on 8 December 2014. Jurors heard Hussain hoped his fake tip-off would discredit an official within the Islamic community group Dawat-e-Islami. Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale, from West Midlands Police, said Hussain's actions "let down" the force and risked losing the public's trust. "The impact of the threat had a huge effect on officers and staff and in turn on their loved ones," he said. "Never before have we had to instruct officers and staff to call in after their tour of duty to let us know they had returned home safely."	A PC who falsely claimed a fellow officer was going to be kidnapped by terrorists has been convicted of perverting the course of justice.
The 19-year-old has spent the summer on trial in the Championship club's development system. Phillips was released by Liverpool in May after 10 years at the Anfield club, having joined as a nine-year-old from Blackburn. "It's a great move for me and a great opportunity to come to a club like Norwich," said Phillips. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Norwich City have signed former Liverpool youngster Adam Phillips on an initial two-year contract.
The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one. Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem. They broke a rule saying: "The driver must drive the car alone and unaided." Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision. The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track. Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a "critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal". Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem. But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear. Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: "Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear." Rosberg then asked: "What does that mean, I have to shift through it? Engineer: "Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it." Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance. Horner said: "The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules. "The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running. "It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing. "The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question." Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap. Wolff said: "We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time." However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

Unite said workers at the Atomic Weapons Establishment's (AWE) two Berkshire sites would strike for 12 days over a pensions dispute. AWE, which builds the UK's Trident submarine warheads, said it had put "resilient measures in place". It added that its pension scheme was "very competitive". The walk-out of around 700 workers at Aldermaston and Burghfield in June, July, August and September will bring the number of strike days since November to 30. Unite regional officer Bob Middleton said: "We know that our members' action has caused serious disruption to the production of the Trident warheads. "We also know that convoys to Scotland carrying the missiles have been limited." The dispute centres on Unite's claim that promises about pensions were broken after the scheme was moved to the private sector in the 1990s. An AWE spokesperson said: "We are actively seeking to re-engage with Unite to find a positive resolution to this dispute." The union Prospect agreed a pension settlement for its AWE members in February.	A union claims strikes have resulted in "serious disruption" to the UK's nuclear weapons programme as it announced further industrial action.
Chamakh, 32, is a free agent, having been released by Premier League side Crystal Palace at the end of his contract in the summer. The Morocco international had a three-year spell at Arsenal, having arrived from French club Bordeaux in 2010. He had loan spells at West Ham United and Palace before joining the Eagles on a permanent basis in 2014. Media playback is not supported on this device Warnock, appointed on Tuesday, is moving rapidly to revamp the Cardiff squad. The Bluebirds are expected to confirm the signings of Junior Hoilett and Sol Bamba as well as Chamakh, in time for the opening game under Warnock at home to Bristol City, on Friday, 14 October.	Former Arsenal striker Marouane Chamakh is the latest target for new Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock.
Jake Cannon of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire said he had no sexual interest in the images himself, he just wanted to sell them to make money. The 22-year-old admitted possessing and distributing indecent images of children. Swansea Crown Court heard the expert who examined the images described them as the worst he had ever seen. Cannon told police he had been swapping indecent images since he was 13-years-old. Recorder Peter Rouch, said Cannon had been, in effect, continuing the abuse of children by both seeking out such material and then passing it on to others. Welcoming the sentence, a NSPCC Cymru spokesman said: "The shocking scale of Cannon's offending and the particularly horrific nature of these images is deeply disturbing. "Every single image represents a crime scene and behind each is a young victim of abuse who will need support to recover from what has happened to them. "Those who distribute this appalling material are responsible for increasing its proliferation and - inevitably - leading to more children being abused."	A man who claimed to be a professional distributor of child abuse images has been jailed for 15 months.
Naomi Barrett, 53, went on a spending spree while working for Viscount Petersham at Crimonmogate, Aberdeenshire, between 2015 and 2016. Barrett, of Branscombe, Devon, admitted the offence at Peterhead Sheriff Court. She was ordered to carry out a community payback order with supervision and to repay the money. Barrett had bought kitchen appliances and art works while having access to a company credit card as part of her role. Sheriff Andrew Milligan told her: "You have pled guilty to this serious offence."	A viscount's former personal assistant who embezzled almost £23,000 has been ordered to repay the money or face going to jail.
Ex-Portugal midfielder Figo, 42, pulled out on the same day as Van Praag, 67, to leave Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan as Blatter's only rival. Blatter is favourite to win a fifth term as president and Figo said: "This process is anything but an election. "This process is a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man - something I refuse to go along with." Each of Fifa's 209 member associations have a vote in the election and Van Praag, who is president of the Dutch football federation, says he will now support Prince Ali. The English Football Association also intend to support Prince Ali, while the Scottish FA had previously said they would back Van Praag. The Dutchman held a joint news conference with Prince Ali in Amsterdam on Thursday, urging his supporters to get behind the Jordanian to unseat Blatter. "Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein convincingly demonstrated that at this moment in time he is the candidate who has the biggest chance to challenge Sepp Blatter," Van Praag said. "It is impossible that Fifa moves on with its current presidency," he added. Figo also highlighted the need for change in his withdrawal statement. "I travelled and met extraordinary people who, though they recognized the value of much that had been done, also concurred with the need for change, one that cleans up Fifa's reputation as an obscure organization that is so often viewed as a place of corruption," he said. "I have seen with my own eyes federation presidents who, after one day comparing Fifa leaders to the devil, then go on stage and compare those same people with Jesus Christ. Nobody told me about this. I saw it with my own eyes." He also questioned an election process in which a main candidate - Blatter - had not produced a manifesto "so that federation presidents know what they're voting for". Figo added: "There has not been a single public debate about each candidate's proposals." The latest withdrawal comes after another presidential candidate, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, a former Fifa deputy general secretary, pulled out in February. Former Tottenham and Newcastle midfielder David Ginola, backed by a betting company, originally announced his intention to stand against Blatter in January, but withdrew two weeks later. The vote will be held in Zurich at Fifa's annual congress and requires the winning candidate to secure a two-thirds majority in the first round of voting. If subsequent rounds are required then a simple majority is all that is required for victory.	Luis Figo has joined Michael van Praag in withdrawing from the Fifa presidential election on 29 May.
Andrew Buchanan, 46, from Inverness, died at Raigmore Hospital on Monday. The crash, involving a black Seat Altea car, happened at about 18:15 on Saturday 4 March at the junction of Kenneth Street and Tomnahurich Street. Police Scotland said a report had been sent to the procurator fiscal.	A 46-year-old pedestrian has died nine days after being struck by a car on the A82 in Inverness.
And the world of Formula 1 is no different - some drivers have consistently excelled while others have had a campaign to forget. A record 21-race season gives us plenty to reflect on as the year draws to a close, so we want you to tell us your top three heroes and villains from the past nine months. Hamilton in Monaco? Rosberg in Singapore? Verstappen, um, everywhere? You decide... We've asked BBC F1 experts to give us their three best and three, well, most disappointing drivers of 2016. We will reveal their views, alongside the collective results of what you all thought, later. Who were the best during 2016? Who were the biggest underachievers during 2016?	It's safe to say 2016 been a truly memorable year for a whole host of reasons - some very good, some utterly awful.
Evacuation advice has been issued to Kennett River, Grey River and Wongarra. Most residents have left their homes. But a wind change on Thursday afternoon eased the threat to these communities, fire authorities said. Firefighters and aircraft from NSW and New Zealand are on standby in case the fire breaks containment lines. The fire is the same one that destroyed more than 100 homes at Wye River and Separation Creek over Christmas Day. It now covers around 2,800 hectares (7,000 acres) and is likely to pose a threat to communities along the famous Great Ocean Road for months. In South Australia a fire is threatening homes at Mosquito Hill south of Adelaide. Aircraft have been sent to the area but the fire is burning very fiercely, South Australia Country Fire Service spokesman Brenton Eden told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Mr Eden said residents in the area should execute their emergency plans.	More than 500 firefighters are set to battle a blaze in the Australian state of Victoria, one of the world's most fire-prone regions on New Year's Eve.
The YouGov poll for The Times of 1,400 eligible voters put Mr Corbyn on 53%, 32 points ahead of Andy Burnham. The left-wing MP said his campaign was "going very well" but ballot papers had not yet been sent out. Alastair Campbell has warned Labour risks "driving itself off a cliff" if Mr Corbyn is elected. Tony Blair's former spokesman is urging support for "anyone but Corbyn" in the leadership vote, arguing that the Islington North MP could never win a general election. Mr Corbyn, a backbencher who was seen as a rank outsider at the start of the campaign, has been packing out meeting halls across the UK, with many of his supporters joining the Labour Party to vote for him. The party has gained 79,000 members since the general election and 145,000 registered supporters. If the findings of the YouGov poll were repeated in the leadership election, Mr Corbyn would win without the need for second preferences to be counted. YouGov president Peter Kellner said he "would personally be astonished if Corbyn does not end up as Labour's leader" despite voting not starting until Friday and the result not being declared until 12 September. But others were warning about reading too much into one poll, given the difficulties of carrying out a representative survey of Labour's membership and those who have signed up as party supporters. Joe Twyman, also from YouGov, cautioned that the poll was a snapshot and there was still "a lot to play for" for all of the candidates in the race. "The ballot papers haven't gone out, we've still got a month to go. What it shows to me is that there's a lot of movement on our previous poll and there still could be a lot of movement in the remaining four weeks," he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. A spokeswoman for Yvette Cooper's campaign said: "This does not reflect our extensive phone banking data, which does not suggest any single candidate will receive 50% of first preferences." Mr Corbyn told BBC Radio London his campaign was going "very well" but added: "We should be a little bit cautious." "There is still time for people to register as supporters and no ballot papers have been sent out yet", the Islington North MP added. Asked about Mr Campbell's criticism, he said the leadership contest was "very democratic". He said the large number of new Labour Party members was a "good thing", adding: "If they choose somebody, the leader that others don't like, well I think we have to accept the democratic process." But he described "Corbynmania" as a "bit embarrassing". Former Labour Welsh Secretary Peter Hain told the World at One he did not think Mr Corbyn would make a successful party leader, or lead Labour to victory in 2020 "unless there is some kind of major seismic change in British politics". But he said the choice of candidates on offer was "underwhelming", saying that Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper,  who he described as "the most credible candidates", had failed to capture "the mood in the party". At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders Mr Campbell said on his blog that he thought Mr Corbyn was "an OK guy, a good MP, and his stance clearly chimes with many people's views of anti-austerity" but his ability to lead and hold the party together "is likely to be low". He added: "Once the pressures of real, difficult decisions and the day to day leadership of the main opposition kick in, I fear that activists currently cashing in on perceived 'betrayal' by past Labour leaders are going to end up feeling very badly let down." Mr Campbell was criticised by left wing Labour MP and former leadership hopeful Diane Abbott, with the two clashing on Twitter about Labour's record. On Monday Barry Sheerman became the latest Labour MP to call for the leadership contest to be "paused" over fears it had been infiltrated by supporters of other parties. These fears have been rejected by Labour, which says robust checks are in place.	Jeremy Corbyn has urged his supporters to be "a bit cautious" after an opinion poll suggested he will romp to victory in Labour's leadership contest.
The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m. Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank. They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures. The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015. Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital. No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000. Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m. And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m. "We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million," said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank. "Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first." However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m. In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall. One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014. The buyer of a £1m house will now pay £43,750 in Stamp Duty, up from £40,000 previously.	One has a golf course that charges £125,000 to become a member, and the other has a post office said to stock bottles of Bollinger and Dom Perignon.
Kerry McCarthy, who is a vegan and has spoken out about the environmental impact of farming, said there would be "violent disagreements at times". But in an interview with the BBC's Farming Today, she said she had a "real passion" for the subject. Ms McCarthy was appointed by new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. She has spoken out against the environmental impact of meat production as well as saying the meat, dairy and egg industries "cause immense suffering to more than a billion animals every year in the UK alone". The Bristol East MP is also vice president of the League against Cruel Sports and has been a fierce critic of the government's badger cull. Her appointment drew criticism from some in the farming community, with the Countryside Alliance saying it looked forward to seeing how the Vegan Society patron and critic of animal farming "intends to re-engage the Labour Party with the rural community". "I do a lot of work on conservation issues so it's something I have got a real passion for," Ms McCarthy said. "I think it's important to have someone in the role who doesn't see it as a stepping stone to a different post but actually is really keen to get engaged in the issues that there are in that portfolio." Ms McCarthy, who campaigns on food waste, said she was concerned about the relationship between farms and supermarkets and the "push towards ever more intensive industrialised forms of farming". Asked about her previous criticism of the farming industry, she said: "I have my own personal views on what I choose to eat, but I accept that we have a livestock industry in this country. "What I want is for the industry to have the best welfare standards possible, to be sustainable as well as economically viable." She said her urban constituency had "pretty close links" with surrounding countryside, and that "the world is not going to turn vegan because I am in post". Her new job would be "very much about meeting with as many people as possible, visiting as many places as possible", she said. "There will be different viewpoints, there will be violent disagreements at times, but it's about trying to listen to the evidence, approach things with an open mind and I am very much prepared to do that."	Labour's environment spokeswoman says she will approach her new job with an "open mind" despite her strong views on meat consumption and farming.
Images appeared to show Drissa Traore, Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill and Jeremy Balmy taking the legal high, commonly known as laughing gas, via balloons. Swindon suspended the trio on 7 April and, following a club investigation, a statement said: "Swindon Town now consider this matter to be closed. "The three first-team players have been fined for their actions." The statement added: "The trio acknowledge that their actions were wrong and would like to apologise to their team mates, the club's staff and the supporters. "They are keen to move on from this issue and get back to training to help the team as quickly as possible. All three will be considered for selection once again this weekend." Head coach Luke Williams told BBC Wiltshire: "They will be available (on Saturday) because they will have served their suspension time but the boys will have to earn their right to be back in the matchday squad. "I should think there's a level of conditioning that they've now lost because they have not been training for a fortnight, so they'll have to be re-conditioned. "They'll have to show in training every day that they're desperately trying to make up for what they've done." Swindon host Chesterfield in League One on Saturday.	Swindon Town have fined three players after they appeared to inhale nitrous oxide in a live social media video.
Hilda Marcel died in 1987 from lung failure and her husband Eugenios died from prostate cancer seven years later. Their mummified bodies were kept in a basement flat in the city's Gilmore Place, which was regularly visited by a son of the couple, until 2002. Since their discovery, the bodies have been stored in the city's mortuary. Edinburgh city council has been trying to get the family's consent to bury Mr and Mrs Marcel, but this has been repeatedly refused. Now, almost 30 years after Mrs Marcel died, the council has lodged a petition at the Court of Session to seek permission to dispose of their bodies. Prof Roderick Paisley from Aberdeen University's Law School said: "The wheels of justice do grind slowly, and they appear to be grinding incredibly slowly on this particular hearse. "I think this should have been dealt with three or four years ago. "I do appreciate there are sensitivities here, but the law is reasonably clear." A police investigation was carried out when the bodies were found in 2002, but no charges were brought. Death certificates had been correctly issued and the pair had died of natural causes. Cameron Rose, leader of the Conservative group on Edinburgh City Council, said it was an "extraordinary story". He added that there needed to be "sensitivity for the families". The Court of Session has now agreed to hear the case, although so far no date has been set.	A council has launched a legal action in an attempt to bury the mummified bodies of a husband and wife who died decades ago in Edinburgh.
Age: 44 Nominated for: Blue Jasmine The character: Jasmine is a wealthy New York socialite who suffers a humiliating fall from grace after her husband is arrested for financial fraud. Oscar record: The Australian actress has picked up five previous Academy Award nominations, including two nods for the role of Elizabeth I, whom she portrayed in 1998's Elizabeth and its 2007 sequel The Golden Age. She won the best supporting actress Oscar in 2005 for playing Hollywood star Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator. The critics said: "Blanchett, who has played Blanche in Streetcar on stage, is the film's glory. She is miraculous at finding the bruised heart of this bullying elitist. This is Blanchett triumphant, and not to be missed." Peter Travers, Rolling Stone Age: 49 Nominated for: Gravity The character: Dr Ryan Stone, an astronaut coping with the loss of her four-year-old daughter, is left adrift in space after a devastating accident. Oscar record: Bullock's one previous nomination converted to an Oscar statuette for her leading role in The Blind Side in 2010. The critics said: "Bullock inhabits the role with grave dignity and hints at Stone's past scars with sensitivity and tact, and she holds the screen effortlessly once Gravity becomes a veritable one-woman show." Justin Chang, Variety Age: 79 Nominated for: Philomena The character: Philomena Lee is an Irish Catholic woman who was sent to a convent when she became pregnant as a teenager in the 1950s, and saw her child given up for adoption. A meeting with a journalist in later life prompts a search to find the son she lost. Philomena Lee is still alive today. Oscar record: Dame Judi has previously landed a total of six Academy Awards nominations. She won for her second nomination, playing Queen Elizabeth I in Shakespeare in Love. Famously, she appeared on screen for only eight minutes. The critics said: "Ms. Dench's Philomena Lee glows with the radiance of someone serene in her faith despite inhumane treatment by the church. That she makes you believe her character has the capacity to forgive, provides the movie with a solid moral centre." Stephen Holden, New York Times Age: 39 Nominated for: American Hustle The character: Sydney Prosser is a confidence trickster who is forced to take part in an FBI sting operation to root out corrupt politicians. Oscar record: Has already picked up four nominations all in the best supporting actress category, most recently for 2012's The Master - but has yet to collect a golden statuette. The critics said: "Sydney Prosser is played with a gleam of pure self-harming passion by Amy Adams." Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian Age: 64 Nominated for: August: Osage County The character: Violet Weston, a family matriarch suffering from cancer with a penchant for taking prescription drugs and doling out searing insults to her loved ones. Oscar record: Streep has collected a total of 17 nominations from previous years, with three wins. One for best supporting actress in Kramer vs Kramer (1980) and two for best actress: Sophie's Choice (1983) and, almost 30 years later, as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, in 2012. The critics said: "There's no denying the raging force with which Meryl Streep tears into the role of Violet Weston, a Great Plains matriarch who specialises in tormenting the people around her." Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly	A look at the best actress winner and her fellow nominees at the 86th Academy Awards.
Longford in Hillingdon could be demolished if a third runway is built at neighbouring Heathrow Airport. A hotel is providing accommodation in houses it has bought for asylum seekers, including those from the so-called "Jungle" in Calais. The Home Office said it has tried to address residents' concerns. It has said decisions about the use of hotel accommodation, including which premises are used, are a matter for the contractors who bear the cost. It would not say how many asylum seekers were being sent to Longford, but said rooms were used for one or two days before asylum seekers were dispersed into temporary accommodation. BBC London filmed two coaches and three van loads arriving in one day carrying people from Iran, Sudan, Eritrea and Syria. Many of those on board said they had come from the so-called "Jungle". Three days later, another two coaches were witnessed arriving. Ray, 85, has lived in Longford for 50 years. He said asylum seekers were accommodated in the houses either side of his. "They meet and they have conversations in the middle of my front garden," he said. "We don't know where they come from, we don't know what they are and we are living next door to them, albeit they might be very nice people." The hotel, Heathrow Lodge, also rents rooms to travellers using the airport. Booking websites confirm a room can cost Â£30 a night per person, less per person if sharing. Neither the Home Office nor the hotel would say how much is paid per asylum seeker. BBC London booked a room and met eight men all staying in one house. They were asylum seekers from Sudan and Eritrea and said a few days earlier they had been sleeping rough in the camp in Calais. Mogdad from Sudan said he had paid a people trafficker 500 euros (Â£370) in Calais to get to the UK. "I have no choice," he said. "I have to get away from death." Villager Ray said: "The coaches turn up  - about 20, 30 people get off, and they're transferred to all the houses that are around the village." Longford resident Leon, said: "You know, (with) what's going on around the world at the moment, they've got a right to move from dangerous areas, but it's just saturated where I live, with immigrants. "I chose to live here with the aeroplanes, but I didn't choose to live here with the three to four coaches a day moving in and out, and especially at night-time as well. The villagers insist they are not being racist. Rana Saif, who runs one of the local pubs was born in Pakistan and moving to Longford from Sweden three years ago. "No racists here," he said. He claimed the numbers of asylum seekers staying in the village had hit his takings. "No-one comes here, when they are standing 20, 80 people outside on the road, on the walls. "I am going to move from here, as soon as. "It was good before the immigrants came." While the future of the village may be bound by the government's decision over whether to build a new runway at Heathrow, residents say they want something done. The Home Office said it had been made clear to contractors that the use of hotels was only ever acceptable as a short-term contingency measure. Hillingdon Council said it received three complaints earlier this year, adding it had looked into claims rooms were being overcrowded and had put in additional licensing arrangements for the hotel. The hotel manager did not wish to be interviewed or to give a statement. However, in a recent meeting with some villagers he said he was sorry people were unhappy. He wanted to make it better, and in future no more than 40 asylum seekers would be staying at any one time.	Residents of a village near Heathrow Airport say they are being "overwhelmed" by people seeking asylum in the UK.
Held at the city's Eden Court, the line-up includes 34 films from 21 countries. Five of the features are UK premieres and 17 will get their Scottish premiere during the event, which runs from the 5-9 November. Documentary, The Possibilities are Endless, follows Scots singer Edwyn Collins' recovery from a stroke in 2005 with the help of his wife Grace. Collins will perform songs after the screening of the film. Foreign films are a key feature of the festival. This year's include Difret about a teenage girl in Ethiopia who is charged with murdering a 29 year old man after he abducts her. Winter Sleep, set in a small hotel in central Anatolia, will be given its Scottish premiere at Eden Court. Another feature that will be give its Scottish premiere in Inverness will be Fantail, a story about a white New Zealand woman who was raised as a Maori. The foreign language offerings also include Firestorm. Another is The Tribe. Festival director Paul Taylor said: "The Tribe is my pick of the festival, it's a unique and original film from Ukraine without words or subtitles or translation and is the most exciting and powerful film that you will see all year. "It's a true one of a kind, which after 120 years of cinema doesn't happen very often." Drama on and under water appear in a number of the films to be shown, including Kon-Tiki which is about Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl's 1947 bid to cross the Pacific Ocean on a balsa wood raft. Angel Azul tells of the creation of an artificial coral reef by artist Jason deCaires Taylor. Also on an aquatic theme is Once in Your Lifetime. It explores the idea that all keen anglers should try fishing on Scotland's lochs and rivers.	The programme for the 12th Inverness Film Festival has been announced.
A television documentary has alleged Blatter has stayed away from the country since 2011 over a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probe. But the 79-year-old Swiss said: "I know that in the US there is an investigation against former people who have been in my government. "There is nothing against me." The investigation into alleged football corruption reportedly involves ex-Fifa executive committee members, American Chuck Blazer and Trinidadian Jack Warner. Blatter added he plans to visit the US in June 2016, to coincide with next year's Copa America tournament. He last visited the US in May 2011 for a meeting of North American confederation Concacaf, and it had been suggested - including in an ESPN documentary this week - that he had deliberately stayed away since then due to the probe. However, Blatter, who is currently running for a fifth term as president of football's world governing body, said: "I will be there if elected. Even if not elected, they will invite me I am sure." Earlier on Friday, Blatter sent a letter to all 209 Fifa member associations identifying several areas where "there is still work to be done", including promoting women's football, combating discrimination and racism, and cracking down on match fixing. A Fifa spokesman said it was unconnected to Blatter's bid for re-election. Election rules state that candidates must not mix campaign activities with duties connected to their official positions. Fifa's member associations will appoint their next president when they meet in Zurich on 29 May.	Fifa chief Sepp Blatter says he is not being investigated by United States authorities - but admitted former colleagues are.
But his leadership of Cuba divided opinion, and leaders across the world have had to decide whether or not to attend the revolutionary's funeral. In the end, the list of those wanting to pay respect Castro in person appears to be very short, with some notable allies choosing to send representatives instead. So who is making the trip to Havana? Perhaps most surprisingly, considering the two countries' long friendship, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will not be attending. His spokesman said he was too busy to travel to Cuba but that Russia would be sending a representative. Less surprising is US President Barack Obama's decision to stay away. Despite the steps Mr Obama made towards fixing US-Cuban relations, Castro remains a divisive figure - not least for Cuban-Americans who fled his rule. The White House will not send an official delegation, but Mr Obama's pick for ambassador to Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, will attend the commemorative event. UK Prime Minister Theresa May, France's President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are all staying away. However, they will be sending government representatives. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry will attend to represent the UK's Labour Party. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - whose late father Pierre was friends with Mr Castro - was one of the few Western leaders to release a message of condolences following the leader's death, but will not be attending. Governor-General David Johnston was attending Tuesday's commemoration. China's President Xi Jinping paid his respects at the Cuban embassy in Beijing, saying the country had lost a "close comrade and real friend". Vice President Li Yuanchao is representing China at the commemorations in Cuba. Despite their close friendship, Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang will also not be attending, sending National Assembly chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Nga in his place. The country will be holding a national day of mourning for Castro, however. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who paid tribute to an "iconic" world leader last week - will be sending his home minister but will not be flying to Cuba himself. North Korea's Kim Jung-un will not be travelling to Cuba either, sending a delegation on his behalf. The list of world leaders actually attending is relatively short. A number of South American leaders will be making the trip: Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whose late mentor Hugo Chavez had a special bond with Castro, Ecuador's Rafael Correa,  Bolivia's Evo Morales and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega have all indicated they will attend. Also expected are Salvadorean President Salvador Sanchez Ceren and Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto. At least two southern African presidents will also fly to Cuba, South Africa's Jacob Zuma, who has just survived a vote of confidence, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, whose country has just brought in a new currency. And it seems the European Union may be represented by just one leader, in the form of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Other notable Europeans attending include Ireland's Gerry Adams and Spain's ex-King Juan Carlos.	Fidel Castro was a fixture of international politics for more than 50 years.
Arturo Vidal scored Bayern's first when he drilled home after his initial shot had been blocked. Germany striker Thomas Muller then turned in from close range as defender Mats Hummels nodded down from a corner. Forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and recent signing Ousmane Dembele went close for Dortmund. "It was difficult and Dortmund played very, very well," said Ancelotti, who took over from Manchester City-bound Pep Guardiola in the summer and has won his 18th title as a coach. "But things worked much better for us after the break and this gives us some self-confidence for the Bundesliga. "This team is already very, very strong." The Bundesliga season starts on Friday, 26 August, when Bayern begin their title defence against Werder Bremen.	Carlo Ancelotti gained his first trophy as Bayern Munich coach thanks to their 2-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup.
Figures collected by the City regulator showed that, in particular, personal accident cover sold alongside home or motor insurance rarely led to payouts. Nobody claimed over the course of a year on one particular policy covering the risk of serious injuries. A campaigner accused insurers of abusing customers' lack of expertise. Add-on insurance is where a policy is sold alongside another product. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the main financial regulator, has said that there is a risk that many of these policies offer poor value for money, previously declaring that "firms must start putting consumers first, and stop seeing them as pound signs". Thousands of complaints have now led the FCA to publish data showing the frequency of claims, their success rate, and average payouts in the 12 months to the end of August. Under personal accident cover add-ons, four of the eight policies included in the data saw a maximum of one claim from an average of at least 25,000 policies. In the case of one policy from Liverpool Victoria (LV), nobody at all claimed throughout the year. The company defended itself and said: "All LV= comprehensive car policies cover personal accident with a limit of £10,000, but customers who want extra peace of mind can choose an extended personal accident benefit of £100,000. "The extended personal accident benefit is selected by a relatively small proportion of our customers. "The add-on represents good value to those customers who want extra protection, by providing what is essentially catastrophe cover, for the modest price of £19.90 per year." The company said it had questioned whether the FCA's analysis was suitable for such cover. Campaigner James Daley, of Fairer Finance, said customers who only occasionally bought an insurance add-on had no idea whether they were paying a fair price or not. As the policies were sold alongside another product, customers did not have the chance to check on price comparison sites to see whether these add-ons were a good deal. "There needs to be a mechanism in place to ensure this is not abused," he said. But the insurance industry said customers should consider whether they really needed these policies. "Our own claims analysis has highlighted some common areas of misunderstanding and we have published a home insurance guide to help consumers," said James Bridge, assistant director at the Association of British Insurers. "Customers also need to ensure that they do not simply buy on price but make sure they have cover at the levels they need." He pointed out that the vast majority of actual claims were paid out.	Thousands of insurance policy "add-ons" only produce a handful of claims, new data shows, raising renewed concerns over their value.
The ATM at the Cooperative store on Argyll Road was robbed at 03:00 on Tuesday. Police said the gang made off with a "quantity of cash". Officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries and reviewing CCTV of the raid. Police Scotland asked anyone who noticed suspicious activity near the store to contact them.	Thieves have stolen money from a cash machine in Perth after smashing their way into a supermarket.
Spurs took the lead in the first half when Ben Davies was fouled inside the area and Nacer Chadli rolled home the subsequent penalty. However, Federico Bernardeschi equalised when his deflected strike looped into the net. Dele Alli shot over late on for Spurs, but a draw was a fair result. Relive Tottenham's draw at Fiorentina here Tottenham would be forgiven for prioritising domestic success over European glory this season, given they are in a strong position to challenge for a first league title in 55 years. They are second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Leicester, but manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed a desire to win every competition they are involved in. Although he made six changes to the side that beat Manchester City on Sunday, there were still several first-teamers involved, including Alli, Christian Eriksen and Chadli. For large periods of the match they looked like the home side as Fiorentina, perhaps aware of the visitors' threat on the counter-attack, adopted a cautious approach and did not have a shot on target in the first half. It was not a classic Tottenham display, but the fact a much-changed team was able to secure a positive result away to a team that has won 10 of their 13 home games this season bodes well for Pochettino's ambitions. Pochettino has been widely praised for nurturing Tottenham's young talent, with Alli one of the most exciting to emerge during his tenure. The 19-year-old once again showed glimpses of the brilliance he is capable of, notably producing a neat bit of skill that almost got him out of trouble when surrounded by four Fiorentina players. He did, however, show immaturity when he appeared to kick out at defender Nenad Tomovic, and was perhaps lucky to only be booked. It might have been easy for Pochettino to substitute the midfielder soon after to avoid a potential sending off, but the Argentine instead showed his trust in the youngster by keeping him on. Pochettino was almost rewarded late on when Alli's spectacular acrobatic effort was just over. Tottenham boss Pochettino, speaking about Alli appearing to kick an opponent: "We need to try to teach him "He is a young player and he has a lot to learn about elite football. "It is his first season in the Premier League at Tottenham. He came from League One, he needs to learn a lot. But I didn't see it. Some people say 'yes', say 'no', so I don't know."

Tottenham will take an away goal into the second leg of their Europa League last-32 tie with Fiorentina after a draw in Italy.
The remains, believed to be those of a 71-year-old woman, were found in Fenny Bridges, Honiton at about 16:00 GMT on Wednesday, police said. A 66-year-old man is being held in custody and questioned at Heavitree Road police station. The woman has yet to be formally identified but a post-mortem will be carried out later, police said. Devon and Cornwall Police said it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.	A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman's body was found in a van in Devon.
The Highways England scheme will take place between Low Newton junction and Meathop roundabout near Grange-over-Sands. Resurfacing, drainage and sign improvements will also be carried out near the Brettargh Holt roundabout. The work is due to be finished on 20 December and will involve some overnight closures.	A Â£330,000 project to improve the A590 in south Cumbria by installing new safety barriers begins later.
BBC Sport pundits and former champions Stephen Hendry and Peter Ebdon reflect on the action so far and assess the business end of the event. Pre-tournament favourite Judd Trump was beaten in the first round by 1000-1 title shot Rory McLeod in one of the biggest shocks in World Championship history. In his second-round match against Stephen Maguire, McLeod is 6-2 down after the first session. Ebdon: "McLeod's victory was not so much of a shock or a surprise to me. I knew he would make it difficult for Trump and let us not underestimate what an incredible achievement it was for him, one that was fully deserved. "There is only one player in that game that works harder than McLeod and that is Mark Selby, who is world number one. Rory has been my friend for over 30 years so I was absolutely delighted for him." Hendry: "It has been an interesting tournament. All the main contenders except for Trump came through the first round so it is building up nicely. "Everyone who should make the quarter-finals will be there so I am looking forward to the second week." Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan has produced some of his best snooker to beat Gary Wilson and then Shaun Murphy. He faces China's number one player Ding Junhui in the next round. Hendry: "Ronnie has looked great on the table. I questioned in my interviews before the tournament whether he could win it or not and the way he was playing then, I did not think he could. "He has not played well since the Masters but since he has been here he has looked really focussed, his game is very strong and he will be hard to stop. Ronnie is definitely one to beat. "There is a difference between winning a match and winning the whole tournament. Ding edged through by beating Liang Wenbo but now has a huge match against O'Sullivan. You have to question whether he has it inside him to go all the way. That is debatable but his game is good enough. He has every aspect to do it." Ebdon: "One of the things often overlooked is the pressure O'Sullivan is under, with the levels of expectation - the crowd, the commentators, millions of adoring fans watching at home. "To carry that much pressure on your shoulders must be incredibly difficult and I cannot think of many other players in the game that could carry the mantle and the responsibility to the extent he does. "He does a brilliant job, is a very gifted player and it was an excellent win against Shaun Murphy." Four-time champion John Higgins came through a tough match against Mark Allen, while 25-year-old Kyren Wilson beat 2015 winner Stuart Bingham. Ebdon: "Wilson did not hit top gear, he was feeling the pressure but that is what everyone goes through at the Crucible. Once he starts hitting the top gears, we will see something very special from him. "Whether he has the experience to win this year, I am not certain. But he is good enough. He is a phenomenal talent, a great lad and his all-round game is very impressive. "He is one of the best players I have played against. But we have not seen on the match table what I see in practice. He could go very close to winning it this year." Hendry: "John Higgins is going to be very difficult to stop getting to the final. If they both go through, I can see a Higgins against Barry Hawkins semi-final." The tournament is described as the "marathon of the mind" by former BBC commentator Clive Everton. Those players who have reached the quarter-finals have won 23 frames but still need to claim another 48 to lift the famous trophy. Ebdon: "When you are concentrating so hard, it takes an awful lot out of you, you do use up a lot of nervous energy. We only have so much nervous energy for certain periods of time. "This is one the reasons why the World Championship at the Crucible - lasting 17 days - is such a difficult and demanding tournament to win. You are really tested in all departments - physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It is the ultimate test."

He played the famous spy in seven Bond films including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill. Sir Roger's family confirmed the news on Twitter, saying he had died after "a short but brave battle with cancer". The statement, from his children, read: "Thank you Pops for being you, and being so very special to so many people." "With the heaviest of hearts, we must share the awful news that our father, Sir Roger Moore, passed away today. We are all devastated," they said in a Twitter post. The actor took the character of James Bond in a more humorous direction than his predecessor Sean Connery. Sir Roger's Bond was calm and suave - a smooth operator who could seemingly get himself out of a tricky situation with ease. The veteran star, who died in Switzerland, will have a private funeral in Monaco in accordance with his wishes, his children said. "The love with which he was surrounded in his final days was so great it cannot be quantified in words alone," read the statement from Deborah, Geoffrey and Christian. "Our thoughts must now turn to supporting Kristina [Tholstrup, his wife] at this difficult time." The statement added: "We know our own love and admiration will be magnified many times over, across the world, by people who knew him for his films, his television shows and his passionate work for UNICEF which he considered to be his greatest achievement. Along with his famous Bond role, Moore was also known for TV series The Persuaders and The Saint. Sir Roger was also well known for his humanitarian work - he was introduced to Unicef by the late Audrey Hepburn and was appointed as a goodwill ambassador in 1991. Russell Crowe led the tributes to the actor on Twitter, writing simply: "Roger Moore, loved him." Michael Caine said: "I am truly sad and think I will be in tears if I talk about him. "Roger was the perfect gentlemen, adored by all his friends." Michael Ball said: "My dearest uncle Roger has passed on. What a sad, sad day this is. "Loved the bones of him. Generous, funny, beautiful and kind." Mia Farrow wrote: "Few are as kind & giving as was Roger Moore. Loving thoughts with his family & friends," while Boy George added: "RIP Sir Roger Moore. He was the king of cool." Duran Duran, who sang the Bond theme song for A View To A Kill, simply tweeted: RIP Roger. In a statement, fellow Unicef ambassador and actor Ewan McGregor said: "Thank you, Roger, for having championed so tirelessly the rights of all children for the last 26 years. "You've shown that we all have the power to make a change to the lives of the most vulnerable children." Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, recalled how he and Sir Roger had become good friends in recent years. "He even watched me ski past his chalet in Crans-Montana [Switzerland] while sipping a drink on his balcony," he said. "He had a wonderful sense of humour and I will miss his jokes by email. We had lunch together only a few months ago and even after all these years he seemed surprised that his career had been as successful as it evidently was. We will miss him."

The opener was struck on the hand by a bouncer from Shamilia Connell that then hit the grille of her helmet, and she was carried off on a stretcher. The 27-year-old was discharged from hospital with a broken thumb and is awaiting further medical reports. Pakistan have replaced her with 21-year-old right-hander Ayesha Zafar. "We were really shocked by the incident," said West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor. "We have now been told she is fine, and that gives us relief."	Pakistan's Javeria Khan has been released from hospital after being hit on the jaw during Wednesday's Women's World Twenty20 defeat by West Indies.
Ammar Haider, from Birmingham, told three woman a series of "sob stories" to get them to part with savings, take out loans and even pawn possessions, totalling £120,000, police said. The married father-of-two said he was a trainee pilot, ill relatives needed expensive medical treatment and he was stuck in a dangerous jail in Dubai. He admitted three charges of fraud. When West Midlands Police looked into his finances, officers said they found transactions from other victims who had apparently been bullied into not reporting Haider to police because he pretended to be a feared gangster and threatened them and their families. Haider first made contact with a woman from Sheffield, in 2011, having stolen her personal details from a customer database at the car insurance centre where he worked in Sandwell. He began flirting with her via text message before they agreed to meet. He told her he was a trainee pilot with Emirates Airlines. She ended up giving him £9,000 towards his ill father's emergency "treatment" and other bills. The woman, who went on holiday to Austria with him, was later contacted by his wife confirming that, along with other women, she had been tricked, police said. The 28-year-old from Acocks Green also told a woman from Edinburgh whom he met through a dating site that he needed £45,000 in bail money to escape torturers inside a Dubai prison, police said. She gave him a total of £52,000 but became suspicious when she checked with authorities. In police interviews, Haider said he knew the three women but said they had willingly handed over money and made up lies about him when he ended the relationships. Det Con Debra Phillips, said his victims - all well-paid professionals - now had long-term financial problems. "They were cynically targeted by Haider because of their financial means. At one stage he was juggling relationships with his wife and two girlfriends." Haider admitted the charges last month at Birmingham Crown Court and was sentenced on Wednesday.	A serial liar who tricked women he dated out of tens of thousands of pounds has been jailed for five years.
Officers also began using ground-penetrating radar equipment, which looks for signs of disturbed earth. Met Police said requests to search two other sites had been granted, and has also asked to extend the current search of scrubland by an extra seven days. Madeleine was three when she went missing in Portugal in 2007. British and Portuguese officers have continued a search of 15 acres of cordoned-off scrubland at the Algarve resort. All search efforts on Wednesday have now finished. The day's main search activity took place within two white tents which were erected on the scrubland, and forensic officers wearing blue overalls and face masks were seen walking in and out of them. The BBC understands that the tents were put up over a hole in the ground - possibly a disused well - and officers were seen filling buckets with earth, which were then placed into a wheelbarrow. No radar equipment was used near these tents. Earlier in the day, officers in Metropolitan Police uniforms were driven to a separate part of the cordoned-off area, where they were joined by Portuguese police and local forestry workers with strimmers. A man in plain clothes wheeled the radar equipment onto a section of ground that had earlier been cleared. Officers from the Met and South Wales Police were also working with sniffer dogs and using spades to help sift through the undergrowth. They were being overseen by the Met's Det Ch Insp Andy Redwood, the senior officer investigating the case. The painstaking search of a site in the resort of Praia da Luz has been continuing, with a forensics officer joining the police team on Wednesday. Work seems to have been concentrated in one particular area, with police going back and forth to a section of land at the perimeter of the site. Two tents have been erected here - it is unclear if that is to prevent the media from seeing what is being done or to provide shade. While the police can't be seen from the beach, which is packed with holidaymakers enjoying the Algarve sun, everyone here seems all too aware of the investigation. Christina, a 35-year-old from Bournemouth on holiday with family and friends, said: "We walked down here last night and it was quite scary seeing so many police around. "The atmosphere here feels a bit flat because of what's happening. When you're on holiday you don't want to see police around but it's completely understandable." Her friend Suzi, 34, said: "It's a bit of a shame because it's a lovely place and this does seem to have had an effect on the economy and on the people here. "But if that was your child, you would want everything possible to be done." Several people the BBC spoke to had not known, before arriving at the resort, that it was the place where Madeleine McCann was last seen. Josie, 29, from Exeter, on holiday with her partner and one-year-old son, said: "It brings it home to you, being here - it makes it feel more real. "We didn't realise when we booked that this was the place. It wasn't until I saw my dad I knew because he told me. I don't know if we would have come here otherwise. "But police have to do what they have to do. We all want the best for the family." Portuguese police sources told the BBC the search might be extended if there was a significant find. Officers are believed to have been surprised by the difficulty of the terrain, while the police also need to consider the disruption to local residents. On Wednesday morning, the national Portuguese newspaper, Correio da Manha, reported that there would be a search of the sewage network around the Ocean Club, where the McCann family was staying when Madeleine disappeared. Officers were expected to use cameras linked to fibre-optic cables, the paper said. It also reported that the bones of cows and pigs had been unearthed by the search on Tuesday. A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said there would be no running commentary on the operation. Two sniffer dogs have been provided by South Wales Police for the search. The Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July, codenamed Operation Grange. In March, they said they were seeking an intruder who sexually abused five girls in Portugal between 2004 and 2006. Detectives said the attacks had happened in holiday villas occupied by UK families in the Algarve. And last month Scotland Yard said a "substantial phase of operational activity" in Portugal would start soon.	Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have focused their efforts on a patch of land on the third day of a fresh search in Praia da Luz.
Two goals by Timmy Adamson in the first half appeared to have Crusaders in control but the Crues striker was later sent-off for two yellow cards. Dean Youle headed Bangor back into contention on 68 minutes with Andy Hall equalising with a superb free-kick. Sub Ethan Boylan scored two goals in extra-time to put Bangor through. He ran onto a flick on to shoot past keeper Sean O'Neill in the 99th minute. Boylan then produced a lovely finish for 4-2, lifting the ball over the stranded O'Neill to make sure of the victory. Adamson had given Crusaders the lead in the 24th minute after Stephen Cockcroft's cross had caused hesitation between defender Colin Nixon and keeper Paul Cairnduff. The Crues front man scored again on 36 minutes after Gavin Whyte had set the chance up. Adamson, who had been booked in the first half for a hand ball, was sent-off when a foul early in the second half resulted in a second yellow card. Bangor, seven points clear in the Irish League's second division, play the Crues again in the semi-finals of the County Antrim Shield. Bangor manager Garth Scates: "We were excellent from the start and had a couple of chances in the first half which we did not take. "We knew if we kept going forward we would get a chance to get into the game. "The sending-off helped and we went three at the back. What a team performance, they worked tirelessly." Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter: "The sending-off was stupid. Timmy is not a young lad, he is 32 and should have known better. "We made one or two changes with Saturday's match against Cliftonville in mind and it has come back to haunt us. "But there are more important things going on in the world than a game of football so we are not going to lose any sleep over it."	Championship One leaders Bangor came from two goals down to beat Premiership title challengers Crusaders in the League Cup quarter-finals.
Bosworth Water Park, in Leicestershire, was closed after police were called at about 15:50 BST on Saturday. The boy was taken to hospital but later died. A man and woman have been arrested and remain in custody, Leicestershire Police said. One woman, who was at the park with her daughter, said she had not been there long when she saw CPR being done on a little boy by the side of the water. Samantha Scott said: "I'm not sure myself how the incident happened, there were a lot of children in the water yesterday, most with adults. "The water was so murky with all the sand, if anyone had gone under, you wouldn't have been able to see them at all. "I wouldn't let either of mine go in further than their knees as the water had stones underneath it too and both girls cut their feet. It looked very deep in the middle. "The first we saw was a gentleman performing CPR, everyone had gone quiet and you could tell we were all listening for a cry or any sign everything was OK. "The air ambulance arrived but we left just as they flew off." Another eyewitness, Olivia Quinn, said the scene was "horrific". "It hasn't left my mind seeing the boy's body on the ground and seeing people try to save him by giving him CPR," said Miss Quinn. "Everyone was in shock, crying and praying for the little boy. The ambulance took a while to come as it was so busy with people everywhere and cars all around the park. "It wasn't looking good as it must have been 30 minutes a man was still trying with CPR. "When I saw the boy's body being moved on the stretcher into the ambulance, I could see paramedics still giving CPR in the ambulance. A few cars followed the ambulance and I was thinking to myself that must be the parents." Owner Nigel Riley said it was a "dreadful incident" and the park in Market Bosworth reopened on Sunday. A statement on its Facebook page said: "From all of the staff at Bosworth Water Park we would like to pass on our deepest sympathies to everyone affected by this tragic loss of life." Police have asked people "not to speculate" about the circumstances of the death. Any witnesses who may have seen what happened should contact the force, especially if they have any video footage from Saturday of the Blue Lagoon beach area.	A five-year-old boy has died in a suspected drowning at a water park.
Amar Mehraj, 29, was one of four men who gang raped a 17-year-old girl while she was unconscious in July 2009 in Oldbury, West Midlands. He then left the country but was caught at Birmingham Airport in November. Police said Mehraj had been jailed for nine years and nine months after admitting taking part in the attack. Three other men were jailed in 2010. Det Con Mark Timmins of West Midlands Police said: "This was a sickening crime against a vulnerable young girl, who was plied with alcohol and drugs before being sexually abused. "Protecting young people from harm is a priority for West Midlands Police and partner agencies and we take reports of sexual offences extremely seriously. "This case just goes to show that we will never give up on bringing offenders to justice. "Thankfully, justice has finally caught up with Mehraj." Mehraj, of Giles Road, Oldbury, was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday, having admitted his role in the attack at an earlier hearing.	A man who fled to Pakistan after raping a teenage girl has been jailed after he was caught trying to return to the UK.
From 1 April, there will be a three-year ban on killing fish outside estuary limits and strict controls on numbers in inland waters. The SNP's Joan McAlpine hailed a "reprieve" for haaf netting methods. However, Labour's Elaine Murray called it a "guesswork decision" while Conservative Alex Fergusson criticised the failure to delay the regulations. Concerns had previously been raised about the impact of the controls on the historic tradition of haaf netting on the Solway Firth which dates back to Viking times. Ms McAlpine claimed the regulations recognised the "unique cultural heritage" of the pursuit. She said Scottish government officials would work on a scientific project which would allow some salmon to be caught. "Nobody knows these stocks better than the haaf netters who have been working the Solway for generations," she said. "So they are ideally placed to participate in a project gathering evidence about fish numbers and other conservation material." She said the details of the plans had still to be revealed but she would be pressing for an early meeting with fishermen. Ms Murray said the regulations threatened the future of angling clubs as well as haaf-netting and related tourism. "Haaf netters and anglers across Dumfriesshire will find it extremely difficult to forgive or forget this disastrous order which has been pushed through by the Scottish government," she said. "What makes things worse is that there has been simply no proper scientific evidence given by the government to back up their decision to introduce a blanket ban on salmon taking in our region." She added that despite the offer of "belated scientific studies" there would be no direct compensation to counter the loss of earnings. "The ban will be felt in every part of the region, as fishing tourism will likely fall, something which is absolutely crucial for rural economies like ours," she said. Mr Fergusson tabled a motion to annul the measures but it was voted down. "It is clear that many stakeholders feel that the scientific basis for these measures is seriously unsound and that the measures are being pushed in order to be seen to be 'doing something'," he said. "My motion to annul the measures was simply designed to delay conservation measures being introduced in order to give the Scottish government time to bring forward a more robust scientific basis for them in a way that would ensure the buy-in of all stakeholders - something that is far from universal at present." A Scottish government spokeswoman said it was aware of the "cultural importance" of haaf netting and the "poor conservation status" assessed in the area meant it could continue on a "catch and release" basis. She said Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead had made clear they were looking to widen their science focus to include more specific work on the impact on such "cultural activities". "Marine Scotland is keen to undertake further scientific work on salmon catches that involves the continuation of existing activities to a degree and we are keen to involve the haaf netters in that programme," she added.	MSPs have given widely differing views of the impact in south west Scotland of new wild salmon stock protection rules.
Jobs Growth Wales helps firms employ 16-24 year olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. Deputy Skills Minister Julie James claimed it was a "ringing endorsement" of Jobs Growth Wales, saying a new scheme was planned for all adults. Labour has hailed Jobs Growth Wales - which is part funded with EU money - a big success that has exceeded its targets on the number of jobs created. However, a review in 2014 found nearly three-quarters of participants would have found work anyway. In July, a committee of assembly members urged ministers to consider designing a similar scheme for the over-50s. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Labour's age cap on job creation offers nothing to the many thousands of over-25s that want to get on and build a career for themselves. "Not only does this sell hardworking people short, it's contributing to the acute skills shortage which is holding the Welsh economy back." The party said it would work with employers to make sure the jobs created lasted longer. But with no extra funding, the money spent on each job would be cut from the current average of Â£4,211 to Â£3,000. The announcement is part of a set of policies the Tories call Stronger Futures Cymru. They say they would work with businesses, schools and colleges to promote apprenticeships to students, and encourage schools to forge closer links with businesses in their communities. Responding for the Welsh government, Ms James said: "They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and I welcome this ringing endorsement of our flagship skills policies. "It is particularly pleasing that they are so popular that the opposition seek not only to continue them, but to extend them too." Ms James also confirmed plans to introduce a new scheme - Skills for Employment Wales - in April 2016 which would be open to all adults looking for work. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman Simon Thomas said: "The Conservatives' cynical plans will make it more difficult for young people to gain access to employment. "Pitting older people against younger people is counter-productive and creates unnecessary divides."	Age restrictions on a flagship job creation scheme will be lifted by the Welsh Conservatives if they win power.
Senior Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi and several government ministers from the state of Punjab were among the large crowd attending the state funeral in Singh's home village. Singh, sentenced to death by Pakistan in 1991, died after being attacked with bricks by inmates in Lahore's jail. Delhi called the attack "barbaric". Indian PM Manmohan Singh has demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice. Sarabjit Singh had been convicted of spying and over his role in bomb attacks that killed 14 people in Pakistan in 1990. By Ravinder  Singh RobinJournalist A 21-gun salute was fired as thousands of mourners gathered at the cremation ground in Bhikhiwind village, in Punjab's Tarn Taran district. Sarabjit Singh's sister, Dalbir Kaur, who had campaigned relentlessly for years to get her brother freed, lit the funeral pyre with help from a local politician. Singh's coffin was carried through village streets lined with thousands of spectators, before reaching the cremation ground. Thousands of policemen were deployed to ensure security. All roads leading to the small village on the India-Pakistan border were jammed with people trying to get to the venue. Earlier, Singh's body was kept in a local school where thousands of people visited since early on Friday to pay their respects. His coffin was kept on a platform, draped in the national flag, and visitors were seen putting flowers on his body. His wife, daughters and sister sat nearby, mourning, while some of the visitors raised slogans of "Long live Sarabjit" and "Death to Pakistan". His family always insisted he was innocent and had strayed into Pakistan by mistake when he was arrested. The issue risks stirring fresh tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours and long-time rivals, correspondents say. Meanwhile a Pakistani prisoner, Sanaullah Haq, suffered critical head injuries after he was attacked by a fellow inmate at the high-security Kot Bhalwal jail in Jammu, in Indian-administered Kashmir. He has been admitted to intensive care at a Jammu hospital and doctors say he is in a coma. Police say Haq has been in prison for the past 17 years on militancy-related charges. His attacker, police say, is a former Indian army soldier convicted of murder. Reports said the attack happened on Friday morning after an argument between the two men. Pakistan's government issued a statement expressing "deep concern" over the attack and saying it had sought "immediate consular access" to Haq. The attack was "obvious retaliation" for the killing of Sarabjit Singh, it added. The body of 49-year-old Sarabjit Singh was flown to Amritsar, northern India, from Lahore on Thursday. Hundreds of mourners waited at the airport, describing Sarabjit Singh as a "martyr". His death triggered protests in India, as people burned Pakistani flags and accused Islamabad of a conspiracy to kill him. By Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent His body was handed over to his family in the village of Bhikhiwind for Friday's cremation. In a statement, Manmohan Singh called Sarabjit Singh "a brave son of India" and said the attack was "barbaric". "It is particularly regrettable that the government of Pakistan did not heed the pleas of the government of India, Sarabjit's family and of civil society in India and Pakistan to take a humanitarian view of this case," he added. He was referring to mercy petitions which had been rejected by Pakistani courts and former President Pervez Musharraf. Sarabjit Singh's sister Dalbir Kaur called her brother's death "a murder by Pakistan". Ms Kaur said she would continue to fight for the release of other Indian prisoners in Pakistani jails. Meanwhile, the government in Punjab has declared a three-day state mourning and the Punjab assembly has unanimously passed a resolution declaring Sarabjit Singh a "national martyr". Sarabjit Singh fell into a coma after last Friday's attack in Lahore's Jinnah hospital and died on Thursday morning. He was assaulted as he and other prisoners were brought out of their cells for a one-hour break. Obituary: Sarabjit Singh Two inmates have been charged over the attack and two officials suspended. The Pakistani foreign ministry said Sarabjit Singh had received "the best treatment available" and that "medical staff at Jinnah Hospital had been working round the clock... to save his life". But a Pakistani intelligence official criticised India for the honour given to Singh, saying he had been involved in bomb attacks in Pakistan and should not be treated as a hero in his homeland. Tensions between the two countries had already increased in the past six months with the execution in India of Kashmiri Afzul Guru over the 2001 attack on India's parliament, and of Mohammed Ajmal Qasab, a Pakistani who was the sole surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Sarabjit Singh's lawyer Owais Sheikh said his client had received threats after Guru's execution. Pakistan and India frequently arrest each other's citizens, often accusing them of being spies after they have strayed across the land or maritime border. In recent years, several Indians returning from Pakistani jails have admitted to spying.	Sarabjit Singh, the Indian convicted of spying in Pakistan and killed in a Pakistani jail last week, has been cremated in India amid mass outrage.
With temperatures at Indian Wells in excess of 105 degrees, Evans broke in the opening game but world number five Nishikori hit back immediately and captured the set in 42 minutes. Breaks were traded again at the start of the second before Nishikori sealed the match in an hour and 24 minutes. Kyle Edmund is also out, 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to defending champion Novak Djokovic. Following the surprise defeat of world number one Andy Murray at the hands of qualifier Vasek Pospisil the previous evening, Evans, 26, produced a spirited performance, but some pinpoint accuracy from Nishikori saw him break again in game eight of the first set. World number 41 Evans, who beat Dustin Brown in the previous round, continued to frequently match the quality of his Japanese opponent's groundstrokes but gradually faded as the assured Nishikori moved through to face Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in round three. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide.	British number two Dan Evans was beaten 6-3 6-4 by Japan's Kei Nishikori in the second round of the BNP Paribas Open.
Crafted in the shape of the letter Y for Yorkshire, the trophy will be handed to the winner of the inaugural event, which runs from 1 to 3 May. It has been designed and made by Thomas Fattorini Ltd - a company originally founded in Yorkshire in 1827. Earlier this month, Sir Bradley Wiggins confirmed his intention to ride in the race. The trophy was unveiled at Brudenell Primary School in Leeds earlier. Tom Fattorini, director of sales and marketing, said: "We do business internationally, supplying trophies to the likes of FIFA, and when we were invited to support the production of the Tour de Yorkshire trophy and medals we felt it was a perfect fit given our Yorkshire history." The Tour will begin on 1 May with a stage from Bridlington to Scarborough, followed by Selby to York on 2 May, and Wakefield to Leeds on 3 May. There will be more than 500km (310 miles) of racing through Yorkshire over the three days.	The trophy to be presented to the winner of the Tour de Yorkshire has been unveiled.
Operations are due to resume early next week after a meeting between NHS bosses and other partners on Thursday night. Data suggested death rates there were double that of other centres, but experts have questioned their accuracy. However, the Department of Health (DoH) said the NHS was right to investigate safety at the unit. A spokesperson said: "We support NHS England and the trust in their decision to suspend surgery last week on the basis that there were serious concerns that needed to be investigated. "If the trust and the regulators are content that these concerns can now be explained or addressed then we would support a joint decision to resume surgery." Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said work would be done over the weekend to give "sufficient assurance" the unit is safe to reopen, early next week. Doctors and other medical experts said the data on death rates had not been verified and was not fit to base a decision to close the unit on. Mortality data and staffing are just two of the concerns being looked at as part of a review into why children's cardiac surgery at Leeds General Infirmary was suspended last Thursday. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission have all been involved. The indication is that if the trust can provide strong assurances that heart surgery is safe, then the unit could reopen early next week. But discussions will continue over the weekend as part of the review, which is expected to last three weeks. If the unit does reopen, Leeds General Infirmary will have to reassure patients and families that safety of care is paramount. The NHS can ill afford another scandal after Mid Staffs. Yet Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will probably have the last say on the future of children's heart services, at Leeds and elsewhere. A separate independent review is set to report to him on the whole restructuring of children's heart services in England. But, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said the figures were among a "constellation of reasons" the decision was made.  He has been backed by health secretary Jeremy Hunt. A senior Westminster source has told the BBC that "as far as the secretary of state is concerned, Sir Bruce Keogh was right to ask questions about the safety of heart surgery at the unit". Parents had criticised the timing of the suspension of surgery at the unit, which came 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that a decision-making process to close it as part of an England-wide reorganisation of services was "legally flawed". Stuart Andrew, the Conservative MP for Pudsey, called for "some really serious investigating" into the decision to suspend surgery. Mr Andrew claimed a review of the mortality figures showed "Leeds is within the average and is a safe unit to use". He said recent events raised questions about the NHS decision to close the Leeds unit for good and concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer centres. "We are losing faith in that review process," said Mr Andrew. "Some of these people are the same people on that decision-making body." Lois Brown, whose five-year-old daughter had life-saving heart treatment at the hospital, described the decision to restart surgery as "fantastic". Ms Brown has been involved in the campaign and court action to save the unit from closure. She said she wanted answers as to why the unit was shut. "I'm really relieved that children are going to get surgery at Leeds again," she said. "For the past week and a bit we have been putting children's lives at risk for no reason, apparently."	Children's heart surgery is set to restart at Leeds General Infirmary, a week after it was claimed data showed higher-than-usual death rates there.
John Martin, 48, denies murdering Russian pianist Natalia Strelchenko, 38, at their Manchester home on their second wedding anniversary last August. Manchester Crown Court heard he took the diazepam believing it to be his prescribed anti-depressant medication. He said "everything is very blurry". It is alleged the double bass player strangled and beat Ms Strelchenko, who was also known by the surname Strelle, in a loss of temper at their home in Newton Heath on 30 August. Giving evidence, Mr Martin, also known as Jon Skogsbakken, said he had been suffering with depression and that he had unwittingly taken unmarked diazepam tablets for around six weeks. He said he "guessed" they had been prescribed to his wife. Mr Martin told the jury he had suffered with depression since 2005 and his GP would prescribe him Escitalopram. He told the court that taking the diazepam was "the biggest mistake of my life". Mr Martin said: "I would never have taken the two together, absolutely not", if he was aware the tablets could have a "paradoxical and aggressive response" and when taken with alcohol it could increase the effects. The court heard following an argument with Ms Strelchenko, he drank four cans of cider at their home before going to the working men's club where he had another pint of cider and then returned home. He said: "I just sat down on the floor and poured myself a glass of wine. I started to drink it. Natalia was angry because I was drinking wine and she tried to take it away from me. "Everything is very blurry for me. I can't recall anything after that point. "I still love her very much. I would never wish to do such terrible things to her. I recall virtually nothing." Mr Denney QC said: "Do you accept that on evidence you killed Natalia?" Mr Martin replied: "Well according to what the witnesses described...I perfectly understand that I must be the man behind it." Mr Martin, who had worked for the computer firm IBM in his home country of Norway, met Ms Strelchenko in 2007. She had performed piano recitals at New York's Carnegie Hall and London's Wigmore Hall. The trial continues.	A musician accused of murdering his wife has told a court "I perfectly understand that I must be behind it" but recalls "virtually nothing" after taking diazepam and alcohol.
The move follows the case of a Thai surrogate mother who said an Australian couple rejected the baby she carried when they found he had Down's syndrome. The couple, who took home the boy's twin sister, have strongly denied the claim. Thai police say couples with surrogate children now need a court order before they can leave with the children. Thailand's military government is rushing through a new law aimed at banning commercial surrogacy. However, Australian surrogacy agencies believe there are more than 100 couples still awaiting the birth of children to surrogate mothers in Thailand. A Thai immigration official told the BBC that one same-sex couple with a baby was stopped from leaving Bangkok airport on Thursday because they lacked documentation to prove they were the legal guardians. Australian broadcaster ABC said three other couples were also believed to have been stopped from leaving Thailand with surrogate babies. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Thailand has become the favoured destination for many Westerners seeking surrogate mothers. But while commercial surrogacy is not technically illegal in Thailand, it does violate the code of the Medical Council which regulates doctors and hospitals, he adds. Earlier this week, Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell denied that they had rejected baby Gammy, now seven months old, when it became clear he had Down's Syndrome. They said that Thai surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua, 21, had refused to hand him over and also threatened to keep his twin sister. It also emerged that David Farnell had been convicted in the 1990s of multiple sex offences against young girls. Mr Farnell insisted that Gammy's sister, Pipah, was not at risk of harm from him. Ms Chanbua, who has two other children, said the couple had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the baby boy's condition. She said she refused, as it was against her Buddhist beliefs. David Farnell denied asking the mother to have an abortion and said that by the time they found out about the baby's condition, it was too late in the pregnancy to abort the foetus.	Thailand has imposed new restrictions on taking children born to surrogate parents out of the country.

Media playback is not supported on this device Captain Thiago Silva set Luiz Felipe Scolari's side on the way with an early goal, and Brazil looked to be set for a comfortable passage into the last four after David Luiz's brilliant second-half free-kick. In a magnificent atmosphere built on a cascade of colour and a wall of sound, new World Cup star James Rodriguez set up a thrilling finale when he pulled a goal back from the penalty spot with 10 minutes left. In a frantic closing phase, Colombia were unable to force the chance that could have brought extra time, and it is the hosts who will meet Germany in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday, a game which will be live on BBC One. "It was a fantastic occasion and a great game. Not in terms of quality but in terms of endeavour and passion. "The game was scrappy and bitty but Brazil wanted it that little bit more. Colombia were overawed from the beginning and lost the game after conceding the first goal. "The South American way is win at all costs and you saw that today. Yes, they gave away fouls, yes David Luiz was trying to put James Rodriguez off for the penalty, but if Brazil win this World Cup playing like that nobody will be bothered. "If they lose, different story." But Brazil will be without superstar and main striking hope Neymar, who has been ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured vertebra after being kneed in the back by Juan Zuniga. They will also be missing captain Thiago Silva, who is suspended after being booked. Colombia had complaints of their own, chiefly the lack of protection offered to Rodriguez, who was on the receiving end of some fierce challenges as Brazil sought to nullify his influence. He broke down in tears at the final whistle as he was consoled by the Brazil players who had offered him none of that commodity during a harrowing physical ordeal which proved he has the courage to go with his natural ability. Brazil and their supporters, in contrast, went wild with elation at the final whistle. The goal of reaching the final - and making up for the 1950 World Cup loss to Uruguay in Rio that is still one of this nation's darkest sporting days - lives on. Germany, who beat France 1-0 in their quarter-final, will need to show mental strength to cope with the tidal wave of emotion and support that Scolari hopes will carry Brazil to the Maracana a week on Sunday. Fortaleza offered up a cauldron of noise and a sea of yellow shirts in an atmosphere that ensured Brazil would launch into a series of adrenalin-fuelled attacks. Scolari's hope was to push Colombia into unknown territory and the strategy was helped by a goal built largely on defensive carelessness after seven minutes. Neymar's corner was a routine affair with little serious menace but it was allowed to drift to the far post, where Carlos Sanchez switched off to allow Silva to bundle home. Scolari and his players were just as aware of the threat posed by Juan Cuadrado as the celebrated Rodriguez, and he illustrated exactly why with a shot that was inches away from 20 yards. This was much more like it from Brazil, though, and it would have been no surprise had they extended their advantage by the interval as they showed genuine threat against a somewhat timid Colombian side. It was down to keeper David Ospina that they did not as he twice saved well from the excellent Hulk, on the second occasion recovering well to then clutch Oscar's long-range effort. Scolari insisted Brazil had formulated no special plans to deal with Rodriguez, but it was clear they were determined to test the 22-year-old in a succession of reckless physical challenges. Media playback is not supported on this device It was after Rodriguez was shown a yellow card for a foul on Hulk by the extraordinarily lenient referee Carlos Velasco Carballo that Brazil scored the goal that effectively sent them into the last four. Luiz came in off his long run to strike a 25-yard free-kick that left the stretching Ospina clutching at thin air as it flew high to his left. The vast bowl of a stadium reverberated to an expression of relief as well as celebration. It came just after Colombia thought they were back in the game, only to see Mario Yepes's goal ruled out for an earlier offside. To his credit, Rodriguez was undeterred by Brazil's close attentions and it was his astute pass that led to substitute Carlos Bacca being upended by Julio Cesar. After a short delay, and some well-chosen words from Luiz, Rodriguez was calmness personified to send the keeper the wrong way. Colombia threw everything forward in the last moments, but once again Brazil held on to seal the victory.

The team, founded by five-time Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins to develop young British talent, was omitted from the race which runs from 28-30 April. "It's very disappointing and it is very much a surprise," said the team's sports director Simon Cope. Race organisers said the event was oversubscribed and "unfortunately someone had to miss out". A total of 49 teams applied for 36 slots - 18 in the men's race and 18 in the women's. The decision on who was included was made between Welcome to Yorkshire and cycling event organisers ASO, who jointly run the event. A Welcome to Yorkshire spokesman said that Team Wiggins were welcome to apply for any future editions of the race. But Cope told Cycling Weekly that he believed the team, who are the only British third-tier UCI Continental outfit not included, could have made an impact in the race. "Good or bad press at the moment, there's a percentage of the UK population who will be going to the race who want to see (Team) Wiggins there," he said. "You would have thought that we would have got in, but the organisers have made their selection and that's it, we can't do anything about it. We will have to go and find another bike race to do." An investigation by UK Anti-Doping is currently ongoing into allegations of wrongdoing in cycling involving Wiggins - who retired in December - and Team Sky. Cope, who used to work for Team Sky, was questioned by MPs earlier this month about the contents of a medical package he delivered to Wiggins when he was racing at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine in France. Team Sky have admitted "mistakes were made" around how medical records relating to the package were kept but deny breaking anti-doping rules.	Team Wiggins say they are "surprised" and "disappointed" after being excluded from next month's Tour de Yorkshire.
During eight months of hearings Lord Leveson heard from some witnesses  - like ex-motorsport head Max Mosley - who called for new laws to set up a tribunal which would control the press. Others, like Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, argued against statutory legislation, saying it would compromise Britain's free press. BBC News asked a selection of Leveson witnesses, and other interested parties, what they wanted out of Lord Leveson's report. The Leveson Inquiry has heard appalling evidence of press malpractice, abuse and criminality. It must have shocked the chairman as it did everyone watching. So I am optimistic he will put forward recommendations to ensure this stops. Surprisingly, given what has happened, we already have quite good press laws and the laws are backed by a code. The problem is you can't go to law unless you are rich, and several national newspapers simply ignore their own code. My hope is that Lord Justice Leveson will recommend that the power to enforce the law and the industry's own code be given to an entirely independent tribunal to which everyone has access irrespective of their means. This would require a statute. It will not have escaped him that the newspaper industry, prompted by three Royal Commissions and several judicial inquiries, has promised on at least five occasions in the last 60 years to put its house in order. It has never kept its word. So I hope he flatly rejects the Hunt/Black proposal for no statute and a mere contract between the newspapers. It amounts to "trust us - we're journalists". Given the industry's record, this is, well, laughable. British journalism has been poisoned in recent years by something that happened at most of our national newspapers. They became unaccountable, and then they became arrogant and cruel. An editor at the News of the World summed up the attitude. 'This is what we do,' he said. 'We go out and destroy other people's lives.' That's not what most journalists think, but nor, sadly, has it been the view of a tiny minority. Almost every national newspaper participated in the attempt to destroy the lives of Gerry and Kate McCann. Eight newspapers tried to destroy the life of Christopher Jefferies, the Bristol teacher wrongly accused of murder. This is bad for a profession whose mission, I was taught as a young reporter, is to bear witness to the world in a truthful way. I want a body capable of asking the hard questions, pointing the finger of blame and ensuring that lessons are learned. It must be independent of the industry and of government and it should have the clout to ensure that mighty news organisations take heed. Nobody at the Leveson Inquiry suggested that the judge should gag papers. They did ask, however, that stories should be properly researched and checked, that they should be fair, and that, if they risk harming anyone, they should pass a basic public interest test. I don't think any ethical journalist would want anything different. There has been one central issue at the heart of the Leveson Inquiry. Is the press to remain free though operating within a tough, independent, entirely new system of self regulation? Or is it - for the first time since 1695 - to be subjected to Government controls and a system of state licensing which would be essential to make it work? That choice is clear. There are no middle ways. "Statutory underpinning", or even "dabs of statute", are mere terms of art. They are state control under fragrant names. I very much hope - along, according to opinion polls, with the clear majority of the public who do not want to see any additional legal burdens on the press - that Leveson will back proposals for a new, effective regulator which will, for the first time ever, have real powers of investigation and sanction, including the ability to fine newspapers up to £1m. Such a system will both protect the public from media intrusion - dealing with the unacceptable practices we heard about at the Inquiry - and crucially protect the public's right to know. The alternative of state intervention is abhorrent in a free society. It would mean the state controlling the regulation of those who are there to scrutinise them on behalf of the public. The consequences of that for our democracy would be incalculable. I want Lord Justice Leveson to get out of the affairs of a supposedly free press, and take his celebrity and political cheerleaders with him. As a defender of press freedom with no "buts", I cannot support any of the proposals discussed around Leveson. "Statutory-backing" of a new regulator is simply state intervention by any other name. And  the alternative proposals put forward by Lords Hunt and Black, for an independent regulator with more powers to police and punish the press than are currently enjoyed by the police, make too many concessions. • Writer and journalist • Editor-at-large of Spiked Online, which says it "stands for liberty, enlightenment, experimentation and excellence" • Formerly editor of LM, left-wing magazine which closed down after being sued by ITN for libel • Author of book There is No Such Thing As a Free Press The danger now is not crude censorship, but that an atmosphere is created in which we are left with a more sanitised, timid and tame press. Press freedom, like all liberties, is indivisible. We either have it for all, or for none at all. And nobody has to pass an ethical test, or be as pious as Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, to qualify for the right to freedom of expression. Standing up for a free press means defending it for things we might not want to read or hear. If the authorities must have a "statutory framework", let them look to the USA, where the First Amendment makes it illegal to pass any law "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press", and where the notion of a Lord Justice proposing new press regulations would be laughed out of court. We have sections of the press that don't inform the public, which seem to be aimed at providing little more than sensation and salacious forms of entertainment.  And when that involves harm to other  people, it is striking that no-one accepts responsibility. I was struck that, when I sued and won damages from eight national  newspapers for defamation, no disciplinary action was ever taken against  the journalists associated with libellous articles. Under the current system, the Press Complaints Commission has been unable  to reign in the excesses of certain sections of the press, and it  stretches credulity that one more attempt at self-regulation will result in something different. There needs to be a regulatory body, independent of government and of  the press it regulates. Unlike the PCC, this new body should have  powers to initiate investigations, plus significant powers to discipline  newspapers that flout journalist standards and make guilty publications  compensate their victims. It is doubly important to bring in reforms because the no-win-no-fee system under which  I was able to sue has been abolished. If those rules had been brought before I was libelled, I would not have been able to get  justice. Lord Justice Leveson repeatedly asserted his concern to maintain the freedom of the press. I therefore hope and expect his report will be based on common sense. That means it must consider all of the evidence given to the inquiry in writing, as well as verbally in the selective and self-interested testimony of some celebrities and academics and the shocking but thankfully unusual experience of ordinary people who became embroiled in extraordinary events. There was evidence of wrongdoing but there could be no real inquiry into phone hacking because of ongoing police activity. Neither was there much evidence heard of the millions of stories published each year that cause no offence or complaint. Indeed quite the opposite. They help ordinary people who are downtrodden by bureaucracy or subject to injustice. That is why the newspapers that are most often criticised are bought by so many. They do not want any kind of state intervention or reduction in the power of the press to probe and expose wrong-doing or hypocrisy,  launch campaigns and indeed inspire, amuse and entertain. Lord Justice Leveson also said he did not want his report to gather dust. That means it must be capable of being embraced by the industry that has already shown its determination to put its house in order. Only the industry itself can change the culture, ethics and behaviour of the press. The government and various lobby groups have seen the Leveson Inquiry as an opportunity to maybe get hold of the media and shape it, so it suits them. That would be  a dreadful outcome - that would be like going back to Stalinism, and China and North Korea. The great strength of this country  is that we do have a free press, and we have enough laws already to deal with the illegal activities the inquiry investigated. So we don't need any more legislation and Parliament must not be allowed - in any way - to take control of the media. However, we do need a genuinely independent regulator, able to control newspapers when they cross the line and stray into that grey area of smear and innuendo. The regulator should be genuinely independent of the government and the media, and have the power to both hear complaints from ordinary members of the public and act on those complaints effectively by disciplining newspapers if they transgress. A good model for the regulator might be the Independent Police Complaints Commission which works very well.	Lord Leveson's exhaustive inquiry into the media is due to report on Thursday with recommendations on the future regulation of the press and conduct between the press, politicians and police.
If true, it would solve one of aviation history's biggest mysteries. Earhart vanished during a 1937 flight over the Pacific - and her disappearance has been a breeding ground for speculation ever since. A photograph from the 1930s shows a figure that could be her, taken on the then-Japanese Marshall Islands. However, at least one prominent expert has poured cold water on the claim, saying he was "astounded" it had taken off. The new material - presented as evidence for an old theory - is a black-and-white photograph found in the vaults of the US National Archives. It shows a group of people standing on a dock. The label on the photograph says it was taken on Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands, presumably by a US spy. The link might seem thin, though, to the legendary pilot who five years before her disappearance had risen to fame as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. The claim is that one seated person with her back to the camera could be Earhart, while another figure on the far left in the photo is said to be Fred Noonan, her navigator on that last flight. On the very right of the picture is a blurry section which, it is claimed, shows Earhart's plane. Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), is certainly unconvinced. He told the BBC: "This photograph has people convinced. I'm astounded by this. I mean, my God! Look at this photograph... Let's use our heads for a moment. It's undated. They think it's from 1937. Okay. If it's from July 1, 1937 then it can't be Amelia, because she hadn't taken off yet. "If it's from 1935 or 1938 it can't be her.... This photograph has to have been taken within a very narrow window - within a couple of days of when she disappeared." He notes that the photograph came from an Office of Naval Intelligence file, saying it was "very natural" the US would want a picture of this Japanese naval asset. "And what does the photo say that it shows? ... Jaluit Atoll - Jaluit Island. It doesn't say 'Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody'! "If this is a picture of Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody, where are the Japanese? There are no soldiers in this picture. Nobody in uniform," he observes. The photograph was released by the US-based History channel ahead of a documentary to run this weekend. If the goal was to drum up attention - and hence audience numbers - it appears to have paid off. A preview of the programme has two experts backing up the claim by looking at the torso measurements of the woman alleged to be Amelia Earhart in the photo, and teeth and hairline of the figure claimed to be Fred Noonan. A far stretch? After all, the heroine has her back to the camera and it's debatable how much of a hairline let alone teeth can really be made out reliably on a faded photograph from the 1930s. Mr Gillespie says it doesn't match other known pictures of the famous aviator. "The person who they say is Amelia Earhart might be a white woman. But her hair is way too long to be Amelia's. We have many pictures of Earhart taken the day before she took off, and her hair's a lot shorter than that." He adds that the man identified as Fred Noonan does not, in his view, resemble the navigator. Further, his shirt is the wrong colour. "The man is dressed in white. Noonan always wore dark shirts and dark slacks. Amelia didn't have a shirt like that with her on the trip either. So the Japanese have apparently given them new clothes. "Everything about this is wrong," he concludes. "I'm astounded." Scepticism aside, the alleged scoop feeds into one of the existing theories about what happened to Earhart and her navigator. She disappeared during her attempt to fly around the globe, trying to reach Howland Island in the Pacific for refuelling. The official explanation is that she didn't find the island, lost communication and ran out of fuel, only to crash into the ocean. While that's a largely accepted version of events, there is no evidence - as in debris - to back it up. The two other prominent theories are that Earhart crash-landed on or near the then-Japanese Marshall Islands, or that she made it to Nikumaroro island near Kiribati and died a castaway there. There is no conclusive evidence for either of these theories - but that hasn't stopped amateur and professional historians from digging into them. Parts of a skeleton found on Nikumaroro in 1940 were initially thought to have been hers, but doctors at the time decided they belonged to a male body. Mr Gillespie, who backs the Nikumaroro theory, has led 11 expeditions in the South Pacific to research Earhart's fate. He points out that the island was uninhabited at the time when Earhart would have landed there. He and his team have recovered artefacts which they say strongly suggest the presence of an American woman from the right era - including a makeup box from the 1930s, a popular US women's moisturiser, and a jacket zipper. Mr Gillespie also cites the timing and location of radio distress calls sent by Earhart after her plane came down. He says the calls were sent "night after night" - which would suggest the plane was on land, not in the water - because if the radios got wet, they wouldn't work. "After six nights the radio signals stopped," he told the BBC. "We now think that's because the airplane was landed on the reef round the island, which is flat, smooth - dries at low tide... But the tide does come in and go out, and ... by the sixth night [he believes] the aeroplane was washed into the ocean by the tides. "So when the planes from the battleship flew over the island a week later, no plane was visible." The rest of the search took place in open ocean, and found nothing. The would-be rescuers concluded that Earhart and Noonan had sunk without a trace. The conclusion drawn by the History documentary, based on the new Marshall Islands picture, is that Earhart was taken by the Japanese, later interned and eventually died a prisoner of war. The Marshall Islands went from German to Japanese hands during World War One, and ahead of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor became an important military post for Tokyo. The Japanese archives have no records of Earhart as a prisoner - but with many documents from these archives known to have been lost, this does not necessarily prove the story wrong. At the same time, the discovery of a single photograph that may or may not show the two lost pilots is likely to add to the mystery rather than solve it.	A newly-discovered photo suggests legendary US pilot Amelia Earhart might have died in Japanese custody - and not in a plane crash in the Pacific.
