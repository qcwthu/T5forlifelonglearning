Scotland's largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), has compiled the guidance which will be sent to all schools and colleges next week. The 20-page booklet sets out a series of "poverty-proofing measures". These will help teachers mitigate the effect of low incomes on children's educational experiences. It addresses areas where cost could become an issue, such as uniform policies, school trips and access to technology, and examines the financial pressure that can be placed on families as a result. The booklet, entitled Face up to Child Poverty, is being published after the EIS asked teachers and lecturers to share their experiences of the impact of poverty on their pupils and students. It states that high living costs, the low wage economy and changes to the welfare system introduced by the Westminster government have resulted in "growing income inequality in Scotland for the first time in 20 years". It says: "Among those most severely affected by this deleterious economic combination are the children and young people that we teach. Currently 222,000 children in Scotland are in poverty - more than one in five, with the ratio increasing to more than one in three in several parts of Scotland. "Within five years, if the current austerity agenda is maintained, the number of children living in poverty will have increased by almost 50% to 322,000." On the issue of school uniform, the guidance says: "Consideration should be given to the financial cost to families of adherence to the school's uniform code, especially in cases where the school recommends a particular uniform supplier. "Often such suppliers are more expensive to purchase from than high street stores and supermarkets. In encouraging parents to buy from these more expensive suppliers, schools may be causing families, albeit inadvertently, even greater financial hardship." Referring to equipment, it said it should "never be assumed that all families can afford to buy even the most basic of resources such as pens and pencils". Teachers are also advised to be aware of signs of hunger among pupils and to act with "sensitivity" on the issue. EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The fact that food poverty now affects such a large, and growing, section of society should shame those in government and elsewhere who continue to push the damaging and divisive austerity-above-all agenda. "Schools and colleges are part of society, and so are not immune from the problems of that wider society. Working alone, educational establishments cannot eradicate poverty or eliminate completely its negative impact on young people. "However, teachers and lecturers can, and do, make a very real difference in the lives of the young people that they work with on a day-to-day basis." He added: "Our hope is that, by offering this booklet to all schools and colleges, teachers and lecturers will give even greater consideration to how poverty affects their pupils and students."	Scottish teachers are to receive new advice on reducing the impact of poverty on their pupils.
Passengers arrived safely at their destination after the 31 August incident, in which an A321S plane was used instead of a A321H. The A321S has less safety and medical equipment on board than the A321H. American Airlines is investigating the plane mix-up with the Federal Aviation Administration. "Whether the plane was going to make it there was never a question," company spokesman Casey Norton told the BBC. Mr Norton said the two planes are equipped with the same engine, fuel tanks, range and basic safety features. The A321H plane, because it is used for long flights, comes with more medical supplies and safety features like fire suppression. "We're reviewing our procedures and looking at everyone involved," Mr Norton said. The airline has revised its software to properly identify the correct aircraft are operating the correct routes, he said. He said the A321S plane flies over water regularly for many missions but is not extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS)-certified, which the airline requires for flights to Hawaii. The A321S plane comes with four slide-rafts and a portable raft, along with life jackets and seat cushions that can be used as flotation devices, the same as the A321H, Mr Norton said.	A plane not certified to travel for long distances over water was used to fly from Los Angeles to Hawaii last month, American Airlines has confirmed.
They had to come from behind after Shay McCartan pounced on a defensive error and rounded Bobby Olejnik to score. Matt Oakley created Exeter's quickfire equaliser with a through ball that Tom Nicholls dispatched. McCartan then struck a post, but the Grecians won it when substitute Christian Ribeiro bundled in a corner. Promotion-chasing Stanley stayed sixth, while Exeter moved within five points of the play-off places in 13th.	Exeter City shrugged off their midweek FA Cup defeat by Liverpool to beat Accrington Stanley and record back-to-back League Two victories.
In a speech he said that he expected rates to rise over the next three years, reaching "about half as high as historical averages", or about 2%. But he added that shocks to the economy could change the timing and the size of any rate rise. Interest rates have been at 0.5% for six years as the UK economy recovers from the financial crisis. The Monetary Policy Committee will "have to feel its way as it goes," Mr Carney said in a speech at Lincoln Cathedral. He added: "Short term interest rates have averaged around 4.5% since around the Bank's inception three centuries ago. "It would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. "In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year," he added. His comments come a day after unemployment rose for the first time in two years. "That suggests the Bank's interpretation of those statistics is that unemployment falls are now being held back by skills shortages," said the BBC's economics editor Robert Peston. "And those skills shortages are also responsible for rising wage inflation." On Tuesday, outgoing MPC member David Miles, regarded as someone who is cautious about the impact of rise, surprised markets by saying it was "likely to be right" to hike rates soon. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the chair of the US's Federal Reserve indicated that interest rates are likely to rise in the US this year. That could be a few months earlier than in the UK if indeed the Bank of England were to move in the new year. If rates were to rise early in the new year, from the current all-time record low of 0.5%, that would be three or four months after the expected equivalent move by the US Federal Reserve. Now for those of you with big debts looking for reassurance that you are not going to be financially crippled by the increase, he has said two other things of note about the so-called Bank Rate. First typical interest rate changes, increments, will be typically much smaller than the half of a percentage point that they used to be before the Crash of 2008 - so probably one quarter of a percentage point, or even possibly an eighth. Also he has signalled that the new normal rate of interest over the medium term after a succession of rises over two or three years will be perhaps half the 4.5% over rate of the past 300 years. So nearer 2%. Read Robert's blog in full here	Bank of England governor Mark Carney has indicated that UK interest rates could rise "at the turn of this year".
Barry Imray, 35, of no fixed address, is jointly accused of killing Lee Irving, who was found dead near a footpath in Newcastle last year. James Wheatley, 29, from Studdon Walk, also denies Mr Irving's murder. Mr Wheatley's mother, Julie Mills, 51, and his girlfriend, Nicole Lawrence, 22, are accused of "causing or allowing" Mr Irving's death. All four deny the charges against them. Mr Imray told Newcastle Crown Court he had seen Mr Irving with facial injuries a week before his death. When asked by his defence counsel how he felt on finding the 24-year-old apparently lifeless a week later at the house they shared in Kenton Bar, he said he had been "scared". Jamie Hill QC asked Mr Imray if he had "done anything" to Mr Irving, such as hitting him or kicking him, to which he said no. It is alleged Mr Irving, who had learning difficulties, had been sedated by the defendants, rather than taken for medical treatment. The court heard how he had been found about half a mile from the house with 27 rib fractures and a broken nose and jaw. The trial continues.	A man accused of murder has told a court he is "easily led".
Pressure has grown on Shaun Wright, who was in charge of children's services in Rotherham from 2005 to 2010, to step down in the wake of a damning report. The report found at least 1,400 children in the town were sexually exploited by mainly Pakistani heritage criminal gangs between 1997 and 2013. Mr Wright said he was the most appropriate person to hold the office. Jack Dromey told the World Tonight on Radio 4: "Shaun should go and we're absolutely clear if he does not agree to resign he will be suspended from the Labour party tomorrow morning." Mr Wright needs to "exercise his conscience and face up his responsibility", said Mr Dromey. Senior politicians from other parties have also called on Mr Wright to step down from his role as police and crime commissioner (PCC). Home Secretary Theresa May said he should "heed calls" to resign. She said it was not her job as home secretary to hire and fire PCCs. She added: "I think he has real questions to answer. I think in the circumstances he should heed those calls." BBC Newsnight's Laura Kuenssberg earlier tweeted that Mr Wright was said to be at home, "consulting with his family about his future". Sarah Champion, the Labour MP for Rotherham, said Mr Wright "needs to stand up and be counted for what happened under his watch". Other senior party figures, including shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant, also joined calls for him to resign. Mr Wright apologised to victims but insisted he had no knowledge of the "industrial scale" of child abuse when he was a Labour councillor in the South Yorkshire town. A report commissioned by the council was published on Tuesday and revealed the massive level of abuse in Rotherham. The inquiry team noted fears among council staff of being labelled "racist" if they focused on victims' descriptions of the majority of abusers as "Asian" men. 1,400 children were abused, 1997-2013 1/3 of victims were already known to social services 157 reports concerning child sexual exploitation made to police in 2013 10 prosecutions were made between 2013 and April 2014 However, Mr Wright told the BBC the scale of the problem in Rotherham had "come as a surprise". "Had I known then what I know now I could have done more," Mr Wright said. "As an elected member I came into this role to make a difference. At every stage I've done my utmost to protect those people. "I have taken lessons learned in that office and brought them to bear in my new role with South Yorkshire Police. "I believe I am the most appropriate person to hold this office at this current time," he said. Rotherham Borough Council leader Roger Stone quit following the publication of the report, which was commissioned by the council and detailed gang rapes, grooming, trafficking and other sexual exploitation on a wide scale in the South Yorkshire town. Race, fear and abuse in Rotherham Town consumed by shock and disgust But calls for further resignations have gathered momentum as the spotlight now turns on to others at the helm of local services during the time of the abuse. It has emerged that no council employees would face disciplinary action, as the authority's chief executive Martin Kimber said there was not enough evidence to prosecute. This is despite the report's author Professor Alexis Jay concluding there had been "blatant" collective failures by the council's leadership. Former children's minister Tim Loughton told the BBC's Newsnight that any social worker involved in the failings in Rotherham "has absolutely no place" in the care of children. The Conservative MP claimed it was a "common theme" in sex abuse scandals that "nobody pays the consequences". A Conservative Party spokesman said the government was "establishing an independent inquiry panel of experts in the law and child protection to consider whether public bodies - and other non-state institutions - have taken seriously their duty of care to protect children from sexual abuse". Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent Shadow chancellor Ed Balls says the Labour Party has "communicated" to Shaun Wright he should stand down - but under the legislation that created the PCCs he couldn't compel him to go. While PCCs can fire chief constables, there are very narrow grounds for their own dismissal. The Home Office says ultimately it's the local electorate who will hold them to account. Fewer than 15% of eligible voters took part in the 2012 election in South Yorkshire - though the current controversy might spark more interest. Local police and crime panels were set up to "provide checks and balances" and can scrutinise their actions. But these panels can only suspend a PCC if they are charged with an offence which carries a prison term of more than two years. As he has committed no crime, Shaun Wright can simply refuse to go. Labour could start disciplinary proceedings for bringing the party into disrepute but neither Ed Miliband nor the government could stop Mr Wright continuing as an independent PCC. One of the Rotherham victims, who is now 24, told the BBC's Today programme she had been groomed by men from the age of 12. Solicitors Switalkskis confirmed on Tuesday they were acting for 15 abuse victims suing South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council for failing to protect them. Karen Froggatt, a director of the charity Victim Support, told the BBC: "The details in that report were truly horrific and it's obvious that some serious mistakes were made in Rotherham. "For the victims not to have been believed and to actually have been treated with disdain and contempt is just appalling and just makes the trauma that they've gone through a million times worse." Several political opponents also joined calls saying Mr Wright's position as the PCC was now untenable. The leader of the Lib Dem group on Sheffield City Council, Colin Ross, said: "Lessons must be learnt and those responsible must be held to account. "Shaun Wright was the councillor in charge of children's services at Rotherham Council and also sat on the Authority of South Yorkshire Police when both organisations knew about the level of child sexual exploitation, but chose not do anything about it. "It's difficult to see how local people can have confidence in him to continue as our PCC." A member of the South Yorkshire police and crime panel, which scrutinises the PCC, has also called for Mr Wright's resignation. UKIP councillor Caven Vines, said: "To me he should never have even put up for the job in the first place. "He should go. He should have gone straight away." Mr Wright has previously apologised for the failure of Rotherham Council while he was in its cabinet from 2005 to 2010. The deputy leader of Rotherham Council, Labour's Paul Lakin, said he would not resign from the authority. "I've been on the council since 1999, and I am one of the councillors that's seen this through," he said. "I can categorically say that until I came into children's services in 2010, I was not aware of the depth and breadth of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham."	A Labour frontbencher has said the party will suspend South Yorkshire's PCC if he fails to quit by the morning.
Officials described the findings as a "fire alarm". But they warned that there are major problems with the way the data is collected. The statistics are part of a drive to make the NHS more transparent in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal. Neglect and abuse at Stafford Hospital led to hundreds of unnecessary deaths between 2005 and 2008 and prompted a public inquiry. While officials called the Risk Adjusted Mortality Index (Rami) a "fire alarm", they warned that problems gathering the data made it difficult to interpret the figures. Data is collected across the UK and a score of 100 is considered normal. When an NHS organisation scores more than 100 it could be an indicator that the number of patients who are dying is higher than should be expected. A Labour MP who is advising the prime minister on how the NHS handles complaints said she was shocked by the mortality rate at Wales' biggest hospital. In the most recent batch of data, the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff has the highest score of any Welsh hospital at 128. David Cameron appointed Ann Clwyd as an advisor after the Cynon Valley MP complained about the standard of care her husband Owen Roberts received before he died at UHW. Patients and their families had written to her about their experiences at the UHW and other hospitals, she said. She added: "I hope this will act as a warning signal to the Welsh government to check on the quality of care that is being offered to patients in these hospitals. "I am determined to find out the reason for the high death rate at UHW, especially as my husband is now one of these statistics." Dr Graham Shortland, medical director for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: "We have confidence in our staff and the care and treatment they provide and we are reassured by what we are being told by other accepted systems and methods of reviewing quality and safety. "However, we are in no way complacent about this and work is already underway to further scrutinise this data and any link to the coding problems that we are currently tackling." A programme of detailed patient case-note reviews will be expanded, he said. Betsan Powys: RAMI: Ropey And Muddled Information? During the most recent period recorded, five out of six local health boards in Wales had scores higher than 100. However, officials warned that higher scores may be due to problems gathering data, rather than lapses in the quality of patient care. The Rami takes into account other factors about patients, including their underlying health, social factors and their lifestyles. The way the data is collected is known as coding. Welsh government officials say that coding in Welsh hospitals has not been as good as in the English NHS. Other annual adjustments to the index make it difficult to compare mortality rates from year to year. The Welsh government uses Rami scores as one way of measuring performance in the NHS. However, it says Rami cannot be looked at in isolation and that reviewing case notes after a patient dies is a better way to find out whether improvements to care are needed. Ministers committed to making more information available as part of their response to the public inquiry into Stafford Hospital. Grant Robinson, medical director for Aneurin Bevan Local Health Board, said the inconsistencies in coding made it difficult to turn the index into a league table. But he added: "Anyone who says this is just coding would be missing an important opportunity to improve care." He said: "It's important to look underneath the numbers and see what's really going on "We've compared this to a fire alarm. So what you have to do is go see if there is a fire and the best way to do that is to look inside your hospital, get on the ground, see what's happening to patients, and also see what did happen to patients who've died to see if it could have been done better. "The statistics we have got are acting as fire alarms, so yes there's the sound of an alarm ringing. "What we need to know is where the fires are and we need to be very alert and get on top of that when it happens quickly." Health Minister Mark Drakeford, who was appointed in a cabinet reshuffle last week, said: "The Welsh government is committed to transparency on performance and to improving access to NHS information. "As from today, anyone in Wales can view a measure of hospital mortality data on local health board and Welsh government websites." The most recent data available is for the period September 2011 to October 2012. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which had a Rami score of 116, said it had a backlog of 40,000 patient episodes which have not yet been coded. The University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff - Wales' biggest hospital - had the highest Rami score of 128. The lowest were University Hospital Llandough, on the outskirts of Cardiff, and Nevill Hall Hospital, in Abergavenny, at 86. Welsh government deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said: "The need to improve the timeliness and accuracy of data collection is well understood by chief executives and their boards. Health boards have plans in place to meet the standards required." Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar said the suggestion that mortality rates were higher in bigger hospitals called into question the Welsh government's reconfiguration of hospitals. "The new health minister must take immediate action to investigate those hospitals with the highest death rates to ensure that swift improvements are made," he said. He also pointed out that the most recent figures available to the public were six months old. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said: "I am in no way comparing it to what happened in Mid-Staffordshire, however, given that there are huge problems in data collection and with LHBs and the Welsh Labour government not having a handle on what's going on, I am concerned that we wouldn't be able to readily identify areas of serious weakness in our hospitals if they arose."	Eleven out of 17 district general hospitals in Wales have higher death rates than should be expected, according to statistics published by the Welsh government.
Shunsuke Mutai, the vice-minister of reconstruction, was visiting the town of Iwaizumi to assess the deadly damage caused by Typhoon Lionrock. The storm killed more than 20 people in the region. But he was seen on TV laughingly being piggybacked by a less senior official, so he could keep his feet dry. Mr Mutai, who apparently forgot to take rubber boots with him, later apologised, saying what he did was "inappropriate" and that he "deeply regretted it". The picture went viral on social media with netizens lambasting the vice-minister and accusing him of not taking his job seriously. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga later criticised Mr Mutai for lacking sensitivity. "He went there as head of the government investigation team, so naturally he should have brought his rubber boots to begin with. "I must say he lacked sensitivity to the residents and the region," he said.	A Japanese senior government official has come under criticism for hitching a ride on a colleague's back to cross a puddle.
The app, which helps doctors and nurses spot signs of kidney failure, proved controversial when it was rolled out at the Royal Free hospital in London. The issue centred around whether it should have sought consent to access 1.6 million patient records. The BBC understands that in the new deal there will be no opt-out for patients who do not wish to share their data. DeepMind is Google's artificial intelligence firm, although development of the app did not involve any AI. The firm has a health division and is keen to explore new ways that technology can be used in the NHS. While the Streams app was welcomed by doctors and nurses, questions were raised about whether the NHS should have shared data with a firm such as Google. DeepMind has always reiterated that no data is shared with its parent firm. A report from the the head of the National Data Guardian said patients should have been informed about the partnership and data sharing arrangement. The app is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office. Following some negative headlines, DeepMind pledged to be more open with patients about its health plans and hold regular patient engagement forums. Musgrove Park Hospital plans to hold workshops and open day events with staff and the public to see how the app works, what it will mean for patients and how it will be developed in future. The hospital did not rule out the possibility that it could be used in future to detect other health conditions. Dr Luke Gompels, consultant in medicine at Musgrove Park Hospital, said: "This is all about early detection of seriously unwell patients so that we can immediately escalate care, ensure a very rapid response, and make sure they are treated quickly by the right specialist doctor. In this way we can make more of a difference, more quickly."	Google's DeepMind has extended the use of its Streams health app to Musgrove Park Hospital in Somerset.
Khalid Alahmadi, 23, took advantage of the 19-year-old's "vulnerability and intoxication" on 24 September 2015, a jury heard. She said she recalled becoming conscious while slumped against a tree as Mr Alahmadi was pressed against her. He denies sexual assault and the trial at Newport Crown Court continues. On Tuesday, the jury was told the alleged attack took place in Gorsedd Gardens in front of the national museum in Cardiff. The student told the court she spent the night with friends at the Tiger Tiger nightclub. She said she recalled meeting people and dancing, but because of the amount she had drunk, she had a limited recollection of what happened at the end of the night. Prosecution barrister Matthew Cobbe told the jury Mr Alahmadi became aware of the woman's "vulnerability and intoxication and took advantage of that". He said Mr Alahmadi intentionally touched the woman in a sexual way without consent and without believing she consented. When interviewed by police, the woman said she had been "very drunk"  and "unable to hold myself up". She said when she came to, she ran away and the man made no attempt to follow her. When she arrived at a friend's house, she said what had happened and her friend contacted the police.	A student has described coming to as a man was attacking her in a Cardiff park after a night out during freshers' week.
As the victims struggle with the misery of damage, mud and ruin, officials say we have entered an era of "unknown extremes" of weather and they want a "complete rethink" of how flooding is handled. Some aspects of the response are infinitely improved from earlier disasters. The emergency teams from organisations as diverse as the fire brigades, the RNLI and the police are far better co-ordinated than they used to be. In Carlisle earlier this month, I saw one mountain rescue team, well-equipped with an inflatable boat, ropes, torches and radios, inch through deep water in total darkness to carefully and tenderly deliver a frightened woman to safety. But however professional the response, questions are inevitably raised about why this effort is needed in the first place, with people demanding to know why their communities were not better defended. And that leads to a sense of anger that as victims of flooding feel ignored or let down by the authorities for failing to keep them safe. I first witnessed this during the summer of 2007 in Hull, where thousands of families were displaced by floods with some still in temporary housing a year later. One family I interviewed were incensed at the prospect of facing a second Christmas in a chilly caravan. Earlier this month, residents in Carlisle, who had watched the construction of a £38m flood-defence scheme just five years before, reacted with fury as it was overtopped by rising waters. We have heard anger too from Leeds City Council which, like many northern authorities, believes that Whitehall favours the South when it comes to allocating funds for flood defence - though the government insists that the North does better on a per capita basis. And anger has been voiced in York in the past few days as the Environment Agency made a fateful decision to lift the Foss Barrier, a key part of the city's flood defence system. With the barrier's electrical motors at risk of flooding - something which itself will face investigation - staff feared that the barrier, if left lowered, could become stuck there, trapping the waters of the Foss and causing more flooding. But, in turn, the raising of the barrier inevitably meant some homes would be flooded anyway - fewer than would have been hit with the barrier left in place, says the EA, but this is a source of deep irritation for many. Along with the despair and the anger comes another dimension: scrutiny. This starts as soon as floods start to cause damage and in some cases the arguments are unchanging year after year. At its simplest are decisions about the scale of government funding - whether the £2.3bn allocated by the government over a six-year period is enough and, crucially, where to spend the money. The longstanding Treasury rule is that for every £1 devoted to flood defence, there must be an economic benefit of at least £8 - a principle which is designed to make saving homes the priority. So cities, with their dense populations, will attract more than rural areas with fewer people, which is why London gets the best protection of all, and tiny villages the least. To help places that might not qualify, the government encourages "partnership funding", another source of cash from local authorities, business groups or communities - but raising it has never been easy. Last year in Norfolk, along a shoreline vulnerable to flooding, I sensed a lot of reluctance among local people to the idea of contributing towards the cost of their own defences. And assuming there is agreement on funding - and maybe an increase in the budget - there remains the tough job of deciding how big a defence to build. Until now, engineers have looked back at past records of rainfall and flooding to do their calculations. The barriers in Carlisle, for example, were constructed with this in mind, but with an additional half-metre (1ft 8in) added on top to allow for the effects of climate change - because warmer air is known to be able to hold more moisture which means that rainfall could become more intense as temperatures rise. Yet, when it struck, the deluge there was another half-metre above even the extra half-metre added to the defences. So difficult decisions lie ahead about the scale of protection that will be needed. And there are further complications. For a pretty town whose riverfront is a tourist attraction, like Keswick in the Lake District, there is a natural reluctance to see massive walls permanently towering over the banks. And if one place wins protection, other communities downstream will clamour for help too. The Jubilee River, an artificial channel, was dug to help Maidenhead and Windsor but has long been criticised by residents of Wraysbury who say it has made them more vulnerable to flooding. The challenge is that flood defence can never be seen in isolation. The new homes the country so badly needs can be most easily built on flat land but that often lies in floodplains - so will planning policy be changed to limit where houses go? New shopping centres or industrial estates with vast car parks can be a huge source of run-off - but can that be changed? One logical plan is for farmers to do more to help trap rainwater in the uplands before it descends via tributaries into the plains below. A pilot scheme has just begun in North Yorkshire - but some say this can never make much difference. Another idea is to create huge water storage sites - like mini-reservoirs - that can hold back any sudden downpour, though there may be disputes over where to site them and how to fund them. And if the government's new review into flooding concludes that climate change will make more intense rainstorms more frequent, should we follow the example of major tropical cities? Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur has invested in a huge tunnel that can handle traffic or, when storms strike, floodwater. For a temperate island more used to drizzle, this seems radical. But as one storm follows another, and new rainfall records keep being set, maybe new ideas will start to seem normal.	Every bout of flooding triggers a predictable cycle of despair, anger and scrutiny, but this one has provoked an unprecedented level of criticism and questioning.
Dr Margaret Ann Rous, who was 37, and her 28-year-old husband David Rous were killed when a light aircraft struck the ground in Glen Etive. The couple, from Newport-on-Tay in Fife, had been flying from Dundee to visit relatives on Tiree. The emergency services had been alerted when contact was lost with the Piper Cherokee at about 13:50 on Saturday. Police Scotland said the wreckage was discovered on the northern aspect of Glen Kinglass at 20:00, along with the remains of the two people on board. Dr Rous' sister Johann Maclean paid tribute to her on social media. She posted on Facebook: "Today has been the hardest day of my life, I love you Minnie xxxx" She also thanked friends and family for their sympathy messages. "Thank you all for the heartfelt messages, phone calls and visits," she wrote. "We appreciate your thoughts at this heartbreaking time xx." Following the discovery of the wreckage, specialist officers remained at the scene in the Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass. Inquiries are continuing into the cause of the accident.	Tribute has been paid to a Dundee GP and her engineer husband who died in a plane crash in Argyll.
The deal will create the second largest cable broadband provider in the US. Charter had to agree to not stop its content providers from separately selling shows online, as part of the approval. The deal also still needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) before it can go ahead. But the head of the FCC Tom Wheeler said he was seeking approval for the deal, noting the merger conditions "will directly benefit consumers by bringing and protecting competition to the video marketplace and increasing broadband deployment." The DoJ said it would work with other regulators to ensure the merger did not "choke off" access to online videos. "The settlement forbids the merged company, referred to as "New Charter," from entering into or enforcing agreements that could make it more difficult for online video distributors (OVDs) to obtain video content from programmers," the DOJ added. US cable companies are facing stiff competition from online service providers such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, as customers increasingly choose to stream films and television shows over the internet often for a lower price. Charter will pay $78bn (Â£54bn) for Time Warner and $10.8bn for Bright House. The combined three firms will serve cable television and broadband to 23.9 million customers in 41 states. The deal was announced last year after Comcast abandoned its $45bn plan to buy Time Warner Cable fearing pressure from regulators.	The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has approved Charter Communications purchase of cable operators Time Warner Cable and Bright House networks.
Thomas Orchard, 32, who had schizophrenia, died in October 2012. An Emergency Response Belt was held around his mouth when he threatened to bite, police said. Custody sergeant Jan Kingshott, 44, and civilian detention officers Simon Tansley, 38, and Michael Marsden, 55, all deny manslaughter. The defence said the belt was "unfortunately" what officers had been equipped with. Mr Tansley's barrister, Michael Mather-Lees, told the court: "It looks appalling but unfortunately this was the item they had been given. It was approved, tested, trained upon and given to use as a spit or bite mask." Prosecutors previously told the court there was no evidence Mr Orchard tried to bite Mr Tansley, who held the belt around Mr Orchard's mouth. However, Mr Mather-Lees said the CCTV footage showing police treatment of Mr Orchard in his cell "doesn't show everything - it doesn't show every angle". Mr Orchard, who had been arrested in Exeter on suspicion of a public order offence, was left lying face down on a mattress in his cell at Heavitree Road police station after he was freed from restraints. Officers discovered he was not breathing when they re-entered the cell 12 minutes later, Bristol Crown Court had heard. Mr Mather-Lees told the court Mr Tansley would have acted had he been aware that Mr Orchard was having problems breathing. Mr Orchard, who had not been taking his medication for schizophrenia, died in hospital following a cardiac arrest. The trial continues.	An "appalling" looking belt used to restrain a man who died after having a cardiac arrest in a police cell was "not ideal", a court has heard.
A club statement said Dortmund were "full of sadness" after one fan passed away and another had to be resuscitated following two separate incidents. Fellow fans watched the rest of Dortmund's 2-0 win in virtual silence after news of the death spread through the stands. The club said the second supporter was in a stable condition in hospital. The club statement read: "During the game there were two tragic incidents in the stadium in which two spectators had to be resuscitated. "Unfortunately one person did not make it and has died. We are full of sadness and the families are in our thoughts. "We have received the news from the hospital that the condition of the second person is apparently stable." Thousands of fans sang You'll Never Walk Alone during the match and following the final whistle as a mark of respect. Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel: "My personal sympathies, just as those of the entire team and the backroom staff, go to the families and loved ones of the affected persons. It was a terrible situation. "We all know that there are more important things in this life than football. It was very difficult to stand on the edge of the pitch or on the pitch, not knowing what was going on but still having to fulfil our obligation of putting in the best-possible performance." Mainz boss Martin Schimdt: "Naturally our thoughts are with the relatives after such tragic events, and we wish to offer our deepest condolences. "I found it inspiring how 80,000 fans fell quiet as a mark of respect in just a few minutes. Such solidarity is impressive, everyone in the stadium came together as a unit. That is, sadly, not always the case."	A fan has died after falling ill during Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga game against Mainz on Sunday.
It was the famous logo for the Rolling Stones and was part of an experiment by tech start-up Lightvert. Its technology can produce images that appear to be 200m (656ft) high, but which only exist in the eye of the viewer for a fraction of a second. So could we be on the verge of seeing giant digital ads in our cities, similar to those featured in the seminal 1982 sci-fi film Blade Runner? Lightvert certainly hopes so. Its tech, called Echo, works by employing a narrow - no more than 200mm - strip of reflective material fixed to the side of a building. A high-power projector mounted below or above the strip beams light off the reflector directly into the viewer's eye. The image appears momentarily, exploiting what's called the "persistence of vision" effect - the way sparklers seem to leave a trail of light when you wave them around quickly. "Echo technology is being well received by those who have seen it to date," says Daniel Siden, Lightvert's chief executive. "Viewers are curious as to how it works and engage with it in a way you just don't see with traditional screen media." He is hoping that landlords will grab the opportunity to turn their buildings into revenue-generating digital billboards that are huge, yet physically unobtrusive. These are very early days for the firm, but Mr Siden believes outdoor advertising generally is overdue a leap forward in innovation. But would you want a billboard to target adverts at you specifically? That's what happened in Moscow recently. Drivers approaching a digital billboard were shown ads for Jaguar's new SUV (sports utility vehicle), but only if they were driving a different make of SUV. A machine-learning camera recognised the vehicle's make and changed the ad to target those drivers. The billboard image was adaptive, too, showing the Jaguar against a dark background if it was night-time, or manoeuvring through snow if the weather was bad. The ads were developed by Synaps Labs and founder Aleksey Utkin says there are plans to test similar ads in the US this summer. But won't such ads be dangerously distracting? A study on driver distraction by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute found that digital billboards attracted the gaze of drivers for much longer than other signs. Researchers found drivers often took their eyes off the road for more than two seconds - a threshold which other studies have found to be dangerous. Some bricks-and-mortar retailers, such as video games specialist Game, are using augmented reality (AR) tech to bring their shop windows to life. Overlaying moving digital images on to the real world, as seen through a smartphone camera, caught the public imagination after the release of Nintendo's Pokemon Go game. "AR is no longer just a nice-to-see technology - it has a far more extensive commercial application for brands, where results can be tracked and measured," says Richard Corps, co-founder of Ads Reality. "We're seeing a much wider industry use of AR tech in different environments, such as in education as well as retail." The uptake of AR in advertising is likely to increase due to the demands of a new generation of consumer, says Alex Fenton, a lecturer in digital business at Salford Business School. "AR has lots of potential," he says. "The technology has been around for many years but had failed to capture the imagination of the mainstream. "But with things like Pokemon Go, there's now an acceptance from young people in particular about AR and its benefits." A few years ago retailers were excited about the potential of pinging you specific offers and ads to your phone based on where you were in the store or High Street. But "proximity marketing" as it's called, has so far failed to take off, mainly due to the high costs of installing and maintaining Bluetooth beacons used to locate shoppers precisely. But Devicescape eschews Bluetooth and instead tracks smartphone users via the use of wi-fi hotspots. "Our software establishes a person's presence in a particular location based on their proximity to the wi-fi network at that location," says Owen Geddes, the firm's vice president of market development. "It could be anywhere, a supermarket, a concert hall, or a bus." This has resulted in a 13% rise in customers clicking through to product websites, he maintains. Once aware of a person's location, the system triggers the delivery of a targeted ad to that smartphone containing a link to a piece of online branded content. "It could be a discount offer for use in the shop the person is visiting, or a piece of content such as a movie trailer," says Mr Geddes. "Importantly, it is always relevant to the consumer because of their location." But Chris Daly, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM), says customers are instinctively sceptical about how their data is used, and thinks the industry will need to tread carefully. CIM research has shown that 92% of customers are wary about data collection and use. "When using adtech, marketers must keep this in mind and ensure they do not overstep their reach when making use of consumer data," says Mr Daly. Maybe sticking to giant ads in the sky would be less controversial.

A senior adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May has told BBC Newsnight that the chancellor is expected to herald a move towards a greater focus on fiscal policy - tax and spending - in his Autumn Statement on 23 November. The move towards a more Keynesian approach towards the economy will mark a departure from former chancellor George Osborne's reliance on what he called "monetary activism". This covered interest rates and the purchase of assets by the Bank of England known as quantitative easing. George Freeman, the chairman of the prime minister's policy board, told Newsnight that Mrs May had used her speech to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham to signal "loud and clear" that she had concerns about relying so heavily on monetary policy. The PM said ultra low interest rates had produced "bad side effects", notably by hitting savers. Newsnight understands that the remarks by the prime minister show that she now believes the time is approaching for a shift in emphasis in the defining mechanism for running the economy. She believes that in future it would be wise to lean in favour of tax and spending to allow for greater public investment. The chancellor will set out the fresh thinking in his autumn statement on 23 November, marking a break with the era of Mr Osborne who championed "monetary activism" and "fiscal responsibility" - low interest rates and spending restraint with a focus on deficit reduction. Mr Freeman told Newsnight: "Philip Hammond is going to set this out in the Autumn Statement. But Theresa has been very clear that this model of the emergency QE package, bail out the banks, stabilise the economy has had a very profound effect on the distribution of wealth. "Those with assets have done very much better than those without. We have to listen to the roar we heard this year and we have to think with money available at 0% - and we want to drive an industrial strategy, getting infrastructure built - we need to make sure we are looking at all the mechanisms for making that money flows properly." He confirmed Downing Street still supports the Bank of England's independence which means it has sole control over monetary policy and it will face no restrictions on the setting of interest rates. The bank's governor, Mark Carney, decides on quantitative easing though he has to seek the approval of the chancellor. Government sources have indicated that the Treasury will continue to accept the governor's advice on quantitative easing. But Mr Freeman signalled that the prime minister believes the UK economy should enter a new era. He told Newsnight: "It is up to the Bank of England obviously to set out with their mandate how they handle that. But she is signalling loud and clear that we need to make sure we understand what effect this model of growth has had on those who are paying for it - the citizens of this country - and to use every lever we have to make sure the economy works for them." Mrs May believes a new approach is needed for two reasons. In the first place she believes that a new economic era, as the government relaxes Mr Osborne's deficit reduction plan in light of the EU referendum, requires a fresh approach to economic management. But she also believes that the government needs to do more to help lower income groups. She thinks low interest rates have helped people with assets but have hit those who rely on savings. The prime minister first outlined her belief in a new approach in a speech in Birmingham on 11 July when she launched her national campaign for the Tory leadership. She echoed these words in her conference speech on Wednesday, also delivered in Birmingham, when she said of current monetary policy: "People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer."	Chancellor Philip Hammond is planning to embark on a major shift in gear on economic policy as the government embraces a more interventionist approach with increased spending on infrastructure projects.
The Daily Telegraph claimed Black had advised undercover reporters how to bribe officials at other clubs. During an internal investigation, Southampton requested the Telegraph provide them with evidence. In a statement, it said: "There is no evidence of any wrongdoing, as such the club now considers the matter closed." The statement added: "Despite numerous requests to provide the club with any evidence relating to the allegation against Mr Black, none has been forthcoming. " Black, 54, joined the Premier League club in June as assistant to manager Claude Puel. The former Aston Villa caretaker manager and Aberdeen striker denied the allegations.	Southampton have concluded there is "no evidence" to support allegations of wrongdoing made by a newspaper against its assistant manager Eric Black.
The force confirmed it was examining a number of buildings used for firearms training between 1980 and 2007. It also said it was in the process of contacting "a large number of officers" who might have been affected. At one time asbestos was frequently used as a building material. Exposure to asbestos can cause serious and potentially-fatal diseases including mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis. It is thought it is generally only people who regularly work directly with materials containing asbestos who are at any serious health risk but Health and Safety Executive figures estimate there are 5,000 deaths a year caused by exposure to the substance. Short-term exposure is not considered to pose a danger. The HSE says asbestos can be present in any building built or refurbished before 2000. The Met said it would undertake rigorous examinations at all buildings where firearms training took place to establish whether asbestos was present. Ch Supt Mike Gallagher said officers still working for the force had been contacted. He said inquiries had identified a possible issue at some buildings used historically and detailed investigations had been carried out to identify all those individuals potentially affected. "Due to the time period in question and number of possible sites, we need to make contact with a large number of officers," he added. "This will include those who have left, retired, or transferred, so clearly this is a process which will take some time." Professor John Cherrie, of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, who has worked on several asbestos research projects, said most people were exposed to low levels of asbestos at some time during their life. "However, people who become ill from asbestos are usually those who were exposed to it on a regular basis, most often in a job where they worked directly with asbestos-containing materials."	Up to 30,000 police officers might have come into contact with asbestos at training facilities, the Metropolitan Police have said.
The Bolivian authorities earlier said the pontiff had requested to chew coca to help him cope with the effects of the high altitude in La Paz. The Pope made the remark when questioned by a journalist as to the secret of his energy during his South American tour, which ended yesterday. Pope Francis said that mate, the traditional tea popular in his native Argentina, helped to keep him going. "You wanted to ask me what is my drug of choice? Well, mate helps me. But I haven't tried coca, I want to make that clear," said the Pope during the flight from the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion, to Rome. Coca leaves, which are the raw ingredient for cocaine, are used legally for medical and religious purposes in Bolivia. The leaves are chewed or brewed in teas and work as a mild stimulant, helping also to alleviate nausea caused by high altitudes. Bolivia's left-wing President Evo Morales began his political life as the leader of the cocaleros, traditional coca leaf producers. The pontiff, who had part of a lung removed when he was young, only stayed in the La Paz area - which lies 3,650m (12,000ft) above sea level - for about four hours. The pontiff returned to Rome this morning after an eight-day trip to Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay, some of Latin America's poorest countries. Pope Francis addressed inequality, poverty and indigenous rights during his South American tour. The pontiff's visit to Bolivia was marked by controversy when Mr Morales gave him a crucifix sculpted in the shape of a hammer and sickle. The Pope looked visibly surprised and it was rumoured that the crucifix had been left behind in Bolivia. But Pope Francis has now clarified that he took it back with him to the Vatican. The crucifix was based on a design by Luis Espinal, a Jesuit Priest assassinated in 1980 by right-wing militia. "It was a surprise indeed. I didn't know that Father Espinal was also a poet and a sculptor," he said. "He was killed in 1980, a time when the [Catholic Church's] Liberation Theology embraced so many different groups and one of them adopted Marxist views." Pope Francis also shared his views on the popularity of selfies: "Today a policeman, a man in his forties, asked to take a selfie with me. I told him: But are you a teenager? "It is a different culture. I respect it but I feel like a great-grandfather," said Pope Francis.	Pope Francis has said he did not chew coca during his recent trip to Bolivia.
The cross-party group said speaking English was "the key to full participation in our society and  economy". They also said ministers should consider letting different parts of the UK set their own immigration policy. The government said it was spending Â£20m on English language provision. Last month a report by Dame Louise Casey warned of "worrying" levels of segregation in some areas and called for more English classes for isolated groups. The report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration urges the government to go further, saying all immigrants should have either learnt English before coming to the UK or be required to sign up to classes when they arrive. The group said integration should begin upon arrival in the UK and described speaking English as a "prerequisite for meaningful engagement with most British people". The government has promised new migration controls once the UK leaves the EU but has not yet set out a detailed model. According to the cross-party group, "substantial" immigration powers should be devolved to the UK's nations and regions, with devolved governments or city regions setting quotas. 4.1m population increase 2001-11 50%+ of the increase is due to immigration 2.8m people in Britain are Muslim - the biggest religious group after Christians 70-85% of the populations in some wards in Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford are Muslim 511 schools in 43 areas take more than 50% pupils from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds 27% of births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK It said replacing the current "one-size fits all" approach would lead to a "more positive" public debate about immigration. Addressing the "economic and cultural needs" of an area would "have a positive knock-on effect on the public debate on immigration", the report said, adding that this "could instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area, and give incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area". Pointing to a similar model in use in Canada, where provincial governments can set region-specific requirements for immigrants, it said visas could be issued specifically for certain regions or certain sectors. The report also called for a new national strategy to integrate immigrants, including "awareness of the host country's laws, traditions and culture" and access to the labour market, and for councils to set up local integration action plans. Net migration is well above the government's target of below 100,000, and ministers have said they will reduce it after the UK leaves the EU and is no longer subject to freedom of movement rules. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the all-party group, said a "meaningful" integration programme would be needed when the rules are changed after Brexit. He said: "It's clear that immigration has impacted on different communities in different ways and the pace of change has alarmed many. "The government has a duty to address the lack of integration of immigrants if it is to address this. Failing to do so has left a vacuum for extremists and peddlers of hate to exploit." The Home Office said it was not planning to introduce local visa arrangements, but the department said it had made funding available for more English lessons. A government spokesman said: "Our country has long been home to lots of different cultures and communities, but all of us have to be part of one society - British society." He said Â£140m was available through a "controlling migration fund" to help councils manage the impact of immigration. He added: "However, we must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services. "Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need."	A group of MPs and peers says migrants should be expected to learn English before coming to the UK, or attend language classes when they arrive.
Concerns about plagiarism in a 2013 law module should have triggered a formal process, says the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education. Instead academics reduced students' marks for "poor academic performance". The university says this was more appropriate as the problem was poor referencing rather than plagiarism. The QAA review found that academics at the university initially raised concerns about some five essays, or 10% of the number submitted, which had the fault of "quoting directly from a source and failing to insert quotation marks around the quoted passages". The university later referred to these sections as having been "lifted". However, the university's own inquiry found that the students, then at the start of their first year, had not yet been subject to rigorous training on avoiding plagiarism and had not committed any deliberate action to deceive. So instead of moving to its formal plagiarism procedure it "determined upon a mark reduction for over-reliance on 'one or two articles' and a subsequent interview with the students to explain", says the review. The university told the QAA team that having first entertained the possibility that the students in question had plagiarised, it then discounted the possibility. "It did not judge it to be plagiarism as defined in the university's regulations." It was "deemed not sufficiently serious in nature for it to be recorded on the students' records". However, the watchdog concludes that the reference to the students' lack of training and the view that it was not done to deceive appear to be mitigations of plagiarism rather than rejections of the possibility of plagiarised work. "The evidence appears to show that the level of 'suspicion' involved in the work in question met the criteria that should have triggered formal procedure." The review finds that the university had substituted its investigation and imposition of penalties for due process, "and thus was in breach of university regulations on academic misconduct". Any reforms to the university's regulations should avoid allowing course teams to make decisions in isolation which would risk "a less consistent approach to its management of academic misconduct", recommends the review. In a statement, the university said it took the matter of academic misconduct "extremely seriously". "In noting the review team's various recommendations, we welcome the conclusion that our procedures for academic misconduct are fit for purpose and conform to the expectations of the UK Quality Code; and that we are taking positive steps to educate and help our students to avoid plagiarism. "The university has completed a full review of its procedures, and will shortly be submitting an action plan to QAA detailing how we are addressing the recommendations."	The University of Buckingham breached its own regulations in an investigation into possible plagiarism, an independent inquiry has found.
The body of Drew Jordan was found in the quarry he owned in Eskra, near Omagh, on Thursday evening. The death of the father-of three, who was in his 50s, is being investigated by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI). The police have confirmed his death is not being treated as suspicious.  His funeral is to be held on Sunday. The Reverend Noel Regan, a local clergyman who knows the family, told the Ulster Herald: "There is widespread shock and grief at this tragic accident." He said Mr Jordan was very well regarded in the area. A spokesperson for the HSENI said the organisation had been "made aware of a fatality at a quarry in Omagh and is investigating". "Our thoughts are with the family at this most difficult time," they added.	The death of a man at a quarry in County Tyrone has been described as a "tragic accident".
UK government figures showed Scotland generated 4,590 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy in the first three months of 2012. This was an increase of 1,435 GWh on the first quarter of 2011. Scotland is aiming to generate the equivalent of 100% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2020. The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change also issued revised statistics for 2011 which showed that renewable electricity generation in Scotland was 13,735 GWh in 2011, an increase of 44.3% from 2010 and up 97.3% from 2006. The Scottish government said that, assuming gross consumption in 2011 was similar to 2010, about 35% of Scotland's electricity needs came from renewables in 2011, beating its interim target of 31%. Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the figures showed the country was making good progress towards the 2020 target. He added: "The increase of 45.5% in renewable output in quarter one 2012 compared to quarter one 2011 is particularly encouraging when you consider that 2011 saw the highest output from renewable energy to date. "Scotland has astounding renewable energy potential, and the Scottish government is committed to ensuring every community in Scotland benefits from the opportunities of renewable energy. "Scotland is a genuine world leader in green energy and our targets reflect the scale of our natural resources, the strength of our energy capabilities and the value we place on creating new, sustainable industries." Jenny Hogan, director of policy at Scottish Renewables, said the figures demonstrated that renewable energy was becoming an "ever important of our energy mix". She added: "Each time you boil a kettle in your home, more and more of that electricity will have been generated from a renewable source such as a wind farm. "Not only does the renewables industry now employ more than 11,000 people in Scotland, it's helping to reduce our carbon emissions, tackle climate change and insulate us from volatility in the gas market which has been responsible for the major hikes in energy bills over the last few years." WWF Scotland's head of policy Dr Dan Barlow added: "To ensure Scotland remains on track to a fully renewable future we need to see continued and rapid deployment of all forms of renewables alongside investment in energy efficiency. "Such a path will help create jobs, reduce pollution and protect households from volatile fossil fuel prices." Labour Shadow Energy Minister Tom Greatrex said: "Any increase in renewable generation is welcome. The investment needed to make Scotland's renewables potential a reality is supported by consumers across the whole of Britain, not just in Scotland."	Scotland's renewable energy output increased by 45% in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year.
The 26-year-old is expected to play five games for the Sixers before joining up with England's limited-overs squad in India. "To get the opportunity to play at the SCG is obviously a massive ambition of mine," he told the club website. Roy could make his debut in the game against Sydney Thunder on 20 December. He played three Big Bash games for Thunder two seasons ago. "Jason is known as an explosive weapon at the top of the order and we look forward to his contribution, bringing also his English experiences from which we can share," said Sixers head coach Greg Shipperd. England begin the limited-overs section of their tour to India next month. Media playback is not supported on this device	Surrey and England batsman Jason Roy has agreed a short-term deal to play for Sydney Sixers in the forthcoming Big Bash tournament in Australia.
The arrangement will see Glasgow-based Clyde Space build two small satellites called CubeSats to observe the changing biology of the surface ocean. Scientists believe it has implications for the marine food chain, fisheries and climate scientists, among others. Clyde Space said the collaboration could be a "game changer". The project is being led by John M Morrison, Prof of Physics and Physical Oceanography at the University of North Carolina. It also involves scientists from other organisations such as Nasa and the Hawk Institute for Space Sciences. Clyde Space chief executive Craig Clark said: "We're extremely excited to be involved in this mission. "Previous missions have used large satellites which come with a big price attached whereas the CubeSats are flexible, low-cost and economically viable." Clyde Space specialises in producing small satellite, nanosatellite and CubeSat systems. It built the UKube-1 which was launched into space from Kazakhstan in July last year.	The company which designed and built Scotland's first satellite has teamed up with US-based scientists to develop new technology to study ocean biology.
As the 18-day festival of traditional and roots music came to a close in Glasgow, they said 176 out of 222 ticketed events were sold out. More than 110,000 people attended festival events which saw 2,375 musicians from 50 countries perform. Artistic director Donald Shaw said: "The past 18 days have been exhilarating and unforgettable." He said: "From the intimate intensity of Laura Marling accompanied for the first time by a full orchestra, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, to a Ceilidh led by Aidan Moffat. "From the stunning virtuosity of an evening of maestros of stringed instruments from Brazil, India and the US dazzling the audience with their skills, to Tryst which saw 10 specially-commissioned new pieces for pipes. "One of the many true joys of Celtic Connections is that within our tradition of Celtic music and international collaborations, we do not think about creative boundaries. "Instead, we present on our stages some of the most brilliant musicians working today and explore the richness and diversity of the music we are celebrating." He added: "The journey we have been on through Celtic Connections 2017 has shown the power of live music to connect with individual lives and to resonate with the wider world in which we all live, and we are already looking forward to presenting Celtic Connections in 2018, in what is going to be a very special 25th anniversary year."	More than three-quarters of shows at this year's Celtic Connections were sold out, according to organisers.
Mr Gordhan will be replaced by Malusi Gigaba, said a statement issued late on Thursday by the preisdent's office. Earlier this week, President Zuma recalled Mr Gordhan from planned events in the UK and US. Sfiso Buthelezi will become Deputy Finance Minister, replacing Mcebisi Jonas. "I have directed the new ministers and deputy ministers to work tirelessly with their colleagues to bring about radical socioeconomic transformation and to ensure that the promise of a better life for the poor and the working class becomes a reality," President Zuma's statement said. Last October, Mr Gordhan was charged with fraud - but the charges were later dropped. He has described the allegations as politically motivated. Mr Gordhan has been seen as standing up to President Zuma in cabinet and has warned against corruption becoming rampant. The South African Communist Party, an ally of the governing African National Congress, had earlier lodged a formal objection to plans to dismiss Mr Gordhan, who is widely respected internationally. Many senior ANC figures also opposed the finance minister's removal.	South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has dismissed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan after days of speculation that rocked the country's markets,
In the first, a Citation jet with two people on board was involved in an alert at about 13:15. It landed safely. Shortly afterwards at 13:54 police and fire crews were called back to the airport after the pilot of a small plane reported an engine problem. Police said the pilot was able to resolve the problem and had flown to Kinloss or Lossiemouth in Moray. Inverness Airport said the crew of the Citation jet had reported a technical fault as it approached. However, it landed safely and taxied to the stand as normal. "As a precaution, and in line with standard procedures, the airport fire service and other emergency service personnel were called to the scene but were not required," added the airport. The incidents come days after a full emergency was declared at the airport after an aircraft reported a bird strike after taking off. The mail flight from Inverness to Stornoway was forced to turn back after the incident last Friday morning. The Loganair aircraft, with a pilot and co-pilot on board, landed safely a short time later.	A private jet and another small aircraft have sparked two separate full emergencies at Inverness Airport.
Wreaths were also laid above the wreck of HMS Royal Oak to mark the 75th anniversary of its sinking. The warship was torpedoed by a German U-boat while it was at anchor in Scapa Flow in Orkney. Most of the 1,234 crew were asleep below deck, and 834 - including many boy sailors - died. The wreaths formed part of the first significant Royal Oak anniversary not to be attended by any of the remaining survivors. There are believed to be just three men who survived the sinking still alive today. However, families of the the crew, and the community in Orkney, have vowed to carry on the act of remembrance for generations to come. The Royal Oak, which also served in World War One, including the Battle of Jutland, is an official maritime war grave. The memorial service was conducted by the Reverend David Dawson and the Last Post was played by bugler Chris Bray of Her Majesty's Royal Marines Band Scotland. Relatives of the survivors and those who lost their lives were taken to the site of the wreck by HMS Bangor. Rear Admiral John Clink said: "It is entirely my honour to have been able to pay tribute to the 834 men who lost their lives in Scapa Flow 75 years ago. "And we remember, too, those who survived that tragedy, living with difficult memories of their lost friends from that terrible night throughout their lives. "The Royal Navy will never forget." Orkney councillor, Dr Stephen Clackson, whose grandfather Seaman Ronald Clackson lost his life at the age of 20, was at the service, which was attended by a number of Royal Navy dignitaries. "It's important to keep the memory alive," Dr Clackson said. "My son is only three years younger than my grandfather was when he was killed." "Being aboard HMS Bangor was fascinating and it gave us a picture of what it would have been like for my grandfather, seeing how enclosed it was and the thought of being trapped down there when the torpedo hit." The White Ensign was exchanged from the wreck for a new one by the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Group from HM Naval Base Clyde last week. It was later presented to Henry Blythe, whose uncle died on the Royal Oak.	More than 100 people attended a ceremony to remember the crew of a battleship which sank in 1939.
Ivor Miller, 27, who has learning difficulties, was chased by the group after one member called him "a beast". The 27-year-old sought refuge in a derelict flat and jumped out a second floor window suffering severe injury. At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Norman Ritchie QC ordered a 17-year-old man to be detained for six months. The judge told the eight accused: "This whole incident, some of which was captured on CCTV, is extremely disturbing. "The group, like a pack of animals, turned on an entirely innocent young man for no good reason other than he behaved differently because he has learning difficulties." Three of those who pursued Mr Miller were originally charged with attempted murder. Michael Clare, 21, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and two 17-year-old youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had their guilty pleas to charges of assault accepted. All three admitted attacking Mr Miller by chasing him into the common close at 52 Howard Street, Glasgow, on 4 August last year. All three, and another 17-year-old youth, a 16-year-old girl, a 16-year-old youth and 23-year-old David Newlands, from Maryhill, Glasgow, admitted committing a breach of the peace and placing Mr Miller in a state of fear and alarm. Newlands also pleaded guilty to punching Mr Miller on the head in the Hootenanny pub in Howard Street. Jade Park, 19, from Glasgow, who sparked the incident by falsely calling Mr Miller "a beast" admitted punching him in Jamaica Street and in the Crystal Palace pub. Judge Ritchie sentenced a 17-year-old male to six months detention for assault.

Eight people who chased a vulnerable man until he threw himself out of a flat window in Glasgow have been called a "a pack of animals" by a judge.
Tech stocks had fallen on Friday and Monday, with some analysts saying that share prices in the sector had become overblown. But after dropping 2.5% on Monday, shares in tech giant Apple were up 1.2% at the close. Google owner Alphabet was also up 1.1% while shares in social media giant Facebook rose 1.5%. The tech-focused Nasdaq index rose 44.90 points, or 0.7%, to 6,220.37. The Dow Jones climbed 93.28 points to 21,328.95, while wider S&P 500 index added 10.96 points to 2,440.35, with both indexes setting fresh record highs. Traders expect an interest rate increase when the Fed concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday.	Stocks on Wall Street have closed higher, with tech stocks recovering some of the ground lost in recent days.
The resignations of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, newly-appointed Prime Minister Khaled Bahah, and the entire cabinet were quickly followed by reports that the parliament had rejected their requests. Given Yemen's mercurial political playing field, another new configuration could be just around the corner. The tension from four days of fighting and negotiation between the rebels and Yemeni security forces seemed to have reached a resting point, with President Hadi and Houthi leaders reaching an agreement on Wednesday. That agreement essentially saw Mr Hadi capitulate to rebels' demands in exchange for a ceasefire, release of a kidnapped presidential adviser, and the withdrawal of rebel forces from some key positions in Sanaa. Yet a day later, the presidential adviser had not been released and rebels still surrounded the presidential palace and Mr Hadi's private residence. Judging from their mass resignation, Mr Hadi and his government decided that operating under the rebels' thumb was untenable and found little reason to believe the Houthis would ever fulfil their end of the bargain. Either they have given up entirely, or they are now playing their strongest card. The Zaidi Shia movement, whose traditional stronghold is the northern province of Saada, led massive anti-government rallies over the summer and then suddenly infiltrated the capital with its heavily-armed militia and tribal supporters, taking de-facto control Sanaa by mid-September. The government, political parties, and the Houthi movement signed the Peace and National Partnership Agreement (PNPA) on 21 September, but it has largely gone unimplemented. Over the past year, Houthi leaders rightly concluded that they can use military might to change the political map and balance of power in their favour. The true extent of Houthi ambition is unclear; but the fact that they did not kick Mr Hadi out of the presidency or claim the premiership indicates they prefer to control from behind the scenes by placing their members in ministries and high-level government positions. This allows them to consolidate power, but without being saddled with ultimate responsibility. But the resignations of Mr Hadi and Mr Bahah now turn the table on their strategy. Sadly, the rebels' tactics affirm the power of the gun over the power of persuasion, and it marks a massive setback for the democratic transition process that began in 2011 with a youth-led uprising against longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh, a new government, and a successful National Dialogue Conference that produced agreement on the country's most pressing problems. The Houthis were included in the 10-month national dialogue process, and their representatives actually participated quite constructively in the working groups. But they were ultimately unhappy with the agreement of a six-state federal system they perceived would erode their power and autonomy. Since they did not win that fight politically, Houthi fighters set out to change the facts on the ground. They systematically pushed into new territory, aggressively picking fights with tribal militia, government forces, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) militants, and established some degree of control in at least nine of Yemen's 22 provinces. The latest conflagration in Sanaa was prompted by the newly-drafted constitution, written by a 17-member committee including a Houthi representative, which established a framework for the federal system that the Houthis vehemently oppose. In his widely-watched speech on Tuesday, the movement's leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi outlined his demands, including revision of the new constitution and full implementation of September's peace deal, and advised the president to "stop delaying and being stubborn". But it is difficult to take Abdul Malik al-Houthi at face value since the Houthis themselves have not implemented the most critical component - withdrawal of their forces and demilitarisation. Waving the fig leaf is a rhetorical flourish, but his anti-corruption message certainly resonates and may gain supporters among average Yemenis. If the president and his prime minister are convinced to return and survive politically, they will emerge a far weaker and less empowered duo. Mr Hadi's inability to stem the Houthi aggression over the past five months had already eroded his quickly evaporating credibility and public support, but this latest action might just be the end of this charade. When the Houthis forced a change in government and prime minister last year, there was some hope that a competent technocrat like Mr Bahah - a massive improvement over his predecessor - would manage to provide some leadership and momentum for the new government to fulfil its promises. But the internal tribal divisions, meddling by the former president, threats from AQAP, and the Saudi-Iranian proxy war have proved too much for Mr Hadi and Mr Bahah to handle. For the United States and its allies, the recent events and ascendency of the Houthis are deeply troubling. The fact that President Hadi can control or claim loyalty from very little of Yemen's military is indeed worrisome, and AQAP is already capitalizing on the distraction, chaos, and unaddressed grievances in tribal areas to wreak havoc and grow its ranks. Saudi Arabia has halted its financial support, refusing to bank-roll a country dominating by an Iranian-supported, Shia-affiliated group, and this could lead to an absolute economic collapse with salaries unpaid and currency scarce. President Hadi has been a loyal and consistent ally in the US counterterrorism campaign - far better than his predecessor - but he is now fighting for his very survival. If the Houthis are now the real power brokers, the US will have few allies to rely on for security co-operation, fewer intelligence assets, and fierce resistance to US drone strikes on Yemeni soil. At present, the Houthis are sailing high - riding on their alliance with Mr Saleh and his loyalists in the military and their alleged financial and ideological backing from Iran. President Hadi might be able to prompt a public outcry for his return, but that would be a far stretch for someone who lacks broad support. This may not qualify technically as a coup, but the result may be the same, and the Houthis are unlikely to stop until they have full control, at least over the north of the country. And unless external events shift the course, or alliances erode, we should expect to see Houthis calling the shots for some time to come.

Less than 48 hours had passed after the latest agreement between the Houthi rebel movement and the Yemeni government, and the ground had shifted once again.
The 28-mile road - previously predicted to cost £347m - was given the green light by Scottish ministers in 2009, but was delayed by legal action. Protesters lost their appeal to the Supreme Court earlier this month. Transport Minister Keith Brown said the "unwanted delays" had resulted in a "substantial increase" in the overall cost of the project. William Walton from the protest group RoadSense, which spearheaded the legal challenge against the construction of the bypass, told BBC Scotland he believed the total cost could be even higher. It is anticipated that construction will get under way in 2014, with completion by spring 2018. In answer to a parliamentary question lodged by Aberdeen Central SNP MSP Kevin Stewart, Mr Brown said the scheme had been costed at £347m in 2008 - an estimate based on 2003 prices. He said that the figure had now risen to £653m as a result of "scope changes, the inclusion of standard risk costs and rebasing to 2012 prices". Mr Brown said inflation had been responsible for a £230m increase in the cost. A scheme to make the A90 a dual carriageway between Balmedie and Tipperty in Aberdeenshire is also expected to cost £92m, giving a total of £745m for the combined project. Mr Stewart criticised the added costs caused by the legal challenges. He said: "Not only has an essential piece of infrastructure been delayed unnecessarily, but inflation has driven up costs. "Now that the legal challenges have been exhausted, we can now move towards construction as quickly as possible." Aberdeen City Council leader Barney Crockett said: "We realised that the cost of the AWPR (Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route) would be roughly what it now is and we have made adequate provision for that. "The economic performance of the area will be underpinned by the AWPR." Tom Smith, chairman of Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Future (Acsef) business development agency, said: "The delays caused by the legal challenges were always going to impact on the costs outlined in 2003. "However, the economic and other benefits of the road are so significant that the cost will still represent a major return on investment for the public purse and people of the north east. "The final mechanics of how they will be paid are still being worked out and there will be delicate negotiations between the Scottish government and our local authorities. "But with the Scottish government paying 80% of the route and the total cost of the fast-link, the north east is getting a great deal in terms of investment in our woefully under-invested roads infrastructure."	The cost of the Aberdeen bypass has risen to an estimated £653m, it has been revealed.
Russell, 28, was part of the side that won April's World Twenty20 and will be available for four matches in June. Tahir, 37, will then link up for the final seven games and is set to play in six County Championship fixtures. "Andre is one of the leading T20 players in the world right now," said director of cricket Mick Newell. Russell has taken 180 wickets in T20 cricket at an average of 26.13, and has 12 half-centuries with the bat with a strike rate of more than 165 runs per 100 balls. Newell added: "Looking at our line-up, there was certainly scope to add a hitter into the middle order, as we did in 2015 with Darren Sammy. "In Andre's case it's an added bonus that he's a very effective fast bowler as well." Tahir played three matches for Notts towards the end of last season. He has taken 150 wickets in international and domestic T20 cricket at 20.82, with an economy rate below seven. "We've seen many times how valuable a world-class leg-spinner can be, in all formats of the game," said Newell. "Imran enjoyed his time here last year, he wanted to come back, and we're only too happy for him to do so. "Having him available will also allow us to make the most of some of the drier pitches in four-day cricket at the back end of the summer."	Nottinghamshire have signed West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell and South Africa leg-spinner Imran Tahir for their T20 Blast campaign.
Hart, 62, became Leeds academy director last September, but left the Elland Road club earlier this month. "He's someone I would love to bring to the club for lots of reasons," Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio. "I've always gone to him for advice and I always wanted to work with him again. He's someone I respect highly." Hart previously worked with Jones at Charlton Athletic. "Probably one of my best years in football was with him at Charlton," Jones continued. "He's been a bit of a mentor for me. If there's a possibility that we can do something then that would be a really good addition to our team."	Luton Town manager Nathan Jones hopes to recruit former Nottingham Forest boss Paul Hart to work alongside him at Kenilworth Road.
Former Juventus playmaker Pirlo's £5.17m annual salary makes him Major League Soccer's highest earner, while ex-Chelsea and Manchester City midfielder Lampard, 37, is on £3.8m. "I asked them the question, why come to MLS now?" said Reyna. "They looked me in the eye and said they wanted to compete." Lampard missed a planned debut in Sunday's 4-4 draw against Toronto FC with a calf injury. Media playback is not supported on this device Thirty-six-year-old Pirlo, who still wants to be a part of Italy's Euro 2016 squad, is likely to play for the first time when NYC FC entertain Orlando at Yankee Stadium on 26 July. "We are starting a club from scratch," said Reyna. "It is not just about bringing great players in. We are trying to establish a culture and a foundation for the way we want to train and act around the changing room. "At this stage, that is as important as the result we get on a weekend. "These guys are experienced. They are mentally very strong. That is why they have been as good as they are for so long. "That will supersede their age." Chosen as an expansion club in May 2013, NYC FC became MLS' 20th franchise and launched at the start of the 2015 season. They are part of the City Football Group founded by Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour, and have sister clubs in Melbourne and Yokohama. They have the same sponsor - Etihad Airlines - and also wear sky blue shirts. On 6 July, the club announced Pirlo had joined them from Juventus, becoming their third 'Designated Player' - each club can sign up to three players whose wages exceed the salary cap - alongside Lampard and Spain World Cup winner David Villa. NYC FC began their debut campaign with a 1-1 draw at Orlando on 8 March and beat New England Revolution in front of 43,507 in their first home game at Yankee Stadium the following week. Results since then have been patchy and the 4-4 draw with Toronto left them second bottom of the Eastern Conference, three points off a play-off place. Crowds remain good - they attracted their highest attendance, 48,047, to the 'derby' with New York Red Bulls on 28 June and their average gate of 28,785 is only beaten by Seattle Sounders (40,236) and Orlando (34,005) in MLS. "There is a long way to go but New York is the most diverse city in America," said first-time fan, Scott Carey, 23. "That will jump start it." Opinion is split. Local shopkeeper Saeed Abbad is impressed. "When they get big crowds - like the Red Bulls game - the atmosphere is exactly the same as when the Yankees are playing," he said. "Remember, the Yankees have been going for 114 years. The soccer team has hardly been here for that many days." Others are not so sure. "New York City won't do anything for football in this country," said Cody Kaczetow, 23, another first-timer. "It is not going anywhere in terms of how people respect it. It will probably still be the same when I am 80. "Kids who play soccer will still get called 'foot fairies' at school and baseball will remain 'America's pastime'. I think as a nation, we are too stubborn to change that." Reyna is undeterred. "We have had some challenges and some difficult patches, which were to be expected from a new franchise," he said. "But if you take a step back, in a little over two years we have created a new club to compete in a very difficult league. "We recognise a need to improve. But, to capture an audience, create an excitement and get people behind the team the way we have done in such a difficult market, has been remarkable. "It proves there is an appetite for football in New York City." NYC FC are committed to using Yankee Stadium for three seasons. The location is not without its issues. Whilst fans are reasonably close to the action on three sides of the famous stadium, they are a long way from the pitch on the dressing room side, where the pitcher's mound, batters' boxes and coaches' boxes are located. And the restrictions mean that, at 70 yards, the pitch's width only just meets Fifa's international regulations. But they will stay there until a new home is found - a new home that, unlike that of the Red Bulls, is in one of New York's five boroughs; Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island. "Red Bulls are New Jersey. I grew up in New Jersey. Anyone who comes from there knows it is not New York. They are proud residents of a different state," said Reyna. "We want to be in one of the boroughs. In a short time we will have some updates to share but at the moment we are focused on playing here. "We are happy here. It feels like home. We have got used to the surface. We have got used to the dimensions. There are no excuses."	Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo have not joined New York City FC just for the money, according to the club's sporting director Claudio Reyna.
In 2014/15 just over 48% of babies were being breastfed at the time of the first child health review visit at about 10 days old. The figures have been published by ISD Scotland. They showed a rise in the number of babies fed a mix of both breast and formula milk since 2005/06. Earlier this year the Scottish government hosted a summit aimed at encouraging more mothers to breastfeed their babies. The report from ISD Scotland, which compiles health statistics for the government, looked at rates for babies born in the last financial year. It said there is good evidence that breastfeeding in infancy has a protective effect against many childhood illnesses. It said breastfed infants were also likely to have a reduced risk of infection while other probable benefits included improved cognitive and psychological development, and a reduced risk of childhood obesity. Reporting its key findings, the publication concluded: "Across Scotland, the overall breastfeeding rate has remained at a broadly similar level over the last decade." In 2014/15, 48.3% of babies were breastfed at the first visit review. This rate included 35.2% of babies who were exclusively breastfed and 13.1% who were fed both breast and formula milk. This compares with the figures for a decade ago when 38.3% were exclusively breastfed and 6.4% were mixed fed. The statistics for last year also showed that by the time of the six to eight week health review the breasting rate had fallen to 38%. The World Health Organization recommends all children are exclusively breastfed up to six months, and breastfeeding alongside other appropriate foods continues up to and beyond two years. In other findings, the report highlighted a "clear association" between low levels of breastfeeding and deprivation. Mothers in the least deprived areas were nearly three times as likely to breastfeed exclusively at six to eight weeks compared with mothers in the most deprived areas. But there has been an increase over the last decade in overall breastfeeding rates in the most deprived areas at the first visit from 26% to nearly 33%, the statistics showed. Researchers also found that mothers who did not smoke were about three times more likely to breastfeed than smokers. Breastfeeding rates were also found to vary by geographical area in 2014/15. Exclusive breastfeeding rates ranged from 24.3% in NHS Lanarkshire to 59.4% in NHS Shetland, for example.	The overall breastfeeding rate in Scotland has stayed relatively static over the last 10 years, despite efforts to highlight the benefits.
The Rt Rev James Jones, who chaired the Hillsborough Independent Panel, said he felt "great pride" in being recognised in the Queen's New Year Honours list. Author Phil Scraton, who led the panel's research team, turned down an OBE in protest at those he said had not helped the 1989 disaster's survivors. Meanwhile, Merseyside Police's only Sikh officer has been appointed MBE. And Liverpool comedy legend Ken Dodd, 89, has been awarded a knighthood for services to entertainment and charity. Bishop Jones, now assistant bishop in the Diocese of York, said his pride was "mixed with sadness" because of "that enduring sadness of the families who have continued to feel the loss of their loved ones at Hillsborough". He continued: "I got to know the families very well during the Hillsborough Independent Panel process. And over the years I've come to understand something of their pain. "I think the families have shown extraordinary forbearance over the years as they have struggled to get people just to listen to them. "So, in receiving this honour, I also salute their forbearance." He said the panel's work was the "climax of my ministry as the Bishop of Liverpool". It was the panel's report that led to the quashing of the original inquests and the setting up of new inquests which ultimately led to the unlawful killing verdict for 96 football fans who perished in the tragedy. Merseyside Police's Det Insp Sarbjit Kaur was awarded her honour for work in exposing honour-based violence and forced marriages. The 43-year-old said she was "extremely humbled". "I believe everyone has the right to live their life free from abuse and have the freedom to choose whomever they want to marry," she said. The force's Chief Constable Andy Cooke praised Det Insp Kaur's work and said she was "an amazing role model". He added he hoped she would "encourage women from a similar background to join the police service and protect those most vulnerable in our communities".	The former Bishop of Liverpool has been made a Knight Commander for his services to the Hillsborough Inquiry.
Bono, who worked with the MP on the Make Poverty History campaign, dedicated Ultraviolet (Light My Way) to her memory. "She lived her life championing the lives of others," he told the audience at London's Twickenham Stadium. Mrs Cox, 41, was shot and stabbed in June last year during the EU referendum campaign. The tribute was one of several moments when U2 paused to acknowledge global events, including the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London. For their encore, the band asked Noel Gallagher on stage to sing Don't Look Back In Anger, which became an unofficial anthem of resilience in Manchester after a suicide bomber killed 22 fans outside an Ariana Grande concert in May. Gallagher also dedicated the song to the victims of the Grenfell Tower disaster. A day earlier, U2 had invited 50 of the firefighters who tackled the blaze to watch their rehearsals and soundcheck. And Bono echoed Jo Cox's maiden speech to Parliament - "we have more in common than that which divides us" - as he made a plea for tolerance towards immigrants. "Us Irish are immigrant people," he said, "and of course we came here into this great, Great Britain and we thank you for giving us safety and sanctuary for all these years. "We hope it won't stop." It was a testament to U2's experience and sincerity that these moments did not overshadow or unbalance the evening; which was, at heart, a celebration of their career-defining album The Joshua Tree. Written against the backdrop of the Cold War, The Joshua Tree reflected the two sides of the American dream, with the Irish band seduced by its glamour but repelled by what bassist Adam Clayton called "the bleakness and greed" of the Reagan era. Thirty years later, it remains an eerily relevant ode to a divided America. "It seems like we have come full circle from when The Joshua Tree songs were originally written, with global upheaval, extreme right wing politics and some fundamental human rights at risk," said guitarist The Edge earlier this year. So while most bands revisit classic albums as an exercise in nostalgia (or luring back lost fans), U2 seemed energised, even hungry on this anniversary jaunt. The tour itself boasts technology that would have been unthinkable in 1987 - from the sampled instruments that bolstered their sound; to the 200-foot, 8K LED video wall that formed a backdrop to the set. At the start of the show, however, U2 spurned both those luxuries. The video screens were set to standby as Larry Mullen, Jr strode onto a small, tree-shaped satellite stage and launched into Sunday Bloody Sunday's instantly-recognisable drum riff. He was soon joined by his bandmates, who played a four song pre-history of The Joshua Tree, facing each other in a circle, like the Dubliners who put on their first London shows 38 years ago, using Â£3,000 they'd borrowed from their families. Performing without spotlights or video screens in the broad daylight was a brave move in front of 80,000 fans - but it brought the best out of both sides. The audience were forced to focus on U2, and U2 were forced to play their hardest, as Sunday Bloody Sunday led into New Year's Day, followed by Bad and their breakthrough single Pride (In The Name Of Love). The raw power of those songs - more often reserved for encores - set the stadium on fire. Grown men played air guitar and bellowed the choruses, clasping each other around the shoulders when they weren't punching the air. For once, Bono was humbled, saying: "Thank you for letting us back into your lives." With the crowd still singing the chorus to Pride, the band moved to the main stage, and played Where The Streets Have No Name silhouetted against the burnt  orange colour of a sunset. This was exactly how the original Joshua Tree tour began in 1987 and it proved similarly effective 30 years later. Indeed, the screens were consistently used to great effect. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For was set against a slow-moving shot of a desert highway; while With Or Without You saw the band play against dramatic time-lapse footage of Death Valley. Later, before Exit, they showed a clip from the 1950s TV Western Trackdown, in which a shady con-man named Trump tries to frighten the residents of a small town into building a protective wall. Rather than preach to the audience, as he has in the past, Bono simply let these clips - and the music - do the talking. The star, who recently turned 57, was in better voice than on previous tours. What he has lost in range, he has gained in depth and gravitas. When he sang Mothers Of The Disappeared, accompanied by a video of women holding candles in honour of the young Chilean men murdered by Augusto Pinochet, the purity of his emotion echoed around the stands. That song concluded the Joshua Tree section of the show; freeing the band up to play some crowd-pleasers for the encore. They raced through Beautiful Day, Elevation and Vertigo - three songs that exposed how U2 stopped soul-searching in favour of stadium-filling in the 21st Century. In the mosh pit, they were a highlight, but elsewhere they felt like the musical equivalent of a Happy Meal. Achtung Baby's Ultraviolet and One felt more nourishing - raising hopes that U2 will tour that album when it reaches its own 30th anniversary in 2021.

Swansea Community Farm in Fforestfach offers free access to a variety of rare breeds including sheep and bees, a healthy eating kitchen and café, and sustainable orchards. Organisers say their core Volunteer and Child and Youth programmes have some funding from external sources beyond March 2017. But day-to-day running costs do not. Founded in 1998, the farm has been an accredited Agored Cymru training centre since 2012. It has also delivered a range of courses in cooking skills and healthy eating, food growing, nature conservation skills and animal care. Phil Budd of Swansea Community Farm said the farm had fallen foul of austerity. "Everyone we speak to agrees that the farm is doing vital work in reconnecting under-privileged urban youngsters with where their food comes from, but when local authorities and the Welsh Government have to choose between us and, say a hospital, it's hardly surprising we are where we are now," he said. "All the available grants are for specific projects, but it's extremely difficult to get funding for the day-to-day nitty-gritty." It is hoped £25,000 can be secured from a crowd-funding campaign, and the same amount via grants, government and business. Organisers say that would secure its future for six months, while they look for a longer-term partnership. "It's terribly sad, at what should be our busiest time of the year, we're already having to keep one eye on the prospect that we won't be here this time next month," Mr Buss said. "Many of our sheep should be going into lambing shortly, so we've already had to start re-homing them, as we don't want to have to move them while they are delivering and suckling. "Hopefully we can welcome them back in the summer, but we all need to pull together and find new ways of working."	Swansea's only community city farm is facing closure at the end of the month, unless it can raise £50,000.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 3-1 win at Solitude means David Healy's Blues finish the campaign two points ahead of Crusaders who had held the title for the last two years. Crusaders ended their title challenge with a 6-1 win over Glenavon at Seaview but in the end it was not enough. It is Linfield's first title triumph since they did the double in 2012. They are one match away from another double as they face Coleraine in the Irish Cup final on 6 May. Linfield may have lifted the County Antrim Shield in February, but this will go down as a first major managerial success for Northern Ireland record scorer David Healy. He took over as Linfield manager in October 2015 and saw his team end the season runners-up in the league and beaten by Glenavon in the cup final. Clinching the title in his first full season seemed unlikely in mid-February when Crusaders were nine points ahead. But Linfield went on an amazing run picking up 43 points from a possible 45, to take advantage of Crusaders' slip-ups. Linfield were trailing at half-time after Daniel Hughes headed Cliftonville into a 13th-minute lead but Linfield bounced back in style after the break. Waterworth pounced for a close-range equaliser and followed that with a brilliant individual strike which turned out to be the title clincher. The former Glentoran striker made it 3-1 on the hour with a penalty after he was fouled by Chris Ramsey who was sent-off. With Cliftonville losing, Ballymena's draw against Coleraine lifted them into fourth place, meaning they will have home advantage against Dungannon in the semi-finals of the Europa League play-offs. Cliftonville will host Glenavon in the other semi-final, with the matches being played on Monday, 8 May. Carrick are seeking a new manager as they prepare for the promotion/relegation play-off games after Aaron Callaghan quit minutes after their 4-1 defeat away to Ballinamallard United.	Andrew Waterworth scored a second-half hat-trick as Linfield beat Cliftonville to clinch the title on a dramatic final day of the Irish Premiership season.
Jose Cuervo has taken control of the brand as part of a deal with Diageo. Diageo's Colin O'Brien said while the sale represented a "change", they were "confident" that Jose Cuervo would "nurture" Bushmills in the future. Jose Cuervo is owned by the Mexico-based Beckmann family. Their distribution firm, Proximo, controls a number of premium whiskey and rum brands. The chief executive of Jose Cuervo, Juan Domingo Beckmann, described the acquisition as the "most important purchase made by Cuervo in its entire history". "Like Bushmills Irish Whiskey, Jose Cuervo is built on a very strong tradition of quality and craftsmanship that dates back over 250 years, so we understand the importance of nurturing and protecting the heritage and quality of a brand and are strongly committed to doing exactly that with Bushmills," he said. "Bushmills Irish Whiskey will be in very safe hands." Mr Beckmann added that no jobs would be lost at Bushmills as a result of the acquisition. Mr O'Brien said Bushmills Irish Whiskey was a brand built on "great history, heritage and passionate people" and had been a "cherished part of the Diageo family" for more than nine years. "During this time we have invested over Â£80m to build capacity, infrastructure and maturing inventory at the distillery, which has supported the continued growth of the brand," he said. Irish whiskey has been a growth category in the United States in recent years. Growth was initially sparked by a big investment made by Pernod Ricard in the marketing of its Jameson brand. In 2011, the US-based maker of Jim Beam whiskey bought the Cooley distillery in County Louth for $95m (Â£59.45m). Bushmills Distillery claims to be the oldest licensed distillery in the world. Distillation has taken place there since at least the 17th century. It has not been locally-owned for many years. Prior to being bought by Diageo in 2005 it was owned by Pernod Ricard.	Bushmills whiskey has been acquired by the world's biggest tequila producer.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) used a confiscation order to seize John Dawes' assets after he was convicted of drug dealing and money laundering. Helen Dawes maintained she was innocent of any wrong-doing and that her role was simply to run the household. But the judge disagreed and said she was "shutting her eyes" to the obvious. The CPS launched the High Court action to seize Dawes' assets after he was jailed in 2005 for 24 years. But his wife fought the confiscation order claiming she was not party to her husband's activities and that she had a 50% stake in the home, valued at £177,486. She claimed her role was simply to look after the house, their son and do the cooking while Dawes ran the finances. But on Tuesday, Mr Justice Collins said: "Mrs Dawes turned a blind eye to what was going on, not because she necessarily did not want to know, but because she took the view that her part was merely to run the home, look after her child and provide for her husband." He added: "It seems to me she has been shutting her eyes to what should have been obvious." Dawes was estimated to have earned £8,283,161 between 1997 and 2003 from drug crime and he was ordered in September 2008 to pay back £355,000. The court heard Mrs Dawes and her husband had several bank accounts with significant sums of cash passing through. The amount of money involved was far in excess of what the couple legitimately earned. Mrs Dawes has since moved in with her elderly father. Mr Justice Collins said there was no reason why their son, who is in full time education, could not find somewhere else to live now he is over 18. Dawes lost an appeal against his conviction in 2007 but maintains his innocence.	The wife of a jailed Nottinghamshire drugs baron will lose the family home after a High Court judge ruled she turned a blind eye to his activities.

Science and research should be a priority in the talks between the UK and the EU, says the Russell Group of research intensive universities. Any barriers "would be bad for the UK and bad for Europe", said the group's acting director, Tim Bradshaw. His comments come as the EU prepares to authorise the start of the talks. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due later on Monday to seek a formal mandate from the European Council in Brussels to begin negotiations. Mr Barnier expects the talks to begin immediately after June's general election. The Russell Group says there will be "no winners" if Brexit results in barriers between researchers and has pledged to work with "all sides to secure a positive outcome". Dr Bradshaw said there had been "huge breakthroughs in medicine, engineering, and any number of fields" as a result of joint working, which he promised would continue after Brexit. "We want to maintain the closest possible relationships with colleagues across the EU, and research must be a priority during talks," he added. He called for the rights of EU students and staff at UK universities to be guaranteed after Brexit. "We value our EU colleagues very highly and need urgent assurances, that after Brexit, they will retain the same rights to stay and work in the UK that they have now. "Nearly half of all UK academic articles result from international collaboration and EU member states are some of our biggest partners. "These relationships improve the quality of UK research and underpin the strength of our science base." UK universities are among the biggest beneficiaries of the EU's huge Horizon 2020 research fund. Non-EU countries can also draw on the fund if they contribute to it - but a major condition of countries being able to participate is allowing freedom of movement for researchers, a potential stumbling block in the talks. The Conservative party manifesto, promises to "collaborate in science and innovation" with EU member states. The manifesto also pledges to secure the entitlements of EU nationals in Britain and British nationals in the EU. "There may be specific European programmes in which we might want to participate and if so, it will be reasonable that we make a contribution," the document adds. Labour's manifesto promises that the party in government would "ensure that the UK maintains our leading research role by seeking to stay part of Horizon 2020 and its successor programmes and by welcoming research staff to the UK". The party also says it will seek to maintain membership, or equivalent, with European organisations that offer benefits to the UK such as Euratom and the European Medicines Agency. The Liberal Democrat manifesto warns that "the Leave vote has already started to affect existing and proposed research programmes". "We will campaign against any reduction in investment in UK universities and for their right to apply for EU funds on equal terms." Manifestos have not yet been published for the SNP, UKIP or the Green Party.	Barriers to research collaboration in Europe as a result of Brexit would harm scientific progress, says a group of leading UK universities.
One Good Samaritan gifted £600 and another gave Sue Percival £180 following the burglary at her home at Tonypandy in Rhondda Cynon Taff. Her British Gas colleagues also raised £150 so she and her daughter were able to replace stolen goods like a laptop and three Android tablets. "Thanks to everyone. We have replaced everything " she said. "They have been so kind." The man who donated £600 wishes to remain anonymous and another set up a fundraising page after South Wales Police put out a plea for information following the burglary on Wednesday between 07:30 and 11:30 GMT. Ms Percival's grandchildren and daughter, Steph Summers, discovered the theft. Four-year-old Tristan, the first in the house, told her: "Mum, Santa's been. All the presents are open." Ms Percival said being a victim of burglary had been "devastating" as she felt it was an "invasion of privacy". She said she had not wanted to leave her home since the incident. She said neighbours had been supportive, giving her the confidence to go shopping to replace the stolen presents.	A grandmother has thanked well wishers who have saved her family's Christmas after a burglar stole £900 in presents.
The FBI said on Monday that it might have found a way to deal with the password lock set by killer Syed Rizwan Farook, who was behind an attack in San Bernardino, California, in December. An Israeli newspaper has since reported that data forensics experts at Cellebrite are involved in the case. Cellebrite told the BBC that it works with the FBI but would not say more. Its website, however, states that one of its tools can extract and decode data from the iPhone 5C - the model in question - among other locked handsets. Apple has refused to help the FBI do this. "File system extractions, decoding and analysis can be performed on locked iOS devices with a simple or complex passcode," Cellebrite's site states. "Simple passcodes will be recovered during the physical extraction process and enable access to emails and keychain passwords. "If a complex password is set on the device, physical extraction can be performed without access to emails and keychain." The keychain reference relates to a tool on Apple devices that allows all of an owner's log-ins to be revealed if a master password is known. The website does not make clear if the process would work with iPhone 5Cs, whose operating system has been upgraded to iOS9, which Farook's device is thought to be running. Cellebrite, a subsidiary of Japan's Sun Corp, signed a data forensics contract with the FBI in 2013, according to the report in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. Apple has refused to create a special version of iOS that would prevent the contents of a device being wiped if someone made too many incorrect guesses at its passcode. It is not known whether Farook enabled the security setting, but the FBI says it does not want to risk losing "evidence related to the terrorist mass murder of 14 Americans". A federal court had been due to rule on Tuesday whether the FBI could compel Apple to help it. But the hearing was postponed when the Department of Justice announced that it might not need the tech firm's assistance because a third-party had demonstrated a possible extraction method to FBI agents. "I am not able to comment on the identity of the outside party," bureau spokesman Christopher Allen told the BBC. "I would simply refer to the court filing from Monday that says the outside party demonstrated the method on Sunday, March 20." Cellebrite has taken numerous calls from the media asking if it is indeed the unidentified helper. A Twitter user noted the firm signed a fresh $15,000 (£10,600) contract with the FBI two days ago - albeit in Chicago rather than California. A spokesman for Cellebrite said it might have more to say at a later point. The firm recently suggested that it has more than 50% of the North American market in law enforcement digital forensics tools. "When we get devices, we do work on different levels of accessing the data," Ronen Engler, Cellebrite's senior manager of technology and innovation, told the Homeland Security Today website earlier this month. "The logical [data] is the somewhat easy part. However, in order to access the logical data the phone needs to be unlocked. "We provide other mechanisms in order to bypass the lock and get the data out." The firm has also provided its services to the UK authorities, and in 2012 helped North Wales Police extract deleted text messages from an iPhone 3GS that helped lead to the arrest of a paedophile. Its website says it intends to show off its latest solutions at the Forensics Europe Expo in London next month.	An Israeli cybersecurity firm is under pressure to reveal its involvement in efforts to extract data from an iPhone.
Goodes, an Indigenous Australian, is regularly jeered and racially abused by spectators. The #IstandwithAdam campaign was trending on Saturday, with actors like Cate Blanchett offering their support. Some fans have defended the booing, claiming it is not racist, but simply a response to Goodes' performance. Ms Blanchett and other high-profile figures, like actor Hugo Weaving and opposition leader Bill Shorten, have spoken out in support of the 35-year-old footballer. They sent videos to Fairfax Media backing the #IstandwithAdam campaign. During games Goodes has faced derogatory slurs and even been told to "get back to the zoo". Other Twitter users said the success of a native Australian should be celebrated rather than derided. The Sydney Swans star has described the abuse as "shattering" and is taking time off from the sport. Australian Rules football, or Aussie Rules, is played on an oval pitch, between two teams of 18 players. The Australian Football League (AFL) Players' Association and team skippers released a statement on Friday expressing their distaste for the constant booing, especially during last Sunday's clash at Perth's Subiaco Oval. "Enjoy the game, celebrate the success but don't boo, jeer or taunt players because of who they are or what they stand for," it said. Goodes is a vocal advocate for indigenous issues and wants to see Aboriginal people recognised by the Australian constitution. Others, including cricketing legend Shane Warne, have defended fans' right to boo athletes. "For me, I don't think that the stuff that they're doing to Adam Goodes is racist," he told Triple M radio station. "It's their prerogative. Australia can have an opinion." Separately, one of Australia's wealthiest and most influential businessmen, Crown chairman James Packer, said on Friday he was "ashamed" of the whole affair. "He's a great Australian. He won Australian of the Year, I think he's an amazing role model," local media quoted Mr Packer as saying.	Social media users have been rallying around Aussie Rules footballer Adam Goodes, after he became embroiled in a racism row with fans.
Britain's  and  champion teams up with Heather Stanning as she aims to repeat her success in Chengdu in 2013. "It's the first big title I've had to defend," Glover said. "There's a little bit of pressure, but it I think it's important to feel the pressure," she told BBC Radio Cornwall. "If you're going to define the season for us, when we look back at the 2014 season, it'll be 'we did this at the World Championships'," she added. "In non-Olympic years it's the biggest event by far, it's a really big deal to have that to your name." Glover and Stanning have resurrected their partnership from London 2012 after Stanning took a year off in 2013 to concentrate on her military career. Glover and Polly Swann won the world title last year in Stanning's absence and the both women have rowed with Glover this season before Stanning managed to secure the spot alongside the Cornwall rower for the Worlds. "It's going to be Heather's first chance since the Olympics [to win a world title] and I'd love the opportunity to keep my title so it's important and special to both of us. "When we first came back together we realised it had been a long time since the Olympics. We needed to find our feet again and found that actually everything was really natural. "That gave us the confidence over the last month or so away on training camp to not just let it be the same as it was - we've really worked on pushing it on. "I feel we've moved on and made changes, looking to be a better crew than we were in 2012,"  Glover added.	Helen Glover says she is feeling the pressure of defending a major title for the first time at next week's World Championships in Amsterdam.
The promotion of Trollope, 43, was confirmed on Wednesday with Dalman promising him full control of the first team and funds to bolster his squad. Trollope worked as Slade's assistant from February 2015 and has been told the Bluebirds hierarchy expect a top six finish. "It is not us taking the cheap option," Dalman told BBC Radio Wales Sport. "It could turn out to be a very expensive option." Slade has taken up a new role as head of football, in which he will oversee scouting, among other duties. Trollope will not report to Slade, and has already started to change his backroom staff with coach Scott Young being moved from first team duties. Dalman believes Trollope's appointment underlines Cardiff's commitment to stability and has explained the club will allow the former Bristol Rovers manager to be his own man. "We have [had] stability over the last 18 months. The team is not far off, let's be honest about that," he said. "Paul is absolutely able to bring in his own coaching team, it is entirely up to him how he builds that and I will support him with club resources." Dalman entirely dismissed the notion the club missed a trick by appointing from within. "First of all, we interviewed candidates from outside of the club as well, and some very, very good candidates actually. I was genuinely very surprised and impressed by the number of people who have shown interest," he said. "We felt that when you look at the history of the club and the disruptions and difficulties that we have had, we felt continuity was important. "And the resources we are about to have we want to put into the squad, rather than anywhere else. There will be money available for Paul, absolutely." Trollope has been told clearly he is expected to finish in the top six next season after the Bluebirds finished this campaign eighth in the Championship. "We need to get promoted and we will do the best that we can," Dalman said. "It is challenging, especially with the teams coming down - Aston Villa, Norwich City and Newcastle United, these are not the sort of teams you take lightly. "I think Paul has a real task ahead of him, but you've got to expect us to be at least in the top six, if not in the top four, if we make the investments we are planning to make." Trollope will not be reporting to Slade as he takes control of all aspects of the first team at Cardiff City Stadium. "Russell has now gone to head our football side; he will be helping us with all football matters, apart from the first team," said Dalman. "Paul Trollope will report directly to our CEO Ken Choo and very much has a free hand. "And that is the big significant change, that we are allowing Paul to express himself on the pitch. I think he will do a good job for us."	Chairman Mehmet Dalman says Paul Trollope is not a "cheap option" to succeed Russell Slade as Cardiff boss.
The two suicide attacks took place at about midday local time (07:30 GMT) on Wednesday, targeting a police station and intelligence agency offices. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attacks. It is the latest in a string of attacks to challenge the Afghan authorities after the resurgent militant group started its spring offensive early. Condemning the bombings, President Ashraf Ghani said: "After the killing of [prominent commander] Mullah Salam and the Taliban's defeat on many other fronts, the terrorists are launching such attacks to raise the moral of their fighters." Salam was killed in a US air strike on Sunday. The first of Wednesday's attacks began when a suicide car bomber detonated his explosives outside a police station - which is next door to a military training facility - in the west of the city. This was followed by a five-hour gun battle between officers and another attacker. Most of the fatalities reportedly occurred in this attack. Soon afterwards a suicide bomber blew himself up outside Afghanistan's intelligence agency, in eastern Kabul. Officials originally said just three people had died in the attack, but revised the number up later in the day. The attacks came a day after the Taliban killed 12 policemen in an "insider attack" in the southern Afghan province of Helmand.	Almost simultaneous attacks in Kabul have left at least 16 people dead and 44 injured, the health ministry says.
But in recent years it, like many other seaside towns, has struggled. The advent of cheap flights abroad and a recession meant the County Antrim town was forced to reinvent itself from its 1950s heyday. And while the weather this year has been as unstable as the political landscape, neither seem to be putting tourists off spending money, with more visitors from the Republic of Ireland providing a welcome revenue stream. Visitors to the north coast traditionally come from other parts of Northern Ireland, said Naldo Morelli, managing director of Morelli's Ice Cream. "But this year, I suppose with Brexit and the pound weakening a little bit we've noticed more customers from the Republic of Ireland, so that helps too," he said. "The Northern Ireland public are very used to having four seasons in one day, so thankfully for us they eat ice cream no matter the weather." Portrush's reinvention seems to be doing the trick for traders. "Business is up 5% to 10% across the board, certainly the restaurants have been busy," said Ian Donaghey, the president of the Causeway Chamber of Commerce. While the weather is not always kind, this is sometimes actually good for local businesses, added Mr Donaghey. "If the weather is too good it keeps people on the beaches and they don't spend money in the town," he said. "What some of the traders would tell you is that they like a sunny morning and a drizzly afternoon because it drives them into Barry's [amusement arcade] and the restaurants and bars." Portrush's much loved amusements and bucket-and-spade shops are still there, but now their neighbours are trendy coffee shops, restaurants and bars. The town may not have completely shaken off its traditional image, but those who visit do not seem to mind. Business owners hope a mixture of nostalgia and new attractions will keep people visiting the north coast for the rest of this summer season, and for many years to come. It seems that come rain or shine, holidaymakers will always have a soft spot for Portrush.	The beauty of Northern Ireland's north coast made Portrush the go-to choice for family holidays for decades.
Tata Steel closed its Dalzell mill in Motherwell and the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang with the loss of 270 jobs. Both were later bought by international metals firm Liberty House which intends to restart production at the Motherwell site in September. About 60 staff are currently working there, with 40 more recruits expected - many of them former Tata Steel staff. Liberty Steel said that the Dalzell plate-rolling mill had taken delivery of about 1,500 tonnes of slab steel rom the British Steel plant at Scunthorpe. This is in preparation for the restart of steel plate production next month. Jon Bolton, chief executive of Liberty Steel UK plate division, said: "This is a significant milestone for the plates business in Scotland, but also positive news for the UK steel sector as steel once again is manufactured in British Steel's Scunthorpe site to be rolled in Scotland. "It is pleasing to watch the plant gradually coming back to life as more people arrive on site and particularly pleasing to welcome young apprentices to the team." Liberty said that about 60 staff were involved in the preparations to reopen Dalzell, with a further 40 expected to join the workforce before production starts. The firm said that about 70% of the initial wave of recruits were former employees returning to their old jobs. It has also awarded about 20 new supply contracts, for business and engineering services, to firms in the Motherwell area. Liberty House Group executive chairman, Sanjeev Gupta, said this was the beginning of the fulfilment of a promise to the local community. "We said we would revive this historic steelworks and that is exactly what we are doing," he said.	Steel production is set to resume next month at one of two Lanarkshire plants that were mothballed last year.
Operations are due to resume early next week after a meeting between NHS bosses and other partners on Thursday night. Data suggested death rates there were double that of other centres, but experts have questioned their accuracy. However, the Department of Health (DoH) said the NHS was right to investigate safety at the unit. A spokesperson said: "We support NHS England and the trust in their decision to suspend surgery last week on the basis that there were serious concerns that needed to be investigated. "If the trust and the regulators are content that these concerns can now be explained or addressed then we would support a joint decision to resume surgery." Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said work would be done over the weekend to give "sufficient assurance" the unit is safe to reopen, early next week. Doctors and other medical experts said the data on death rates had not been verified and was not fit to base a decision to close the unit on. Mortality data and staffing are just two of the concerns being looked at as part of a review into why children's cardiac surgery at Leeds General Infirmary was suspended last Thursday. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, NHS England and the Care Quality Commission have all been involved. The indication is that if the trust can provide strong assurances that heart surgery is safe, then the unit could reopen early next week. But discussions will continue over the weekend as part of the review, which is expected to last three weeks. If the unit does reopen, Leeds General Infirmary will have to reassure patients and families that safety of care is paramount. The NHS can ill afford another scandal after Mid Staffs. Yet Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will probably have the last say on the future of children's heart services, at Leeds and elsewhere. A separate independent review is set to report to him on the whole restructuring of children's heart services in England. But, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said the figures were among a "constellation of reasons" the decision was made.  He has been backed by health secretary Jeremy Hunt. A senior Westminster source has told the BBC that "as far as the secretary of state is concerned, Sir Bruce Keogh was right to ask questions about the safety of heart surgery at the unit". Parents had criticised the timing of the suspension of surgery at the unit, which came 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that a decision-making process to close it as part of an England-wide reorganisation of services was "legally flawed". Stuart Andrew, the Conservative MP for Pudsey, called for "some really serious investigating" into the decision to suspend surgery. Mr Andrew claimed a review of the mortality figures showed "Leeds is within the average and is a safe unit to use". He said recent events raised questions about the NHS decision to close the Leeds unit for good and concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer centres. "We are losing faith in that review process," said Mr Andrew. "Some of these people are the same people on that decision-making body." Lois Brown, whose five-year-old daughter had life-saving heart treatment at the hospital, described the decision to restart surgery as "fantastic". Ms Brown has been involved in the campaign and court action to save the unit from closure. She said she wanted answers as to why the unit was shut. "I'm really relieved that children are going to get surgery at Leeds again," she said. "For the past week and a bit we have been putting children's lives at risk for no reason, apparently."	Children's heart surgery is set to restart at Leeds General Infirmary, a week after it was claimed data showed higher-than-usual death rates there.
11 May 2014 Last updated at 11:24 BST Hundreds of volunteer builders gathered in the city centre to make the tower, using 1,000 cardboard bricks. The People's Tower community art event was created to mark the opening weekend of the annual Norfolk and Norwich Festival. The tower is 22 metres tall and is designed to look like the St Peter Mancroft Church tower. It took more than eight hours to complete and was held together by more than eight miles of packing tape. It was designed by French artist Olivier GrossetÃªte.	A church made of cardboard boxes has been built in Norwich.
The influence of the movement has been in the spotlight again in Mr Gulen's home country, where a feud between his followers and other members of the political class has been blown into the open by a series of arrests. Ill-feeling is said to have grown since the Turkish government moved to close down a network of private schools run by Hizmet. Until then, the movement played a part in driving the electoral success of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party, which has been in power for three terms. But the movement's influence extends far beyond Turkey, funding schools, and think tanks and media outlets, from Kenya to Kazakhstan.  It has attracted millions of followers and billions of dollars. Hizmet has no formal structure, no visible organisation and no official membership, yet it may have grown into the world's biggest Muslim network. Its name means "service" and it promotes work for the common good, with advocates saying they simply work together in a loosely affiliated alliance inspired by the message of Mr Gulen. The imam promotes a tolerant Islam which emphasises altruism, hard work and education. There are said to be millions of Hizmet followers in Turkey, where they are believed to hold influential positions in institutions from the police and secret services to the judiciary and the AK Party itself. Followers are said to donate between 5% and 20% of their income to groups affiliated with the movement. The movement's schools usually boast hi-tech facilities, and many students are on scholarships funded by Gulen-inspired businessmen. Although the schools are secular, teachers are expected to act as role models. Smoking, drinking and divorce are frowned upon. Fatma Disli first came across the movement at a school it founded to help students pass university admissions tests. "The people I met through Hizmet were really hard-working, virtuous people who were practising their religion, but at the same time had important jobs," she told BBC News. "I realised that it's possible to be religious and to have a career." Turkish businessmen are attracted by what they see as Mr Gulen's international outlook and pragmatic approach to issues like using credit. The mix of philanthropy and business appears to have been powerful, with Gulen-inspired schools supporting and smoothing the way for Turkish businessmen in emerging markets like Africa and Central Asia. However, critics believe the movement's aim is to gain power, to spread socially conservative Islamic attitudes on issues like marriage and alcohol around the globe, and to suppress any opposition. Opponents of the movement point to a video which surfaced in 1999, in which Mr Gulen seemed to tell his followers that they should deliberately attempt to infiltrate mainstream structures: "You must move within the arteries of the system, without anyone noticing your existence, until you reach all the power centres. "You must wait until such time as you have got all the state power, until you have brought to your side all the power of the constitutional institution in Turkey." The following year, Mr Gulen faced charges of trying to undermine Turkey's secular state. He left for the US, saying the recording had been tampered with. He was later cleared in absentia of all charges. Several of Hizmet's most prominent critics have been jailed in Turkey, sparking claims that it has become a sinister controlling force in its native land. A police chief who wrote a book on Gulen's influence on the police and judiciary was jailed, as were two Turkish investigative journalists. One of the journalists, Ahmet Sik, shouted during his arrest: "Whoever touches them burns!" Today, aged 72, Mr Gulen lives a reclusive life on a country estate in Pennsylvania, in the US. He urges his followers to build schools instead of mosques, and encourages interaction with people of other faiths through dialogue societies, including one in the UK. However, he continues to attract suspicion from supporters of the secular state in Turkey, and activists picketed his estate this summer.	Supporters regard the Hizmet movement inspired by US-based Turkish preacher Fethullah Gulen as the benign, modern face of Islam, but critics question its motives.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called to Symonds Yat at 14:45 GMT on Friday where a three hour rescue operation took place. The ambulance service said it was fortunate the man's fall was broken by some bracken. The man, who is in his twenties, was flown to Hereford County Hospital for treatment on a broken leg and his back.	A man has been airlifted to hospital after falling 25m (82ft) from the top of a rock face in Herefordshire.
The former Scottish first minister will be in the Belgian capital to collect the first Coppieters Award. A spokesman for Mr Salmond said last week that he would meet Mr Juncker ahead of the awards ceremony. It comes as the Scottish government prepares to publish its proposals for keeping Scotland in the single market after Brexit. Mr Salmond's successor as first minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Juncker in Brussels in June. Speaking at the time, Mr Juncker said Scotland had "won the right to be heard in Brussels" and that he would listen carefully to what Ms Sturgeon had to say. But he stressed that he would not "interfere in an inner British process". The request for a meeting with Mr Juncker was made by Mr Salmond, who will receive the Coppieters Award in recognition of his "dedication and advocacy for Scotland's right to redefine its political future among a European family of nations". The Scottish government is exploring potential options for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK as a whole leaves, with its proposals expected to be published next week. The EU has previously said it will only negotiate a deal with the UK government once Article 50 is triggered and the formal process of leaving the EU begins. The UK Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said earlier this month that a special Brexit deal for Scotland was "not realistic". He also said he wanted to work closely with the Scottish government and the other devolved administrations in order to "secure the best possible deal" for all parts of the UK.	Alex Salmond is expected to meet European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels later.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Portugal captain, 28, was named world player of the year for the first time since 2008 by national coaches, captains and journalists. It is a tremendously emotional moment Germany goalkeeper Nadine Angerer was named best women's player, while former Bayern Munich boss Jupp Heynckes picked up the coach of the year accolade and Germany manager Silvia Neid claimed the women's award. Ronaldo claimed the award with a total of 1,365 points, ahead of Messi (1,205) and Ribery (1,127), with the votes cast by 184 coaches, 184 national captains and 173 members of the global media. Neither Ronaldo or Messi voted for the other in their top three. Cristiano Ronaldo didn't vote for Lionel Messi, and Messi didn't vote for Ronaldo. Find out who voted for whom in a breakdown of the results Ronaldo selected Radamel Falcao for first place, followed by Gareth Bale and Mesut Ozil, while Messi opted for Barcelona team-mates Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Neymar. England manager Roy Hodgson chose Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robin van Persie as his top three, while captain Steven Gerrard picked Ronaldo, Messi and Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez. Messi, 26, had won the award for the last four years, but Ronaldo had been viewed as the front-runner this time after scoring 66 goals in 56 games in 2013 for club and country. They included a sensational hat-trick for Portugal against Sweden in their World Cup qualifying play-off second leg, which sealed a place in the finals in Brazil. "First of all, I have to say a great thanks to all of my team-mates with the club and the national team," Ronaldo said as he cried during his speech. "Without all of their efforts, this would not have been possible. I am very happy; it is very difficult to win this award. "Everybody that has been involved with me on a personal level, I have to thank - my wife, my friends, my son. It is a tremendously emotional moment. All I can say is thank you to everybody that has been involved." Angerer, 35, saved two penalties in Germany's 1-0 win over Norway in the 2013 European Championship final and was named player of the match. "I have to say that I'm a little surprised, but very thankful," the Brisbane Roar goalkeeper said. "You never get a success like this on your own. I have to thank my team-mates and my goalkeeping coach who raised me to a level that I never thought I'd get to." Media playback is not supported on this device Heynckes, who retired at the end of the last season after guiding Bayern Munich to a historic treble, said he was "humbled and happy" to have won his award. The Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur was awarded to Brazil legend and three-time World Cup winner Pele. "I promised to my family that I would not cry but I am emotional," he said. "I got so many trophies and prizes but I was jealous of all of those guys who got the Ballon d'Or, which I couldn't get because I didn't play in Europe. Now I thank God that I can complete my trophies at home." The Puskas Award for goal of the year went to Ibrahimovic for his 30-yard overhead strike for Sweden - his fourth goal of the game - against England in November 2012.

The company blamed the general election for contributing to a sharp fall in demand in the second half of its financial year. It now expects its underlying annual profits to be between Â£82m-Â£87m, below the Â£94.4m it reported in the previous 12 months. Its share price tumbled by 55.25p to 196.75p DFS said the market-wide trend was linked to uncertainty regarding the general election and "uncertain macroeconomic environment". It said it had seen "significant declines in store footfall leading to a material reduction in customer orders". Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said that the slowdown reported by DFS was "not surprising" given recent economic data. "CPI inflation has accelerated to 2.9%, while wage growth is slowing. Real wages are falling. If the gap continues to widen then the likes of DFS could suffer further as spending takes a knock. Undoubtedly the uncertainty around the general election and Brexit means people are delaying big ticket purchases," he said. DFS said it experienced short-term fluctuations to demand and, confident of longer-term growth, had maintained its investment levels. But Mr Wilson said: "The relative resilience of the UK in the six months after the referendum, and comparative slowing thereafter, seems to be mirrored in the fortunes of DFS."	Shares in DFS Furniture have plunged by 22% after the sofa specialist issued a profit warning.
Nicholas Muton claimed he was protesting against police corruption and the court heard that he was convicted of a similar stunt in 2003. His recent protest, which began on 12 June, cost emergency services £1.4m and the wider economy an estimated £28m. He pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court to causing a public nuisance. Judge Adrienne Lucking QC told him his protest was a "childish response to your beef with the police". "Your actions had a direct economic impact on the constabulary and the wider economy," she said. Muton, 45, of no fixed address, was found guilty of the same offence by a jury in 2003, after he brought the M1 to a standstill for 10 hours by threatening to hang himself from a bridge. He was jailed for 18 months at the time. In 2007 he was arrested for attempting to jump off a bridge, and was Tasered by police while he was in custody. The court heard this was one of the reasons behind his most recent protest; he had also claimed to have been abused as a child. Muton has made 34 complaints to police in the past, plus appeals to the Independent Police Complaints Commission but none have been resolved in his favour. Days before his most recent protest he phoned police anonymously saying there was going to be a demonstration, but he did not say where and exactly when. Muton also wrote a Facebook message warning about his plan and alleging police had "covered up" child abuse. The court heard that no charges have ever been brought in relation to the alleged child abuse. Leicestershire Police said it would not be commenting on Muton's claims of corruption. He climbed the information board gantry between Coalville and Loughborough on the southbound carriageway at about midday at 12 June, and wrote messages alleging that someone "tried 2 kill me" and referring to "2 murder attempts". Police tried to talk him down but he was abusive and threatened to jump. He eventually came down at about 16:00 BST the following day after the IPCC arrived. The gantry was near East Midlands Airport and the court heard that cars were abandoned by people trying to catch flights, which hundreds of them missed. Angela Clark, District Crown Prosecutor at CPS East Midlands, said Muton had "set out to cause the maximum disruption possible". "The regular users of the road were affected and there were also thousands of people due to leave Donington Park from the Download festival at that point," she said. "People reported missing flights at the nearby East Midlands Airport, vehicle breakdowns and some accidents resulting from overcrowded roads." In mitigation, Muton's lawyer said he knew what he did was wrong, apologised and wanted to put it behind him. But the judge said his "one-man protest" was "so serious and had such a significant impact, a clear message must be sent". Muton claimed police closed the motorway to "wind him up", but Leicestershire Police defended their actions. Assistant Chief Constable Phil Kay said: "Our priority from the outset was the safety of the defendant, of my officers, and of the wider motoring public and the closure was necessary in order to reach a safe conclusion."	A protester who disrupted thousands of motorists by scaling a gantry and causing the M1 to be closed for 28 hours has been jailed for two years.
Molloy has made 40 appearances for the Wildcats since joining from Huddersfield in April 2013. Meanwhile, centre Bill Tupou will also miss Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final at Warrington after suffering a minor tear in his hamstring. "The injuries are a loss but we've got depth in the squad," head coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds.	Wakefield Wildcats second-row forward Jon Molloy will be out for four weeks after suffering a torn pectoral muscle.
Heartbleed was one of the worst internet flaws ever uncovered. The maintenance of the software, which secures around two-thirds of the world's websites, was done by a group of volunteers with very little funding. The new group set up by the Linux Foundation has a dozen contributors and has so far raised around $3m (Â£1.7m). As well as maintaining OpenSSL it will also support development of other crucial open-source software. Firms supporting the initiative include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Cisco and Amazon. Each will donate $300,000 over the next three years. The industry has been forced to step up after Heartbleed brought chaos to the tech sector. Experts estimate that the Heartbleed bug will cost businesses tens of million of dollars in lost productivity as they update systems with safer versions of OpenSSL. "Sometimes it takes a crisis to do the right thing," Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told journalists. The bug exposed more than just people's passwords and credit card details. It also highlighted that the crucial piece of software is maintained by a small group of developers who receive donations averaging about $2,000 a year to support the project. "It is kind of weird that such crucial software is run by a group of hobbyists on a shoestring budget," said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer with security firm F-Secure. "This software was invisible, behind the scenes and there are very few volunteers who have the skill and willingness to work on a project like this. There is no recognition, no money and it is very difficult." The details that have emerged about how the vulnerability came about speaks volumes about how little the industry has cared about the software that was securing their websites, he added. "The fact that the code change which caused the bug was done by an individual working at 23:00 on a New Year's Eve says a lot. The code simply wasn't reviewed enough and it went undetected for two years," he added. "Now there is formal and monetary support from the industry I hope we will see a change not just for OpenSSL but for other crucial open source software."	The world's biggest technology firms will donate money to fund the support of OpenSSL, the software at the centre of the Heartbleed bug.
