Ryan Matthews, 62, was already serving a life sentence for double murder when he killed Sharon Wall at Wotton Lawn Hospital in Gloucester, where he lived. Ms Wall was stabbed twice in the back on 9 July and could not be saved despite efforts from hospital staff. Matthews pleaded guilty to the 53-year-old's murder in December. Police and NHS investigations have failed to establish how Matthews got hold of the knife he used. However Shaun Clee, chief executive of the Gloucestershire 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, said the attack was "neither predictable nor preventable". He admitted his staff had "no idea" where he got the murder weapon from but said it was not one of the "sharps" on the unit, which were "controlled" and "moderated". Matthews has changed his name several times and was convicted under the name of Stephen Cecil King for two counts of murder and one count of conspiracy to murder in 1983. Gloucestershire Police said his mental health had been deteriorating throughout a number of hospital placements since 1999 when he left Broadmoor prison under the provisions of the Mental Health Act. He arrived in Wotton Lawn in 2012 but was due to be moved to Ty Catrin Hospital in Cardiff on the day he killed Ms Wall. Speaking after the sentencing, Det Ch Insp Steve Porter said: "This is a dreadful case in which a dedicated public servant turned up at her workplace only to lose her life in the most brutal way. "People who worked with Sharon say she was a very competent, hard-working healthcare assistant - her family are devastated by their loss. "Ryan Matthews had suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and anti-social personality disorder but his condition had been managed with medication." Mr Clee said the trust - which is in the process of changing the search policy at the unit - was aware of Matthews' previous convictions, adding "the clinicians were happy with his placement at that time". He offered his "deepest sympathies" to Ms Wall's family and said the incident was the most difficult thing he, and many of his colleagues, had dealt with. "[Our investigation] has identified some areas where we think we can learn and do additional things, and we are revising and enhancing our search procedures," Mr Clee said. He would not confirm specific details about Matthews' care but said it was "common practice for individuals during their treatment programme, at times and when appropriate, to have leave". The Health and Safety Executive is investigating Ms Wall's death, saying its inquiry is continuing.	A convicted murderer who stabbed to death a worker at a mental health unit has been sentenced to a whole life order.
Denny Solomona crossed for Castleford, but Wigan led at half-time against the run of play through Lewis Tierney's try and Matty Smith's penalty kick. Grant Millington's try put the visitors back in front, before John Bateman went over to restore Wigan's two-point lead. Nick Gregson got his first senior try and Bateman crossed again late on as Warriors climbed to third in the table. Having suffered their heaviest defeat in Super League since 2005 with a 62-0 loss to Wakefield in their previous fixture, Wigan started slowly but were good value for their win after the break. The hosts failed to take advantage when Luke Gale was sent to the sin-bin for dissent with the scores level in the first half, but Bateman's return to the side after two games out sparked the comeback. Shaun Wane's team also welcomed back Dom Crosby, who made his first Super League appearance of the season having recovered from a hip injury. Solomona moved clear as Super League's leading try-scorer with his 13th of the season, but Tigers were frustrated by improved Wigan defence in the second period as they suffered their fourth defeat in a row at the DW Stadium. Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "I don't want to keep going on about it. But, if you knew what we had gone through this week, there's so much toughness showed in that game against a really good Cas team. "The admiration I have got for my players, the desire to grind out the win with the circumstances that nobody knows about is unbelievable. "There were quite a few good performances, they are a good team and are well coached who know how to defend. "We're not the biggest team, but I thought the way we defended was outstanding." Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "That last try gave the score a bit of an easier look than it was. It was tight all the way through. "We lacked a little bit of quality in our play. I thought we defended awesome, they came at us in the second half with a game plan that put us under pressure. "They made minimal errors and kicked well and we couldn't find a spark to get us out of yardage and into good field position. "They deserved to win the game, they had more ball than us in decent field position and we had to work really hard to keep them out and that drained our energy reserves." Wigan: Sarginson; Tierney, Bateman, Gildart, Charnley; Gregson, Smith; Mossop, Powell, Clubb, Tomkins, Isa, Sutton. Replacements: Crosby, Tautai, Burke, Bretherton. Castleford: Hampshire; Monaghan, Minikin, Webster, Solomona; Holmes, Gale; Lynch, Milner, Jewitt, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey. Replacements: McShane, Millington, Maher, Cook. Referee: Phil Bentham.	Wigan moved level on points with Super League leaders Warrington by coming from behind to beat Castleford.
He said in a tweet: "I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings." Days after he fired Mr Comey in May, the president had tweeted: "James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations..." He has been under pressure to produce the tapes amid inquiries into alleged Russian meddling in the election. The House Intelligence Committee had earlier this month asked the White House to hand over any such recordings. James Comey was heading the FBI inquiry into alleged Russian interference in last year's presidential election, and whether the Trump team had any links to Moscow, when he was fired on 9 May. In the days that followed, a succession of stories appeared in US newspapers with allegations surrounding a private meeting Mr Trump had with Mr Comey in the Oval Office in February. They included the claim that the president had asked Mr Comey to drop an investigation into fired National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. It was in that context that Mr Trump sent his tweet, hinting that there were tapes of the conversation. Appearing before Congress earlier this month, Mr Comey confirmed he had been asked by the president to "let go" any possible prosecution of Mr Flynn for lying to federal agents about a conversation with the Russian ambassador. He said he was also asked by the president in no uncertain terms to give assurances that he would be loyal. When asked whether he thought the conversation had been recorded, Mr Comey replied: "Lordy, I hope there are tapes."	US President Donald Trump says he did not make secret recordings of ex-FBI chief James Comey despite an earlier hint to the contrary.
Mayor John Hamilton said the move would "better reflect cultural sensitivity in the workplace", local media said. Bloomington is a traditionally liberal city. Its county gave Hillary Clinton 58.6% in the presidential election. But the move sparked a backlash on social media, with opponents condemning it as an act of political correctness. How Columbus became a hate figure for many A political correctness war that never really ended The change was announced on Friday by Mr Hamilton in a memo to city employees. "We are terrifically proud of our diverse workforce at the city," he wrote, according to the Herald-Times. "That diversity makes us stronger and more representative of the public we proudly serve. These updated names for two days of well-merited time off is another way we can demonstrate our commitment to inclusivity." Bloomington city employees receive paid time off for Columbus Day and Good Friday. Columbus Day became a federal holiday in the United States in 1937 and celebrates the arrival of explorer Christopher Columbus in the Americas in 1492. The holiday falls on the second Monday of October. However, it has drawn significant opposition from those who regard Columbus's arrival as a prelude to centuries of oppression. A movement began in 1977 to replace it with a holiday that celebrates the indigenous peoples of North America. A few states now do not mark Columbus Day, or give it another title. Good Friday is one of the most important dates of the Christian faith, marking the day Jesus Christ was crucified by the Romans. It is not a federal holiday in the US but is a state holiday in some states. Bloomington, with a population estimated at 84,067 in July 2016 by the Census Bureau, has long been regarded as a liberal city. It is the home to Indiana University Bloomington and a number of other schools and institutes. It enrolled in Tree City USA, a tree planting and tree care programme in 2015. The renaming of the holidays drew strong social media responses, most of them condemning the move. They included posts such as "How is the day Jesus died insensitive?" and "I'm guessing they will next rename Christmas to winter holiday".	The US city of Bloomington in Indiana has renamed Good Friday and Columbus Day as "Spring Holiday" and "Fall Holiday" to be more "inclusive".
A JCB spokesperson confirmed that the company had ended its membership of the CBI, but did not give reasons why. Sky news had earlier reported that it was due to the group's response to the referendum outcome JCB's chairman, Lord Bamford, was a prominent supporter of the Brexit campaign. During the campaign he said: "The UK is the world's fifth largest trading nation. We therefore have little to fear from leaving the EU." He also wrote to his 6,500 UK employees to explain why he favoured a vote to leave the European Union, saying he was "very confident that we can stand on our own two feet". The CBI, on the other hand, warned that a UK exit from the EU would cause a "serious economic shock", potentially costing the country Â£100bn and nearly one million jobs. A CBI spokesman said: "It's always a shame to see any member leave the CBI, but we recognise that businesses have competing priorities and we respect that." A spokesperson for JCB said only: "I can confirm that JCB is ending its membership of the CBI." The Sky report said that the Staffordshire-based company had ended the membership in the summer, after the referendum.	The construction firm JCB has left the business lobby group, the CBI, reportedly because of its anti-Brexit stance.
The judges said Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and How to Think Smarter About People Who Think Differently was a "tour de force" of journalistic and scientific research. It is the first popular science book to win the prize in its 17-year history. The shortlist had included Jonathan Bate's Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life and Robert Macfarlane's Landmarks. Historian Anne Applebaum, chair of the judges, praised Silberman's "compassionate journalism" and said he excelled at using stories and anecdotes to explain complex medical issues to a wide audience. The American author, who is based in San Francisco, has been a science writer for Wired and other magazines such as the New Yorker, the MIT Technology Review, Nature and Salon for more than 20 years. "We admired Silberman's work because it is powered by a strongly argued set of beliefs: that we should stop drawing sharp lines between what we assume to be 'normal' and 'abnormal', and that we should remember how much the differently-wired human brain has, can and will contribute to our world," Applebaum said. "He has injected a hopeful note into a conversation that's normally dominated by despair." Neurotribes, she added, was "a tour de force of archival, journalistic and scientific research, both deeply researched and widely accessible". In its review of Silberman's book, The Guardian described Neurotribes as "a gripping narrative written with journalistic verve". The £20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize was won last year by Helen Macdonald's H is for Hawk.	Author Steve Silberman has won the £20,000 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction for his book about autism.
Citizens Advice said that hidden charges such as line rental and delivery costs could add Â£20 a month to the advertised price. It highlighted one case in which a customer would pay Â£465 more than the amount advertised during a contract. The trade body for internet service providers, ISPA, said broadband prices were "clearly presented". Nicholas Lansman, ISPA secretary-general, said: "It is important that customers look at the full terms of an offer when choosing a provider. "Ofcom recently concluded that the UK has one of the most competitive broadband markets among major European economies, as the average price of a fixed broadband package has fallen by 40% and speeds have greatly increased." Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said confusing teaser rates and hidden costs made it difficult for consumers to work out whether they were getting a good deal. "Internet providers need to be upfront about broadband costs, ensuring adverts are transparent and people know what they are signing up to," she said. "Some broadband firms are starting to accept that prices need to be clearer. Now the whole industry needs to up its game." The charity said that line rental was the most expensive additional cost. The ISPA said that service providers using the BT network were required to levy a line rental charge, which went toward maintaining the network used by most of the UK for both phone calls and broadband. The report comes as Virgin Media was criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for one of its broadband adverts. Two customers complained that they had signed up to the operator's 12-month broadband contracts only to be told that their monthly charges would be increasing during the minimum term. They said this was misleading. The company argued that it could not predict price rises at the start of a contract and so was unable to advertise potential increases.	Teaser deals in adverts are masking the long-term cost of broadband packages, a charity has claimed.
The Boomtown Rats were to headline the event in Dumfries along with Rick Astley, ABC, The Stars from The Commitments and The Rezillos on 4 June. Last year the Doonhamers hosted their first concert when Status Quo were the headline act. However, advanced ticket sales of just 700 compared with 5,000 sold in 2015 prompted the decision to cancel. Organisers said sales were "not sufficient to justify the event going ahead on a commercial basis". "We have not been helped with the number of alternative outdoor festivals and concerts across Scotland and the north of England," they said. "After weighing up additional costs to go ahead with the concert from this point against the costs of cancelling altogether it was unfortunately a decision that had to be taken. "Clearly all customers who have already bought and paid for tickets for the event will be refunded in full."	A 1980s-themed concert at Queen of the South's Palmerston Park has been cancelled due to poor ticket sales.
Sir Philip, owner of clothing retailer Arcadia Group, will examine expenditure from the past three years to try to identify potential savings. He told the BBC more centralised buying by government departments might help. But the appointment was criticised by the GMB union - who said that Sir Philip's wife, the direct owner of Arcadia, lives in a tax haven. Sir Philip owns more than 2,000 shops in the UK, including BHS and Topshop, which are estimated to make up some 12% of the nation's clothing retail market. His conclusions will inform the wider Comprehensive Spending Review due in October. Sir Philip Green is one of the UK's most successful retailers. With a personal fortune of more than £4bn, he owns the Arcadia Group, whose fashion chains include Topshop, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Miss Selfridge. In 2009 Arcadia made pre-tax profits of £213.6m, 13% higher than the previous year. Sir Philip also owns department store chain BHS, whose fortunes he has transformed since he purchased the then ailing company in 2000. The government will be hoping that Sir Philip can transfer his renowned ability to trim costs from the private sector to the civil service. He will also bring a proven record in procurement, and aims to reduce the cost of the government's purchasing contracts. However, despite Sir Philip's successes, his appointment may still raise eyebrows. His wife Tina is the direct owner of Arcadia, and she is officially a resident of Monaco. This enabled her to gain a tax-free £1.2bn dividend in 2005. Sir Philip also made headlines in 2004 when he made a failed hostile takeover bid for Marks and Spencer. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had "no idea" how much could be saved yet, but added: "We need to get ourselves focused on the big spending, where is the money actually being spent. "I think in the past, occasionally having had discussions on this, there is not central procurement. "So the thought process of us having an individual buyer in each one of our stores without centralising the purchasing, will give you some idea, hopefully, of the opportunity. "But it's about process as well, so we need to understand the process, how it's done, who does what and how we can quicken all of that up." But his appointment was criticised by Paul Kenny, head of the GMB union, who  pointed out that Sir Philip's wife - the named owner of Arcadia - lives in the tax haven of Monaco. He said: "If we were seeking advice about marketing or selling clothes he is someone you might ask. This is about the health, education and care of millions of our fellow citizens - not about importing cheap clothing." And the Public and Commercial Services Union, which represents civil servants, said: "It's not that surprising that the millionaires in the cabinet have appointed a billionaire to say that their cuts, which will devastate communities in the UK, are 'fair'." But Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude defended Sir Philip's appointment, saying he had a "sharp eye for detail" and could guide the government on contracts and leases signed up to in future. "He's shown how he can turn around big complex businesses. Government is a huge complex organisation, and while it's not the same as a business, a lot of the same disciplines are needed," he added. Asked about the tax status of his wife, Sir Philip told the BBC: "My wife's not a tax exile - my family do not live in the United Kingdom, it's somewhat different." He added: "We do pay all our tax in Britain. I think we have paid over the last five years some £300-400m in taxes on profits that have been made on our company. "I'm a UK taxpayer, I work here every week, we employ 45,000 people in the UK and we have got a £500m payroll." Sir Philip will be supported by a team of civil servants and report to Mr Maude and Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander - who said the review would help the government "totally re-think" the way it spends public money.	Billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green is to lead a review of government spending - amid criticism from unions.
The 29-year-old spent the majority of last season on loan with Wolves, making 19 appearances in all competitions. He previously played 211 league games for the Molineux side between 2008 and 2015 before moving to Craven Cottage.

One Met Police officer received an overtime payment of £45,000 last year, a Freedom of Information request found. The overtime bill for officers and staff in England and Wales totalled almost £1bn over three years and went up by £6m last year. The Home Office said the government had "already taken steps to reduce unnecessary overtime payments". "We have asked the independent Police Remuneration Review Body to consider whether more can be done on this issue," said a spokesman. "Police officers' pay should reflect the difficult work they do - but the public rightly expects that this is not abused." The National Police Chiefs' Council said it was "only right" that officers should be compensated for overtime. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent "Overtime does not go sick or take leave." That pithy phrase, from Tim Godwin, the former Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner, sums up the usefulness of overtime to a service that has to cope with sudden and unexpected events. Whether it's the surveillance officer monitoring a terrorism suspect, the detective constable deployed on a murder investigation, or the civilian staff employee answering calls after hours because a colleague has gone home ill - overtime has a valuable part to play. Sir Tom Winsor's review recognised that, while also recommending changes designed to reduce the overall bill. The year-on-year increase, identified by 5 live's research, does not mean that work has stalled. But it's interesting to note that some overtime payments appear to be connected to staff shortages. As the police workforce shrinks further, it may well be that existing officers and staff are increasingly asked to plug the gaps. Figures for 39 forces in England and Wales show the overtime bill rose from £307.1m in 2013/14 to £313.2m in 2014/15. The Metropolitan Police accounted for about a third of the overall bill, while in two other forces, Bedfordshire and Cleveland, the overtime bill went up by 50% - explained in part by gaps in recruitment. The Met said officers earning the highest amounts were in specialist roles, where working time was determined by the operational circumstances. An officer at West Midlands Police earned £32,702 in overtime working in a contact centre. Inspector Tony Morris from that force said "recruitment in this business area has been on hold" due to a reorganisation. "This means the department has been carrying a significant number of vacancies, resulting in an increased need for planned overtime." Sergeants and constables are eligible to claim overtime for working extra days, for staying on at the end of a shift, or for being recalled between shifts. On four days each week, officers are expected to give the first 30 minutes of unplanned overtime for free, traditionally referred to as "half an hour for the Queen". Three years ago, Sir Tom Winsor's review of policing in England and Wales called for "cultural change" to reduce the cost of overtime. He suggested that in future, the police pay review body may consider a "buy out" for sergeants which would see them give up overtime pay in return for an increased salary. Overtime for inspectors was "bought out" in 1994. South Wales Police reported the biggest percentage increase for overtime spending in the last year, from £5.2m in 2013/14 to £8.4m in 2014/15. The force said the majority of that increase was due to the Nato summit in September 2014, which involved 9,500 officers from across the UK, including 1,500 from South Wales. But in Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures were down on the previous year. Police Scotland spent £18.2m on overtime in 2014/15, a reduction of £6m on the previous year. The Police Service of Northern Ireland also spent less, down by £11.5m from £59.2m in 2013/14 to £47.7m in 2014/15. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: "Overtime is called upon when it is essential to maintain operational effectiveness and, in the context of capital city policing and national responsibilities, there are times when there is a genuine need to call on officers to work beyond their scheduled hours to police unforeseen events, to provide security, or public reassurance." The force said the London Olympic and Paralympic Games had a particular impact on its overtime bill for 2012/13 - when forces in England and Wales spent a total of £354.9m. Chief Constable Francis Habgood from the National Police Chiefs' Council said: "Overtime is a very flexible - and can be a very cost-effective - way of managing unexpected demand and it is only right that officers whose lives are disrupted by a last-minute order to work an extended tour of duty or work on a rest day are compensated for that disruption. "With the current cuts regime, we are doing all we can to ensure that the police service offers the best value for taxpayers' money and all forces have reduced overtime spend in recent years."	Some UK police forces are using overtime to cover gaps caused by staff shortages, BBC Radio 5 live has found.
Leader Brandt Snedeker, who had a share of the lead after the opening round, is on 12 under par - one clear of fellow American Kevin Kisner. Donald, five under par for the day, is 10 under, level with Americans Zach Johnson, Zac Blair and Chez Reavie. Snedeker was third at last week's Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. His short game helped him take the lead on day two as he holed out from 15 foot on his first hole, chipped in from 35 feet on his 12th, and then had a 20-footer at the next on the way to match Donald's five-under-par round of 65. "This is why we spend so much time away from our families as well as so much time on the golf course - to be in contention and have a chance to win at the weekend," he said. Fiji's Vijay Singh, 52, who is hoping to become the oldest winner on the PGA Tour, is four off the lead after a one-under round of 69. Singh had shared the early lead with Snedeker, Kisner, Ricky Barnes and Morgan Hoffman after the quintet all hit 63s in their first round. Padraig Harrington and England's Greg Owen are in a group six off the pace on six under but Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell missed the cut by six shots on three over after a 73 on Friday.	England's former world number one Luke Donald lies two shots off the lead at the halfway point of the Sony Open in Honolulu after a second-round 65.
At one stage, winds were gusting at 55 knots and winds over 48 knots are not safe for airport staff to work in. As a result, passengers on nine planes were unable to leave as it was too windy to put access steps in place. Some passengers were kept on planes for two hours, but wind speeds eventually dropped, allowing them to disembark. Flights from Edinburgh, Tenerife, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Gatwick and Bristol landed, but flights, from Luton and Tenerife were diverted to Dublin. Belfast man Martin Garland was on a flight from Liverpool that landed at 19:30 GMT. Speaking from the plane, he said: "People are starting to get irritated now and there's a number of elderly passengers that are now getting agitated with the heat on the plane," he said. "Most people seem to be playing on their phones, the pilot has been getting people up into the cockpit and letting the kids play." Thomas Spence, who arrived at the airport on a flight from Tenerife, was unable to reclaim his luggage as baggage handlers could not unload baggage from the plane. Returning to the airport on Wednesday morning to retrieve his bags, he said: "When we were sitting [in the plane], it was rocking on the tarmac. "You actually thought you were still in the air. "But it was good to be on the ground because it was a rough flight, it was bouncing everywhere, and we were just glad to get touched down. "When you came off the plane, it was really windy and you could understand why we were stuck on the plane." Alan Whiteside, the airport's operations director, said the weather conditions had been "probably the worst we've had in quite a number of years". "The real issue is the safety of the both personnel operating the steps and the aircraft doors, and the passengers," he said. "In those kind of winds, those large-sided steps will just start to move, so it's unsafe to put them on unsafe to try to get passengers off. "It was a fairly horrendous night."	Passengers flying into Belfast International Airport were prevented from getting off planes for a time on Tuesday night due to high winds.
UK Parking Control (UKPC) said it has investigated allegations one of its employees in Lincoln had changed timestamps on photos. It said it had worked "to mitigate the risk of this re-occurring". But, a wider inquiry in other parts off the UK by the British Parking Association (BPA) is under way. The BPA said it could not comment further as they were "still in the process of our investigation". UKPC has also been reported to Action Fraud and the complaint is currently being assessed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. Alex Shipp, who campaigns as the Parking Prankster, said: "I think this merits a full investigation, rather than just acknowledging the few cases we know about so far." The issue came to light in Lincoln when Simone Riley-Young was issued with a parking charge notice while parked at Tritton Retail Park on 18 July. Drivers can park there free of charge for up to two hours. The timestamps on the photos said 07:15 and 09:27, but Ms Riley-Young said the earlier time was impossible as she was still in bed. Another driver, Matthew Treacy, had the same problem at the car park on 23 August. The timestamps on the photos of his car said 14:06 and 16:21, but Mr Treacy said he had four independent sources to prove his car could not have been in the car park at 14:06. UKPC operates more than 1,400 sites nationwide and similar problems have been reported outside Lincoln, including in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Talking about the Lincoln incidents, UKPC said there had been a full investigation. "This behaviour is completely contrary to UKPC's operating procedures and employees who do not adhere to our high professional standards or codes of conduct are subject to disciplinary proceedings up to and including dismissal," a spokesman said. "We have put steps in place to mitigate the risk of this reoccurring." The BBC contacted UKPC again about incidents elsewhere in the country, but the company has not responded.	A car park operator is being investigated over claims photographic evidence has been altered to unfairly impose parking charges.
With 100 hours of video added to the site every minutes it can be hard to get noticed, so some people buy fake views. There are many companies that will sell YouTube views, likes or comments for a fee. Most videos have genuine views but the website wants to crack down on the small number that don't.	YouTube has warned it will clamp down on users who buy 'fake views' to make their videos look more popular than they really are.
This is, said shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith, "the most important general election for a generation". The prime minister agrees.  David Cameron cannot be accused of inconsistency on this issue. He said exactly the same in 2010. Perhaps they should agree that it's the most important general election since the last one. Owen Smith made his remarks in Ammanford as Labour launched its Welsh campaign in a seat it lost to Plaid Cymru in 2001. Labour used the launch to unveil its Welsh campaign pledge card (above). These cards have become an essential campaign tool since John Prescott took to his battlebus in 1997. Not for the first time at these gatherings, I asked the obvious question of the politicians, candidates and activists present: how many of the five pledges can you name? Some of the replies were more on message than others. One sticker-wearing supporter was honest: "Oh, not many....I haven't read it yet." His friend got closer: "The bedroom tax is going to go...more money for the NHS? That is very important." Once candidate told me: "I don't know....let me see...I knew you were going to ask me that......I haven't actually seen it yet." So I thought I'd try asking Welsh Labour leader, Carwyn Jones: "Well if you look at the pledges, they are UK pledges. They are pledges around UK issues as you know. What we've got to be careful about is to make sure the pledges affect the UK and not just of course Wales." Pressed, he mentioned the living wage, looking at improving the economy and helping people live in safer communities. The "safer communities" pledge doesn't appear to be one of the five pledges, which may explain why, after our interview, the first minister was seen asking a spin doctor for his own pledge card.	There's one thing the political parties agree on.
The University of London's Institute of Education compared vocabulary test scores and reading habits of 9,400 British people born in 1970. The researchers analysed data collected at the ages of 10, 16 and 42. As well as the tabloids finding, they said childhood reading for fun boosted vocabulary throughout life, while highbrow fiction helped adults further. The research team drew on the 1970 British Cohort Study, which collects information on a group of people from England, Scotland and Wales who were born in the same week. At the age of 10, the group took a pictorial language comprehension test and at 16 they did a multiple-choice vocabulary test. The test they did aged 42 was a shortened version of the one used at 16. The researchers also analysed information on the group's reading habits as adults and their educational achievements. The group were asked how often they read books for pleasure and what sort of books they read. The vocabulary tests showed all respondents had greater word power by the age of 42 than they had had at 16, with the average vocabulary score rising from 55% to 63%. But those who had read regularly for pleasure as children beat the rest, scoring an average 67% in the age 42 test, compared with infrequent childhood readers who scored an average of 51%. The study found those who read regularly as children tended to come from better-off families and had higher vocabulary scores as children. However, even after the data was reanalysed to take these differences into account, there was still a nine percentage point gap in the vocabulary scores at age 42 between the two groups. This may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read for pleasure as adults, wrote the researchers. "In other words, they developed 'good' reading habits in childhood and adolescence that they have subsequently benefited from." But they also found "what people read mattered as how often they read". In terms of newspapers, they found readers of broadsheets made more progress in vocabulary than people who did not read newspapers. But "tabloid readers actually made less progress than non-readers of newspapers". Co-author Prof Alice Sullivan said the finding was in line with the team's previous work, which showed "the presence of tabloid newspapers in the home during childhood was linked to poor cognitive attainment at age 16". The report also said: "Those who read 'highbrow' fiction made greater vocabulary gains than those who read middlebrow fiction; and lowbrow fiction readers made no more progress than non-readers." The study found the adults with the biggest vocabularies were graduates of Russell Group of sought-after universities, scoring an average of 81% in the age 42 vocabulary test. Of this group, two-thirds (66%) preferred "highbrow" fiction and more than half (56%) said they read only broadsheet newspapers.	Readers of tabloid papers have smaller vocabularies than people who do not read newspapers, suggests a study.
But images of famous civil rights campaigners, including Martin Luther King Junior, Nelson Mandela and Bob Marley with the same string around their heads have appeared on the singer's Facebook page. It's causing controversy with some people claiming she's comparing herself with them and exploiting their images to promote her album. Next to anti-apartheid campaigner, Nelson Mandela, Madonna wrote 'This #rebelheart fought for freedom!' But the promo campaign's faced criticism on social media. The star later posted another picture of Princess Diana saying "Yes Princess Diana was. #rebelheart! Anyone who fights for freedom is a #rebelheart" -Madonna". She also issues an apology: "I'm sorry, I'm not comparing myself to anyone. I'm admiring and acknowledging there (sic) Rebel Hearts. This is neither a crime or an insult or racist!" Some of the songs from Madonna's latest album, Rebel Heart, were recently leaked online. She compared it to 'artistic rape' and urged fans to wait for their official release on March 10.

Tommy Roome, of Rams Grove, Romford, has been accused of murdering Mr Hayden, 27, who was stabbed outside his home in Chadwell Heath on 13 September. Mr Roome was also charged with the attempted murder of Mr Hayden's father, Paul, 46, who was also injured. He is due to appear at Barkingside Magistrates' Court on Friday. Mr Hayden died from a stab wound to the thigh a day after he was attacked in Gibbfield Close at about 01:25 BST. Both he and his father were assaulted when they confronted a group of men outside their home following the attempted theft of a moped. The bodyguard had worked in security at ITV and at high-profile events including the marriage between footballer Peter Crouch and model Abbey Clancy. He was also employed by Havering Council. Two other teenagers, aged 16 and 19, were previously arrested over the attack and bailed.	A 19-year-old man has been charged with the murder of celebrity minder Ricky Hayden, who was stabbed to death in east London.
Wildschut, 25, has agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract after requesting a transfer from Wigan on Monday. The Dutchman helped the Latics win the League One title last season. Dijks, 23, was in Norwich last week for talks, but his agent said in a Dutch newspaper that Dijks would not be moving to Carrow Road. However, Dijks has joined the Canaries on a deal which includes an option for the English club to buy the player. Dijks began his career with Ajax, but had a spell with Willem II before rejoining them in July 2015 and has made 15 appearances this season in the Dutch Eredivisie and Europa League.

Norwich City have signed Wigan Athletic winger Yanic Wildschut for £7m and Ajax left-back Mitchell Dijks on loan for the rest of the season.
In the footage, which has been widely shared on social media, the policeman headbutts, slaps and kicks the driver as they quarrel beside the lorry. The incident happened at Wadi Joz, an Arab area in occupied East Jerusalem. Police said the officer involved had shown "severe and unusual behaviour" and had been placed on forced leave. The video, which was recorded by a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem, has been passed to the police investigation unit. Apparently filmed on a dashcam of another vehicle, it shows the officer remonstrating with the lorry driver. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said the incident reportedly arose over an issue with the parking of the lorry. The Palestinian appears to be explaining something and emphasising a point, whereupon the officer headbutts him and slaps him back and forth across the head. As the driver clutches his head and bends over, the policeman knees him in the stomach then punches him on the back of the head. At this point, two more individuals arrive and start remonstrating with the policeman, who shoves one of them backwards. He pushes back at the policeman, who then kicks out at him. The edited video then cuts to a moment where the second man apparently strikes the policeman on the side of the face, before a third man steps in and tries to calm the policeman down. The footage drew outrage from Israeli Arab politicians. Member of the Knesset Ahmad Tibi called for the officer to be arrested and prosecuted. "It is brutal behaviour of mafia and gang members, not people who are responsible for law and order," he said. Israel's Public Security Minister, Gilad Erdan, condemned the officer's actions. "There is no place for such behaviour in the [police] force and I hope that the police investigation unit will prosecute him to the full extent of the law," he said.	Israeli police are investigating after a video emerged showing an Israeli policeman beating up a Palestinian lorry driver.
Bus use has been falling across the UK since 2008 but the drop has been sharpest in Wales. The Welsh government puts Â£25m a year into supporting bus services - a quarter less than in 2013. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the level of cuts could be "devastating". "If the cuts are of the scale of what's been mentioned by George Osborne - we're talking 25 to 40%," the WLGA's transport spokesman Andrew Morgan said. "You take 40% of funding away from non-protected services like bus services then we're talking about probably another three, four, five per cent of all bus services in Wales will end up being withdrawn." Kevyn Jones, managing director of Cardiff-based bus operator New Adventure Travel, said about half the routes he ran received some subsidy, but he expected the numbers to reduce in the future. "The subsidised services are dwindling each year. There's less this year than there was last year and the same each year for the last five years we've been operating them," he added. A Welsh government spokesperson said: "These grants are intended to supplement local authorities' expenditure on bus services and it is a matter for them how that funding is allocated. "Under the concessionary bus travel scheme local authorities are responsible for determining the reimbursement rate for bus operators and for ensuring that operators are no better and no worse off." Hear more on Eye on Wales, BBC Radio Wales, Sunday 18 October at 12:30 BST.	Bus services in Wales could be dramatically cut as a result of the UK government's spending review next month, it has been warned.

It's a special day." Reve De Sivola held on for second and Deputy Dan trailed in third, another 12 lengths further back.	Thistlecrack ended the three-year reign of Reve De Sivola to cruise to an impressive victory in the Grade One Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot.
A statement said the initiative aimed to provide better information about Russia than is available on Wikipedia. Analysis had shown that Wikipedia "does not have enough detailed and reliable information about Russian regions and the life of the country", it said. Some 50,000 books and documents had been collected, it said, to portray Russia "objectively and accurately". But the new site has some catching up to do - Wikipedia is the world's sixth most popular website. The Russian edition has more than one million entries. The move comes amid increasing Kremlin control of the web. In August, laws were enacted forcing bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers to register with the mass media regulator. And in March, websites run by opponents and critics of President Vladimir Putin were blocked.	Russia is planning an alternative version of the Wikipedia, the country's presidential library has said.
Media playback is not supported on this device The takeover, which would include the Rodney Parade ground, has already been approved by the WRU and Dragons boards. It needs to be ratified by 75 per cent of Newport RFC shareholders next month. Dragons chief executive Stuart Davies agreed the decision was pivotal, adding: "It is a hugely important moment in the history of Newport RFC, the Dragons and Rodney Parade." He warned that holding company Rodney Parade Ltd faced going into liquidation of a deal was not agreed. The shareholders have been issued with a document providing information on the central issues. It also includes an open letter from Tony Brown, one of the two main financial backers, advocating the deal. Rugby union has been played at Rodney Parade since 1877, and the ground is used by the Dragons regional side, Newport RFC and League Two football club Newport County. The venue is in need of updating, with the pitch suffering from water-logging problems that have led to football and rugby matches being abandoned or postponed. The deal on offer would see: Davies described the Dragons current financial position - set out in the documents sent to shareholders - as "not healthy" and suggested a refusal to go ahead with the takeover could lead to the end of rugby at Rodney Parade. "It all points to one thing. Rugby stops and the ground stops." "It's an historic venue known the world over and the protection of the venue has been at the heart of this," he said. "It's an incredibly important evening and we have done everything we can to ensure everything is understood and more importantly the implications of it not being supported. "When you read through the circular and see the accounts you realise what our trading position is. "Our financial situation is not healthy so the circular clearly sets out in the event a "no vote" the directors are likely to call in an administrator or receiver and that leads to events where the ground has to be sold for best price to secured creditors. "It all points to one thing. Rugby stops and the ground stops." Newport RFC chairman Will Godfrey said the WRU's offer of £3.75m for the ground reflected its value as a sports ground. "The problem you have got is that you either treat it as a development site or a sporting venue," he said. "There is limited demand for a sporting venue so when we established the value we consider that to be a fair price for a sporting venue. "Some of the facilities here are pretty old and people coming are going to look at them and say is a further investment going to bring back a return?" Major benefactor Brown said in his letter to shareholders he had initially invested £4m into Newport Rugby Club after his association started in 1997 which was turned into shares and written off when he initially left the board. After returning to the board, Brown claims he and Martyn Hazell put in an extra £5.5m to 'keep the Newport Gwent Dragons and Newport afloat.' He said the deal on offer was "the product of two years of many challenging board meetings and difficult decisions being taken to evolve it to this point, once we accepted that the current business model was not working and would ultimately fail. "Both Martyn and myself are over 80 and anxious to cut back on our responsibilities. "Before doing so, we have explored multiple options while trying to ensure a successful Dragons, a secure Newport RFC, protection of the venue and the continuation of professional rugby in Gwent at Rodney Parade. "The WRU became our preferred option rather than a choice of last resort, and I believe they are doing this with the best of intentions. "They are best placed to make a success of the Dragons, and ensure rugby for all continues at Rodney Parade."	The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) takeover of Newport Gwent Dragons will be put to the vote on Tuesday, 9 May.
Motorcyclist Leighton Santos, 22, admitted causing David Hitchen's death through careless driving and was jailed at Preston Crown Court on Monday. The maximum sentence is five years, but this can be reduced by a guilty plea. Road safety charity Brake said there was a "need to see much tougher sentences when a driver has killed". Santos admitted causing the 42-year-old former Great Britain international's death near Belmont, Lancashire, in September 2014, on the first day of his trial. Lancashire Police said Santos had been riding a Yamaha motorbike on Rivington Road when he "drifted into the opposite carriageway" and collided with Mr Hitchen. The cyclist suffered serious injuries and died later in hospital. In addition to the six months for causing death by careless driving, Santos was also given 12 months for another motoring offence. In March 2016 he was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of dangerous driving after taking police on an eight-mile pursuit that saw him reach speeds of up to 90mph (145km/h) in a 30mph zone. Martin Key, British Cycling's campaigns manager, said six months for "causing the death of a human being is a punishment that many would agree certainly does not fit the crime". "While these incidents are extremely rare, we need to ensure that sentencing guidelines adequately reflect the potential consequences of an offence," he said. A spokeswoman for Brake said the sentence was "insulting". "Leighton Santos, who killed another human being, was sentenced to a paltry 18 months in prison, and will likely be out in nine. "It's no wonder that grieving relatives are often left feeling let down and insulted by our justice system. "We need to see much tougher sentences when a driver has killed, particularly when, as in this case, they have exhibited previous examples of dangerous behaviour."	A six-month prison term handed to a motorist who killed an ex-international cyclist in a crash "does not fit the crime," British Cycling has said.
The skull of an adult male was found by the M54 slip road on Thursday by workers surveying a roundabout near Telford. The find sparked a West Mercia Police inquiry and led to the discovery of "further skeletal remains". The remains have now been recovered and post-mortem tests on Tuesday will help to identify him, police said. Officers said the remains had been there for at least two years. Police have contacted neighbouring forces asking for information about people who had been reported missing.	A post-mortem examination is to take place on human remains found near a motorway slip road in Shropshire.
Oberon was one of three animals mauled by a dog in their field in the eastern part of the New Forest on 22 December. Owner Susan Sears said she was "devastated" Oberon's wounds had not healed, and, despite further surgery, he was found to be "beyond recovery". The two other injured animals have received further treatment for their wounds. Mrs Sears said: "After nearly two weeks of round the clock monitoring and nursing, poor Oberon's wounds were not healing as well as hoped and, despite further surgery, were found to be beyond recovery. "As alpha male, it is likely that Oberon would have put himself between his herd mates and the attacking dog," Another alpaca had also been the victim of a dog attack in the same field earlier last year. Oberon was part of a herd of about 80 animals which Mrs Sears and her husband have bred for their wool for the past six years. A crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the animals' treatment raised more than Â£1,900.	An alpaca which was seriously injured in a dog attack has been put down, its owner has said.
Christopher Nolan won best director, and also received the film magazine's "inspiration" award. Andy Serkis won best actor for his motion-capture performance in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Ralph Fiennes, meanwhile, was presented with a "legend" award by Liam Neeson, his Schindler's List co-star. Code-breaking drama The Imitation Game began the evening with the most nominations - six - but ultimately took home just one award, for best thriller. Paddington was named best comedy at the event, while spy caper Kingsman: The Secret Service was crowned best British film. An absent Rosamund Pike was named best actress for her role in Gone Girl, while former Doctor Who star Karen Gillan won best female newcomer for her work in Guardians of the Galaxy. The latest X-Men film, Days of Future Past, won the award for best sci-fi or fantasy, while Australian title The Babadook took home the prize for best horror. Voted for by Empire readers, the awards were presented by Cold Feet star James Nesbitt at London's Grosvenor House hotel. Serkis, best known for playing Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, ended Eddie Redmayne's winning streak for playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. The 50-year-old said it was "gratifying" to be recognised as it helped illustrate his part in portraying computer-generated ape Caesar was "no different from any form of live-action acting". Fiennes, currently appearing in Man and Superman at the National Theatre, confessed to feeling both "delight" and "embarrassment" at being called a legend. "The 'L' word is only really applicable to a handful of dead actors... and should be treated with generous bucket-loads of irony," he told an audience that included his Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe. Paying tribute to such former colleagues as Steven Spielberg and Robert Redford, the 53-year-old also gave an unexpected shout-out to Jennifer Lopez, his co-star in romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan "May the spirit of J-Lo, with whom I maided in Manhattan, stop me for taking myself too seriously - though I am serious about the work," he concluded.	Deep space epic Interstellar left the competition earthbound at this year's Empire awards, taking off with three prizes including best film.
Other shopping centres have increased the number of their security officers - and frisking people before they enter buildings, public transport vehicles and even churches is now common. While the attack contributed to a fall in revenues in the country's important tourism sector, it has also boosted business in the private security industry. "In a way it has [boosted business] because our clients have been concerned," says James Omwando, chief executive of the security firm, KK, of the new emphasis on security. "They've taken on additional security officers, they've invested in new equipment - CCTVs and access control." The company's training centre on the outskirts of Nairobi is busier than ever. New recruits march for hours as they answer their instructor at the top of their voices. Their clean-shaven heads, navy blue shorts, white socks and shoes are meant to help instil discipline. "Even in terms of general recruitment we're now looking for a better educated, higher profile security officer who'll be able to understand what's being looked into because the challenges are many," says training manager Lucas Ndolo. Ndolo, a former military intelligence officer, says even though understanding terrorism has always been part of the training, they have had to put more emphasis on it. "We emphasise more on surveillance, detection, profiling and what security officers are looking for in the field," he says. The soon-to-graduate guards are taking their lessons in a wooden classroom. A lot of the lessons taught are focused on preventing attacks. "It is better to press the panic button when you realise that a person is gathering information, instead of you pressing the panic button when they've come to attack," a trainer lectures the class of about 20 trainees. "You saw what happened at Westgate?" he goes on, as they answer in the affirmative. One of the first victims of the Westgate gunmen was the mall's security officer. For security companies such as KK, one positive thing that has come out of the widely publicised attack is that they now collaborate a lot more with Kenya's security services. "We get police officers coming here to help train our people. We've been in touch with the bomb people, the criminal investigation [and] anti-terrorism [officers] who come here to train our people," says Lucas Ndolo. They also work together in conducting security operations. That co-ordination is also beneficial to the police, who number about 80,000. While the UN recommends a ratio of one police officer for every 400 civilians, Kenya has only half as many officers that would be required to meet that. The Kenyan government has increased its security budget this year by 24% to $1.7bn (Â£1bn) from last year's $1.3bn. Part of that money is meant to employ 10,000 more police officers. In the meantime, the estimated 300,000 private security officers are supplementing efforts to make civilians feel safer. But not everyone can afford to pay for private security officers, and technology is a cheaper security solution. "[Many people] are looking for alarms so that our vehicles can respond in the event of a problem," says KK's James Omwando. The company's control centre is getting ever busier, he says, with the team monitoring phone calls and alarms going off at their clients' premises. A government bid to buy and install CCTV cameras in Nairobi and Mombasa has been riddled in controversy and is yet to be implemented. Most attacks have targeted the two major cities. Walking through the streets of the capital you see security officers standing at buildings' entrances frisking people using metal detectors. Female officers inspect women's bags and belongings while their male counterparts check the men. But security analyst George Musamali argues that the checks are not thorough enough. "When the item beeps, this person [should] remove what he's carrying," he says. "Then if it's a dangerous weapon, you're supposed to have been given the action on what you need to do once you've identified that this person is carrying a weapon or something that is dangerous. "You deny access, have him arrested, hand him to the police." He interprets the fact that there have been several attacks since security was improved to mean that the improved measures have not succeeded. "But let's give credit to them because so far most of the cases we've seen are that these grenades are being lobbed from outside the vehicles - they're being lobbed from outside supermarkets." So in a way, he says, they have helped deter more attacks. But security is still a concern for both locals and visitors. The daring siege of the remote agricultural town of Mpeketoni, an hour's drive from Lamu island, in June reinforced fears that the government had not done enough to maintain security. Partly as a result of that state of affairs, the country's growth projections for 2014 have been revised down by as much as 0.5% from 5.2%. For the security industry however, this is likely to mean more business.	A lot has changed in Kenya since the attack at the Westgate shopping mall a year ago.
The McLaren driver was already not going to race in F1 in 2017, with the team holding an option on him for the 2018 campaign. But speaking on Thursday, the 36-year-old Briton said: "I go into this weekend thinking it's going to be my last race. I think that's the best way. "At this moment in time, I don't want to be racing in F1 beyond this year." Button, world champion in 2009, made his debut at the age of 20 in 2000. Sunday's race will be his 305th grand prix start, with only Rubens Barrichello (322) and Michael Schumacher (306) having driven in more. He has won 15 F1 races, driving for Williams, Benetton, Renault, BAR, Honda, Brawn and McLaren. Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne is replacing Button at McLaren next year as team-mate to two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, whose contract runs out at the end of 2017, with Button acting as an ambassador for the team. "It is true that I have a contract in 2018 but, at this moment in time, I am not going to be racing in 2018," Button added. "The whole point of this [contract for 2018] was if, in three months' time, I had eaten myself stupid and I changed my mind. "But I don't want to go into this race thinking it's not my last race - and it is." Under his contract for 2017, Button is due to be McLaren's reserve driver and would race if either Alonso or Vandoorne are unable to for any reason. Media playback is not supported on this device He will do promotional work for McLaren and some work in the simulator and attend a minimum of four grands prix. "It's been a long journey since eight years old until now," Button added. "You get to Formula 1 with many dreams and hopefully you leave the sport with memories - some amazing memories, some life-changing, some good, some bad. To walk away with the world championship is very special, too. "I will definitely step away from F1 happy with what I've achieved and definitely my life starts now."	Former world champion Jenson Button says he will retire from Formula 1 after Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
The 27-year-old still had two years left on his existing deal but he has now committed himself to New Road for another season. He is the ninth player in five months to sign a new deal with Worcestershire, who will be back playing in County Championship Division Two in 2016. "It was very pleasing to see the other contract extensions," said Shantry. "It shows the level of morale at the club, even though we had a difficult year in Championship cricket. We've got a group of players here that are only going to improve." Shantry, Ed Barnard, Joe Clarke, Brett D'Oliveira, Tom Fell, Joe Leach and Charlie Morris have all signed for three years, England Lions man Ross Whiteley has signed for four years and Tom Kohler-Cadmore has agreed a two-year deal.	Worcestershire left-armer Jack Shantry has signed a contract extension with the relegated county until 2018.
Media playback is not supported on this device First or minor offences will result in either a warning, fine or order for a match to be played behind closed doors. Serious or repeat offences can now be punished by a points deduction, expulsion or relegation. Jeffrey Webb, head of Fifa's anti-racism task force, said the decision was "a defining moment". He added: "Our football family is fully aware that what is reported in the media is actually less than 1% of the incidents that happen around the world. "We've got to take action so that when we look to the next 20 or 50 years this will be the defining time that we took action against racism and discrimination." Fifa, world football's governing body, passed the anti-racism resolution with a 99% majority at its congress in Mauritius. Richard Conway, reporting for BBC Sport at the congress, said a concern was raised over those who voted against the tougher racism measures. "Former South African apartheid prisoner Tokyo Sexwale, now a Fifa member, urged congress to check cameras to see who voted against racism rules," he said. "Sexwale says (the) 1% vote against demonstrates how football still has to fight against racism." Webb said of the vote against the measures: "I would like to think it was a mistake but I'm glad it wasn't the other way. I'm glad only 1% went that way." Nonetheless, Fifa president Blatter accepted more must be done to eradicate racism. He said: "We need zero tolerance and strict punishments everywhere. We must lead. We must set a tough, uncompromising example. "We can make a difference. We can send a strong signal to the racists that their time is up." Fifa commissioned a task force to address the issue of racism after a friendly game between AC Milan and Pro Patria was abandoned due to racist chanting. Their verdict includes putting an official inside the stadium to identify potential acts of racism and ease the pressure on the match referee. The new rulings standardise punishment across the members, meaning federations will lose the power to impose their own judgements. Further to the regulations that relate to clubs or international teams, the new measures will see any individual who commits a racist offence banned from stadiums for a minimum of five matches. The five-match suspension is one that has been introduced by the Football Association, whose chairman David Bernstein sat on the task force in Mauritius. Also on the task force was Kevin-Prince Boateng, the AC Milan player who led the walk-off in the game against Pro Patria in January. Former England international striker Luther Blissett, an ambassador for anti-racism charity Show Racism The Red Card, admitted to reservations about the new measures. "You've got to applaud them for doing something about it, my thing is when they talk about the 'level' of racism," he told Radio 5 live. "To me, racism is racism. "Fifa have to let it be known where they are going to start this from. Any form of racism is serious enough for the bans to start, they should hit people hard straight away."	Teams could be relegated or expelled from competitions for serious incidents of racism after tough new powers were voted in by Fifa.
Division One leaders Middlesex, who were bowled out for 381 at Taunton to lead by 145, looked in charge when they reduced Somerset to 59-3 and 126-4. But Trescothick, who made 124, and Trego, still there on 115, shared 181 to leave the contest in the balance. Somerset closed on 348-6, an advantage of 203 runs. On a surface that has become easier for batting as the game has progressed, the outcome seems likely to rest on the length of time Trego spends at the crease on the final day. Somerset would perhaps want to post a target in excess of 250, while anything less would probably leave Middlesex as favourites. That the home side, who at one stage looked set to be defeated inside three days, are still in with a shout is down entirely to Trescothick and Trego. Opener Trescothick had seen Johann Myburgh bowled offering no shot to Harry Podmore and captain Chris Rogers shovel the same bowler to point for a duck. After James Hildreth was caught at slip from the off-spin of Ollie Rayner, Trescothick found some support from James Allenby, but when he mistimed a pull to mid-on, Somerset were still 19 behind. But Trescothick, playing characteristically powerful cover drives, and Trego, who capitalised as the Middlesex bowlers often dropped short, compiled their huge fifth-wicket stand to drag the hosts back into it. Trescothick's 48th Somerset hundred took him past Sir Viv Richards to second on the all-time list, while Trego completed his 14th first-class ton. Only when James Harris found some late energy did he have both Trescothick and Craig Overton caught behind, leaving Alex Barrow to accompany Trego to the close. Harris was earlier the last Middlesex wicket to fall, caught at slip off Tim Groenewald for 78, missing a maiden first-class hundred, just like James Fuller, who fell to the same combination for 93.	Marcus Trescothick and Peter Trego both made centuries to drag Somerset back into contention with Middlesex on day three of the County Championship match.

Compounding the trauma of personal loss they face a lonely battle to find and identify husbands, wives and children before trying to bring them home for burial. Mohammed Nowrouz Noori is an Afghan man in his late 30s but he is already a broken man. In January this year he set off with his wife Nilufar, son Mohammad and baby daughter Nastaran from the Turkish coast heading for Greece. "When we were boarding my son said 'Dad I have prayed that we reach to other side safely'," Nowrouz says as he recounts the tragedy at the family home back in Kabul. "We could see lights from Greece. I reassured him, saying 'tonight is the last night of our troubles'." But the boat arranged by people smugglers soon got into trouble and capsized. "In a matter of seconds water was everywhere, filling the boat. It was dark. I lost my children and my wife who had been sitting next to me," Nowrouz says. At least 39 migrants, including several children drowned that day. Nowrouz was among more than 60 rescued, What came next was a 12-day struggle to recover the bodies of his loved ones and bring them home for burial. Read more: The untold story of Europe's drowned migrants Anatomy of a shipwreck Nowrouz says he received medical treatment in a camp on the Turkish coast where police showed him photos of bodies which had been recovered. "I saw my family's pictures there," he says. "I saw the photo of my one-year-old daughter, my six-year-old son and my wife who was 25. I lost them." A police officer asked whether Nowrouz intended to bury his family in Turkey or take them home. After phoning relatives he decided the family should be buried in Kabul. The next day a minibus took Nowrouz and other survivors to Istanbul where he turned to the Afghan consulate for help. "They said that I have to repatriate the bodies myself," he says. At the Afghan consulate in Istanbul, Zia Zaki is one of those trying to cope with the fallout from the migrant crisis. "We have assembled a team of three people to deal specifically with refugee issues," he says as he sifts through piles of documents. "In the last incident I attended there where 25 Afghans who lost their lives at sea. I saw a child's body in the cold room. "I have my own small child. I tried to stay strong because it was my job to be there and identify the bodies. But when I returned home I looked at my child and I cried." Nowrouz spent days calling relatives back home. "I had to borrow money to repatriate my family back to Afghanistan," he says. The consulate told Nowrouz that the bodies of his wife and children were kept in Bursa, a town 300km (187 miles) inland from where the accident happened. He hired a car for the four-hour drive, leaving in the middle of the night. He also booked flights to Kabul for the following evening. But once in Bursa, he could find only the bodies of his wife and son; his baby daughter was missing. With flights arranged he had little choice but to leave her behind to be buried in one of Bursa's cemeteries. At Bursa's Kent cemetery, Imam Neshet Kaya performs the funeral rites for deceased migrants. "I just buried a child who has no name and we don't know who he was," he says. "He was buried here surrounded by me and a few cemetery workers. Today we are his brother, sister and his family." Whether he buried Nowrouz's daughter here is impossible to know. Many of the migrant victims are Muslim and the imam says he makes sure they are buried properly. "We go to hospital to pick up the body and bring it here to perform the Islamic rituals, washing them and wrapping them in a shroud," he says.  "Later we perform the prayers at the mosque." The cemetery keeps records of each grave together with available documents, photos or DNA records to allow possible identification and exhumation if a body is claimed at a later date. For Afghans taking a body home means travelling by air. In Bursa, Mr Nowrouz bought coffins for his wife and son, hired an ambulance and headed back to Ataturk airport for the flight to Kabul. At Istanbul airport, Sohila Shalizai runs the office of Afghanistan's Ariana airline - the tragedy of migrants' deaths has become overwhelming here too. "Lately we have been carrying at least two or three, even up to seven bodies on each flight," Ms Rizi says. "Sometimes we can't cope with the numbers of bodies that come to us and we have refer people to Turkish airlines. Sometimes most of our cargo is coffins." Her colleague, Khan Mohamad, says the airline has transported 70 bodies back to Afghanistan over the last 12 months. "I just returned from customs where I have processed another coffin which came from Izmir." Sometimes, Mohamad says, families don't have the money. "They lose it all when they capsize or the smugglers take it. Last time we sent four bodies to Afghanistan and the relatives still need to pay." Nilufar and Mohammad were buried the day they arrived back in Kabul. But even in grief the family is not united. "I wanted to bring my daughter's body to Afghanistan too", Nowrouz says, "but because the whole process took so long I couldn't find her." Compounding the heartbreak of losing his family, he now has debts to worry about as well. Having borrowed $8,500 to cover the costs of the ordeal, Nowrouz has been left bankrupt by a journey that already cost him everything.

Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: "I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it." The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: "The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. "They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other." Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: "My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. "This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. "He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind." Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.	A man has admitted killing his wife of 25 years while she slept.
Sir Bruce hosted Strictly for a decade until he stepped down last year. Last week, he was forced to pull out of presenting a BBC variety show after slipping and falling at his home. But the 87-year-old is expected to recover in time to co-host Strictly's Children In Need special, which will feature four stars from Call The Midwife, to be aired on 13 November. Actors Jenny Agutter, Laura Main, Stephen McGann and Jack Ashton will compete in the one-off contest as part of BBC One's Children In Need telethon. Children In Need will be hosted by Sir Terry Wogan, Tess Daly, Fearne Cotton, Rochelle Humes and Nick Grimshaw. The evening will also feature Harry Hill giving his own history of television, while The One Show's Matt Baker and Alex Jones will perform the lead roles in the West End version of The Rocky Horror Show. EastEnders pub The Queen Vic will host "a house band with a special guest lead vocalist" and stars including Ellie Goulding, Rod Stewart and Selena Gomez will be in the studio.	Sir Bruce Forsyth is to return to Strictly Come Dancing for a special Children In Need edition of the show.
Spencer Vaughan, 27, of Campbell Road, Plymouth, suffered spinal damage after hitting his head on a sand bar in Gran Canaria while on a training course. He is seeking damages from the MoD for not warning about the dangers of diving into shallow waters. Mr Justice Davis will give his ruling at a later date. Mr Vaughan, who comes from Cwmbran, South Wales, is now an incomplete tetraplegic following the accident in 2009 and gave evidence from his wheelchair at London's High Court. Mr Vaughan insisted he was "on duty" when he walked into the sea to "cool off", executing a shallow, surface dive as the waters reached waist height. Malcolm Sheehan QC, for the MoD, suggested to Mr Vaughan that he and his comrades were simply "chilling out" on the beach. "It is unrealistic to say that you were on duty because you had a free choice about how to spend your time", the barrister said. The QC referred him to "other accounts" which suggested that he "ran into the water and then carried out a Baywatch-style dive". Mr Vaughan agreed that he and his fellow marines were "relaxing and chilling out", but said their primary purpose was to exercise and to swim. Mr Vaughan said he had walked carefully into the water to avoid a young family in front of him. Mr Sheehan said he had "every sympathy" for Mr Vaughan's plight, but added: "On the facts of this case there is no basis for a finding of negligence on the part of the MoD." Mr Justice William Davis has now reserved his judgment on the case and will give his ruling at a later date.	A Royal Marine who is suing the Ministry of Defence for up to £8m, has denied that he broke his neck performing a "Baywatch-style" dive.
Navalny had denied the charges, saying the trial was politically motivated. The 37-year-old had been a leading campaigner against President Putin's United Russia party, and regularly blogged about corruption allegations. The EU said the verdict posed "serious questions" about the state of Russian law. The US said it was "deeply disappointed". Before he was handcuffed and led away, Navalny urged his supporters to continue his anti-corruption struggle, tweeting: "Don't sit around doing nothing." Navalny has previously said he would like to stand for president one day. He had recently registered his candidacy for the next mayor of Moscow, but his campaign team said that after the verdict he was withdrawing from the race, and called on his supporters to boycott the vote. By Oleg BoldyrevBBC News, Kirov Minutes after Judge Blinov started reading from the substantial sheaf of papers, it became evident the two defendants, Alexei Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, were going to be found guilty. Seasoned observers of this trial were just about able to pick up the judge's words. Others were bewildered by the hum-like reading. Entering the courtroom just before the verdict reading started, both defendants were far from gloomy. "Why sad faces?" quipped Navalny, walking past dozens of journalists and a row of cameras. Navalny has long acquired the skill of tweeting and blogging while interminable financial documents were read by prosecution, defence and, now, judge. Publishing his fiery comments on politics, corruption and the need to unite in opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime - that's one of the many things he won't be able to do from behind bars, waiting for the sentence to be appealed against. 'Explosion of anger' The BBC's Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford says that when the sentence was handed down, there were tears from Navalny's supporters and an explosion of anger on the social networking sites that he has used so effectively. Anti-Putin activist and former cabinet minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters the trial was "completely fabricated from start to finish, and even the judge could not say what the reason for the crime was". Other countries have also voiced their concern at the verdict. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, said: "We are deeply disappointed in the conviction of Navalny and the apparent political motivations in this trial." A spokesperson for the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the embezzlement charges were unsubstantiated, and that Navalny's jailing posed "serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia". French foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot added his concern, but said: "We note that not all judicial remedies have been exhausted and that the sentence could be reviewed on appeal." Navalny's supporters in Moscow have vowed to stage protests against the verdict later on Thursday. 'Almost inevitable' Navalny arrived at the courtroom in Kirov to hear the verdict after a 12-hour overnight train journey from Moscow. Our correspondent said Navalny smiled in a resigned manner when the almost inevitable guilty verdict came. His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband knew he would get a non-suspended sentence and was mentally prepared to go to prison. Navalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m rubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh. The prosecution had asked for a six-year jail sentence, but judge Sergei Blinov decided on five years, and said there were no extenuating circumstances that would warrant keeping Navalny out of prison. Navalny's co-accused, Pyotr Ofitserov, was also found guilty, and given a four-year jail sentence. "Navalny... committed a grave crime," said Judge Blinov as he delivered the sentence. State television has only shown limited interest in the process despite Navalny's prominence, but online the trial has been followed extensively. Mr Navalny came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin in December 2011. Profile: Alexei Navalny A thorn in Putin's side Judge Blinov said he found the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Vyacheslav Opalev, to be "trustworthy and consistent''. Navalny insists that Mr Opalev spoke against him out of revenge, because Navalny had recommended he be fired and his company investigated for corruption. After the verdict, Navalny tweeted: "So that's it. Don't get bored without me. Most importantly, don't sit around doing nothing. The toad won't get off the oil pipe by itself." In his LiveJournal blog on Wednesday Navalny said: "The current authorities are not a big, healthy fish, but rather a bloated fish or Latin American toad, which puffs itself up when it sees danger, with the help of television." In an unusual step, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live online. He is now one of the key figures of the opposition - a thorn in the side of the political establishment, campaigning against the endemic corruption, our correspondent says. Mr Navalny has also coined a phrase to describe the ruling party United Russia that has stuck in everyone's minds - "the party of crooks and thieves".	Russian protest leader Alexei Navalny has been jailed for five years, for embezzlement from a timber firm.
Bingham, who won the World Championship in 2015, reached the semi-finals of the 2016 event before being knocked out by eventual winner Ronnie O'Sullivan. The 39-year-old told BBC Essex he would play in this year's tournament if his wife gives birth before his first-round game against Joe Perry on Monday. "The only question I'd ask myself is if she actually went on the day," he said. "Obviously it could happen and even now I still haven't got an answer to that question. I'd have to talk it over with my wife and see where we go." Bingham, the current world number two, said his wife has been supportive in wanting him to play at the tournament, which gets under way on Sunday. He continued: "She's had two previous babies and she's been in labour for 10 hours, so obviously if that's the case then I've got a bit of time to 'pot some balls and hurry up' sort of thing. "As I say, we need to talk the next day or two because we thought it'd be out by now. "But being the stubborn Little Miss Bingham it's going to be, I think she's a bit too comfortable in my missus' belly."	Stuart Bingham may pull out of the Masters if his wife goes into labour with their third child.
Beat estimates 80% of those affected by eating disorders in the UK have misused laxatives in order to lose weight. It says supermarkets have done nothing to restrict sales of the medicine to young people. UK supermarkets say their sale of laxatives complies with regulation set by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. Beat says eating disorders most commonly develop during adolescence. Teens are turning to stimulant laxatives believing they can quickly lose weight, with some children known to be taking dozens of laxative pills on a daily basis, they say. Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death. Beat wants supermarkets and retailers to reduce the ease with which young people can buy laxatives in large quantities. The charity is calling for a minimum purchase age of 16, the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets, sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label on packets that states "this is not a weight loss product". The Dulcolax and Senokot tablets currently have age restrictions on the packets. Dulcolax states that the dosage instructions are for adults and children over 10, and children under 10 should consult a doctor before taking them. The Senokot packet advises the dosage instructions are for adults and children over twelve, and that children 6 years and older should consult a doctor before taking them. They do not recommend the drug for children under 6. Both and Dulcolax and Senokot say that they treat the issue of eating disorders very seriously and say they fully comply with all the legal requirements made by MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). "We've seen a 30% increase in calls to our help lines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way," Susan Ringwood, chief executive of Beat, told BBC Watchdog. "And that does include a significant number of young people as well," she added. Lottie Hall is 17 years old. She started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was 13 and now has long term damage from laxative abuse. "At first it would start with just a few, 4 or 5. Over time my body just got used to it and in the end I could be taking 20 to 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect. "It was a long time, probably about 3 years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it. "They'll be times where I'm out and all of a sudden it gets really uncomfortable and I have no control over it. "I was a school once and I was in the corridor and was crouching down and holding my stomach in agony and my friend found me and she asked me what was wrong and I had to tell her and it was a really embarrassing situation. "She actually had to tell my teacher and my teacher had to tell my mum." In 2009 Beat warned Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda that children were buying the medicine in large quantities. But the charity says nothing was done. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and according to research from Beat, 80% of those surveyed by the charity admitted that they had misused laxatives in order to lose weight. Dr Babu Vadamalayan, a paediatrician and gastroenterologist at Kings and St Thomas Hospital, told BBC Watchdog that the eating disorder unit at Maudsley Hospital say they see 140 under 18s with eating disorders every year and 10-15% of them are abusing laxatives. As part of an investigation, BBC Watchdog sent four 14-year-old actors into 25 branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Boots stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives. The actors were not stopped or questioned by staff in any of the stores, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets in each store. MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recognise the concern. The body says it has consulted independent experts and believes that restricting the sale of laxatives or reducing pack sizes would not be appropriate. However, it adds that it is working with manufacturers to get stronger warnings printed on products and will monitor their safety and take further action if necessary. Boots and the four supermarkets said that they fully comply with current government and MHRA regulations on selling laxatives. Sainsbury's and Boots added that they are retraining their staff to better identify signs of laxative misuse. You can see the full report on BBC Watchdog at 20:00 BST on Thursday 16 October.	The UK's leading eating disorder charity has called for the sale of laxatives to children to be more strictly regulated.
Female officers will be able to wear a headscarf under their caps or berets, provided it is plain and is the same colour as the uniform. Headscarf bans on university campuses and state institutions - except for the judiciary, military and police - have also been lifted in recent years. The garment has been controversial in Turkey for years. Secularists regard it as a symbol of religious conservatism. Since the 1920s, Turkey has had a secular constitution with no state religion. The opposition have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) of trying to reinterpret secularism. However, public debate has also evolved to accept the hijab as an expression of individual liberties, correspondents say. No strong opposition has been voiced against this latest move. President Erdogan has long embraced Turks' right to express their religious beliefs openly, but he says he is committed to secularism. In 2010, the country's universities abandoned an official ban on Muslim headscarves. Three years later, women were allowed to wear headscarves in state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police. That year, four MPs wore headscarves in parliament. Most people in Turkey are Sunni Muslims.	Turkey has lifted a ban on policewomen wearing the Islamic headscarf.
Now, the community is turning to introspection. Questions are being raised in the province around radicalisation and whether there is a climate of intolerance that needs to be addressed. On Monday, Alexandre Bissonette, a 27-year-old University of Laval student, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder. Police have not said what motivated the alleged attacker, who opened fire at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre during evening prayers. Quebec attack: Who were the victims? Quebec Muslims 'emotionally destroyed' Who is Alexandre Bissonnette? But there are reports that Mr Bissonette expressed anti-immigration and anti-feminist views online. Francois Deschamps, an official with an advocacy group, Welcome to Refugees, said the suspect was known for those views online. Vivek Venkatesh, a professor with Montreal's Concordia University who studies online hate and radicalisation, says social media creates "echo chambers", where more extreme views can gain traction. He says while Quebec is "still reeling" from the mosque shooting, it is important that there be a public debate in the province on how to prevent radicalisation and violent extremism in all its forms. Pierre Martin, a political science professor with the University of Montreal, says that it appears Mr Bissonette may have been influenced by a mix of global nationalist trends, the so-called "alt-right", and "currents within Quebec itself". Trump’s shock troops: Who are the ‘alt-right’? In the 1960s, Quebec shifted quickly from a highly religious society to a deeply secular culture. "People (now) tend to be critical of religion in general and how religion shapes people's social interactions," he said. He said Quebecers tend to reject overt displays of religion. For example, the province has debated in the past few years whether government workers should be allowed to wear clothing that showed their faith, like hijabs or turbans. Mr Martin said the current provincial Liberal government is seen as being overly permissive on the issue while the opposition "have tended to be criticised for seizing some currents of resentment and exploiting them for political purposes". But he says the fact that thousands of Quebecers attended candlelight vigils on Monday showed "that the large majority of people who may have even traces of reservations about ostentatious displays of religion in the public sphere are extremely tolerant of private observance". Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard echoed that on Tuesday, telling journalists that while "all societies live with demons and our society is not perfect", the majority of the province is open to newcomers. Still, many in Quebec City's Muslim community have said over that past two days that they have concerns about Islamophobia in the province. Amira Elghawaby, with the National Council of Canadian Muslims, says that in Quebec, recent debates around the niqab - like whether to ban the wearing of the face veil while offering or receiving public services - have been "toxic" and contributed to the mischaracterisation of Muslims as the "other."	The shock from Sunday night's deadly the Quebec mosque shooting is slowly waning.
Residents awoke from a night of colourful fireworks to find the city covered in a thick grey blanket of smog and authorities warned that pollution levels were critically high.	Diwali celebrations in the Indian capital Delhi have seen air pollution rise to hazardous levels after many firecrackers were set off.
Isobel Parker, 23, who was known as Becky, died at a property in Booth Place, Burnham-on-Crouch, on 17 July. Her mother described her as a "bubbly girl" and a "fantastic mother who adored spending time with her two precious children". Matthew Smith, 23, of Wood Corner Caravan Park in Maldon, has been charged with murder. He will next appear in court on 28 September. A post-mortem examination found Miss Parker had been strangled with a ligature. Her partner Shane said: "Becky was the best woman I could have ever wished to meet. "We were so looking forward to the birth of our first child together, a little girl, who we were going to name Charmaine."	The family of a pregnant woman who was strangled to death in Essex said she was "an absolute angel".
Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, left home in February to join the Islamic State (IS) group, and two of them are now married. The families are not identifying which of the girls have married. Tasnime Akunjee, who represents the families, says it "does not bode well" that those girls will now return. The Bethnal Green Academy pupils flew from Gatwick to Turkey on 17 February after telling their parents they were going out for the day. They later entered Syria and are thought to be in Raqqa, the self-styled capital of the so-called Islamic State. Mr Akunjee said the girls had contacted their families "some weeks ago" to tell them of the marriages, which took place "some time ago". He added: "The families learned that the girls were not together in Raqqa three months ago, and it was because two of them were married. "They are distraught, because it doesn't bode well for their return. The girls are starting to grow roots socially, and deep roots." Mr Akunjee said the men the girls married are in their 20s, but said it is not known whether they are IS fighters. However, the Guardian reports that the two schoolgirls married in ceremonies approved by IS authorities. The three girls had been studying for their GCSEs at the school in Tower Hamlets, east London - where they have been described as "straight-A students". A fourth girl from the school is believed to have travelled to Syria in December. Mr Akunjee also said a video published by the Daily Telegraph claiming to show the girls in Raqqa, in the care of a woman handler, is unlikely to be them. "The girls were not together at the time of the video," he said. "It's unlikely that they would have been under the aegis of the leader of a woman's centre."	The families of two east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria are "distraught" after learning they have married, their solicitor has said.
Environment body Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said staff were erecting temporary flood barriers and carrying out other prevention work. An amber "be prepared" warning for persistent rain is in place for Gwynedd, Conwy and Denbighshire. The Met Office said up to 15cm (6ins) of rain could fall in north Wales. A yellow "be ready" warning is also in place for Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham. NRW  has issued river flood alerts due to rising levels caused by continuous rain since Friday. It said people should be prepared for flooding and it was monitoring the Dyfi, Elwy, Conwy and Vyrnwy river catchments. Scott Squires, of NRW, said: "Our staff are out working putting measures in place to prepare for flooding. This includes erecting temporary flood barriers to protect areas at risk in St Asaph and Llanrwst."	Work is being carried out to try to prevent flooding in parts of north Wales as heavy rainfall is forecast to continue into Sunday.
26 January 2015 Last updated at 09:11 GMT The trees were part of an area known as 'Doggerland' which formed part of a much bigger area before it was flooded by the North Sea. It was once so big that hunter-gatherers who lived in the area could have walked to Germany, in Europe, across its land. The underwater forest was discovered by Dawn Watson and Rob Spray from Sea Search on a diving trip to study marine life. The prehistoric forest lay undiscovered until it was exposed by the extreme storms along the east of England coast in December 2013. Check out this underwater footage of the forest which experts believe could date back more than 10,000 years. Underwater diving footage is copyright and courtesy of Rob Spray and Dawn Watson.	Nature experts have discovered an amazing underwater forest thousands of years old under the sea close to the Norfolk coast in England.
Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised "lowlanders" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed "work in progress", has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called "new breed" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to "tame" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia. The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia. There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview. Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility. However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.	The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has thrown the populous Horn of Africa giant into a period of deep uncertainty and created a serious leadership vacuum in the region with profound geopolitical implications.
Ward was on loan with the Terriers from Liverpool in the Championship and does not want to leave after his penalty shoot-out heroics helped take them up. The 23-year-old's saves helped them beat Sheffield in the semi-final and Reading in the play-off final. "On a selfish point, yes, I would like to stay at Huddersfield," said Ward. "I am only young for a goalkeeper and to have a chance of playing week-in week-out in the Premier League would be good experience for someone of my age." Ward accepts Liverpool will decide his future as they contemplate a season in which they return to the Champions League, but he would prefer regular games with Huddersfield to the likelihood of sitting on the Reds' bench. "It's in the hands of Liverpool because ultimately I'm their player," said Ward. "They've got to decide what's best. "Liverpool have my contract and their needs come first, especially with the Champions League." Ward and his Wales team-mates are preparing for Sunday's 2018 World Cup Pool D qualifier against Serbia, but he is expected to be on the bench with Crystal Palace's Wayne Hennessey preferred. He will go into the game having been congratulated for his efforts with Huddersfield by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. "After the final he said, 'Congratulations and keep it up'," said Ward said. "His relationship with the Huddersfield manager David Wagner has been well documented and that's been good for me. "I know they were in constant contact and hopefully he (Klopp) has heard only good things."	Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward wants to remain at promoted Huddersfield after helping them rise into the Premier League.
He headed in Daniel Johnson's free-kick as Preston inflicted a first home defeat of the season on the Canaries. Norwich's Cameron Jerome hit the post with a volley moments after the goal and forced Chris Maxwell into a fine reflex save with the follow-up. Bailey Wright then cleared Alex Pritchard's header off the line as Norwich tried in vain for an equaliser. The win extended Preston's unbeaten run to seven games as they rose to ninth place in the Championship, while Norwich slipped from second place to fourth as they lost for just the third time this season. Maxwell  made a smart save from Jerome after just 14 seconds and Michael McGovern thwarted Jordan Hugill four minutes later. But neither side had another great chance until well into the second half as Pritchard's curling free-kick was deflected by a Preston defender and edged just past the angle of post and crossbar. Baptiste's powerful header proved to be the difference as he met a free-kick after Martin Olsson had unnecessarily fouled Callum Robinson by the corner flag. Norwich City boss Alex Neil: "It was really, really sloppy. We have defended set-pieces well all game and then we allow Baptiste to have a free run from a central area and head the ball in. "It was a very frustrating game for us because although we had a lot of the ball we didn't do enough with it. That is what can happen when five or six of your players aren't at their best. "We had a lot of possession, but that means nothing if you don't make full use of it. We needed to do more with the ball today. It was really disappointing." Preston manager Simon Grayson: "We defended really well and we also posed a threat to them as well and had plenty of chances over the course of the game. "It wasn't that long ago that we had lost six of the first seven and the some of the natives were getting a little restless. But since we lost 5-0 at Brentford the lads have knuckled down and put a good run together. "The confidence of the players is obviously high at the moment after the good results they have had but no-one is getting carried away." Match ends, Norwich City 0, Preston North End 1.

Having a baby is a joyous occasion for most women - but for one in 10, pregnancy and the period following childbirth can be anything but rosy. Depression, anxiety and stress can be the overriding feelings they experience and, if left untreated, the risk increases that they develop into serious psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, psychoses and eating disorders. The mental health of this group of women during pregnancy and after birth - whether the illness already existed beforehand or developed for the first time - has been of particular concern to mental health professionals for some time. Psychiatric disorders are the cause of 7% of all maternal deaths during pregnancy and the six months after the birth. So why are there still women falling through the net? Guidelines from NICE, the health watchdog, say women at risk of mental health problems should receive extra support at all stages of pregnancy, be provided with a care plan for their treatment and be offered advice on the safest and most appropriate drugs to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Research suggests providing this level of care will improve not only the long-term well-being of the mother but protect the child's emotional and physical development too. But the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA), which represents more than 70 organisations committed to improving the mental health of mothers and their infants, says this isn't happening in many areas of the country. Dr Alain Gregoire, consultant and honorary senior lecturer in perinatal psychiatry, and chair of the MMHA, says this failure is costing lives. Suicide is an increased risk for women with serious perinatal psychiatric disorders, he says. And then there's the cost to society, he points out, of Â£8bn a year in lost earnings and NHS care. He says: "It's a very critical time in women's lives and it's important to get it right." The inquest heard that Ms Bevan stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication some time before the birth of her daughter because she wanted to breastfeed. Dr Gregoire says decisions like this should be part of a care plan agreed in advance and need not be a major issue, he adds. "There are many medication options available with no evidence of risk to the baby, whereas there is clear evidence that women being unwell is not good for mother or baby." Stopping medication suddenly is never advised and can be avoided because there are always other effective treatment options, he says. Rachael Jones felt no connection with her pregnancy and no happiness at the thought of son's arrival five years ago. She had always wanted children but she didn't tell anyone how she was feeling because she didn't understand the feelings herself. "No-one asked me how I was feeling. There wasn't an opportunity to talk about it, no invitation to chat about it from anyone I saw." It was only after the birth that Rachael admitted to a health visitor that she felt detached, lonely and depressed. She had experienced suicidal thoughts too. During a 12-month wait for talking therapy on the NHS, she relied on family and friends to help her get through each day with postnatal depression. And, in the meantime, she set up a charity dedicated to pre and postnatal depression advice and support, called the PANDAS Foundation. She says the Charlotte Bevan inquest demonstrates how important it is for pregnant women to be able to talk about their mental health. Rachael wants communication between health professionals to improve so that women like her are properly supported during pregnancy. She also believes doctors and midwives need a better understanding of mental health so that they can ask the right questions and offer support at the right times. If or when a pregnant woman's mental health deteriorates, the guidelines state that all women with a child under a year old should be offered a place in one of the 17 specialist psychiatric care mother and baby units in the UK. But a map of these dedicated mother and baby units, with an average of eight beds per unit, show that some areas such as the south, south-west and east of England, and Wales, are noticeably underserved. Another map of specialist community perinatal mental health teams across the UK shows there is a very patchy service, with most areas having an extremely basic level of provision, or none at all. However, Alistair Burt, Minister of State for Community and Social Care, said perinatal mental health was a strong priority for the government and it was investing Â£75m over the next five years "to help drive improvements". "Since 2010 the number of in-patient mother and baby units which specialise in caring for women during the perinatal period has almost doubled and we have trained more than 600 perinatal mental health visitor champions." The Royal College of Midwives has said that more midwives with specialist training in mental health are needed to work with at-risk women. But this relies on GPs, midwives and health visitors recognising that their patients are suffering in the first place. NHS England estimates that around 3% of women who give birth each year will be referred to psychiatric services and 1% will need specialised care in a mother and baby unit. That's 6,700 women with serious mental illnesses who need specialist help. They are at one end of a wide spectrum of mental illnesses which can affect pregnant women - ranging from mild to severe. Rachael did not take any medication for her condition. All she wanted was to speak to someone else who felt the way she did, so she could feel normal. Instead, she suffered in silence.	The family of Charlotte Bevan, whose body was found in the Avon Gorge with her four-day old daughter, has called for a dedicated service which looks after women with serious mental health problems before, during and after childbirth.
Steven Walters, 48, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault at Stafford Crown Court in September. Chief Constable David Thompson said the case represented "one of the worst violations of policing integrity I've ever seen". Walters was also found guilty of gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing on Monday and dismissed from the force. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country The crimes took place between February and April 2015. Walters, who was based at Sutton Coldfield, approached a woman in her 20s, who he offered a lift home in his patrol car in the early hours. After a colleague asked the woman "what she was doing at that time of night in that dress", Walters placed his hand on her thigh when she was in the car, leaving the victim feeling "creeped out". In the second assault, the court heard he touched the victim under her skirt in her own home while her children were in other rooms. He attempted to kiss her face and neck, and also asked to be taken to a bedroom. Sentencing, Judge Paul Glenn said Walters had shown no remorse, adding: "The public are entitled to have faith in police officers and to trust them in the discharge of their powers and responsibilities. "You exploited that trust and you have brought disgrace on yourself and indeed the force you served." Derrick Campbell, from the Independent Police Complaints Commission, praised the victims for their "courage and bravery" in reporting his crimes. "[Walters] completely abused his position of trust by targeting and taking advantage of vulnerable women for his own sexual gratification," he said.	A West Midlands police officer who admitted sexually assaulting two women has been jailed for four years.
Charlene Walker, 36, suffered a single stab wound at the Darlington home of Julie Gowling in December. The 44-year-old tried to cover up the killing and dispose of the weapon, a kitchen knife, by burying it in a garden, Teesside Crown Court heard. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told the mother-of-four she must serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The court heard Gowling, who had denied murder, got into a heated argument with Ms Walker - a known drug user - over the missing cash on 6 December. It ended when Gowling lost her temper and stabbed Ms Walker in the chest. She then fled the house and tried to dispose of the knife. The court was told Ms Walker died as a result of massive blood loss. After the hearing, Det Supt Dave Ashton, of Durham Police, said: "Our condolences go to the family of Charlie Walker who, since her death have shown nothing but dignity and courage. "Ms Walker had a difficult life in many ways but the extreme act of violence which ended her life was not justified during an argument over a relatively trivial matter."	A woman who stabbed her lodger during a row over a missing £21 has been jailed for her murder.
Petersen was still there at the close on 105, with captain Steven Croft on 34, as the Division One leaders ground out 298-3 from 96 overs in the day. Teenager Haseeb Hameed fell 11 short of a second successive Championship ton on 89, while Luke Procter made 45. But the unbroken century stand between Petersen and Croft put Lancs on top. Having so far put on exactly 100, they will resume on Monday with a third batting bonus point looking a formality - and 14 overs to get a fourth. But, if they maintain their current pace of scoring, the Division One leaders will not reach 400 by the time the all-important 110-over mark is reached. Hameed followed up his maiden first-class hundred against Warwickshire at Old Trafford last week by taking almost five hours over his 89. But it was surpassed by the 41st hundred of 35-year-old South African Test player Petersen's first-class career. Lancashire cricket director and head coach Ashley Giles told BBC Radio Manchester: "We weren't quite sure what to do when we first turned up this morning. The pitch had a green tinge to it but in the end we decided to toss up and to opt to bat. "We knew that pitches at Lord's have been good in recent times so we went with that, and it worked out well for us. "Both Alviro Petersen and Haseeb Hameed batted extremely well. We are very lucky to have a number of youngsters who have come into the team and are performing well but we also need our senior players to pull their weight and Alviro did that. "We did not expect to be leading the First Division at this stage ,but there is a long way to go."	Alviro Petersen made his second County Championship century of the summer to spearhead a solid day's batting by Lancashire against Middlesex at Lord's.
The film, Caste on the Menu Card, was the only film among the 35 sent to India's information and broadcasting ministry to be refused clearance. Festival director Manoj Mathews told BBC Hindi he was "disturbed and disappointed" by the decision. Ministry officials said they were "not provided with adequate information". Mr Mathews said: "There were documentaries showcased on this platform which dealt with more controversial issues than this and we have had no problem." The documentary was filmed by five students from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. "The documentary is about how caste works in the meat industry. How it's a livelihood question for workers of the industry. We are talking about social exclusion, we are talking about caste," Atul Anand, one of the students who made the documentary, told BBC Hindi. "We are shocked and upset. We made this documentary between August and September 2014, before beef was banned in Maharashtra. "We took almost three months to make this documentary and it was sparked by a row on our campus in 2014 after some students demanded that beef and pork be banned," Mr Anand said. Mr Mathews told the Indian Express newspaper that information and broadcasting ministry officials had told him that "due to the current political situation over the beef ban issue they have not give exemption permission for this particular documentary". However ministry officials told the newspaper that they had not received "adequate information" about the film and were willing to reconsider the decision if they got the required information. In another incident, reports from the north Indian state of Haryana indicated that an editor of a state government publication was sacked because of an article that said beef was nutritious.	A documentary on beef eating habits in India has been withdrawn from a Delhi film festival for "technical" reasons, its organisers have said.
Tidal energy specialist Nova Innovation said this was the first offshore tidal array in the world to deliver electricity to the grid. Two 100kW turbines have been installed so far in the Shetland Tidal Array at Bluemull Sound. The blades for the turbines were made by Shetland Composites. Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation said tidal energy was a "long-term source" of predictable renewable power, with the turbines generating to full power across all tidal conditions. Simon Forrest, managing director of Nova Innovation, said: "We are absolutely delighted to be the first company in the world to deploy a fully operational tidal array." Mr Forrest said the deployment of the second turbine showcased the technology. The UK Carbon Trust estimates a Â£126bn global tidal energy market could be developed by 2050. WWF Scotland said the turbines were another "major milestone" on Scotland's journey to becoming a "fully renewable nation". The charity's director in Scotland, Lang Banks, added: "With some of the most powerful tides in Europe, Scotland is well placed to lead in developing this promising technology, which will help to cut climate emissions and create green jobs right across the country." Jenny Hogan, director of policy at Scottish Renewables, said: "Scotland is already at the forefront of capturing power from the tides and waves, and Nova's latest news demonstrates that lead is well-deserved. "The country is already home to some of the most advanced marine energy technologies anywhere, as well as the European Marine Energy Centre: arguably the most advanced marine energy proving site in the world. "With companies like Nova and others all working on developing this cutting-edge technology, the sector holds huge promise for the future."	Turbines installed off the coast of Shetland could herald a "new era" in tidal energy, according to the company running the project.
Mole Valley Council will get Â£21m from the developer Barratt Homes if the proposals go ahead. Nearly 2,800 people have signed a petition against the sale of the allotments. Campaigners say schools and doctors surgeries are "already full". Council leader Chris Townsend said the plans would provide more housing and financial support for council services. There are more than 100 plots at the Barnett Wood Lane allotments. The authority has said more than 100 allotment holders would get new plots and is suggesting a split site with allotments on both the Leatherhead and Ashtead sides of the M25. Linda Weller, from the Leatherhead Poors' Allotment Society, who organised the petition, said the council had tried to address most of the issues the society had raised. "We do still have issues with what we're being offered, " she said. "We need time to go and assess both sites but we're slightly relieved that we're not going to the awful site that they originally dumped us on." She said wildlife, including at least one badger sett, would be disturbed. Allotment holder David Wells said local schools and doctors surgeries were already "rammed full" and that the roads were "a nightmare at the moment". He added: "As a resident for over 60 years I've looked out at the allotments and now to be faced with 500 houses and the development prior to that, well it's not good news." The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) Surrey said it would continue to campaign to protect green belt land and open spaces. "We are extremely disappointed by Mole Valley Council's determination to dispose of a vital community asset and to allow building on adjacent green belt fields," the spokesman said. "[The council's] approach to the Barnett Wood Lane site indicates a failure to think strategically about the role of Mole Valley's countryside and green belt. "It also shows a woeful disregard for the needs of local people."	Five hundred homes could be built on allotments and green belt land next to the Leatherhead bypass in Surrey.
Andre Andre gave Porto the lead, volleying in after Asmir Begovic pushed away Yacine Brahimi's effort. Midfielder Willian equalised on the stroke of half-time with a superb free-kick from the edge of the area. Maicon put the home side ahead again with a flicked header at the front post, before Diego Costa rattled the bar with a curling shot. Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas and Pedro both forced Spain team-mate Iker Casillas - making a record 152nd appearance in the competition - into saves early on. But despite their early pressure, and a late penalty claim for a handball by Ivan Marcano, they came away from the Estadio do Dragao with nothing. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho surprisingly left out last year's PFA player of the year Eden Hazard, who has struggled for form this season. On-loan striker Radamel Falcao failed to even make the bench against his and Mourinho's former team. Meanwhile, Brazil midfield duo Willian and Ramires - who both came on and scored in the 2-2 draw against Newcastle at the weekend - were named in the starting side, as was striker Diego Costa, currently serving a domestic suspension. But it was in defence that the Blues looked to have the biggest problems when the Portuguese league leaders - who won the competition when Mourinho was in charge in 2004 - went ahead six minutes before half-time. Full-back Branislav Ivanovic's indifferent season continued when he was too easily beaten by Algerian Brahimi in the lead-up to Andre's goal. Mourinho described his side's first-half performance against the Magpies as "minus one out of 10" and this tie looked to be heading the same away until Willian levelled with a curling free-kick. Chelsea have conceded the second most goals (14) in the Premier League this season and Jolen Lopetegui's Porto underlined the London club's problems at the back as Maicon lost his marker to reach a near-post corner and head past Begovic. Danilo also hit the post from another set piece. Media playback is not supported on this device Toiling in 15th place in the defence of their Premier League title, eight points behind leaders Manchester United, Mourinho's side have now suffered five defeats in 11 games in all competitions this season. The Portuguese manager has had disagreements with the media and differences with his coaching staff as his team have stuttered so far domestically - and Mourinho's troubles appeared to have spilled over into Europe. Mourinho's side easily defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 4-0 in their opening group game and Chelsea might have taken a point from a hardworking Porto side. But they saw efforts either hit the woodwork or deflected wide, while Marcano appeared to handle the ball in the area. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho: "We watch dozens and dozens of repetitions of Porto taking corners. We were completely ready for that and in a moment when the game is under control we concede a goal that is ridiculous. "They hit the post from a similar mistake. Apart from that, the game was balanced. Two ridiculous moments and we were punished." Porto coach Julen Lopetegui: "The players attitude was amazing, spectacular. It was our best performance of the season. I have to congratulate my team. This three points are totally deserved. It was tough and unfair to go to the dressing room at half-time with a draw, but we reacted well."

Rachel Fee, 31, and her partner Nyomi Fee, 28, are accused of murdering the two-year-old in March 2014 at a house near Glenrothes, Fife, and ill-treating two other boys. The two women deny all the charges against them. Jurors immediately asked for a break after watching the 12-minute film. The video was shown to the jury at the High Court in Livingston. It showed Liam lying on the floor of his bedroom in his pyjamas, covered in a duvet. The video was taken by detectives in the early hours of 23 March 2014. The court had previously heard paramedics arrived at the house just after 20:00 the previous evening. The video showed each room of the house where the toddler lived with Rachel and Nyomi Fee. There was a cot in the room, alongside a buggy and pictures of Liam on the wall. Later, Police Constable Sam Girdwood, 24, told the trial he and his partner were called to the house after receiving a report a baby was in cardiac arrest and may have been strangled by a young boy. Pc Girdwood said he arrived and Rachel Fee was standing with the boy who she and Nyomi are accused of falsely blaming for Liam's death. He said: "She had a hold of the young boy and told him to tell me what had happened. He mumbled something that sounded like 'I strangled him'." The officer said he took the boy into a separate room from the women where he repeated the claim, and brought it up later at Glenrothes police station. He said: "He wanted to tell me what happened. He put his hand up in the air to say he had done this to (Liam). He went on to say something along the lines of (Liam) was getting more attention than him." Both accused, who are originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, also wept as the video was played to the jury. The couple are accused of murdering Liam and attempting to defeat the ends of justice by blaming the killing on a young boy. They are also charged with a catalogue of allegations that they neglected Liam and abused two other children, one of whom they blame for killing Liam, while in their care over a two-year period. They deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.	Members of the jury in the Liam Fee murder trial wept as they were shown a police video of the toddler's body hours after he was found dead.
Hampshire, who chose to bowl, had Essex 0-1 when Nick Browne was caught off the bowling of Fidel Edwards. Rain then caused a lengthy delay, but Cook (114 not out) and Westley (111) dominated when play resumed. Kyle Abbott finally ended their stand, bowling Westley with the last ball of the day as Essex closed on 243-2. England opener Cook's ton was his second of the season, with the former Test captain averaging 81.75 with the bat through five first-class innings this season. He was ably supported by Westley, whose century was his first of the season in first-class cricket. Hampshire could take few positives from a difficult first day, especially after a shoulder injury to fast bowler Edwards, but Abbott's late removal of Westley will leave them with some hope of limiting the hosts' score. Essex batsman Tom Westley: "It's good to get that first score out of the way. That first Championship hundred of the season is always nice. It was tough going, but it's pleasing to get some runs. What's most pleasing is the position we're in after being put in to bat. "We would have wanted to bowl first in those conditions. It did nip around in the first hour and a half. It's a good cricketing wicket, but there is definitely a bit in it for the bowlers, but also if they miss their length you feel you score. "I don't think Cookie will mind me saying we both played and missed. On another day you can nick them and we can be 100 for three or four. But sometimes you have to ride the luck and Cookie's was a chanceless hundred. They bowled well at him, so it wasn't easy going. It's great having him at the other end. He just loves scoring runs. He's a huge asset for the club." Hampshire coach Craig White: "We'll assess Fidel Edwards' injury in the morning, but it looks a bit sore and he'll struggle to take a further part in the game. "Every game it seems this year we've had a bowler go down. It's not ideal, it's just frustrating. Injuries happen I know but when it happens every game and you're a bowler down you wonder if you're doing something wrong." "It was a frustrating day. At the start we wouldn't have thought they'd only be two wickets down at the end of play. I'm a little bit shocked really. It was great conditions to bowl in and we probably early on didn't get enough balls consistently in the right areas. But you have to take your hat off to those two. They played really well."	Alastair Cook and Tom Westley both hit centuries as Essex took charge on a rain-affected first day against Hampshire in the County Championship.
The 10-year-old son of Crown Prince Frederik was saved last Thursday by a lifeguard on the popular Gold Coast strip, 7News reports. He was reportedly pulled from the surf at Mermaid Beach after being caught in a rip current. The lifeguard, Nick Malcolm, was personally thanked by the Crown Prince. Danish officials played down the incident on Monday, insisting the prince was at no point in danger. But Stuart Keay, Mr Malcolm's supervisor, told reporters the young prince might well have died without the lifeguard's intervention. "We got him before it got too serious but he wouldn't have come back in," Mr Keay said. Another colleague said the lifeguard was completely unaware of the boy's identity and was not used to all the subsequent attention.	Prince Christian, the second in line to Denmark's throne, has been rescued after getting into trouble in the waves at an Australian beach, reports say.
Patients on two wards at University Hospital Llandough are suffering from the illness, which can pass quickly from person to person. The hospital said the spread of the virus would be limited if people made only absolutely necessary visits. Cardiff and Vale health board said it was asking people to be "sensible". Chief operating officer Alice Casey said: "Many people will have the norovirus bug at this time of year - we see it every year and, for most people, it will be unpleasant but not serious. "But when norovirus spreads in hospitals, where patients are already unwell and are in close proximity to each other on wards, the effects can be more serious." Norovirus is a highly contagious virus which causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. The symptoms begin about 12 to 48 hours after infection and usually last for between 12 and 60 hours.	Visitors have been asked to stay away from a Vale of Glamorgan hospital because of an outbreak of norovirus.
Between them, the 66 state-school pupils will receive scholarships worth $17m (Â£12m) from US universities. The numbers of UK students in US universities has risen each year since tuition fees rose in England in 2012. US ambassador Matthew Barzun praised the value of such "interconnectedness". Mr Barzun said that such educational exchanges between the US and the UK allowed students to see beyond unrealistic "exaggerations" and "caricatures" of each others' cultures. "It's a chance to see each other in three dimensions, not in caricature form," he told the BBC. "It might not always be pretty, it's not always perfect, that's what makes the special relationship live." But the strength of the special relationship between the US and the UK depended on accepting differences and looking outwards to the world. Mr Barzun said Churchill's 1946 "sinews of peace" speech that introduced the phrase "special relationship" had been about the importance of international cooperation in difficult times. "There is strength in diversity, there is a real cost to cutting connections and putting up walls," said the ambassador. Mr Barzun said cooperation did not mean always having to agree or be the same. "One of my least favourite diplomatic expressions is 'no daylight between us'," he said. "It's usually said in an earnest tone. "In most cases it's a ludicrously high standard for cooperation and doesn't account for what makes a relationship special. "Think of two soldiers, shoulder to shoulder, there is plenty of daylight between them. Or FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and Churchill sitting on a bench, there is literally a space - and that daylight is healthy. "We shouldn't try and paper over little differences. "There's strength in that. That's what networks look like." Mr Barzun also mentioned that when his term as ambassador finishes this year he will take back two favourite words from the UK to the US - "sorted" and "gutted". There are 10,700 UK students in US universities - up by about 16% since tuition fees were increased in England to Â£9,000. But the project run by the Sutton Trust education charity wants these international opportunities to be available to poorer students and those from families where no one has previously gone to university. Of those who will be starting in US universities this autumn, the Sutton Trust says, 83% will be the first generation in their family to go to university. Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said the scholarships meant that many of these students could graduate without any debts. And he hoped more young people in the UK would "realise that a university education in America is well within their grasp". J Jeffry Louis, chairman of the US-UK Fulbright Commission, which supports the scheme, said: "This remarkable achievement demonstrates that American universities value the diverse talent, ambition and academic potential of the most deserving British state school students. "Our special educational relationship crosses the Atlantic in both directions." An additional summer school project run by the Sutton Trust will take 150 state-school students, selected from 1,200 applicants, to visit US universities.	A project helping disadvantaged UK pupils go to US universities has seen undergraduates accepted for courses starting in September 2016 at all of the prestigious Ivy League colleges.
Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012 at their London Street property. Sibery pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. The court heard that when Mrs Sibery decided to confront her husband because of his erratic behaviour, the GP admitted he had been using the narcotic for two months. She told him if he did not quit his addiction, she would end his marriage to him. But despite the ultimatum, Sibery managed to persuade his wife into taking what was supposed to be his final fix. The court heard how Sibery wanted his wife to experience the feeling he got when he took the heroin. However, Mrs Sibery collapsed and started having difficulties breathing. The court also heard that Sibery, who was on bail for the offence, was now in the care of a consultant psychiatrist who was helping him to tackle his problems, and that he and his wife were still together. Sheriff Jarvie told Sibery that she would pass sentence on him at a hearing next month.	A drug-addicted doctor watched his wife lose consciousness and struggle for breath moments after injecting her with heroin in Edinburgh, a court has heard.
It will be available to 1.7bn people on the platform worldwide via Rooney's and the Manchester United Facebook pages. Proceeds will be distributed to Rooney's four chosen charities. The game at Old Trafford, between Rooney's only two professional clubs, marks his 12 years' service at United. Rooney said: "I am delighted my testimonial game will be streamed globally, which will hopefully raise awareness and increase donations." It is expected to mark the first home appearances for Jose Mourinho's three summer signings; Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Eric Bailly. Manchester United's Facebook page has more than 70 million 'likes', while Rooney's has more than 25 million.	Wayne Rooney's testimonial match between Manchester United and Everton on Wednesday will make history as the first ever game between Premier League teams to be streamed live on Facebook.
Organisers of the Magical Journey, at The Belfry Golf Club, near Sutton Coldfield, said they had "no alternative" after a "key financial backer dropped out". The attraction closed temporarily after receiving hundreds of complaints on its opening day last month. Ticket-holders have been advised to contact their banks for refunds. In a message posted on the attraction's website on Monday night, bosses apologised to those who had bought tickets. "After all we've been through having to shut down in the final week is devastating," they wrote. "However, today a key financial backer has dropped out leaving us in the lurch. We have tried desperately over the last few hours to find a replacement but to no avail." The attraction had been due to operate the event until Christmas Eve. Llewelyn-Bowen, who said he only found out about the closure via Twitter, said he was shocked at the news. "I was really impressed with the way they addressed all the issues the first time around and the energy and resources that went into it so I'm extremely surprised the towel's been thrown in at this stage," he said. His contribution had only been "some design concepts" and he had not backed the project financially, he added. "I feel very much I was the designer and I'm a very public face so people are cross with me," he said. Helen Blakemore, from Aldridge in the West Midlands, visited the Magical Journey on Monday night with daughters Lucy, eight, and Molly, 11. She said it had been "very busy" and there was "no indication" of any problems. "There were lots of helpers, lots of happy elves," she said. "It was wonderful. The kids thoroughly enjoyed meeting Santa." Other customers took to Facebook to express frustration at the short-notice cancellation. Tracy Peach said it was "so unfair for families who have paid for their children to go." "How awful to have to tell them at this point that Santa won't see them," she wrote. Louise Tanner branded the attraction "the tragic journey" and said she had received an email on Monday night advising her of the closure. The Belfry's managing director Lynn Hood said the resort had not charged operator Magical Journeys for using its land. She said because the firm was a start-up company the hotel had not asked for payment. "We genuinely thought they would create a magical journey," she said. "We're shocked and very saddened at what's happened." "We were given no prior warning." The event closed for three days last month, after dissatisfied customers branded the top price of Â£22.50 for a children's ticket a "rip-off". Some reported seeing elves smoking and criticised the poor quality of gifts handed to children. Event director Paul Dolan admitted bad weather had hampered first-day preparations and it had not been ready to open.	A much-criticised Christmas attraction designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has closed down permanently.
Forster, who rejoined the club in July after 22 games on dual registration at Haven earlier in his career, replaces sacked James Coyle. He began his career at Saints, winning the academy Grand Final there, but was limited to five senior appearances. "This appointment will lift everybody," general manager Amanda Hewer said. The ex-Salford forward takes charge after a season which saw Haven relegated from the Championship, despite winning three of the final five games in the Super 8s.

Former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner assesses the victors' performance in Sunday's Scottish League Cup final, while former Aberdeen and Scotland defender Willie Miller gives his marks out of 10 for Derek McInnes' side. Didn't do too much wrong, couldn't do anything about the goals. Not over-worked, but Celtic had a number of other chances. Not the worst. In second-half, he came more to life in terms of getting forward, which is a big part of his game. In team for his height and domination but didn't dominate his opponent or take responsibility for closing gap between defence and midfield. Use of the ball was poor. Probably his poorest performance for Aberdeen - uncertain, played too deep. He didn't close down James Forrest quickly enough for the second goal and conceded the penalty for the third. Must be disappointed, because he's looked good since coming to the club Wasn't exposed on too many occasions against Patrick Roberts. Did have the chance with a header and maybe should have done better with it. Moved to centre-back later, his preferred his position. Didn't play to the standard he's capable of. Not the worst in midfield. Tried hard but played in an area that was dominated by Celtic. Only got close to Celtic's midfielders on a couple of occasions and should have made it more difficult for them. An opportunity as captain to lift the trophy. He normally gives you an element of control in midfield but didn't do that. The gap between him and his defence was too wide, allowing Roberts, Rogic and Forrest to get in behind. Largely anonymous in the first-half. Spent his time worrying about defensive duties rather than what he's good at. Turned it around in second half and had a number of good runs, but he's a match winner and he didn't show what he was capable of. Celtic dominated in midfield and McLean must take responsibility. He's been at the club long enough to know what's expected, should be performing to a high level and on the big stage. If you want to be an international, you have to perform better. Whenever he got on the ball, you felt, if anything was going to happen creatively, it was going to come through him. He was taken out the game on two or three occasions and Celtic players realised he was the main threat. Not the Adam Rooney I know. Didn't do much in terms of causing a threat to the two centre-backs, who handled him extremely well. He needed to work harder to make it difficult for them but had little support. Should be a goal threat but didn't do that. Won a couple of headers, but his timing was out at times after coming on for O'Connor. Expect more from a player like him. With Hayes, who he replaced, he's the quality in terms of creativity and didn't create anything. Barely touched the ball after taking over from Rooney. Hard when coming on at 3-0 down. Had that save from Andrew Considine's first-half header but didn't have much else to do. To force his way back into the side and win a medal, you have to give him great credit. Fairly comfortable at right-back, as steady as always, and was in control defensively. Was probably the pick of the back four. Stepping out, he made the opening goal. Passed the ball well throughout. Strong, powerful figure at the back. Was never put under significant pressure. Attacked the by-line as always and delivered an early cross for Moussa Dembele to head on target. Man of the match, dominated proceedings, looked in control and showed flair at times. Won a tackle with O'Connor that probably put paid to the defender for the next five or 10 minutes. Led by example. Solid display, worked very hard, not over-spectacular and should have scored at the end after getting himself into a great position. Always capable of doing something in the game. An attacking threat throughout. He plays the position well and scored the opening goal. Scored Celtic's second goal, laid on a couple, won the penalty for the third. I asked the question before, could he step up? And I think he did. Probably Celtic's quietest player. Wasn't involved as much as he would have wanted to be. Probably the quietest we've seen him but still scored his goal. Not as sharp as he normally is but led the line well. Did what he had do after coming on for Roberts. Kept it nice and solid in midfield. Another who did his job well and kept the performance ticking over after coming on for Rogic. Didn't have much time to impress as a late sub for Forrest but didn't do anything wrong. Pat Bonner and Willie Miller were talking to BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson.	Celtic cruised to a 3-0 win over Aberdeen at Hampden Park as Brendan Rodgers secured his first trophy as the Scottish Premiership leaders' manager.
Police had appealed for witnesses to an incident in the town's Agnew Crescent on Saturday evening. However, a short statement said a 23-year-old man had now been arrested and charged with wasting police time. It added that they were not looking for anyone in respect of the original alleged robbery.	A man has been charged with wasting police time following inquiries into an alleged assault with intent to rob in Stranraer.
After going down to 12 men, following Ben Flower's red card, Wigan scored 21 unanswered points to triumph. The Warriors have lost the past two Super League deciders at Old Trafford. "We will take a lot of confidence coming into the back end of the year when confidence is important going into big games," Smith said. Victory when the Catalans Dragons visit the DW Stadium next week would guarantee Wigan a home semi-final, while their hopes of clinching the League Leaders' Shield are slim as Warrington travel to second-placed Hull FC. Warrington only need a draw to win the first piece of Super League silverware this season. "We are looking just to win the game next week. Whatever comes of it, being first or second, gets us a home semi and that is what we want," Smith told BBC Radio Manchester. "We want to get to Old Trafford and want to win. We've had a disappointing couple of years, and it is all about progressing now and putting in a performance next week." If Wigan do reach the final for a fourth successive season, they may be without Flower after his elbow on Declan Patton saw him sent off with 23 minutes remaining on Friday. It was the prop's first dismissal since receiving an early red card in Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens in 2014. A man down and with the League Leaders' Shield being made ready for presentation to Wolves, the visitors produced a remarkable turnaround from 28-14 down in the second half. Josh Charnley touched town twice and Lewis Tierney completed a brace of his own before Smith edged Wigan ahead with a drop goal. Anthony Gelling's late try put the result beyond doubt. "As soon as we got the first try when Benny got sent off I think the belief was there to go on and do something special," Smith said. "When you come to stadiums like this and get results like that, it gives you a massive lift."	Wigan have the confidence to go on and win the Super League Grand Final after overcoming leaders Warrington on Friday, says half-back Matty Smith.
The woman, aged in her 20s, was attacked after leaving the event's Chinawhite enclosure early on Sunday, with men she met there. She walked with them to the Harpsden Road and Reading Road area and was raped outside a car, which the men then drove off in. A passerby found the victim near the Three Horseshoes pub shortly after. Daniel Grist, secretary of the regatta, said: "We have been liaising with Thames Valley Police, regarding this terrible incident, which took place after Regatta facilities had closed and racing had finished for the day on Saturday 1 July. "The Chinawhite area is not located on land managed by Henley Royal Regatta but we will continue to assist Thames Valley Police and are working with them to secure CCTV footage to assist in identifying the perpetrators." Thames Valley Police is appealing for witnesses, and specially-trained officers are supporting the woman, who left the Chinawhite enclosure between 00:00 and 02:30 BST. Det Ch Insp Lis Knight said such incidents were rare in the area. The Â£3m rowing regatta sees more than 200 races take place on the river Thames over five days. The annual regatta, which has been held since 1839, was expected to attract 200,000 spectators to this year's event.	Organisers of the Henley Royal Regatta are supplying hours of CCTV footage to police after a woman was raped.
Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said the policy of paying the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees has to change. He wants it replaced with a means tested grant to help poorer students. The Welsh government said its tuition fee policy has been a "huge success". Prof Riordan told BBC Wales' The Wales Report TV programme: "If you took the same approach to the tuition fee grant, as you do with maintenance grants, you could free up considerable funding to allow Welsh universities to compete in the same way as other universities in the UK and that's really critical to the future of our country. "There is no limit to the number of students that can go to university which means there is no limit to the money that is needed to fund the tuition fee policy and that means there is not enough money to fund Welsh universities." Yesterday, First Minister Carwyn Jones defended the Welsh government's university tuition fees subsidy and rejected the idea that tuition fee support should be limited to Welsh students who study at universities in Wales rather than anywhere they study in the UK. He was responding to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood who said the current policy meant too much Welsh public money ended up going to English universities. On Sunday, outgoing Education Minister Huw Lewis told BBC Wales tuition fee grants would remain in place after May's assembly election if Labour retained power. Universities in Wales get the majority of their funding through the tuition fees paid by students. They also get an amount from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), around Â£90m a year, which has been cut this year by the Welsh government. Prof Riordan said it had seen a 40% cut to funding which would result in job losses and would affect students. "The critical part is that the government needs to make sure than enough money is still available to fund all the areas that the tuition fee grant can't fund and that means making sure that funding is available to ensure that Welsh universities can continue to be the great success they've been over recent years," he said. "The future prosperity of the people of Wales is in the knowledge economy and the universities are the building blocks of that economy". A Welsh government spokesperson said: "There is no doubt that we have had to make some tough decisions within this budget and we  recognise that the cut to HEFCW will present challenges. "We stand by our tuition fee grant policy which has been a huge success, has supported our learners to study a course and at an institution that is right for them, and has meant that Welsh graduates have left university with debts that are on average Â£22,000 lower than graduates from England." The Wales Report is on BBC1 Wales at 22:40 GMT	The Welsh government's tuition fee policy is threatening the future of higher education in Wales, according to the body representing its universities.
Media playback is not supported on this device Back rower Mike Williams, prop Nathan Catt and versatile back Alex Lozowski are the uncapped trio, while prop Ellis Genge, 21, is also in the 34-man squad. Flanker James Haskell, lock Maro Itoje, winger Anthony Watson, back rower Jack Clifford and winger Jack Nowell all return for the champions after injury. "We are looking forward to being daring in our [first] game against France on 4 February," said head coach Eddie Jones. England are without a number of players through injury, including both Mako and Billy Vunipola and former captain Chris Robshaw. Of those players in the squad, the likes of Haskell, Anthony Watson, Joe Launchbury and George Kruis have either just returned from injuries or are still fighting their way back to full fitness. The experienced Tom Wood retains his place after a fine November series, while lock Charlie Ewels, prop Kyle Sinckler and hooker Tommy Taylor have just a handful of caps between them. England go into the tournament as defending champions having won the Grand Slam in 2016, and on the back of a 14-game winning streak, equalling the record set by Sir Clive Woodward's side in the build-up to the 2003 World Cup. "This time last year I said the long-term strategy for England is to develop a side who can be the most dominant team in world rugby," added Jones. "Obviously I've been pleased with how the team's progressing, but there's still plenty to improve on. "At the start of last year's Six Nations I probably didn't realise the enormity of the tournament and how intense the rivalry is between the countries, so this year we'll be better prepared for it." Jones said Catt, Williams and Lozowski are "all guys who have great physical capabilities", adding: "With a number of injuries to some key players it's a great opportunity for them." And he praised his returning big names who missed the autumn Tests because of injury, saying he was "looking forward to those guys coming in and challenging for a spot and adding strength". He continued: "Maro Itoje has done well for his club [Saracens] as has Jack Nowell [Exeter]. James Haskell was magnificent for England last year and is a fierce player. Anthony Watson has been a fine player for England and is one the most prolific try scorers for the number of Tests he has played." Jones has also added visual awareness coach Dr Sherylle Calder to his coaching team. Calder, part of Woodward's back-up staff, will work with the team on a consultancy basis. BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter Chris Jones After constantly throwing selectorial curve balls over the past year, this is by far Eddie Jones' most predictable squad yet. With Mako Vunipola ruled out and Joe Marler struggling, Jones has named four loose-head props, including uncapped Nathan Catt and Leicester tyro Ellis Genge. And while there are injury absentees - notably the Vunipolas and Chris Robshaw - key players such as Maro Itoje and Jack Nowell return. England squad for 2017 Six Nations Forwards: Nathan Catt (Bath Rugby), Jack Clifford (Harlequins), Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), Charlie Ewels (Bath Rugby), Ellis Genge (Leicester Tigers), Jamie George (Saracens), Teimana Harrison (Northampton Saints), Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints), James Haskell (Wasps), Nathan Hughes (Wasps), Maro Itoje (Saracens), George Kruis (Saracens), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton Saints), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Matt Mullan (Wasps), Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins), Tommy Taylor (Wasps), Mike Williams (Leicester Tigers), Tom Wood (Northampton Saints) Backs: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Danny Care (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps), Owen Farrell (Saracens), George Ford (Bath Rugby), Jonathan Joseph (Bath Rugby), Alex Lozowski (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester Rugby), Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), Henry Slade (Exeter Chiefs), Ben Te'o (Worcester Warriors), Anthony Watson (Bath Rugby), Marland Yarde (Harlequins), Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers)	England have named three uncapped players in their Six Nations squad.
Norma Diffley, who ran a boutique in Donaghadee, died in the accident on the A2 dual carriageway between Bangor and Holywood close to the Devil's Elbow at Carney Hill on Monday afternoon. The 33-year-old man is being questioned on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death. He was arrested on Tuesday.	A 33-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a two-vehicle crash which claimed the life of a 75-year-old woman in County Down.
The 27-year-old Commonwealth Games silver medallist was badly injured in a motorbike taxi accident in Vietnam. Earlier this week she was flown back to Scotland and is in hospital in Edinburgh. In a Facebook message posted by a friend, Stephanie also said "can't wait to get home and have a Nando's". On Thursday, her parents said she had opened and her eyes and said "Hi". In a further update, on the SaveSteph facebook page, a friend said the judo star had made "outstanding progress" and was eating and drinking small amounts by herself and fully able to communicate. "Hopefully next week she will be moved to a rehab centre and continue her progress," the statement said. In her message dictated to her friend, Stephanie said: "Tell everyone thank you for all their support and well wishes, I am going to be up and about before you know it and come and see everyone and can't wait to get home and have a Nando's. "Thanks everyone for the cards flowers and trinkets that you have sent." The 27-year-old, who grew up in the Highlands but has been living in Dunfermline, was flown back to Scotland from Thailand after being treated in a Bangkok hospital for a serious head injury and also infections, including pneumonia. Doctors in Vietnam had given her a 1% chance of surviving her injuries. Her parents, who live in Daviot, near Inverness, flew to south-east Asia to be with their daughter. Stephanie, who won her Commonwealth Games medal at Glasgow 2014, had been in Vietnam for about four months, teaching underprivileged children, when the motorcycle accident happened last month. Her skirt is believed to have become unravelled and caught in the wheel. Friends and family set up a crowdfunding campaign to pay for her medical costs after it emerged her travel insurance was not valid because she had been in the country more than 31 days.	Scots judo star Stephanie Inglis has thanked her supporters and said she hopes to be "up and about" soon.
Helen Smith, who lives in Deal with her British husband and their two children, applied for a new visa last September. But she is still waiting for officials to return her passport, and said her plea to speed up the process after her grandfather's death was rejected. UKBA said applicants could not be given updates within the first six months. Mrs Smith said not being able to attend her grandfather's funeral had been "devastating". "You've got the support of your family but you just want to be there with them and go through the whole grief and saying goodbye with them," she said. She had sent a fax to the Border Agency outlining the situation, but did not receive a reply. Her husband, Ross Smith, said: "I expected an answer that day because of the severity of what had happened - somebody had actually died. "So somebody must've picked that fax up... and we got nothing, so that was as low as it gets in my eyes." Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, said he was taking up Mrs Smith's case with the immigration minister. "In cases like this, clearly it should be fast-tracked and what they need to do is take a more risk-based approach," he said. The UKBA website informs applicants that "you do not need to contact us to check the progress of your application". "We will contact you as soon as a decision has been made or if we require further information. "Our staff cannot provide any information about your application if you applied less than six months ago." Mrs Smith said she was still hoping to fly to New Zealand for the scattering of her grandfather's ashes.	A New Zealand woman living in Kent has claimed the UK Border Agency (UKBA) prevented her from travelling to the funeral of her grandfather in Auckland.
By the time a baby takes its first breath many of the key pathways between nerves have already been made. And some of these will help determine how a baby thinks or sees the world, and may have a role to play in the development of conditions such as autism, scientists say. But how this rich neural network assembles in the baby before birth is relatively unchartered territory. Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, King's College London, Imperial College and Oxford University aim to produce a dynamic wiring diagram of how the brain grows, at a level of detail that they say has been impossible until now. They hope that by charting the journeys of bundles of nerves in the final three months of pregnancy, doctors will be able to understand more about how they can help in situations when this process goes wrong. Prof David Edwards, director of the Centre for the Developing Brain,  who is leading the research, says: "There is a distressing number of children in our society who grow up with problems because of things that happen to them around the time of birth or just before birth. "It is very important to be able to scan babies before they are born, because we can capture a period when an awful lot is changing inside the brain, and it is a time when a great many of the things that might be going wrong do seem to be going wrong." The study - known as the Developing Human Connectome Project - hopes to look at more than 1,500 babies, studying many aspects of their neurological development. By examining the brains of babies while they are still growing in the womb, as well as those born prematurely and at full term, the scientists will try to define baselines of normal development and investigate how these may be affected by problems around birth. And they plan to share their map with the wider research community. Central to this project are advanced MRI scanning techniques, which the scientists say are able to pick up on details of the growing brain that have been difficult to capture until now. While in the womb, foetuses are free to somersault in their amniotic sacs, and this constant movement has so far hindered clear images of growing brains. But researchers at the Centre for the Developing Brain have found ways to counter the effects of these movements, building up full three-dimensional pictures while the foetus is in motion. And by placing the MRI machine in the neonatal intensive care unit at Evelina Children's Hospital in London they are one of the few centres in the world to have a scanner in such close proximity to the babies who often need it most, Prof Edwards says. This means the same scanning system can be used to find out more about the brains of the sickest and smallest newborn babies, he says. Daniel Rueckert, professor of visual information processing at Imperial College London, who is also involved in the research, says: "We are trying to look at brain connectivity in two ways: firstly, from a structural perspective, to find out which parts of the brain are wired to other parts. And secondly we are looking at functional connectivity - how strongly two brain regions are linked across time and activity." But Prof Partha Mitra, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York state, says we need to be aware of the limitations of the technology in use. "It would obviously be a very good thing to know more about the circuits in the developing human brain. Much of what we know hasn't changed in a hundred years and has come from dissection studies. "But we need to keep in mind the imaging techniques we have are indirect - we can't open up a human brain and look at the connections while someone is alive so we rely on these non-invasive methods.  But there is a big gap between the real circuits in the brain and what images can show us." Prof Rueckert acknowledges that this map will provide a "macro-level" view of the developing brain and not be the "final answer". But he points to early results from the adult version of this project  - the Human Connectome Project, based in the US: "There is so much evidence already from the adult project that there are significant changes in the brain that can be mapped with the technology we have now. "It will be incredibly useful to be able to do this with the still growing and developing brain - perhaps giving us more time to intervene when things go wrong."	UK scientists have embarked on a six-year project to map how nerve connections develop in babies' brains while still in the womb and after birth.
Welsh language minister Alun Davies told AMs it would help efforts to reach that goal stay on the right track. Targets to meet growing demand for Welsh-speaking teachers and public sector workers will also be set. Culture committee chairwoman Bethan Jenkins said AMs had been told 70% more Welsh-medium teachers were needed. Mr Davies responded that around a third of teachers in Wales could speak Welsh, and that the challenge was to see if more of them would be willing to teach through the medium of Welsh. Earlier this month, Welsh language commissioner Meri Huws called for "radical change" in the education system to ensure all children under the age of seven were "immersed" in Welsh.	The Welsh Government will set a "framework" of five-year targets in its attempt to ensure a million people speak Welsh by 2050.
Mackie has scored twice in 33 Championship games for the Rs since rejoining following his release by Nottingham Forest in June 2015. The 31-year-old found the net 18 times in 94 games in his first spell at Loftus Road between 2010 and 2013. Meanwhile, midfielder Karl Henry, 34, will leave the club after not being offered a new contract. Henry made 118 appearances for the Rs after signing from Wolves for an undisclosed fee in July 2013, but had not featured since December.	QPR forward Jamie Mackie has signed a one-year contract extension to stay at the club until the end of next season.
Meghan Ambrozevich-Blair, 26, died following a collision between her car and a pick-up truck on the A1 near Dunbar in East Lothian in December. The student, who was engaged, was at Edinburgh Napier University. She is survived by parents Kevin and Lauren, siblings Jared and Ethan and fiance Scot. In a statement, her family said: "We are extremely proud of our daughter's achievement. "Meghan worked so hard at university, on placements and overseas, learning about and caring for animals. "Her dyslexia and dyscalculia meant she had to work harder than most to keep up with her fellow students. "Even from a very young age, it was clear that Meghan loved animals. She was always drawn to the leftovers and the misfits, the runts that nobody else wanted. "Meghan's loss has affected all the family deeply but we take comfort from the fact that all the creatures in animal heaven are being very well cared for." Ms Ambrozevich-Blair was a volunteer at vet nursing open days and had been part of a team from the university that visited Kerala, India, in 2015 to help develop local interest in animal welfare and training veterinary nurses. Academic staff at the university said she achieved the top grading through "hard work and good humour". Life sciences programme leader Dr David Smith said: "She was on track to be one of the outstanding students in the history of the programme, not just academically - her profile shows straight merits - but also in being at the forefront of showing what veterinary nurses can do. "The slogan Meghan provided for the School of Applied Sciences' pop-up banner - Edinburgh Napier gives you the opportunity to become the best veterinary nurse you can be - sums her up well." Dr Smith, who taught Meghan for four years, said: "She was always on the front row, eager and willing to go. "She usually had a lovely big smile on her face - unless she wasn't quite satisfied with your answer to her questions. "She will be sadly missed by the staff of Edinburgh Napier University and the college of animal welfare." The 26-year-old, from Dunbar, previously studied at Barony Agricultural College, Dumfries, and was also involved in campaigning against animal cruelty and fundraising for the Scottish SPCA. Her close friend and Edinburgh Napier colleague Kirsty Dougherty said: "Meghan was a special friend, warm-hearted and fun, and generous with her laughter and enthusiasm. "The world seemed like a kinder place when she was around, not only to her friends and family but for her animal patients too. Her compassion and energy were boundless - she is sorely missed."

Winger Matt Phillips is still nursing a hamstring problem and remains out for the fourth game in a row. Mohamed Elneny should be available for Arsenal after making a quicker than expected recovery from an ankle injury. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs are both fitness doubts and will be assessed, while Santi Cazorla remains a long-term absentee. Martin Fisher: "Even a win in this one won't be enough to lift Arsenal back into the top four, a worrying sign of what might be their fate come the end of the season. "The FA Cup again offers Arsene Wenger the chance of silverware but it's extending his proud record of Champions League qualification that's more likely to persuade him to sign that contract on his desk. "After losing three of their last four Premier League outings, the Gunners can ill afford any slip-ups against an Albion side I saw well beaten at Everton last weekend. "Having superbly steered West Brom to safety by the end of February, the challenge for Tony Pulis now is to make sure the season doesn't peter out tamely." Twitter: @martfisher1 West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "The most important thing is that we get that mentality into the players and into everyone around the football club that we want to get more points, that we want to push on. "My aim is to get a team that can stay in the top 12 every year and get to cup finals. You've got to have that strong mentality and desire to do that." Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "Success, it's not down to me to judge that. Our job is to do as well as we can until the end of the season. We want to play in the Champions League next season. "We have a tough job because we have six or seven teams fighting for the places. We are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, we have an opportunity to do that as well. So overall that's our targets. "After that, success is basically to take the maximum out of the potential of the team. Where is that? We will see." The Baggies are yet to beat a top-seven team this season but I am expecting a response from them on Saturday after their recent displays. Arsenal have a mixed record at The Hawthorns with only one win in their past three league visits, and I don't see them leaving with three points this time either.

"There's a lot going on right now,"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong. The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1. "And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today," she adds. "It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified." The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear. Describing the concept as "just hellish", she tells us: "I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'." So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart. "In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury." Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a "genuine champion". "He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why. "I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special." Here the diary of Laura's day. Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day. "I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big," she admits. "I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up. "Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can." We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive. Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's "glad you only find out on the day". "I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers. "I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album." Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn. "There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise," says Laura. "With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress. "My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family." Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts. Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano. "Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?" she laughs. "Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now." Time for some nourishment. The team ("there's like millions of them... making it work") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in. "I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine." "[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently," says Laura. "He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight. "I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'. "It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps." Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands. She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved. With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman. "If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made," says Laura. There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again. Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio. "He made me cry so much," says Laura. "I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel. "I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon." With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two. "It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. " Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman. "That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!" It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other. US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap ("Because he's fine. And obviously amazing"). "I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is," says Laura. "The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment. "That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance." So what now? "Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away. "But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out. "I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!"

The prince visited the Mants'ase Children's Home in Maseru, Lesotho. "Festive cheer! Despite it being 32 degrees, someone gave out Christmas hats and inevitably one found its way on to my head," he wrote. "All the children, orphaned for one reason or another, absolutely loved the hats and balloons." Prince Harry was supporting the charity Sentebale which assists projects that work with disadvantaged children, many of whom have Aids or have become orphans because of the disease. He was also photographed participating in the building of Mamohato Children's Centre. This will give emotional and psychological support to young people affected by HIV and Aids. The prince visited a Mamohato Network Club in Maseru and said: "These are children who have never had the chance to talk about their illness, and who had no idea that they were one of so many in their age group. "It was really emotional watching them interact with each other. Some really outgoing chatty kids, others slightly overwhelmed, but all with huge smiles. "This confirmed to me again that what we're doing is going to change thousands of children's lives, and hopefully save a generation." Prince Harry also revealed his own love of photography and shared some images that he had taken. "I have always enjoyed photography and the challenges that come with trying to capture the perfect shot, although privately I don't take many photos," he said. "The best photos I have are in my head - I have some very special memories, mostly from Africa. "But on this visit, I had the time and opportunity to be on the other side of the camera and take some photos in the stunning country of Lesotho for my charity, Sentebale."

His 1965 track Tears was the third biggest-selling single of the decade, according to a newly compiled chart. The Beatles occupy the top two places in the chart and have an additional three records in the Top 10. DJ Tony Blackburn counted down the Top 60 best-selling records of the 1960s in a special programme on BBC Radio Two, broadcast on Bank Holiday Monday. According to sales data compiled by the Official Charts Company, the biggest selling single of the 1960s was She Loves You by The Beatles. I Want to Hold Your Hand, recorded by the Fab Four in 1963, came second. The Unswinging Sixties The other Beatles records in the Top 10 are Can't Buy Me Love at four, I Feel Fine at five and the double A-side We Can Work It Out/Day Tripper at seven. Yet Dodd's track - which topped the UK singles chart for five weeks and was the biggest-selling single of 1965 - outsold them all. "It comes as no surprise to see the Fab Four at number one, but other aspects of the chart are perhaps a little unexpected," said Blackburn. Jeff Smith, Radio 2's head of music, called the chart "a nostalgic reflection of the enduring appeal of the music of the '60s and the artists that defined the decade." Dodd, now 82, has been in showbusiness for more than 50 years. Born in Liverpool in 1927, he is best known for his buck teeth and frizzy hair, tickling stick and his creation of the Diddymen.	Eccentric comedian Ken Dodd was one of the biggest recording artists of the 1960s, new research has revealed.
Two crews and a hovercraft from Weston-super-Mare were called just after midnight to rescue two adults and the children from Uphill beach. The police and ambulance service also attended, the fire service said. Avon Fire and Rescue have warned people not to park or walk on the beach in the dark due to the fast-rising tides.	A family of five, including three young children, had to be rescued from a Somerset beach after their car got stuck in the mud on Saturday evening.
The 20-year-old had been due to go on trial for allegedly driving an Â£80,000 Porsche while banned. He has also been accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice and driving without insurance. At Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court, it was said Mr Feruz was in training in Tanzania. Sheriff Frances McCartney issued a warrant for his arrest. The Somalia-born player joined Celtic as a 10-year-old. The club had successfully campaigned for him and his family to be allowed to stay in Scotland. He moved to Chelsea six years later and has had loan spells with a number of clubs, including Hibs.	A warrant has been issued for former Celtic footballer Islam Feruz after he failed to turn up for a court appearance in Glasgow.
Cardiff narrowly missed out on the Championship play-offs last term, finishing eighth in the table. But under new head coach Paul Trollope, Pilkington thinks the Welsh side are capable of better. "We fell just short [last season] and we were all really disappointed with that. We felt we had the squad to get in the play-offs definitely," he said. "It's going to be a tough season again, just like it was last year, but hopefully we can be right up there come the end of the season." Pilkington, 28, scored Cardiff's first goal in their 4-0 friendly win at Shrewsbury on Saturday. The Republic of Ireland international played in attack, having moved from the wing to a central forward role last season. Pilkington made the transition under former Cardiff boss Russell Slade, who was replaced by Trollope in May. Trollope had been working under Slade before then, and Pilkington believes that smooth transition has helped the Bluebirds in their preparations for the new campaign. "The gaffer was working with us last season so we know how he works," he added. "We know what he's about and we know we have to be on our toes all the time. "He's come in and changed a few things. It's been good up to now so hopefully we can carry on working really well."	Cardiff City forward Anthony Pilkington believes the Bluebirds can challenge for promotion this season.
For Fahad bin Mohammed Al-Attiya, it is the nightmare scenario. He is the executive chairman of the Qatar National Food Security Programme. The small Gulf state is 100% dependent on desalinated water. Mr Al-Attiya says such a scenario would threaten the very survival of Qatar and its population of more than two million. "We need to have clean water," he says. "A situation like the Gulf of Mexico where BP lost two or three million barrels of oil - if that happens in the [Persian] Gulf the consequences would be severely different." Qatar sits on the world's third largest gas field and is investing billions into mega-reservoirs at home to give it some kind of water security. But water is not the only problem. Despite being the richest country per capita in the world, Qatar also needs to import 90% of its food. "Qatar is... hydrocarbon-rich," said Mr Al-Attiya, speaking on a special In the Balance discussion on food security for the BBC World Service. "But certainly water-poor and food-poor. "Not only that, but for our own development we have to import the... labour to develop our country so we need to import even further to feed the nation." Where the solution to water security is largely domestic, food security involves a tangle of trade, diplomatic and political issues. Qatar joins a growing list of countries that includes other Gulf states, India, China and South Korea, that are not just importing food but buying the land abroad on which it is grown. These countries are often accused of "land grabs" - the buying up of millions of hectares of overseas agricultural land with scant regard for the livelihoods of local farmers or the environment. The charity Oxfam claims land eight times the size of the UK was sold off globally in the last decade, enough to grow food for a billion people. It says that more than 60% of investments in agricultural land by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010 were in developing countries with serious hunger problems. Two-thirds of those investors plan to export everything they produce on that land. But the truth is, for all its wealth, an investor like Qatar can itself be at the mercy of global weather, disease and politics. The price Qatar pays for losing imports is not just financial - it is often the physical loss of food to eat. Mr Al-Attiya points out that many of Qatar's trading relationships fell apart in 2010 when India, Russia and other countries blocked exports in the face of the worst droughts in a century. "That made countries like ours question how much faith we put in free trade." So he says that Qatar has to have a bigger vision. "We will not go in and invest simply to service our population of 2.5 million people.  It doesn't make any economic sense. "We will go in and invest to service the country, and the region - and the globe at large. "I say there is no direct link between investment in a foreign country and food security of the country that made that investment. "Because the country that received that investment is a sovereign state and it could say, 'Thanks for the investment but in times of crisis I am not going to export that food.' What we do... is really enhancing the availability of a food at a global level." Such a global perspective is not the norm. Land grabs get bad press - for good reasons. Ahmed Soliman, research assistant on the Horn of Africa at Chatham House, says land grabs put pressure on local communities. "Many of the populations are involved in either subsistence agriculture or very low-level agriculture. "Taking into consideration what is sustainable for them in terms of how they are able to feed their families and future generations is very important. And when it gets down to national level those concerns are not being met." But there may be ways of meeting them. Prof Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist of the UN Environment Programme, says: "The kind of investments the Qataris are talking about is a very 'soft' power, because they are talking about raising the whole global food production system. "But in a more aggressive world perhaps there is space for an investment bond that says if things go horribly wrong and you have denuded the land we're going to use that fund to reinstate some kind of productive farming." But there is also a need for a relationship between investor and host country that works day-to-day as well as in a crisis. "It's a very complex problem," says Ken Ash, director of trade and agriculture at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). "People are hungry because they are poor, because they don't have money to buy food when they need it. It isn't just about producing more grain or more rice. It's about generating income opportunities in rural areas so that people can increasingly feed themselves." The question of food security could have some very prosaic solutions. For Prof McGlade it is a question of too much waste. "It's waste at the farm level, it's waste through the supply chains and delivery, and the lack of refrigeration. "You look under just one tarpaulin and you see the extreme loss of potential at every stage of the food supply. So if we can tackle food waste at the very beginning then I think food security becomes something that is realisable." In the Balance's discussion on food security is broadcast at 08:30 GMT on Saturday, 6 December on BBC World Service.	Imagine this: an oil spill the size of the Gulf of Mexico 2010 disaster, but this time in the Persian Gulf.
"I genuinely believe that being on death row for 22 years ultimately saved my life. It was the greatest adventure of my life, and I survived it." Nick Yarris has never had an apology for being imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. He spent almost all that time in solitary confinement, sometimes being beaten so badly by prison guards that, on one occasion, his retina detached. "The hardest thing to do when people are hurting you is to remain a decent person," he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. While on death row, he educated himself about the law, and sometimes read up to three books in a day. "The whole purpose of my education ultimately was so I could deliver a statement eloquently before my execution," he said. For 22 of the 23 years he spent in prison, Nick genuinely believed he would be executed. Nick has now written his own book about his life called "The Fear of 13", because he believed bad things happened to him around the 13th date. "I didn't mind the 23 hours a day solitary confinement for the majority of the time, because after the first few years in prison, when I stopped being angry and started to like myself and understand myself, it was OK. I still enjoy my own company sometimes. "I've never had any psychiatric help since leaving prison. I studied psychology in there and applied it to myself." Nick grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia with his parents and five siblings, but his happy childhood was shattered when, aged seven, he was attacked by a teenage boy who hit him on the head so hard it gave him brain damage and then raped him. He did not tell his parents. The trauma of this assault led his behaviour into a downward spiral and as he got older he began drinking and taking drugs. He was arrested, aged 20, after being accused of the attempted kidnap and murder of a police officer - a charge of which he was later acquitted. But while in custody before that trial, Nick was desperate to get out and so made up a story, telling police he knew who committed the murder of a woman, Linda Mae Craig, who he had only read about in the newspaper and had never met. "I was just desperate, a drug-addled kid who didn't know what to do to get out of jail." He said the murderer was a man with whom he once briefly lived. Nick thought the man - who had stolen money from him - had later died and so believed he could safely trade this false information for his own freedom. However, the man Nick accused was still alive and the lie was exposed. The police then charged Nick with these crimes instead. In 1982, he was convicted of the woman's rape and murder and sent to death row. During his imprisonment in Pennsylvania jails, Nick's only possessions were a couple of paper sacks full of legal materials, some novels, toiletries and a small radio. He was only allowed to exercise for 30 minutes on weekdays in a small cage. He would spend 14 years, from 1989 to 2003, without being touched by another human being. During this time, he would lie on his arm until it went numb and then use it to rub his face, as though it were someone else. In 1988 he became the first man on death row in the United States to ask for DNA testing, but this led to years of heartbreaking delays and churning frustrations, such as when a vital package containing DNA samples burst open when it was posted to a laboratory, destroying the evidence. Eventually, Nick sought the most extreme form of relief from his imprisonment. "In 2002 I was ready to be executed and I asked to drop my legal appeals so that the execution process would be carried out." But then a judge ordered one final round of DNA testing and evidence came back and cleared him in 2003, demonstrating that there were DNA traces of two unknown men in the car and on Linda's clothing. Linda's killer has never been found and Nick received compensation for his wrongful conviction, although it "feels like pity money" to him. "When I got out, I got a mantra from my mother, who sat me down and said that I had to be a polite and kind man from now on and that I had to be kind to women, otherwise it was a waste of coming home. "She did me a huge favour. I began creating positive passages in my brain that changed my thoughts for the better." He also said that when he got out, he noticed how "people weren't as reserved as they were". "In prison you're not allowed to give out your opinion. But now everyone's expected to give their opinion on social media." He now campaigns for the abolishment of the death penalty, has spoken in front of officials at both the United Nations and European Union and has given around 300 talks in schools. And it was a trip to the UK, to speak to MPs in Parliament, that led him to fall in love with England, where he has lived since 2005. "It felt like a permanent holiday away from my woes," he said. Now a father and living in Ilchester, Somerset, he recently saw a photo from his own childhood, showing 27 children from his neighbourhood in the 1970s. He is the only one still alive, the others dying through drugs, car accidents or violence. Both his brothers died because of drugs and alcohol abuse. He added: "I see my prison past as an old movie I watched that scarred me, but now I don't get so bothered about it. "If I hadn't have gone to prison, then my life wouldn't be as good as it is now. I never look at it in a negative way." The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. International viewers can see clips from the programme here.	Nick Yarris spent more than two decades on death row in the US after he was wrongly convicted of rape and murder, before a DNA test eventually freed him.
Kingfisher House, near the domestic airport in the western city of Mumbai (Bombay), was being sold by lenders to recover losses. However, bidders appeared to be deterred by the asking price of 1.5bn rupees ($22m; Â£15m). The businessman is said to have some $1.4bn of unpaid debts after his Kingfisher airline collapsed in 2013. Speculation rose about his whereabouts after a consortium of banks and creditors approached the Supreme Court over  unpaid debts. They demanded that his passport be impounded, and that $75m in severance pay he was to receive from Diageo be blocked and used to repay them. The payout was blocked, but it emerged that Mr Mallya had already left India. Later in a series of tweets he denied that he was "absconding" as was being alleged in India. Media reports say Mr Mallya is currently living in London. Opposition MPs have demanded that the government bring him back to face the law. Mr Mallya, who is a household name in India, sold a large chunk of United Spirits, which he inherited from his father, to Diageo in April 2014. He was to receive the $75m payout as settlement after being ousted from the firm in February. Mr Mallya, once dubbed by Indian media as "India's Richard Branson" and the "King of Good Times" for his lavish lifestyle, also owns a stake in the Formula One team Force India.	An auction to sell a property belonging to Indian drinks baron Vijay Mallya has failed to attract any bidders.
Andrew Shinnie, James Keatings and Chris Humphrey banged in three goals inside 13 first-half minutes. The Midlothian junior side had a moment to celebrate when Dean Hoskins converted a penalty. The one-way traffic continued in the second half with Jason Cummings scoring twice, while Lewis Stevenson, Keatings and Jordon Forster were also on target. The opening 10 minutes were evenly matched but a goalkeeping error gifted Hibs their opener and it encouraged the Leith side to go on a three-goal blitz at the home of their arch-rivals Hearts. Shinnie's 22-yard shot looked like it would be dealt with comfortably by Michael Andrews, but the low effort squirmed through his grasp and into the bottom right corner. Bonnyrigg's 5000-strong support remained noisy before Keatings' delightful strike into the top left corner punctured their enthusiasm. Goalkeeper Andrews could do nothing about that one and all of a sudden the pressure was on the underdogs not to fold, but a third Hibs goal followed soon after. Andrews palmed Stevenson's low shot into the path of Humphrey for the winger to stroke home an easy first goal of his Hibs career. Manager Robbie Horn signalled to his players to be big and to stand up to Hibs' dominance, and left-back Ruaridh Donaldson impressed under pressure on more than one occasion before playing a useful ball to Kieran McGachie. Forster fouled the ambling blonde forward and referee Alan Muir pointed to the spot. Dean Hoskins sent Hibs' substitute goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw the wrong way and all of a sudden the Rosey Posey's support rediscovered their fervour, flags and volume. Another shout for a penalty from a Forster handball, as well as Wayne McIntosh's header wide gave the New Dundas Park side some hope of scoring a second, but Neil Lennon's side also remained a threat and Hoskins had to be smart to clear off the line before the break. Media playback is not supported on this device Hibernian quickly killed off any thoughts of an unlikely comeback with Cummings' scissor-kick and Stevenson's back post tap-in well and truly wrapping the result up by the hour mark. Bonnyrigg were broken further by Cummings' second strike of the game - an easy finish when Andrews could only parry an effort from Grant Holt. Then Keatings completed his brace by converting into the far corner from a tight angle following Martin Boyle's through ball. The rout was complete when Forster got in the scoring act by heading home Keatings' free-kick after a reckless foul by Hoskins on Humphrey. A chastening experience on the day for Bonnyrigg but one they only experienced because of a terrific run in the competition. Hibernian's Neil Lennon: "The attitude was great and that will give the players a lift. Overall, I'm very pleased and the most important thing is that we are in the next round. "It was a good day. Unfortunately, we lost our goalkeeper early [Ofir Marciano after a collision], so we are waiting to hear the results of that and we're hoping it's not too bad." Bonnyrigg's Robbie Horn: "We just didn't start the game and we gave away some poor goals. I know we are better than that. "We showed in spells what we are capable of at 3-0 and I thought there was a good shout for another penalty to go 3-2. "The way Hibs moved the ball was different class."

Police said the 29-year-old man was attacked at the Gorbals venue's Island Bar at about 01:30. He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital but was released after treatment. His attacker was white, in his late teens to early 20s, between 5ft 7in and 6ft tall, with short, dark hair. He was wearing a white polo shirt and light-coloured knee-length shorts. Det Con Lee-Anne Miller, of Police Scotland, said: "The injured man was standing in the bar area when he became involved in an altercation with the suspect which then led to a fight in which he was stabbed. "Thankfully no-one else was injured but with the number of people about, this could have escalated quite easily. "We are working with staff from the venue, who quickly stepped in to stop the fight, and we are checking CCTV inside the premises to identify the person responsible for the attack." She added: "The gig was packed at the time of the assault and a number of people have been spoken to regarding what they saw, however, I am still keen that anyone who witnessed the incident contact police."	A man has been stabbed in a bar at the 02 Academy in Glasgow.
Max Power's scuffed shot allowed Grigg to pounce and nod the Latics ahead. Yanic Wildschut hit the bar for the hosts before Nick Powell curled a free-kick from 25 yards into the top corner to double their advantage. Michael Jacobs' cross then caused havoc before defender Shane Duffy bundled the ball into his own net to make it 3-0. Gary Caldwell's Latics, who announced the signing of Shaun MacDonald from Bournemouth before kick-off, earned their first win of the season in their first home game of the campaign. Rovers' second defeat in as many league games this season, leaving them without a point under boss Owen Coyle. Former Burnley, Bolton and Wigan boss Coyle was facing the Latics for the first time since he left the club in December 2013 after less than six months in charge. But Wigan only compounded his side's poor start to the season, in which Rovers are bottom, having now conceded seven goals in two matches. The visitors rarely threatened, their first shot on target not coming until the 85th minute as Wigan comfortably extended their unbeaten run against Blackburn at the DW Stadium to eight games. Wigan Athletic manager Gary Caldwell: "It was total dominance from us. It should have been more than 2-0 at half-time, and that was the only frustrating aspect. But, in terms of the way we played, the way we went about our business - with and without the ball - that was us at our best. "We can take a lot from that game in terms of belief. We know that against good sides, Championship sides, at our best we're a real threat. "For the first 45 minutes, I don't think there would have been many better performances up and down the country. "Our pressing was incredible, our energy was incredible, and we showed real belief with the way we passed the ball. "It could have been four or five at half-time." Blackburn boss Owen Coyle: "It doesn't matter whether it was a return to the DW, or a game against Newcastle or whoever. What was important was us trying to win a game of football. "And, if truth be told, looking at their goals, we never gave ourselves a real opportunity to do that. "As much as Wigan had their tails up at the beginning, the first goal was from a mis-hit shot, and their lad's put a fantastic reaction header into the top corner. "At 1-0 you've obviously got to try and find a way back in and then they score from a free-kick, when we probably should have had a free-kick that wasn't given. Jason Steele will probably feel that on another day he would have saved that." Match ends, Wigan Athletic 3, Blackburn Rovers 0. Second Half ends, Wigan Athletic 3, Blackburn Rovers 0.

The crackdown began last month when Turkish ISPs were told to cut off the virtual private networks people use to hide where they go. Many people are changing the way they connect to Tor to avoid the block. Activists said the block moved Turkey's net censorship policies from "moderate" to "severe". Tor, also known as The Onion Router, aims to conceal where people go online by using encryption and randomly bouncing requests for webpages through a network of different computers. The system has become popular in many nations, such as China and Turkey, where governments are known to watch what people do and say online. Now Turkey Blocks, which monitors internet censorship in the nation, said its regular monitoring of Tor showed that it was being widely blocked across the country. The organisation started to investigate after many people in Turkey reported having problems reaching the Tor network. It added that the Turkish government had put in place sophisticated systems at ISPs to spot when people were trying to connect to Tor. These inspect packets of data and can pick out the distinctive signature of those that are destined for Tor. Turkey Blocks said the Turkish government ordered firms to start blocking VPNs and Tor in early December, and has increased the pressure on firms to act by asking for weekly updates about the success of the measures. The monitoring group said that while direct access to Tor was not working well, many people were reporting that they could still access the network if they used a bridge. These are unofficial entry points to the Tor network which, because they are not listed in the software itself, can survive when blocks are imposed. Turkey has a long history of cutting off access to websites and services - particularly during periods of social unrest.	Turkey has blocked direct access to the Tor anonymous browsing network as part of a wider crackdown on the ways people circumvent internet censorship.
Williams, who took Cuthbert's place on the wing during the Six Nations, will miss Wales' first two warm up matches following foot surgery. Ex-Wales centre James says Cuthbert faces a big task to win the shirt back. "He'll be very lucky if he gets back in," he said. "I don't think he's put his hand up this season." Cardiff Blues' back Cuthbert, 25, has not played for Wales since their 26-23 win over Scotland in February at Murrayfield, their second match of Six Nations. He was left out of the matchday squads altogether for their three remaining fixtures. The previously prolific Cuthbert failed to score in 11 of the 14 matches he played for his region in the Pro12 during 2014-15, but crossed twice in their final fixture of the campaign against bottom side Zebre. He has been included in Wales' 47-man World Cup training squad which will be trimmed down to 31 at the end of August and James told Radio Wales Sport that the winger needs to improve. "It's down to mental attitude possibly," the 2001 British Lion said. "It depends how he goes in the training camp. "If I was in the training camp and I was one of the backs I'd see this as a massive opportunity to really step up my game, show what you can do and put your hands up." Wales head coach Warren Gatland is "optimistic" Williams, 24, will recover in time to take part in the World Cup. James says losing the Scarlets' back would be a setback for Wales, who are already without injured centre Jonathan Davies (knee). "It would be a massive blow," said James. "He's certainly a valuable commodity to have in the back division. "He seems to create a hell of a lot of try-scoring opportunities, which we've seen him doing time and time again for Scarlets, but also for Wales this season. So let's hope he makes a speedy recovery."	Alex Cuthbert would be "lucky" to regain his Wales place even if Liam Williams is ruled out of the Rugby World Cup, according to Dafydd James.
One person died when a car, a van pulling a trailer and a lorry crashed between junctions 10 and 10a on Sunday at about 15:00 BST. Major repair work was needed to the motorway surface with leaking fuel suspected to have caused damage, said West Midlands Police. The road was closed for about 15 hours with tailbacks to junction 7. The hard shoulder could remain shut for repairs for two days. Highways England described it as a "complex recovery operation overnight".	The M6 motorway between Wolverhampton and Walsall has reopened after a fatal crash.
Harsent won the prestigious £20,000 award for his eleventh collection Fire Songs. It was his fifth nomination, dating back to 1998, but he had not previously won. Chair of the judges Helen Dunmore described Harsent as "a poet for dark and dangerous days". She added: "Fire Songs plumbs language and emotion with technical brilliance and prophetic power." This year's other nominees included former winners John Burnside and Michael Longley. The 10 shortlisted authors received £1,500 each. To mark the 50th anniversary of Eliot's death on 4 January 2015, the prize money for the winner has been increased from £15,000 to £20,000. Judges Dunmore, Sean Borodale and Fiona Sampson chose the shortlist from 113 books submitted by publishers. The TS Eliot Prize 2014 shortlist: Harsent's previous collections include 2005's Legion, which won the Forward Prize for best collection, and 2011's Night, which was shortlisted for the Costa, Forward and TS Eliot Prizes and won the Griffin International Poetry Prize. He is currently professor of creative writing at the University of Roehampton and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Harsent was presented with his award at a ceremony at the Wallace Collection in London on Monday. Previous TS Eliot Prize winners include Ted Hughes, George Szirtes, Carol Ann Duffy, Seamus Heaney, Derek Walcott, John Burnside, Sharon Olds and Sinead Morrissey. The TS Eliot Prize was launched in 1993 to celebrate the Poetry Book Society's 40th birthday and to honour its founding poet. The prize money is donated by the TS Eliot estate.	David Harsent has won the TS Eliot Prize for poetry at the fifth attempt.
David Skeen, 51, was last seen going for a run in Talgarth, near Brecon, at 09:00 GMT on Tuesday. Firefighters, police and more than 45 mountain rescue volunteers had been out searching for Mr Skeen. A drone was used during the day. Mr Skeen was last seen wearing an orange gilet, black running trousers, pale trainers and a blue hat. Dyfed-Powys Police said they would continue to follow up any lines of inquiry overnight.	The search for a jogger who has been missing for more than 24 hours in Powys has been stood down for the night.
There is no change as Team Sky's Froome trails Tinkoff's Contador, by 13 seconds and BMC's Porte by six. Stage three of the Tour de France warm-up race was won by Astana's Fabio Aru - also a Tour de France contender. Aru broke away from the peloton with 12 kilometres to go, crossing the line a few metres ahead of the chasing sprinters. Froome, 31, finished in the peloton in 23rd place along with Contador, 33, who had made a late bike change with a team-mate before returning to the pack, finishing 39th. Froome won the Criterium du Dauphine last year and will attempt to defend his Tour de France title from 2 July, ahead of his bid for Olympic gold in the road race in Rio in August.

Archie Darby died on 13 October after being attacked by a Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog in Harwich Road, Colchester. Essex Coroner's Court heard the infant died from severe head injuries consistent with a dog attack. His 22-month-old brother Daniel-Jay was left with "life-changing injuries". The boys' mother was also hurt. Live: Read more about the hearing and other Essex news The dog was put down with the consent of its owner - the children's aunt - who has been named in reports as 31-year-old Clare Ferdinand, a serving Essex Police officer. Police are not treating the attack as a criminal investigation. During a brief hearing, coroner's officer David Dinnell said: "Archie Darby was a four-month-old baby being held in his mother's arms when he was taken out of her arms by the family dog and attacked." The inquest heard an ambulance was called and CPR was attempted but Archie was pronounced dead at the scene at 16:02 BST. Senior Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: "Please let condolences be expressed to Archie's family at this very dreadful time for them." A full hearing will take place in December.	A dog that mauled a four-month-old baby to death snatched the boy from his mother's arms, an inquest has heard.
Shaun Ritchie, 20, was last seen with friends at a remote woodland area near Strichen on the night of Friday 31 October into the Saturday morning. Police Scotland said it had been one of the biggest ever search operations carried out by the force. There was no evidence, said the police, that he had been the victim of a crime. Insp Stewart Drummond said: "The searches carried out to locate Shaun have been extensive and also challenging due to the difficult terrain. "Items of Shaun's clothing were recovered as part of the early stages of the enquiry which would have placed him in the Greenburn area. "If Shaun has walked on from this area, as appears to be the case, we have no indication of the direction he has taken, which compounds further searches due to the size of terrain already searched." He explained:  "We have interviewed a number of people, including those who were with Shaun on the night he was last seen. "Although we will always keep an open mind as to the circumstances, there is no evidence to date which would indicate that Shaun has been a victim of any crime. "We understand this is a difficult time for Shaun's family who just want answers and not knowing where he is or what has happened to him is beyond frustration for them. "We are therefore again appealing for any information which may assist us in finding Shaun and ask people to come forward and contact Police Scotland." A CCTV image released earlier showed Mr Ritchie wearing dark grey skinny jeans, a white t-shirt, a grey hoodie and brown trainers.	Police investigating the disappearance of a Fraserbugh man have launched a fresh appeal for information six months after he was last seen.
But for one group of passengers - those who use wheelchairs - flying often turns into an upsetting and nerve-wracking experience, whatever the time of year. From problems getting on the plane, to difficulties checking in equipment, and even being unable to go to the toilet onboard, there is always something to worry about. But there is one issue that can really ruin a holiday: damage to the wheelchairs which are our mobility lifelines. My wheelchair has been damaged multiple times, including on a recent EasyJet flight to Portugal at the end of July. So I set out to uncover the scale of the problem. I use a powerchair to get around; my cerebral palsy means my arms are too weak to propel a manual wheelchair. The chair is custom-built, heavy and extremely expensive. When I fly, my chair goes in the hold. On two successive trips in 2013, to Dublin and Barcelona, it came off the flight home making a foreboding rattling sound. A few weeks later, it stopped working. The repairs were costly and left me stuck in my university room, entirely reliant on others. If I was going to continue travelling, I needed another plan. I thought I'd solved the problem when I invested in another chair, which is specifically designed for travelling by air. The expensive piece of kit consists of a manual chair and an attachable motor. When flying, the motor can be stored in a suitcase. The idea is that breakable parts are kept safe. And yet, when I came to reassemble my chair after I arrived in Portugal last week, the motor had been bent out of shape. Five of my friends could not reattach it to the manual frame. (EasyJet says it is "very rare" for its ground handling companies to damage wheelchairs. When it does happen, they say, they arrange for repairs and a replacement chair. The airline also points out its customer satisfaction amongst passengers with reduced mobility was 84% in 2016). I spent the whole holiday in Portugal unable to move independently more than a few metres. And it turns out that my experience is far from unique. After flying more than 40,000 miles all over the world this year, Dan Dorszynski's wheelchair was broken on a short flight from Philadelphia to Detroit. "The cargo guys couldn't fit it into the cargo door so they crammed it in and broke the backrest, armrest, and a few other things on my chair," he says. Although his chair was "drive-able", Dorszynski says it couldn't be fixed in time for his next trip. He bought a used version of the same model to take instead. "Upon leaving Sweden on the way to return home, the airline insisted that I check this chair at the ticket counter instead of taking it to the gate because it was too heavy. "I argued a bit... however it was fruitless and I just decided to let them have it so it would not be an issue. "I get to Chicago and after all that, my back-up chair never made it on the first flight. Here I am two days later wondering where that chair is." Michaela Hollywood has also had difficulties when flying. "Pretty much every time I've flown before [her most recent flight] there have been problems," she says. "My chair has been lost for two weeks, only half of it brought back; stuck on the plane, stuck on the ground... my dad once had to actually put it into the hold himself." And Jeff Courtade was left "bedbound" in his house for "nearly a month" after a flight from San Francisco to Washington DC. His highly-customised and pain-relieving chair was bent and rendered immobile. "I am terrified of flying now," he says. 'A cultural problem' In my opinion, the problem has three parts: In the eyes of the industry, it seems, a wheelchair is the same - and as robust - as any other piece of luggage. I have seen my own motor being flung into a trolley of suitcases. Others have found their powerchairs lying on their sides on conveyor belts. Staff often do not know what they are handling - moving specially-positioned backrests and unplugging vital parts of chairs which cannot just be reattached. Chairs get lifted and pushed in ways that damage them. My powerchair's brakes were destroyed when staff pushed it without following instructions to set it to its manual settings. All wheelchairs are different, but some basic training in how they usually work would go a long way. Once a wheelchair is damaged, it is difficult and expensive to get it fixed. Transporting a broken powerchair involves specific vehicles and a lot of strength (they regularly weigh over 100kg). Spare parts, particularly for customised chairs, can take weeks to arrive and cost hundreds of pounds. A new chair could cost thousands. Being awarded compensation for these costs is also an uphill struggle. "The issue is cultural rather than operational," says Roberto Castiglioni, who set up the organisation Reduced Mobility Rights after experiencing the challenges of travelling with his disabled son. He now helps others to make successful compensation claims for damage or mistreatment. Thanks to the division of responsibilities between airports and airlines, there is "endless (and useless) finger-pointing when something goes horribly wrong," he says. As for me, I eventually made it home from Portugal to the comfort and ease of my powerchair. I'll be setting off on my holidays again next year - perturbed but thankfully not deterred. But many will find themselves unwilling to entrust their most important belongings to an industry which - all too often - seems not to recognise their value.	The stress of air travel has increased this summer, with long queues reported across Europe because of tighter security and immigration checks.

The hosts closed on 152-3, a lead of 128, after 10 wickets fell in the day. Mehedi Hasan Miraz (6-82) reduced England to 144-8 but Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid put on 99 to give England a first-innings lead of 24. However, Imrul Kayes hit an unbeaten 59 and Mohammad Mahmudullah made 47 as Bangladesh regained the initiative. Mahmudullah was bowled by England debutant Zafar Ansari with the final ball of the day after the left-arm spinner had earlier dismissed Tamim Iqbal for his first international wicket. Bangladesh's only victories since their first Test in 2000 have come against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Another fluctuating Test sees England on the back foot and Bangladesh once again contemplating victory. England's bowlers created little pressure and it isn't immediately obvious who will step up tomorrow morning to bowl Bangladesh out. What is certain is that 250 would take some getting and Bangladesh are well on course for setting England a real challenge. Mehedi, 19, tormented England in the first Test in Chittagong and became only the third spinner to take five wickets in the first innings of each of his first two Test matches. Having taken two wickets on day one to reduce England to 50-3, off-spinner Mehedi bowled Moeen Ali in the third over of the day, with the England all-rounder playing an ill-advised sweep. Ben Stokes was out in the following over, caught off Taijul Islam, bringing Jonny Bairstow to the crease. He put on 45 with Joe Root to steady the visitors after they had slipped to 69-5, but Mehedi returned to trap Bairstow lbw for 24 with his first ball of a new spell - and then had Ansari caught at gully for his fifth wicket of the innings. Media playback is not supported on this device Root batted well to score his 23rd Test half-century, but when Taijul took his wicket England were rocking at 144-8. However, Woakes (46) and Rashid (44) excelled as Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim rotated his bowlers, their partnership of 224 balls and 127 minutes taking England from a deficit of 76 into the lead. The stand was England's highest for the ninth wicket in Asia and was in stark contrast to the Bangladesh innings, where they fell from 171-1 to 220 all out. The partnership perhaps should have been cut short, though. Woakes, on 38 at the time, hit a high full toss from Sabbir Rahman straight to the mid-wicket fielder, but he was given a reprieve when TV umpire Chris Gaffaney judged that the ball had reached the batsman above waist height and gave a no-ball, despite later replays suggesting the wicket should have stood. Woakes was eventually out when Mehedi returned with the new ball and claimed his sixth wicket, while Steven Finn was the last man out for 0 off the bowling of Taijul. Bangladesh's openers Tamim and Kayes batted positively in the final session to wipe out England's lead, reaching 65 before Ansari dismissed Tamim to claim his first Test wicket. England captain Alastair Cook then caught Mominul Haque at slip off Stokes in next over and the tourists seemed to have the momentum. However, Kayes and Mahmudullah played freely to put on 86 before Mahmudullah played a loose attacking shot and was bowled by Ansari with what turned out to be the final ball of the day. Bangladesh scored at almost five runs per over in the final session as Finn and Rashid, both wicketless in the first innings, went at six runs per over, while Woakes conceded 14 from his two overs. England all-rounder Chris Woakes on BBC Test Match Special: "That wicket at the end gives us a bit of hope going into tomorrow. I think we've had a reasonably good day. "We'd have liked to have got a few more runs early on this morning but the partnership between myself and Rash got us up ahead of them. "I don't think the pitch will get any better - it will only get worse, if anything. We've got a long batting line-up but we don't want to chase too many. "It's important when we come out tomorrow we firstly try to keep the run rate down so they don't get away from us, but also look to take wickets. It's a tricky thing to do. "If we can pick up a few early ones, we know they can roll easily."	England face a battle to prevent Bangladesh earning their most famous Test victory after an absorbing second day of the second Test in Dhaka.
Oldham went in front in the fifth minute when Marc Klok delivered a free-kick from the right to the far post, where unchallenged defender Peter Clarke scored with a downward header. Bradford dominated the rest of the opening period as the visitors' defence survived a series of narrow escapes. Keeper Connor Ripley made a brilliant one-handed save to deny winger Mark Marshall, Timothee Dieng and Josh Cullen both had shots deflected for corners, and Billy Clarke missed a good chance when he turned James Meredith's cross wide. Oldham somehow held their lead until half-time, but Bradford deservedly equalised after 57 minutes when Ousmane Fane dragged Cullen to the ground and Clarke scored from the spot. Bradford continued to dominate, but could not turn possession into goals as Oldham's defence held firm. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Pae Jun-ho, known in the US as Kenneth Bae, smuggled anti-government materials and plotted the state's downfall, a Supreme Court spokesman told state news agency KCNA. He denied Mr Bae was being used as a "political bargaining chip" with the US. Mr Bae was detained last year after entering North Korea as a tourist. North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytism. They were released after intervention from high-profile American figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both of whom went to Pyongyang. The court spokesman told KCNA that Mr Bae was "dispatched to China as a missionary". There he was involved in setting up "plot-breeding bases" from which he "infiltrated at least 250 students" into the North Korean port city of Rason with the aim of "bringing the government down". US citizens held by N Korea "He committed such hostile acts as egging on overseas [North Korean] citizens and foreigners to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign," he said. He added Mr Bae's full confession was the reason why he did not receive a possible death sentence. "He dared commit such hideous crimes as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership," he said. The spokesman denied that Mr Bae was "not tried in a transparent matter and [the North] was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip". Mr Bae, 44, was arrested in November as he entered Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. South Korea activists believe he was arrested for taking pictures of starving children. Other reports have described him as a devout Christian. His conviction on 30 April came amid high tension between the US and North Korea, after Pyongyang's third nuclear test. The UN expanded sanctions against the communist state in March, in the wake of its 12 February nuclear test and December long-range rocket launch. Pyongyang reacted angrily both to the measures and the annual US-South Korea military exercises, threatening to attack US military bases and cutting key hotlines with its southern neighbour.	North Korea has released details of the alleged crimes of a US man it sentenced to 15 years of hard labour.
There could be "serious implications" for Gloucestershire Police, the police and crime commissioner has warned. Cotswold District Council's proposal to form a unity authority with West Oxfordshire has proved controversial. But CDC says the plans - dubbed 'Coxit' - are at an early stage but aim to improve accountability. CDC leader Lynden Stowe has said Gloucestershire's "historic borders" would remain under the proposals, which aim to improve the "administration and the delivery of council services". He told BBC Radio Gloucestershire a few weeks ago: "We would expect the police to patrol up to the existing county borders, exactly as now, so if there's a crime in Cirencester, Gloucestershire Police attend and if there's a burglary in Burford, Thames Valley Police attend." But Gloucestershire's PCC Martin Surl said he had taken legal advice on the "Coxit" proposal, and warned it could "signal the end of Gloucestershire Police as we know it". Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, he said the Cotswolds could become part of Thames Valley Police District. "If they break away to a new district, we can't continue policing just half a district," he told the BBC. "So, either we start taking some of Thames Valley's area in Oxfordshire, or they start policing parts of Gloucestershire. Neither want that ." A spokesman for Cotswold District Council said they "fully understand the initial concerns" but they were "best addressed through the detailed studies that will now take place to assess the feasibility of the unitary proposal". Mr Surl, an independent, is standing for re-election as Gloucestershire PCC on 5 May, alongside Labour's Barry Kirby and the Conservatives' Will Windsor Clive.	The Cotswolds could be policed by the Thames Valley force if plans to "break away" from Gloucestershire County Council go ahead, it is claimed.
The breakdown service, which also reported a rise in personal memberships of 0.4% to 3,335,000 in the six months to the end of January, said it had so far absorbed the price rise. Insurance premium tax (IPT) was 6% in 2015, but is going up to 12% from June. The AA said it would look at its fees if the tax increased again. "We have managed to protect our members," the AA explained. "But this is an industry-wide challenge and we will need to review our pricing policy in the context of any future increase in IPT." The increase in memberships - an "important milestone", according to the company - halted a long-standing drop in figures. It came after the AA signed up more members, with a 19% rise in new business year-on-year, and kept more existing customers, with its retention rate improving to 82%. It added that there was a 5% rise in the number of breakdown call-outs in the 12 months to the end of January, again reversing a trend of gradual decline, which it described as "unhelpful for costs in the short term". However, the company explained that this did increase the chances of people renewing their membership. The AA has been investing in technology, with more than a fifth of its members (22%) using its app in breakdowns, while its newly-launched in-house underwriter recorded 115,000 car insurance policies in its first year, more than expected.	The AA has warned that it may have to raise its prices because the government has doubled the tax rate on insurance policies in less than two years.
The Tigers trailed 12-4 at the break after tries from Mark Percival and Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook. However, Cas, for whom debutant Kieran Gill scored in the first half, reduced the deficit through Mike McMeeken. Tom Holmes crossed to secure a seventh straight victory for Daryl Powell's side. Second-placed Salford Red Devils were beaten 34-24 at home by Wakefield. Powell, whose side played three games in nine days last week, made several changes, following the lead of other Super League coaches this weekend as he described their schedule as "a nonsense" and "appalling". In contrast, Saints, who went into the game after a nine-day rest, will be disappointed they did not do more with the pressure they had at the start of the second half when leading by eight points. Cas return to action with a home game against struggling Warrington next Sunday, while Saints host improving Widnes on Friday. Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "It's one of the biggest wins I've been involved in. "For a team that had been played about with to roll into a game against opposition that had a significant rest period on us and a full-strength team and come out with that kind of performance was awesome. "We had to dig in right at the end and the amount of scrambled tackles to keep them out shows the character we've got. "What we've become as a club is we've got genuine depth and belief that we've got something special here." St Helens coach Justin Holbrook: "We knew it was going to be a tough game and it would have been great to win. To fall just short is very disappointing. "Castleford obviously weren't at full strength but they haven't lost here for a reason. They're a very good footy side and they showed that again today. "But it was a missed opportunity. They had the luxury to rest a few today because of where they are sitting in the table and they earned that. "For us to fall just short, it's really costly for where we're sitting in the table. "It was disappointing we didn't get the win but I'm really happy with the squad and we came really close today. It's important we just move on to next week." Castleford: Eden; Gill, Webster, Monaghan, Minikin; Roberts, T Holmes; Lynch, McShane, Massey, Foster, Larroyer, Sene-Lefao. Replacements: McMeeken, Moors, Hitchcox, Trueman. St Helens: Makinson; Swift, Morgan, Percival, Grace; Lomax, Smith; Walmsley, Roby, Amor, Taia, Wilkin, Knowles. Replacements: Lee, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Douglas, Thompson. Referee: Chris Campbell (RFL).	Castleford Tigers came from behind to beat St Helens at The Jungle and extend their lead at the top of Super League to four points.
Jackie Stokes, from Burton-upon-Trent, said she spent Â£9,500 on implants in Hungary but an investigation found her treatment plan caused "irreversible damage to otherwise healthy teeth". Dentist Dr Zsolt Csillag was given a one-year supervision order by the General Dental Council. He did not respond to attempts to contact him. The Forest and Ray Medical Care Group said he had left the company due to "personal reasons". The clinic said it "always puts patients first" and treated Mrs Stokes with extra care, above and beyond its normal routine. Mrs Stokes said: "It has left me feeling like I have been assaulted, butchered and robbed of my life savings. "I was advised by an NHS dentist to go down the implant road... because it wasn't on the NHS I would go seek help elsewhere. "A friend of mine had been over to Hungary so we decided to go down that line," the 65-year-old added. Mrs Stokes had implants in her upper jaw and crowns on eight teeth in her lower jaw, over two trips to Budapest. On her second visit in June 2013, she said she was left with a "bulldog bite" - a gap between her gums and upper teeth through which food would seep. The implants failed and were later removed. She now has to wear dentures. In total, Mrs Stokes said she had 27 visits to the dental group over four years. The General Dental Council found Dr Csillag should not have put crowns on her eight lower teeth because they were healthy. In relation to Mrs Stokes and another patient, his treatment plan for them included "irreversible damage to otherwise healthy teeth", the investigation found. The restrictions placed on Dr Csillag can only be imposed when he is working in the United Kingdom.	A woman who spent her life savings on dental implants that had to be taken out feels "butchered" by the dentist.
Some people, including Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, questioned how this transfer could be allowed under European football's governing body Uefa's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Remember, the £198m is only the initial outlay - PSG will also have to pay the Brazilian star that amount in wages over a five-year contract, as well as hefty fees to his father who is his agent and insurance premiums to protect their investment. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu had threatened to report PSG to Uefa for breaching FFP rules. But Uefa does not have the power to block the deal. In a statement, it told the BBC: "We are not in a position to stop clubs from buying players, but the clubs will face sanctions if they fail to abide by Financial Fair Play rules." Uefa introduced break-even FFP rules in 2013 to stop clubs accumulating too much debt and to prevent wealthy owners from injecting too much cash into their clubs. The rules state that over a three-year period a club like PSG, which is owned by the Gulf state of Qatar via its Oryx Qatar Sports Investments fund, can spend 30m euros more than it earns. It is possible that PSG has accumulated lots of profits over the past two years to make it easier for them to make such a big outlay in the current year. Uefa allows spending on things like stadiums, youth development and women's teams to be excluded from the calculations. Barcelona was given the whole transfer fee up front, but that does not mean it has to all be accounted for in the current year. "For FFP accounting purposes, the transfer fee will be divided over the length of the player's contract," says Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at Sheridans. "So if it's a five-year deal, that will count as around £40m of transfer spending per year." But £40m a year plus wages is still a hefty outlay, so how might PSG balance the books? There has been much talk of the club recouping the outlay by selling lots of Neymar shirts, but Mr Geey is not optimistic. "It's a complete misnomer that clubs make a fortune from shirt sales increasing after big transfers," he says. Kit deals tend to involve a big outlay up front with only limited profit-sharing of 10% to 15% after a certain number of shirts have been sold, he explains, so many millions of extra shirts would have to be sold to make serious inroads into the extra spending. Of course, it may mean the club receives more money from Nike when it comes to renegotiate, but its current deal runs until 2022. PSG is presumably confident that such a high-profile player will help it to sign other commercial deals and there is no limit to the number of official products they could have. We do not know what deal has been struck over Neymar's image rights, but if PSG can get a proportion of those it will help with meeting the FFP rules. Then there is money to be earned on the pitch. PSG is already making a considerable amount of money in the Champions League - in the last five years it has reached the quarter-finals four times and been knocked out in the round of 16 once. Last year, a team getting to the semi-final was paid an extra 7.5m euros (£6.7m), the losing finalists earned 11m euros (£9.9m) and the winner 15.5m euros (£14m). And that's just prize money, there are other pots of cash distributed to successful teams. The club came second in the French league last year but had won the title for the previous four years so there is not much scope for extra prize money there. They may argue that their huge acquisition will make French football more popular and lead to more lucrative television deals from around the world, but that would be a big impact for a single player, although it might help them sell expensive hospitality packages at their stadium the Parc des Princes. Of course, PSG could always balance the books by selling a few of their existing players, but losing them would not help their Champions' League ambitions. PSG fell foul of the FFP rules in 2014 when Uefa ruled that a £167m commercial contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority was unfairly generous - effectively, the governing body ruled that Qatar had been using the contract to bypass the FFP rules. They were given a £20m fine, their spending was capped at £49m and they competed in the 2014-15 Champions League with 21 players in their squad instead of the usual 25.

It took 72 firefighters five hours to extinguish the fire in Trebovir Road, Earl's Court, after being called at about 21:45 BST on Sunday. They rescued 12 people from inside the building, three from one next door and two from the roof of a neighbouring property. Nobody was hurt but 150 people were evacuated. The whole of the second floor of the hotel was damaged by fire, three quarters of the third floor and all of the roof. Station manager Winston Douglas said: "This was a serious fire and crews and worked very hard to stop the fire spreading."	Seventeen people were rescued after a huge fire ripped through a hotel and block of flats in west London.
The strike is over a 1% pay rise that was awarded last year to all midwives in England, Scotland and Wales. The Department of Health said officials worked to ensure a safe service was provided during the stoppage. It said midwives in Northern Ireland had the same settlement as colleagues in England. "While we would like to be in a position to have done more in 2014/15, it is important to recognise midwives and other non-medical staff received a minimum of 1% extra with the average rise through incremental progression being 3.7% and some staff receiving 6.7% more," a spokesperson said. While the most senior midwives in Northern Ireland got the rise in a one-off payment last March, those on lower pay bands did not. Instead, most received the annual uplift of around Â£1,500. According to the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), all midwives should receive the 1% increase like elsewhere in the UK, regardless of their band, as well as the uplift in salary that is built in to the pay system. It has emerged that talks resumed on Tuesday between the Department of Health and some of the health unions. While those negotiations have been described as positive, further industrial action is planned, including claiming for all overtime. Amy Leversidge of the RCM said the department was "being cheeky" to suggest that midwives in Northern Ireland had received the same pay rise as their English colleagues. She said staff on higher pay bands had received a 1% "temporary uplift" to their basic pay in February, but at the start of the financial year in April, their pay went back to 2013 levels. Incremental progression based on experience and performance was a part of the NHS pay structure rather than a pay rise, the union's employment relations adviser said. "We don't want to wait until February 2016 to find out what's happening - we want to negotiate a solution now," she said. Midwife Hazel McAllister told the BBC: "We are not any less passionate, caring or hard-working than colleagues in other parts of the UK who have gained this 1% pay rise. "We feel very undervalued by the powers-that-be who have refused to pay this. "I have been a midwife for 37 years - it's a fantastic profession but I would worry about its future."	Midwives in Northern Ireland staged a four-hour strike from 08:00 BST and 12:00 BST on Thursday in a pay dispute.
The Czech world number 233 edged Estonia's 99th-ranked Kontaveit - who beat Britain's Heather Watson in the first round - 6-4 7-6 (8-6). Vondrousova had beaten Czech compatriot and world number 18 Barbora Strycova in the semi-final. Sunday's victory moves her close to the top 100 for the first time. Croatia's Borna Coric saved five match points to defeat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 5-7 7-6 (7-3) 7-5 to clinch his first ATP title at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech. Coric, the 20-year-old world number 79, trailed 3-0 in the second set and 4-2 in the decider before he rallied to beat the third-seeded Kohlschreiber, who was bidding for an eighth title.	Marketa Vondrousova, a 17-year-old qualifier, beat Anett Kontaveit in the final of the Biel Bienne Open in Switzerland to win her first WTA title.
Sen McCain has repeatedly called for the US to provide military aid to members of the Syrian insurgency. He becomes the highest ranking US official to travel to Syria, though McCain spokesman Brian Rogers did not give further details about the visit. News of the trip came as US Secretary of State John Kerry met his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Paris. The US currently provides non-lethal aid to opposition groups in Syria, where an estimated 70,000 people have been killed since violence broke out in March 2011. Rebels call for arms Sen McCain, the top Republican on the Senate armed services committee, is understood to have entered Syria through Turkey and was on the ground there for several hours. He travelled with the Syrian Emergency Task Force and met General Salim Idris, chief of staff of the rebel Free Syrian Army, as well as 18 other rebel commanders, the BBC has learned. Gen Idris called for weapons to continue their fight, as well as a no-fly zone and air strikes on government targets. These are all steps that Arizona Sen McCain has previously urged the Obama administration to take. Gen Idris also urged airstrikes on the forces of Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group whose forces have been fighting in Syria on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad. Sen McCain -  who was the Republican presidential candidate in 2008 - has repeatedly urged more forceful American support of Syrian rebels, calling for US cruise missiles to target Syrian government forces. After unverified reports emerged last month that Syrian government forces had used chemical weapons on rebels, the hawkish 76-year-old senator renewed his calls for the establishment of a no-fly zone. He has also repeatedly urged that the insurgents should be armed. But the Obama administration has demurred, amid concerns that weapons might fall into the hands of al-Qaeda sympathisers. Earlier this month, American Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford briefly crossed into northern Syria to meet opposition leaders - in his first visit to the country since he left in February 2012 when the US closed it mission there.	US Senator John McCain has visited Syria to meet rebels in the war-torn country, his office has told the BBC.
The tiny crustaceans are a naturally-occurring parasite that can cause disease and are responsible for many losses to wild and farmed fish stocks. With resistance to chemical treatments rising, the Glasgow team has been looking at breeding resistance. It has now come up with a new protocol to breed resistant fish and developed a mathematical model to predict outcomes. Sea lice can cause skin lesions and increased susceptibility to infections by suppressing the host's immune system. The parasite is estimated to cost the worldwide fish farming industry hundreds of millions of pounds a year. Professor Michael Stear said: "Sea lice infection is a major threat to the health of farmed salmon and to the fish-farming economy. "Our research has produced a practical tool for quantifying resistance to sea lice and shown that selection could substantially reduce the need for drug treatments. "Selective breeding for sea lice resistance should reduce the impact of sea lice on fish health and thus greatly improve the sustainability of Atlantic salmon production." The study outlining the Glasgow University model is published in the Royal Society journal Interface. WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "There is no doubt that sea lice are a major problem for Scotland's salmon farming industry and that large amounts of chemicals are currently used to combat the problem. "If we are to protect the wider environment, then finding ways to reduce the industry's reliance on chemicals is to be welcomed. "However, as chemical use is only one of a number of environmental impacts from salmon farming, we need to see more farms sign up to the Aquaculture Stewardship Council's "responsible farming" labelling scheme, and pledge to operate more sustainably in all aspects of their operations."	Researchers at Glasgow University have developed a new way to protect farmed salmon from sea lice.
Mark Roy Mason, 48, was assaulted outside Home Bargains on Marsh Road, Rhyl, at 19:25 BST on Thursday. He was taken to hospital but later died. North Wales Police said a white Renault Kangoo drove into the car park, followed by a black 4x4. It is understood the offenders got out of the black vehicle and attacked Mr Mason before making off. Det Ch Insp Jason Devonport said it was "a truly shocking incident". He added: "We believe this to be a targeted attack, but the reason for this attack is yet to be established." Mr Mason's family and the coroner have been informed. The store was closed on Friday and a police cordon put in place in the car park.	A man who died after being stabbed in a car park in Denbighshire, prompting a murder investigation, has been named.
Robin Hood, also known as Tim Pollard, appropriately met Sally Chappell at a banquet at the city's former Sheriff's Lodge venue. The couple now have a two-year-old daughter called Scarlett. Instead of wedding presents they have asked for donations towards a relaxing space for Ms Chapell, who has incurable breast cancer. Mr Pollard, 52, said: "I think one of the first times I met her, I threw axes at her as part of the show. "I can't say that will work as dating advice for everyone, but it did for me." Speaking about his fiancÃ©e's cancer diagnosis, he said: "We both had a bit of a weep and now we are just carrying on anyway. "We were planning on getting married, so that's what we're doing." Mr Pollard has been playing Nottingham's famous outlaw for more than two decades. He was in need of a Maid Marian so he asked Ms Chappell, who was also into re-enactments. "It's the best chat-up line in the world really - 'Will you be my Maid Marian?'," said Mr Pollard. "Except it wasn't a chat-up line. We worked together as Robin and Maid Marian for years just as friends and neither of us thought about going out with each other. "And then five years ago, we just kind of went 'You know this pretending to be in love thing that we're doing? I quite like you' and we got together." Ms Chappell, 39, is also a lecturer and researcher in human molecular genetics at the University of Nottingham. "You can't pull the wool over her eyes about the seriousness of her condition because of her work but she has just been amazing with it," said Mr Pollard. Ms Chappell said: "We've been a couple for several years now and even have a beautiful two-and-a-half-year-old baby daughter, Scarlett, so maybe it's time for me to make an honest man of Robin." The couple are getting married later this month in Buxton, Derbyshire. Guests will include the Pied Piper of Hamelin, from Germany. Even Robin Hood's arch enemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham, has wished the couple well on their big day. Jackie Morris, who holds the ceremonial role of the Sheriff, said: "I'm delighted the legendary love story of Robin Hood and Maid Marian, better known locally as Tim and Sally, is going to be celebrated on their wedding day. "Tim dubbed me the 'nice' Sheriff, but even so I will leave him in peace on his wedding day. I'm sure family, friends, their daughter Scarlett and the Merry Men will help them celebrate in style. "Myself and the whole of Nottingham will be celebrating with them in spirit and we wish them all the best for a happy wedding day."	Nottingham's official Robin Hood is to marry Maid Marian after they fell in love while playing the famous couple.
Stocktrade is being transferred to the Dundee-headquartered firm for £14m in cash. Its most recent annual revenue was £9m, with £1.3m in pre-tax profit. Last September, Stocktrade had £4.3bn of assets under management. The buyer said it now stands at £4.6bn, bringing 48,000 new customers. That should increase the scale of Alliance Trust Savings to £11.5bn in assets under management, with 105,000 customers, allowing for more efficient operations. It will also increase the Dundonians range of services, including telephone and online share dealing services for pension providers, building societies, company share schemes and corporate Individual Savings Accounts. Brewin Dolphin said the sale would only clear a net gain of £1m, after paying for separation costs. The deal still requires clearance from regulators, and is expected to close during this year. Alliance Trust Savings was part of the strategy last month criticised by Elliott Advisers, the hedge fund and activist investor in parent company Alliance Trust. In criticising the Dundee company's management, it succeeded in getting two new directors appointed. They could have sought to block further expansion of the financial retail platform. But it appears, from this deal, that they have agreed to expenditure on growth. Alliance Trust believes that the expansion could help its savings division into profit by 2016, apart from the cost of integration. Patrick Mill, managing director of Alliance Trust Savings (ATS), said: "Stocktrade is a great strategic fit for ATS, giving us access to new customers, an increase in assets and the opportunity to build a strategic partnership capability. "It also gives us the ability to align a traditional stockbroking business with our innovative, scalable and cost effective approach by offering customers online access alongside our in-house customer service team."	Alliance Trust Savings has announced plans to buy an Edinburgh-based share trading company from Brewin Dolphin.

Nottinghamshire Police were present when the man fell from a building in the Radford area of Nottingham on Friday evening. A witness told the Nottingham Post he survived the first fall before running to another flat and falling again. Police are not treating the death of the man, in his mid-30s, as suspicious. Officers were called to Waterloo Road at about 19:30 GMT.	The death of a man who twice apparently jumped from a building has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims. It has called on the government to offer tax breaks to encourage building and investment in the sector. The Conservative Party has indicated its focus remains on home ownership. The number of UK households renting property rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 5.4 million in 2014, according to Rics. It said that any further investment in property by landlords had been hit by changes to stamp duty in April. Anyone buying a home that is not their main residence must now pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated. This led to a spike in property purchases in March, with transactions falling quickly again thereafter. Next year, landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill is removed. Rics suggests that the stamp duty increase should be reversed, a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors. Generation Rent, a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants, said the higher rate of stamp duty was a good thing. "It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up," said Dan Wilson Craw, the policy manager of Generation Rent. "In the first three months of the surcharge, the tax on second homes raised £424m - that cash could help build new homes for people on low incomes." A body that represents landlords said that rents were likely to rise. "Tenants will be hurt most, as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more," said David Cox, the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA). "The simple answer is that we need to build more homes." In addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase, Rics also called for: Rics' call comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take "unprecedented steps" to encourage construction of homes for people to buy. He told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was "a huge issue for our country" and would be his "number-one priority". He said: "Far too many young people cannot get a foot on the housing ladder. Many are being forced to live back with mum and dad as rents soar faster than wages." Among the plans announced was an Accelerated Construction scheme, using £2bn of new public sector borrowing to make public land with outline planning permission available to builders. Where can I afford to live?	The UK is facing a "critical rental shortage" which requires a building programme to focus on providing for tenants, a surveyors' body has said.
But such apparently excessive pay is not a new concern. Back in the early 1960s the Conservative government was interested in cutting back the sprawling and loss-making British railway network. The man who was chosen for the job was a senior ICI director called Dr Richard Beeching. He was appointed as chairman of the new British Railways Board in 1961 and two years later published his first, and infamous, report on "The Reshaping of British Railways". Even before he devised his controversial plans for pruning British Rail, there was another controversy, at least in the newspapers - over his pay. The Times reported in 1961 that Dr Beeching would be paid the same as his ICI salary while he was on secondment to the government. That was the then huge figure of £24,000, which was thirty times higher than the average annual UK salary of just over £800 a year and £14,000 more than that of the then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. "Is this man - or any man - worth pounds 450 a week?" thundered the Daily Sketch. Let's fast forward a couple more decades to the 1980s. It was then that the current trend for spiralling executive pay took root. According to some analyses, the touch paper was lit by the boom in City salaries that followed the Big Bang of financial deregulation in 1986. That prompted not only a bidding war for City traders and the like, but attracted a rush of US investment banks who set up in London. They brought with them American-style  pumped-up salaries, so fitting for the "greed is good" ethos famously espoused by the character Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street. Outside the City, in 1987, the boss of the Burtons men's clothing firm, Sir Ralph Halpern, was paid £1.3m, becoming the first million-pound-a-year-businessman in the process. Since then, we have seen a parade of ever-higher pay packages for supposedly top executives. Public indignation over the issue boiled up. In 1994, the then chief executive of privatised British Gas, Cedric Brown, was pilloried as Cedric the Pig. He had enjoyed a 75% pay rise to £475,000 a year, for running what had been a boring state owned utility only a few years before. By the late 1990s, according to the High Pay Commission, the ratio of top pay to average pay had risen to 47 times. What could be done? There were various reports into corporate governance in the 1990s (Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel) which pondered, among other things, how executive pay should be decided. None have had any effect on pay. And from time to time even big City shareholders have baulked at some of the more generous pay deals that executives have been able to wangle out of their companies, arguing that shareholders have been taken for a ride. So how to explain the boom in top salaries and pensions? The economist Paul Ormerod, who famously wrote a book "The Death of Economics" more than 20 years ago, wrote last year that we shouldn't look to his profession for an explanation. "Economics has no theory with which to explain the distribution of income," he said. "The simple fact is that executive pay is almost entirely determined by social values and norms. The sense of restraint, of noblesse oblige, which characterised much of Britain's post-war history, has vanished." A study by the London School of Economics shows that bosses' pay in 2014 was 160% larger in real terms than in 1999, whereas an average worker's salary has risen by just 10% over that time. But not everyone thinks "excessive" executive pay really matters. That reliable supplier of contrary economic views, the Adam Smith Institute, said in a blog: "Ultimately, it's hard to see the public interest argument here." "If shareholders are really missing a trick and overpaying their chief executives, who loses out? "Well, shareholders, in the form of lower profits. And they're the ones who stand to gain if they can fix that problem."	The average pay for chief executives of firms in the FTSE 100 index is now 144 times that of the UK's average salary, says the High Pay Centre.
The "marijuana resort" would have been the first of its kind, but concerns that the stockpile could be confiscated led tribe leaders to incinerate it. The tribe says it wants to show cooperation with federal officials for future negotiations. Whether the tribe can sell marijuana to non-Indians has come under question. Representatives for the US Department of Justice did not tell Santee Sioux tribe leaders a raid was imminent, but the government reserves a right to conduct a raid at any time and the tribe would risk one if all the concerns about the resort were not addressed. The Justice Department decided last year to let tribes grow marijuana on their land. Also in question is the origin of the marijuana seeds used for the tribe's crop. The tribe had planned on opening a lounge selling marijuana - for consumption only in the lounge - on New Year's Eve. "We just felt it would be best to go in with a clean slate to look for answers on how to proceed so that all sides are comfortable with it," said Flandreau Santee Sioux President Anthony Reider, adding that burning the crop was "in the best interest of both tribal and non-tribal members." The 400-person tribe, which already runs a casino, hotel and ranch, had predicted the marijuana sales would make up to $2m (Â£1.3m) per month. The lounge would have had games, food and a bar, and eventually a live music venue and slot machines. In September Mr Reider said he wanted it to be "an adult playground".	Fearing a federal raid, a South Dakota Native American tribe is burning its marijuana crop, which it had planned to sell in a resort on its land.
It is the joint-most corrupt country in the world with Somalia, according to Transparency International, and the same family has ruled since 1948. So why is it holding elections? And how reliable are they? Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people. The number of seats is determined by each district's population. In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 "officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals" were elected. The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party. Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box. Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason. In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas. Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census. "The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it", one North Korean defector told the NK News website. "It is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed." If the state works out you did not vote, NK News says, "you and your family are in trouble". Sunday's elections do not decide the leadership of the country. Parliamentary elections are also held in North Korea, and they decide who rules the country - which is always a foregone conclusion. Kim Jong-un won in the last parliamentary election in 2014 - gaining 100% of the vote in his Mount Paektu constituency.	Local elections are being held in North Korea - the first since ruler Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011.
Iain Duncan Smith said the raft of changes should save the taxpayer Â£50bn by the end of this Parliament. He said the reforms - including tougher criteria for people seeking disability allowances - would "help and benefit" those who wanted to return to work. The Disabilities Trust charity said the reforms were part of a "triple whammy" of factors hitting disabled people. Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: "I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people, who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not, going back to work." He said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work. "There were over a million [people] not looked at for over 10 years," Mr Duncan Smith said. "These regular reviews, I think, will help them and benefit them. We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people. The purpose is to try to support disabled people." He added: "The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work, and many are going back to work now, and those who need full support get that full support." The government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Under the old disability regime, claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance. Now, they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment. Mr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change, and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first, and then 50m. "What we're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments, and those who don't need the higher levels don't take the higher levels," Mr Duncan Smith said. Under the DLA system, he said, 70% of people who made a claim got awards "for life". The new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants' ailments. He said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects almost half of the Â£50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months. The raft of welfare reforms, introduced a year ago, also included what the government calls the removal of the "spare room subsidy" but critics call the "bedroom tax". Mr Duncan Smith, defending it, said it was not a tax but rather a "balanced and fair" policy for taxpayers. However, Sarah Clifford, director of communications for the Disabilities Trust, said the reforms were part of a "triple whammy" of factors affecting disabled people. She said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England, Scotland and Wales. The housing benefits changes - dubbed the "bedroom tax" by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a "spare room subsidy" - were introduced in April last year.  A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating "financial hardship and distress" for disabled people. Ms Clifford said: "We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities." Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos, which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work. Mr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement, saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract.	The work and pensions secretary has defended changes to the welfare system, including disability benefit reforms.
The Barcelona striker is ahead of team-mate Lionel Messi, who is valued by academics at £149m. The only England players in the top 10 are Tottenham duo Harry Kane (worth £122m) and Dele Alli (£96m). Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United for a record £89m in the summer, is worth £136.4m. The study has been carried out by a team of academics from the CIES Football Observatory, using a transfer value algorithm. They have calculated the value using criteria that includes player performance and characteristics, such as age and length of contract. Cristiano Ronaldo, the Ballon d'Or winner and Fifa's world's best player, is seventh on the list at £111m, with Real Madrid team-mate Gareth Bale 14th and valued at £73.8m, less than the £85.3m he cost the La Liga side in 2013. Pogba is the only player in the top five not based in Spain, with Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann third at £132m and Barcelona's Luis Suarez fifth (£127m). There are 42 Premier League players in the top 100 including Chelsea's Eden Hazard (£89m), Manchester United's Anthony Martial (£81m), Manchester City's Raheem Sterling (£75m) and Leicester City's Jamie Vardy (£45m). West Ham midfielder Michail Antonio makes the list at 100, with a value of £31m.	Neymar is the most valuable player in Europe - worth about £216m - according to a new study which values 10 players at more than 100m euros.
Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: "I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. "It is a disappointment that is widespread." A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was "a political problem". "We are not going to lie down and accept it," she said. "We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases." Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that "action can be taken as soon as possible". "Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner," he said. "This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits." A Department of Justice spokesman said: "Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. "There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners."	An inquest into an IRA massacre of 10 Protestant workers has been delayed because there is no coroner to hear it.
The German was 0.207 seconds quicker than Williams driver Valtteri Bottas. There was encouragement for struggling McLaren-Honda as Fernando Alonso set the third best time, albeit 1.7secs slower than Rosberg on the same tyres. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth, 1.8secs off Rosberg but on a tyre calculated to be 0.8secs a lap slower. Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat was fifth quickest, on the same 'soft' tyre that Rosberg and Alonso used, 0.2secs slower than the McLaren. World champion Lewis Hamilton drove in the afternoon as Mercedes continued their policy of using both race drivers in one day to avoid over-exerting them, as a result of the high mileage the team are covering. But Hamilton concentrated on a race-simulation run and did not record a representative one-off flying lap, setting the sixth quickest time on the same type of medium tyres used by Raikkonen. Sauber's 2016 car ran for the first time and Felipe Nasr was ninth fastest, 2.5secs off the pace. It is notoriously difficult to predict form from pre-season testing times because the teams do no release crucial data about the specifications in which their cars are running, such as fuel load, engine mode and so on. But all the indications so far are that Mercedes are again in the best shape before the start of the season in Australia on 18-20 March, with a car that is both fast and running with metronomic consistency. Ferrari, expected to be their closest rivals, did not show anything like equivalent pace, and nor have they enjoyed the same level of reliability. Raikkonen lost all but one hour of the afternoon on Tuesday after stopping out on track when the car became stuck in eighth gear. But Rosberg said on Tuesday: "It's very close between Ferrari and us - and another team might be there as well." Raikkonen's best time was set on the medium tyre - but that still means the Ferrari was a second off the Mercedes' pace assuming the cars were on similar fuel loads. The identity of the other team Rosberg is referring to was not clear - but the main candidates are Force India, Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso. Bottas' flying laps on Tuesday suggested that Williams are there or thereabouts at the head of the mix behind Mercedes, as they have been since they switched to the German engines in 2014. The Finn was 0.763secs off Rosberg when both used the soft tyre and 0.207secs when using the ultra-soft, which is reckoned to be about 1.2-1.3secs faster than the soft. "At the moment it looks like [Mercedes] are in a really strong position," he said. "Quite tricky for anyone to challenge them at the beginning of the season." Meanwhile, Alonso's pace on Tuesday was the first clear evidence that McLaren's engine partner Honda has indeed made a significant step forward with its engine over the winter. McLaren are running this week the definitive 2016 engine, although there are still updates to be added before the first race. As with all manufacturers, Honda will also be able to improve the engine through the season as in-season development, within certain restrictions, has been allowed. Toro Rosso, who ran the car in its definitive 2016 livery for the first time on Tuesday, have also been tipped as dark horses. The Red Bull junior team say they believe they can score podium finishes this season following switch from Renault to Ferrari power, albeit a 2015-specification engine. The new US-based Haas team ran very impressively during the first test, but they were hit by reliability gremlins on Tuesday, and Esteban Gutierrez was consigned to the garage for much of the day. Fastest times: 1 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes 1:23.022 2 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Williams 1:23.229 3 Fernando Alonso (Spa) McLaren 1:24.735 4 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:24.836 5 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Red Bull 1:25.049 6 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 1:25.051 7 Max Verstappen (Ned) Toro Rosso 1:25.176 8 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Force India 1:25.336 9 Felipe Nasr (Brz) Sauber 1:25.493 10 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Renault 1:25.760 11 Esteban Gutierrez (Mex) Haas 1:26.661 12 Rio Haryanto (Idn) Manor 1:27.699 Bottas set best time on ultra-soft tyres; Rosberg, Alonso, Kvyat, Verstappen, Magnussen, Hulkenberg, Nasr and Haryanto set best times on soft tyre; all others on medium	Nico Rosberg set the pace as world champions Mercedes continued their ominous form on the first day of the final Formula 1 pre-season test.
The winger, 29, was taken to hospital following the game in Beijing, which Chelsea won 3-0, and stayed overnight. He also suffered concussion but posted a message saying "everything is OK" before travelling back to London. Pedro is expected to wear a protective mask when he returns to training. The rest of the Chelsea squad are now in Singapore where they will play two games - against Bayern Munich on Tuesday and Inter Milan on 29 July.	Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says Pedro suffered multiple facial fractures in a collision with Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina in a friendly on Saturday but should return to training in 10 days.
Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said Christians were the most persecuted people, but few of them would receive sanctuary in the UK. The government has said 20,000 refugees will be brought to Britain directly from refugee camps around Syria. But Cardinal Nichols said most Christians did not go into the camps. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today, Archbishop Nichols said: "I can see the point in going directly to the refugee camps, but in fact I think its unintended consequence will be that there will be few, if any, Christians coming to this country. "That is because for the most part Christian refugees do not go into the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) camps. They go to fellow Christian organisations." He added: "If we are going to deal purely with UNHCR according to their rules, then there can be no preference given to anybody on behalf of their faith and we will simply bypass the Christian refugees, not intentionally but in fact." It comes as the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, will say that Britain has lost its sense of proportion in relation to the refugee crisis. In his Christmas sermon at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff he is expected to say that the "debate seems to be centred on how many refugees we should accept. We forget to ask, or perhaps we choose to forget, why there are so many refugees in the first place". The refugees being brought to the UK will be drawn from established refugee camps, initially as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme. More than 50 local authorities have taken a share of those who have already arrived. Alongside the VPR scheme, the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015.	Christian refugees fleeing Syria are being bypassed by the UK government, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has said.
Villa instead appointed Roberto Di Matteo, but he was sacked after 124 days and replaced by Steve Bruce. "They wanted bigger names I think, they took the lad [Di Matteo] and that is how it goes," Warnock said ahead of Cardiff's visit to Villa Park. "I thought at the time that's their loss not mine." The 67-year-old continued: ''There were about five clubs I spoke to. You have to look at that when you get to my age. "I would not be here if one or two of those things had cropped up, but I am really pleased I am here. It is probably fate." Warnock had discussions with a number of clubs in the summer, including Nottingham Forest, before joining Cardiff following the departure of Paul Trollope in October. Trollope has since been appointed assistant manager at Brighton, replacing Colin Calderwood who left to join Bruce at Villa. After sacking Di Matteo, who lasted just 12 games, Villa opted for former Hull manager Bruce just a week after Warnock had been installed at Cardiff. Warnock thinks Bruce is the right man to bring success to Villa following their Premier League relegation as he is a similar manager to himself. ''With Steve and myself you get what you see. I was disappointed I did not get a chance with Villa in the summer if I'm honest, because I thought it would have been ideal to sort everything out," Warnock told BBC Wales. "That is why I am not surprised at all Steve has gone in and done really well. "I am not saying we are similar types, but we have the same philosophies regarding management. ''I think Steve is the right one now. He knows it's a massive club. He will be looking forward to it. "We have had some right battles over the years. He knows he's in for a tough game on Saturday.'' Warnock believes Bruce, unbeaten at Villa, deserved a crack at the England job. ''Personally I thought he should have been England manager at the time," he said. "With his experience, playing wise, what he had done and his age and his enthusiasm, it was an ideal position for him in the summer. ''I know Gareth Southgate has done a good job, but I am surprised they have not spoken to Steve again.''	Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock says he was "disappointed" that he did not get a call from Aston Villa over their managerial vacancy in the summer.
The stricken robot, made by Knightscope, was spotted by passers-by whose photos of the aftermath quickly went viral on social media. For some, the incident seemed to sum up the state of 21st Century technology. "We were promised flying cars, instead we got suicidal robots," wrote one worker from the building on Twitter. "Steps are our best defence against the Robopocalypse," commented Peter Singer - author of Wired for War, a book about military robotics. It is not the first accident involving Knightscope's patrolling robots, which are equipped with various instruments - including face-recognition systems, high-definition video capture, infrared and ultrasonic sensors. Last year, a 16-month-old toddler was run over by one of the autonomous devices in a Silicon Valley shopping centre. And earlier this year, a Californian man was arrested after attacking a Knightscope robot. The man, who was drunk at the time of the incident, later said he wanted to "test" the machine, according to Knightscope.	A security robot in Washington DC suffered a watery demise after falling into a fountain by an office building.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had ordered all insurance companies to split out the extra charges for the additional protection. But the Co-op was the only firm which missed a deadline to do so, in August last year. As a result around 120,000 customers received quotations that were unclear. From 1 February, the Co-op will provide two separate quotations - one with no claims bonus protection, and one without. "It is very disappointing that a major company such as Co-op Insurance has taken so long to provide this vital information to its customers," said Adam Land, senior director of remedies, business and financial analysis at the CMA. "Before the order came into force, the price and benefits of NCB [no claims bonus] protection were often unclear to drivers. "We expect the Co-op to fully comply with the terms of our directions immediately, so that motorists can search more easily for the best deal for them, and decide whether or not they want this optional cover." The Co-op said most of its quotations do now provide separate details of no claims bonus charges. "For 90% of our new business customers we are already fully compliant with this order," a spokesperson said. "We are part way through a major transformation programme, which when complete will allow us to be fully compliant and enable us to provide best in class service to our members."	The Co-op has been ordered to provide clearer insurance quotations, after it failed to tell motorists about separate charges for no claims bonuses.
The Whitesands project would see the creation of a raised walkway along the waterfront area. The scheme has been revised a number of times to address public concerns about the river view and loss of car parking. Last year an estimate of project costs put the overall bill at between £15m and £17.8m. The Scottish government would provide 80% of the funding for the scheme with the remainder coming from Dumfries and Galloway Council. It has already approved nearly £4.5m towards the project which means it has a maximum of about £500,000 to find. A report to the local authority will ask it to agree that the project be officially published and adopted as a flood protections scheme. It cites a range of reasons for the increased costs which include: The council has spent nearly a year refining the scheme which it said had produced a range of "positive developments". Those actions include: Councillor Colin Smyth said: "I am pleased that we are now at the stage to seek committee agreement to commence the formal process of publishing the Whitesands project as a flood protection scheme. "It is unacceptable that the largest town in our region continues to flood. "That is why all councillors agreed for a flood protection and regeneration scheme to be progressed for the Whitesands, demonstrating the need for change and putting an end to the regular flooding that has plagued our regional capital for too long." He added that it was more than a flood protection scheme and could create a "high quality public open space" to encourage the use of the Whitesands.	A major flood protection scheme in Dumfries is set to make a step forward but has seen its cost estimate rise significantly to £25m.
Senior judges in Belfast have lifted an injunction on the PSNI taking possession of Winston Rea's recorded account to Boston College researchers. Detectives were present with a bag ready for the handover of the tapes. They were given the all-clear after lawyers for Mr Rea confirmed their final bid to secure a block had been turned down. The tapes had been held under lock and key at the Royal Courts of Justice. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg refused to grant an interim prohibition as part of efforts to stop the PSNI from obtaining them. A judge said the time had come "to lift the injunction and allow the materials to be examined by the police". Detectives want to access the recordings as part of their investigations into murder and other paramilitary crimes from the 1970s to 1990s. Mr Rea's legal team argued that it would breach his right to privacy. He was among dozens of loyalists and republicans who provided testimonies to Boston College staff compiling an oral history of the Northern Ireland conflict. Interviews were given on the understanding that tapes would not be made public until after their deaths. In 2013, detectives investigating the abduction and murder of Belfast mother-of-10 Jean McConville in 1972 secured the transcripts of former IRA woman Dolours Price's account. That material was handed over following court battles on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Rea's barrister said his client was "confident that there is nothing in his past or anything contained in these tapes which hasn't already been dealt with by the criminal courts". "He's a man who has health difficulties," he added. On that basis, lawyers for both the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) and the PSNI Chief Constable argued that the recordings should now be released.	Police are finally to get access to interviews a former loyalist prisoner gave to an American university project.
David Mackintosh was the leader of Northampton Borough Council when the authority authorised the loan to Northampton Town in 2013. The money has never been paid and the council is in the process of trying to get it back. Mr Mackintosh said "due diligence was carried out" before the loan was granted. The Conservative MP for Northampton South said he felt "angry, frustrated and upset" about the ongoing financial problems at the Cobblers. The club currently faces a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) over £166,000. This is due to be heard on 16 November. The £10.25m loan was originally given to the club for the re-development of its Sixfields stadium. Mr Mackintosh said all decisions over the loan were taken at the borough council's cabinet and followed "a lot of work" by officers. He said safeguards were put in place and were now being deployed by the council to recover the money. Mr Mackintosh said: "Clearly as leader I have to take some responsibility for what happened. "It is very frustrating because at the same time there are other things that haven't happened at the club. "There are serious questions to be answered." Club chairman David Cardoza previously told the BBC he expected the loan issue to be resolved by the end of last month.	An MP says he "has to take some responsibility" over an unpaid £10.25m loan to a football club.
Reports say the blast may have been caused by a letter bomb. Mr Papademos, 69, and his driver have suffered leg injuries but their lives are not believed to be in danger, the reports add. Mr Papademos was appointed caretaker prime minister in November 2011 amid political and economic turmoil. He served in post until May 2012. Mr Papademos has also served as vice-president of the European Central Bank. Current Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who is attending a Nato summit in Brussels, is being kept informed of the incident, Greek news agency ANA said. Mr Papademos and his driver, who has not been named, were reportedly rushed to Evangelismos Hospital. Some reports say two banking officials were also in the car, but their condition is not known. No group has said it was behind the blast. In March, a letter bomb sent from Greece exploded at the International Monetary Fund office in Paris. The employee who opened the letter suffered hand and face injuries and staff were evacuated. Days earlier, a parcel bomb meant for German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was intercepted and destroyed in Berlin before it could explode. Greek far-left group Conspiracy of Fire Cells said it was responsible for sending that device	Former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has been injured by an explosion inside his car in Athens.
The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) accused ministers of offering an "unworkable" guarantee to protect firefighters aged over 55 who fail fitness tests "through no fault of their own". The government said it had been "clear" that the staff would get full pensions. It said "robust" plans were in place to protect the public during the strike. In December, MPs approved plans to make firefighters in England work until they are 60 and to increase their pension contributions. Fire minister Penny Mordaunt said no firefighter over 55 would lose their job for losing fitness if it was not their fault. But the FBU says it has contacted fire authorities and "a number" said they would not uphold the guarantee. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack claimed: "It is clear that when Penny Mordaunt gave the guarantee in Parliament she would have been aware that no fire authority ever planned to implement the 'guarantee'." He said Ms Mordaunt had "misled" fire service staff and Parliament, and firefighters were "unbelievably angry with the disgraceful actions of this government". A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said firefighters who "fail a fitness test through no fault of their own and cannot regain fitness with remedial help" would get an "unreduced pension". The FBU said its members in Northern Ireland had ended their dispute following a "revised and improved offer with a lower pension age". It said members in Scotland and Wales would not strike because "genuine negotiations" had taken place.	Firefighters in England say their next one-day strike in the long-running dispute with the government over pensions will be on 25 February.
Australian Matthews, 25, of Orica-BikeExchange won a sprint finish ahead of Peter Sagan and Edvald Boasson Hagen to claim his first Tour victory. Slovak Sagan took the green points jersey from Briton Mark Cavendish. Defending champion Froome finished in the peloton, nine minutes 39 seconds behind Matthews, on the 197km stage from Escaldes-Engordany to Revel. Britain's Adam Yates, Matthews' 23-year-old team-mate, was in the same group to keep the white jersey for best young rider. 2013 and 2015 winner Froome and his main rivals enjoyed a relatively comfortable day, which started with a big climb but flattened out to suit a breakaway win. The main contenders for the yellow jersey were happy to let a group of 15 riders - none of whom threatened the overall lead - surge ahead. Britain's Steve Cummings, who won stage seven, was part of the breakaway but dropped back as two Orica team-mates helped Matthews earn an emotional win. Matthews said he came close to "giving up" on the Tour de France after breaking four ribs in a crash last year, and missing the 2014 race following an accident. But his win continued Orica's impressive Tour, with Yates second in the general classification standings, 16 seconds behind Froome. While Yates has produced some superb solo performances, Matthews was helped by team-mates Luke Durbridge and Daryl Impey as they neutralised the threat of Tinkoff's world champion Sagan. Durbridge's pace reduced the breakaway to seven riders before he dropped out, with Impey launching several attacks in the last few kilometres. Matthews waited until the final 200m to make his move, overtaking BMC's Greg van Avermaet and Sagan in the last 50m. "To have won a stage after two really bad years in the Tour de France, the emotion is just sinking in," said Matthews, who has also won stages at the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana. "I was close to giving up on this race, thinking it was maybe not for me, but today was incredible. "It was never the plan to go in the breakaway. We were hoping for bunch sprint after the last climb but we had strong guys, and whoever is up we give them 110%. Daryl and Luke gave me everything." Sagan overtook Cavendish in the green jersey standings after winning the intermediate sprint and finishing second to Matthews. Cavendish, who has won three stages in this year's race, finished in the peloton and now trails Sagan by 38 points. Sagan has won the green jersey in each of the past four years, and Manxman Cavendish, 31, said before this year's race that he cannot beat the world champion. Cavendish, whose tally of 29 career stage wins is bettered only by Eddy Merckx's 34, could challenge for a 30th on a largely flat stage 11, which takes the riders 162.5km (101 miles) from Carcassonne to Montpellier. 1.

Media playback is unsupported on your device 21 October 2014 Last updated at 09:51 BST Eleven-month-old Harmonie-Rose Allen became ill in September and was rushed into Bristol Children's Hospital where she was diagnosed with a rare form of meningococcal septicaemia. Harmonie-Rose's family want to raise money to help with her care and have stuck pink ribbons all around the estate where she lives. BBC reporter Ali Vowles went to meet the family.	A fundraising campaign is under way to help a baby girl from Bath who has to have all of her limbs amputated after contracting meningitis.
Four of those on board, three soldiers and an airman, were stationed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. The fifth, an Army reservist, was based in London. The Ministry of Defence said the crash near Kandahar air base appeared to have been a "tragic accident". It represents the third single biggest loss of life of British troops in Afghanistan since the conflict began. The families of all five servicemen have been told. Three of the soldiers on board the helicopter were from the Army Air Corps, based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, the MoD said late on Saturday. A fourth member of the crew was serving with the Royal Air Force and was also based at Odiham, while the fifth man was an Army reservist from 3 Military Intelligence Battalion, in London. Maj Gen Richard Felton, Commander Joint Helicopter Command, said: "It is with great sadness that we must confirm that five UK service personnel have been killed in this incident which, at this early stage, would appear to have been a tragic accident. "Events like this, whilst mercifully rare, remind us of the risks our personnel face in their work in Afghanistan as we approach the conclusion of the combat mission later this year. "Our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives." Prime Minister David Cameron said his "heart goes out to the families and friends of those killed in this terrible tragedy". Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was "tragic and poignant reminder of the sacrifices made by our armed forces in serving our country with bravery and distinction". It is the first fatal accident involving a UK military helicopter in Afghanistan since the conflict began in 2001. BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said sources had suggested the cause of the crash may have been "technical problems" on board the helicopter, despite claims by the Taliban that its fighters had shot it down. She said the location of the crash - close to the border with Pakistan - has also led to speculation that the helicopter could have been taking part in a special forces mission. It is understood the helicopter was a Westland Lynx Mk 9. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "We can confirm that a UK helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan today. "The incident is under investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further until families have been notified." The crash is understood to have happened around 30 miles from the Pakistan border, near Kandahar air base in the Takhta Pul district. The deaths bring the number of British forces killed in the conflict in Afghanistan to 453. The fatal crash comes after a Nimrod surveillance aircraft exploded in mid-air while supporting Nato ground operations near Kandahar, killing all 14 servicemen on board, in September 2006. This incident remains the biggest single loss of UK life at one time in Afghanistan. In 2012, six British soldiers were killed when a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle in Kandahar province was hit by an explosion. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) coalition of international forces said it was still in the process of reviewing the circumstances of Saturday's helicopter crash. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends affected by this tragic event," it said in a statement. Defence analyst Paul Beaver said all the indications are that the crash involved a Lynx helicopter, which he said has an "exceptional record". He said the light utility helicopter is likely to have been operating in "fairly mountainous areas", or in "challenging" terrain. "The key now will be looking at the weather," Mr Beaver told the BBC. "If enemy action is not suspected, which is what the MoD is saying, then you have to look at whether this might well be weather-related." The crash brings the total number of international troops killed in Afghanistan in April to seven. It comes after the last major helicopter crash took place in December last year, when seven Americans and four Afghans died. In August 2011, the Taliban shot down an American Chinook near Kabul, killing 30 Americans and eight Afghans in the deadliest single incident for US troops since the war began. Concerned family members can contact the MoD's Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre on 08457 800 900.	Five British service personnel have been killed in a UK helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan.
Last year serious floods hit north and mid Wales, and one woman died. Environment Minister John Griffiths announced that the Welsh government plans to spend £47m in 2013/14 on schemes to protect 1,000 homes. However, that is likely to be less than the amount spent on flood defences and dealing with coastal erosion in the previous two years. "We know our climate is changing and that as a result we are set to see, and have already seen, an increase in rainfall and storms," Mr Griffiths said. By working together and sharing knowledge "we can vastly improve our resilience to flooding in Wales", he said. Outlining his plans, Mr Griffiths said: "Continued investment in flood and coastal erosion risk management is a vital part of our work to manage flood risk, and in spite of a reduction in our overall budget from the UK government the Welsh government has maintained its level of investment in this area. "In 2013/14 I am investing £47m in flood and coastal erosion risk management which will pay for major flood defence schemes in some of our most vulnerable communities including Swansea vale, Fairbourne, Corwen and Coldbrook, Barry. This would protect 1,000 homes and businesses currently at risk of flooding. Although the Welsh government's "baseline" spending on flood defences is growing slightly, other sources of funding have been cut. The £47.2m earmarked for the next financial year compares to £52.7m this year and £51.9m the previous year. In the past extra funding has become available during the year, meaning the amount that is eventually spent could rise if the same happens again. Mr Griffiths added: "It is so important that we effectively target our funding for flood defence.. "That is why my national strategy includes a commitment to developing a national funding policy as well as a method for prioritising investment. "A group has been set up to progress this work and once completed the national programme of investment will enable areas of Wales to be ranked according to risk from all sources of flooding and coastal erosion." Last year was a disastrous one for flooding in Wales. In June, a month's worth of rain fell in 24 hours in Ceredigion, hitting Aberystwyth and surrounding villages, trapping people in their homes and flooding caravan parks. In November, a 91-year-old woman died and more than 1,000 people had to leave their homes after the River Elwy burst its banks in St Asaph, Denbighshire. In December, heavy flooding hit the Vale of Glamorgan while homes in Ystalyfera in the Swansea Valley were evacuated after landslips brought thousands of tonnes of soil down onto a road. Monday's summit in Cardiff unites the Welsh government, local authorities, the Met Office, Environment Agency Wales, Welsh Water, and other organisations. It coincides with climate change campaign Climate Week. Emyr Roberts of Natural Resources Wales, a new agency that will take over responsibility for Environment Agency Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry Commission next month, said he thought Wales had the right approach to flooding in the past. "Obviously in many areas the answer is to raise flood defences, but increasingly we're putting more emphasis on communities - raising awareness about what the flooding risks are and what individuals can do about it," he said. "Obviously, we're working very closely with the emergency services, but I think the summit... will be looking at longer term issues and ways in which we might use the natural environment to alleviate the problems of flooding." Local Government Minister Carl Sargeant said the role of the local community was also important in tackling the challenges caused by severe weather. Communities which develop a flood plan can act more quickly and effectively when flooding happens. "It is vital that services comes together and work hard to save lives, protect property and help communities recover," said Mr Sargeant. "This was demonstrated in serious flood incidents last year and we owe our emergency services a debt of gratitude for their professionalism, commitment and dedication."	A summit is considering how Wales can respond to the growing threat posed by flooding.
However, it said the "masterminds" behind the murder of Gen Adolphe Nshimirimana were still being sought. Prominent human rights activist Pierre Claver Mbonimpa was shot and wounded in an apparent reprisal attack following Gen Nshimirimana's killing last week. Mr Mbonimpa has been allowed to fly to Belgium for treatment. Heavy shooting was heard in the capital, Bujumbura, on Sunday night, but it was unclear who was behind it, the AFP news agency reports. Burundi has suffered serious unrest since President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision in April to seek a third term in office. Opponents argued this violated the constitution, and protests broke out in parts of the country. There was also failed coup attempt in May, as renegade generals demanded that Mr Nkurunziza steps down when his term ends. A presidential election was held last month which Mr Nkurunziza won. The result was rejected by the main opposition parties, but one of its leading members, Agathon Rwasa, agreed to take the post of deputy parliamentary speaker to promote reconciliation. The prosecutor's office said in a statement that a military vehicle was used by Gen Nshimirimana's attackers and it was subsequently burned. "The identities of the perpetrators are now known. A certain number have been arrested. The rest of them and the masterminds are being sought," it  said. The attackers targeted the general's car with machine guns and rocket launchers in the Kamenge district of Bujumbura. He was widely seen as the most powerful person in Burundi after Mr Nkurunziza. Meanwhile, Mr Mbonimpa's daughter said the authorities had allowed him to leave for Belgium, the former colonial power. "He will be treated there and they can do all the tests that we can't do here. We are also more reassured about his safety there," Amandine Nasagarare said, AFP reports. The government condemned his shooting by a gunman on a motorbike last week as an act of "terrorism". Mr Mbonimpa was a staunch critic of Mr Nkurunziza's bid to run for office again, and was said to be one of the few members of Burundi's civil society who had not fled the country. In April, he was held without charge for more than 24 hours by the intelligence services after he called for protests against the president's efforts to secure a third term.	Several people have been arrested in Burundi over the assassination of a powerful general, the prosecutor's office has said.
David Davis rebuffed Nicola Sturgeon's calls for Holyrood to be given powers over areas such as immigration as part of any deal with Brussels. The Conservative politician was in Scotland a day after the Scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his Scottish government counterpart Michael Russell for talks. When asked if the First Minister is being "realistic" with her demands, he said: "They are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers." Before the EU referendum in June, leading Brexit campaigner and then justice secretary Michael Gove had suggested Scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the EU. But Mr Davis said: "It's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work." He insisted the Brexit arrangements would be a "United Kingdom deal", rejecting the idea put forward by the Scottish Government that the country should be able to keep its place in the European single market. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to "protect Scotland's interests" in the wake of the Brexit vote. But she has insisted her government was "exploring all of the options" for safeguarding Scotland's place in Europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK leaves. After his first meeting with Mr Davis, Mr Russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for Scottish input into the Brexit process. Speaking at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Mr Davis said while it has "got to be a United Kingdom deal", it would "incorporate protection for the people of Scotland". He also said the eventual agreement would "reflect the interests of the people of Scotland". Mr Davis stated: "The aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the European Union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. "How we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim." He continued: "I don't think the Scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. "I have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the Scottish people." Yesterday the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said that he thinks the United Kingdom might actually rein back on Brexit. Mr Davis told BBC Scotland that is not the case: "That's not going to happen. The prime minister has made clear that the now infamous phrase 'Brexit means Brexit' is going to happen. "The people have given us an instruction, we have to carry it out."	The UK government's Brexit secretary insists any arrangements to leave the EU would be a "United Kingdom deal".
The 22-year-old former Wales Under-20 international made his Dragons debut at 17, making him the youngest player to ever represent the region. He will fill the gap left by Micky Young and Peter Stringer, who will leave the club in the summer. Evans will compete for a place in Bath's side with Chris Cook, Will Homer and new arrival Niko Matawalu. "Having known Jonny since he was a youngster and seen his development for myself, I know he'll fit right in here," said Bath coach Darren Edwards, who worked with Evans at Dragons and with Wales U20s. "He brings a spark to the game and he's very much at an exciting stage of his career. He's joining a club that has a fantastic forward pack and he'll thrive on playing off such a strong platform."	Bath have agreed a deal for Newport Gwent Dragons scrum-half Jonathan Evans for next season.
The columnist told the newspaper last month that he had been diagnosed with the "full English" of cancers. Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not "feel cheated" and had been "very lucky" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been "a giant among journalists" and the "heart and soul" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: "It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. "Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all." He added: "He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. "Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him." Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had "an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. "There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy." Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a "controversialist" but also "a kind man and a brilliant writer". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as "the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times". "The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office," he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been "the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. "In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine." Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: "Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour." Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had "trashed" him for 20 years, but always did so "with magnificently eloquent savagery" as well as "an irritating kernel of truth". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as "dark, ugly little trolls" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as "a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the "hernia on the end of England", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it "smelled of boiled washing". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a "dyke on a bike". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been "surprisingly excited" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as "The Blonde" in his restaurant reviews.	Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill has died, aged 62, three weeks after revealing he had cancer.
After their scrum had won a penalty try, two fine scores from the backs saw Tigers stretch clear in Italy. Tonga full-back Veainu raced on to Tommy Bell's grubber, before the full-back sent Peter Betham over in the corner to make it 22-3 at the break. Veainu's solo try earned the bonus before Greg Bateman pin-balled over. Tongan Veainu may well think he should have had a hat-trick after a spectacular finish in the corner, but the TMO ruled he had knocked on. In tricky, rain-affected conditions Leicester dominated the opening 40 minutes and with three tries in the bag by the break looked locked on for the bonus point. But, after Veainu had seen what would have been a superb effort ruled out by the TMO early in the second half, Treviso enjoyed their best spell of the match. They were on top for 20 minutes, with their scrum finally firing, but could not add to their solitary first-half penalty and Leicester eventually managed to regain control. An attack from the two-time champions broke down but Veainu - who scored two tries in the World Cup - rescued the ball and beat four men in a confined space with some sizzling footwork to score under the posts. Replacement hooker Bateman put a gloss on the score as he bounced off several attackers to add a fifth try for Tigers with the last play of the match. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill: "You've got to be satisfied with maximum points from two games and also with not conceding a try. "The attitude in defence not to let them in even when we were well ahead said a lot for the team. "Two wins out of two is a good start, we've got to be happy with that. To get two bonus points is important too - every point will count." Benetton Treviso: McLean; Nitoglia, Bacchin, Christie, Iannone; Ambrosini, Gori; Zanusso, Gega, Harden, Paulo, Montauriol, Barbini, Minto, Steyn. Replacements: Pratichetti for Nitoglia (41), Smylie for Gori (71), Muccignat for Zanusso (68), Giazzon for Gega (41), Filippetto for Harden (50), Budd for Paulo (61), Lazzaroni for Barbini (61), de Marchi for Minto (66). Sin Bin: Harden (17), Montauriol (49). Leicester: Veainu; Betham, Tait, Smith, Thompstone; Bell, Harrison; Ayerza, T Youngs, Balmain, Barrow, Fitzgerald, Croft, O'Connor, Crane. Replacements: Catchpole for Smith (70), Bai for Bell (68), B Youngs for Harrison (50), Aguero for Ayerza (66), Bateman for T Youngs (53), Cole for Balmain (57), Slater for Fitzgerald (53), McCaffrey for Crane (50).	Telusa Veainu scored twice to ensure Leicester earned a four-try bonus point from their trip to Champions Cup Pool Four strugglers Treviso.
Mr Khan is the city's first Muslim mayor, after beating Tory Zac Goldsmith by 1,310,143 votes to 994,614. The result bolsters leader Jeremy Corbyn after Labour was beaten into third in Scotland by the Tories and lost some English councillors. In Scotland, the SNP said it would form a minority government after winning its third election in a row. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is celebrating what she said was an "emphatic" victory, her first as party leader, after the SNP emerged as the largest party at Holyrood with 63 seats, ahead of the Conservatives on 31 and Labour on 24. But she played down talk of another independence referendum after falling short by two seats of an overall majority. In Wales, Labour remains as the largest party, with 29 out of 60 seats, but was denied a majority as Plaid Cymru and UKIP both made notable gains. Counting is continuing in Northern Ireland.	Sadiq Khan has been elected the new Mayor of London - boosting Labour after it slumped in Scotland's elections.
Sports Direct also reported a big drop in half-year profits, which it blamed partly on the fall in the pound. The retailer, which has been criticised over working conditions, said reported pre-tax profits fell 25% to Â£140.2m. However, the firm added that it would be buying a corporate jet for Â£40m. Chief executive Mike Ashley said the past six months had been "tough for our people and performance". Announcing the company's results, Mr Ashley said: "Our UK sports retail business continues to be the engine of Sports Direct, but our results have been affected by the significant deterioration in exchange rates, and our assessment of our risk relating to our stock levels and European stores performance." Mr Hellawell, who has been under fire during his tenure as chairman, used the results statement to launch a blistering attack on the way in which the company had been treated. "I have no doubt that the extreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company has not only damaged its reputation and influenced our customers, it has impacted negatively on the morale of our people," he said. "I begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated. One of the most damaging consequences has been for the very people our critics supposedly support. "The board accepts responsibility for our shortcomings, but there has also been disproportionate, inaccurate and misleading commentary. "The individuals at the heart of our organisation are blameless. They are increasingly upset and angry at the barrage of detrimental comments about the company, which in their view is unjustified." Sports Direct has suffered from a number of scandals in recent months. After HMRC looked into whether workers at its Derbyshire warehouse were paid below the minimum wage, a damning report by the the Business, Innovation and Skills committee said employees of the company were "not treated as humans". Since the criticism over its treatment of staff began, a delegation of MPs claimed an attempt was made to record them in a private discussion while on a visit to the firm's Shirebrook warehouse. Most recently, an investigation into the company's accounts was launched. Several senior employees have also left the company. Dave Forsey stepped down as chief executive and was replaced by Mr Ashley. Acting finance director Matt Pearson was replaced by another interim appointment, Herbert Monteith, in October. A subtle sign of the change in mindset at Sports Direct comes deep in the fine print of today's interim results. Under the prim heading "corporate assets and facilities", the company says it is about to take delivery of a corporate plane. Business aircraft are always a potential source of embarrassing headlines, and Sports Direct has had its fair share of those over the last year. But finally it has shown it has learned one of the ways to avoid such headlines - be upfront about what is happening and explain it, and the sting is drawn. Elsewhere, the company's critics were given a few sops. The veteran banker David Brayshaw has been recruited as an independent director, and may perhaps be in line to take over as chairman, should Keith Hellawell, the incumbent, not survive another vote on his tenure on 5 January. Mr Hellawell offered to resign earlier this year, but was convinced not to by Mr Ashley. However, after failing to receive the necessary support from a majority of the company's independent shareholders who voted at the annual general meeting in September, the chairman will stand for re-election on 5 January next year.	Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell has lambasted critics of the sportswear firm, saying an "extreme political, union and media campaign" has damaged its reputation.
And I don't get to say that very often. On the one hand, eurocrats were hurried - in wind and rain - into EU courtyards to stand in photo-op-ready groups to form the number 60. (It's the EU's 60th birthday celebration this Saturday.) And on the other - after months of cajoling, thinly-veiled frustration and angst from Brussels - the UK government finally made clear the date it will officially trigger the Brexit process. Next Wednesday. But whereas Saturday really is a huge deal for the EU - marking decades of togetherness at a time when the union is very much under threat from populist nationalism across the EU, inequality and discord in the eurozone, migration complications and Brexit itself, of course - next Wednesday, while an historic day in the UK, will not play out so big this side of the Channel. There is a determination here that Brexit must no longer be allowed to dominate and overshadow EU politics as it has done since way before the UK referendum even. One high-level source told me that after Brussels received Britain's formal notification of its intention to leave, Brexit would immediately be downgraded to one of many EU issues to be dealt with, rather than The Big Thing. "There will be no major political apocalyptic show," he assured me. But of course, the underlying EU fear remains that if a Brexit deal is too sweet for the UK, other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door. Brussels officials are grateful that Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 this week, so close to the EU's birthday bash. The tone there will be resolutely upbeat, rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club. As for the what-happens-next with Brexit, the rule in Brussels is: don't expect too much too fast. Ever. The remaining 27 EU leaders, or at least their teams, began getting diaries together on Monday. To fix a date (expected in around five or six weeks) for that all-important summit when they'll agree their red lines and guidelines for Brexit negotiations. The European Commission will lead the UK talks from the EU side - but all the initial meetings will be about who will meet, when, in which country, discussing what and in which order. Most probably little of substance will be achieved before the autumn. The EU prefers to get the key elections coming up in big-hitters France and Germany out the way first. But any delay is painful for the UK. The Article 50 timer is set for two years and the clock starts ticking next Wednesday.	Brussels was abuzz on Monday.
He said he was disappointed that judges ruled ministers could not invoke Article 50 - starting formal Brexit negotiations - without MPs' approval. Mr Cairns was at a breakfast meeting with business leaders in Cardiff. Welsh Conservative MP David Davies warned attempts to block Brexit could lead to an early general election. Mr Cairns told BBC Wales that there was an "obligation" on politicians in all UK parliaments to give firms certainty about the UK's departure from the European Union. "What investors and employers want is the direction of travel and that's what we're focused on," he said. The UK government has said it intends to appeal against Thursday's High Court ruling. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that would be a mistake, but on Friday the Welsh Government announced it would apply to have a voice in the appeal. Mr Cairns claimed the UK was in a "strong position" on the Brexit negotiations as it had one of the world's fastest growing economies. He said he wanted to work with the Welsh Government to get "a good deal" for Wales, and also wanted to work with Europe. "It's in our interests that Europe grows and it's in Europe's interest that the UK and Welsh economies grow," he said. Mr Davies, MP for Monmouth and chair of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, warned that politicians seeking to keep the UK in the EU would now use the judges' decision to try to block Brexit. "There'll be members of parliament looking to find excuses and flaws in the legislation that the government bring forward and the negotiation package, if you like, to try and vote against it," he told BBC Radio Wales. "This is all about trying to undo the result of the referendum - let's be in no doubt about that." He added: "This could easily lead to an early general election if that's what it takes to get this sorted out." But Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Parliament now needed to do its job and scrutinise the UK government's approach to Brexit. "How we leave the European Union was not on the ballot paper and there are a number of ways in which that could happen," she told BBC Radio Wales. "There's no consensus on that yet because the government haven't yet disclosed any details of how they intend to approach both the negotiations and the end point when we leave the EU. "So of course Parliament should scrutinise those plans - that's exactly what Parliament is there to do. "The court decision yesterday simply says, as we all knew, that Parliament has a clear role - a legal role, a constitutional role and an incredibly responsible role to try and influence how that exit happens." However, Pontypridd Labour MP Owen Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics programme he could "potentially" vote against the triggering of Article 50 in a Commons vote. "Most [Labour] colleagues feel that we couldn't possibly do anything other than trigger Article 50 - I disagree with them," he said. "If we have no further clarity as to whether Britain is going to be better or worse off as a result of the ending of the negotiations then I think the right thing for me to do on behalf of my constituents is not to vote to make them worse off."	Businesses need stability after the UK government's High Court defeat over the trigger for leaving the EU, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has said.
Penglais Farm will have a total of 1,000 rooms, but only 700 will be ready this month to welcome students. The university said developer Balfour Beatty confirmed the remaining 300 rooms will be ready during the 2015-16 academic year. Balfour Beatty has been asked to comment. The unfinished rooms have not been let to students.	Hundreds of rooms at a £45m student halls development at Aberystwyth University will not be ready for the new term.
The Australian, 21, beat world number 29 Querrey 6-4 6-4 in 53 minutes to progress to the second round. Kyrgios, ranked a career-high 12th in the world, won the Japan Open on Sunday and is closing in on the top 10. "I was just a bit bored at times," said Kyrgios, when asked why he was not his usual vocal self against Querrey. "I was feeling very tired. It was just tough. I'm just tired so maybe I just wanted to get the job done." Kyrgios said his success in Japan, and the travelling involved in playing at the Qi Zhong Stadium, an hour from Shanghai city centre, had taken its toll. "I didn't have the greatest sleep last night and obviously got in late the day before," he said. "The ride to the courts isn't great either." It was at the Shanghai Masters last year that Kyrgios was fined $1,500 (£984) for a foul-mouthed outburst, describing the tournament a "circus".	Nick Kyrgios said he was "bored" as he extended his unbeaten run to six matches with victory over Sam Querrey at the Shanghai Masters.
This year the event's being hosted by Nicki Minaj at the city's SSE Hydro. U2, Alicia Keys and Ed Sheeran are set to perform but Calvin Harris pulled out on Saturday after a heart scare. On Twitter, the DJ said: "No EMAs for me this weekend. Got some heart problems. Heading home to see if it can be fixed x." With nominations across seven categories, Katy Perry leads the competition. See a full list of this year's MTV EMA nominees She's followed by Ariana Grande with six. Both are up for best female, along with Minaj, Taylor Swift and Beyonce. Pharrell Williams is up for five trophies, including best song and best video for Happy. He is also among the nominations for best male in a category which includes Ed Sheeran, Eminem, Justin Bieber and Justin Timberlake. The awards show is on MTV and Channel 5 on Sunday from 21:00 GMT. Redfoo's presenting an award and told Newsbeat it's an "honour". "They like what I do," he said. "They want the Redfoo energy, with the comedy, just the whole quirky and fun vibe that I have, and that's what they want. "And that's exciting when someone wants you, you want them." Labrinth lit up Glasgow ahead of the awards with a 3D video-mapping light, in George Square on Friday. The video was timed to his new track Let It Be. MTV held castings for more than 2,000 local music fans to be part of the audience for the show. Enrique Iglesias, Kiesza and Royal Blood will perform at the 21st awards, which organisers say will have a time travel theme. MTV also announced the 10 acts nominated for its worldwide act award. Originally, the number nominated sat at 286 but that's been whittled down to 10 after seven weeks and three stages of voting. One Direction are representing North Europe although Southeast Asia/China & Hong Kong/Taiwan have won the award for the past two years and are thought to be in front again. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash and actor David Hasselhoff will present trophies, while Black Sabbath legend Ozzy Osbourne is expected to attend to receive the EMA's Global Icon Award. Grammy award-winning singer Alicia Keys is one of several artists to be nominated in a new category, best song with a message, for her song We Are Here. She said: "I am crazy excited to perform on the global stage of the EMA and for my song to be nominated. "We Are Here is a 21st century peace movement that believes if we all stand together and join our voices we can create a kinder world for everyone." Keys' performance will take place in front of an audience at Glasgow's O2 Academy and be beamed live into the SSE Hydro. The awards have previously been hosted in London, Liverpool, Belfast and Edinburgh.

Mr Beheshti died after being held on charges of "actions against national security on social networks". Following his arrest on 30 October, he was handed to police for interrogation and died on 3 November. The exact circumstances of his death remain unclear. Some reports have suggested he was tortured. The Tehran prosecutor's office says the main cause of Mr Beheshti's death could be physical shock - caused by the brute force applied to sensitive parts of his torso - or psychological pressure. "It is not possible to determine the exact cause of death," it said in a statement quoted by Irna news agency. "But the most likely cause leading to death may be shock." The statement notes that a thorough forensic investigation has been carried out and that prosecutors have obtained witness statements from Mr Beheshti's inmates and prison wardens. Neither the statements nor the forensic results are in the public domain. An earlier coroner's report said his body had "signs of wounds" but no broken bones, according to the semi-official news agency Mehr. Mr Beheshti's death sparked an international outcry. Last week, three people were reported to have been arrested and subsequently, according to an opposition website, released. According to opposition website, Kalameh, the suspects had been involved in Mr Beheshti's interrogation. Mr Beheshti's mother has been forbidden to speak to the press. But an opposition website quoted her as saying she had been offered "blood money" in compensation. She added: "I said I didn't want any. What I want is for the world to know that they killed my son. They killed Sattar." It is thought Mr Beheshti was targeted for his writings on political and social issues on his blog and on Facebook. The blogger spent one night in Tehran's notorious Evin prison on 30 October, where he wrote an official complaint to prison authorities alleging ill-treatment, before being moved to an unknown location. His death provoked criticism from politicians and human rights groups, Amnesty International said Mr Beheshti had complained of being threatened the day before his arrest.	Iranian prosecutors say the death of blogger Sattar Beheshti in police custody may have been due to "excessive psychological stress".
It has announced changes to the heavily criticised and regularly overspent Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for drugs the NHS has deemed unaffordable. The new system will start in July 2016 and have a fixed budget of Â£340m. No patients receiving drugs on the old Cancer Drugs Fund will have their medication stopped. At present, the CDF can choose to pay for innovative drugs the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has rejected for widespread use on the NHS. But under the new system, NICE will make all the decisions. By the time a drug comes on to the market, NICE will give it a yes, no or maybe rating. Those given the go-ahead will be routinely offered across the NHS while those given a maybe rating can be considered for the CDF. However, there will be "clear entry and exit criteria" to ensure money is spent on only the best breakthrough drugs. Bruce Keogh, medical director at NHS England, said: "Improving cancer care is an absolute priority for NHS England... that is dependent on access to treatments. "[The CDF] will provide faster access for patients, I think that's really important, and I think it will bring clarity to which drugs are the most effective sooner than we know at the moment." The fund, which was established in 2011 and covers England, has seen its costs rise to Â£340m in 2015-16 from an initial annual budget of Â£200m. An NHS official said: "Drug companies will need to price their drugs responsibly, and we make no apology for maintaining the pressure on this point on behalf of the public. "Companies keen to work with the NHS for patients will get a new fast-track route to NHS funding for promising new drugs, backed by a speeded up and more transparent NICE assessment process." Dr Paul Catchpole, from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: "If cancer medicines go through more or less exactly the same NICE appraisal process that was in place five years ago - which necessitated the setting up of the CDF in the first place - we will largely get the same answers as before - the majority of medicines will be turned down. "Without substantial changes the ABPI estimates that under the proposals two thirds of existing CDF medicines are likely to no longer be available to NHS patients by the end of the year." Target Ovarian Cancer chief executive Annwen Jones said: "Important questions remain unanswered with this proposal. "The Cancer Drugs Fund must retain the power to make a real difference to people's lives in the face of budget cuts." Follow James on Twitter.

The speed of change, development and growth in Asia is staggering, particularly when you compare it to the inability of Washington DC to get anything done at all. I had the privilege of being one of the first people to fly out of Hanoi's gleaming new international airport terminal on Monday. The building opened with great Vietnamese fanfare on Christmas Day. But here's what's really impressive - the project was only started in 2009. That is five short years in which to build not only a large new airport terminal but also a six-lane motorway and an impressively high-tech bridge to connect the facility to the centre of the city. Imagine America, or Europe for that matter, being able to accomplish anything that big in that short a time frame. Political divisions in the US Congress mean America can't agree on any new infrastructure projects, let alone something on that scale. And I can tell you, when you fly from the capital of Vietnam to the capital of the world's superpower, you realise it's Washington's airport that desperately needs the upgrade. By comparison with all five of the clean, modern Asian airports I visited during my trip - in Cambodia, Vietnam and South Korea - it was Dulles that felt like it was in the developing world. With so much construction going on in South-East Asia, you would think Western firms would be rushing to invest. But Hanoi's new airport - like Ho Chi Minh City's new subway system - has been built with Japanese money.  From what I could see, the Asian boom is being financed with Asian cash. If I owned a construction company, or a hotel chain, or an airline, or pretty much anything related to travel or tourism, I'd park myself firmly in the East. Take a tour of the Angkor Wat in Cambodia after 9:00am and the crowds of Chinese tourists are almost impressive as the ancient Khmer ruins themselves. Where only 10 years ago there would have been just a handful of intrepid Chinese visitors, outnumbered by Westerners, today there are millions of them. And of course, their numbers will only grow. The new face of global tourism is Asian and any hospitality firm not catering to Asian tourists is missing a profitable trick. I loved my two weeks in Asia. It was the first time I had been back in too long. Despite being dragged round endless sights at the crack of dawn, my kids loved it too, the welcome for them was just as warm as I remembered it when I used to live in Japan. I was there for holiday not work, so my impressions are just that, impressionistic, but I came away with two clear observations - a sense of how fast things are moving there compared to here and of how little the West seems to feature in that boom.	It has become a truism that this is going to be an Asian century not an American one - but there's nothing like seeing the two continents first-hand to really understand why.
Called Tupperware Party, it is wrapped up in challenging issues, and also marks a return for the actress to where her fascination with movies first began. "Weirdly, I am back where I started," says the 29-year-old actress, writer and director on the set of Tupperware Party. "I have been concentrating on acting for, I guess, the last decade. "But when I first started off when I was a young child expressing an interest in all this I had a video camera and was directing little short films. "It feels exactly the same, except everything is on a slightly bigger scale." Inverness-born Gillan is best known for her roles as Amy Pond in the BBC's Doctor Who and also as space pirate Nebula in 2014's Marvel movie, Guardians of the Galaxy. Since her breakout role in Doctor Who she has also appeared in the films Not Another Happy Ending, Oculus and In a Valley of Violence and US TV shows, including Selfie. But Gillan has also been busy writing and directing her own material. She already has two short films to her name, including a horror short called Conventional. Tupperware Party, which she wrote and is directing and starring in, is an art house film set in her home city and is being made by a US-based film company. Gillan says: "Tupperware Party follows the story of a girl called Lucy who lives in Inverness. She is dealing with the suicide of her best friend. "It is one year one on and she is having a really hard time expressing how she feels about the whole event. Her angst manifests itself in quite destructive ways." The film is being shot at locations across Scotland, including Inverness. When I catch up with Gillan the production is in Bo'ness, near Falkirk. She says: "It was so important for me to film in Scotland first and foremost because the film is set in Scotland. "The only other film I've seen set in Inverness was Loch Ness, which is great and I really enjoyed it, but I really wanted to show the reality of the place and what it is like to grow up there. "There is a sense of identity that is beyond the tourist sort of aesthetic." Tupperware Party is being made by Mt Hollywood Films, a film company with a mission to offer women and film-makers from minority backgrounds leadership roles such as writing, directing and producing films. "I have such an amazing team to collaborate with," says Gillan. "We have such a strong team of females on this project. We didn't choose anyone because they were female. To me gender is irrelevant and it is whoever is best for the job." Andru Davies, of Mt Hollywood Films, says Gillan is "exactly" the kind of film-maker the company wants to work with. "She wrote the script, she is directing it, she is the lead actress, it is female-driven and her partners are all women," he says. But he adds: "It is a story that speaks to both men and women." It is not only the Scottish actress that has won over the film company. Making Tupperware Party has convinced Mt Hollywood Films to return to Scotland to make other films. Davies says: "It is great working here. We are actually moving some of our other projects to Scotland because of how much we have enjoyed working here. The crews are amazing and the towns are great." Part of Tupperware Party's crew is producer Claire Mundell, who also has her own independent film company, Synchronicity Films. She previously worked with Gillan on Not Another Happy Ending. "At the end of that film she told me she was writing a script about suicide in Scotland, which is a really big issue as we know," says Mundell. "That really resonated with me and I thought the opportunity of working with Karen as a writer, director and female film-maker would be really exciting." Mundell also says that Tupperware Party is yet another film that underlines the need for Scotland to have its own studio with an industry-scale stage. The Scottish government has been looking at how to provide such a facility. Mundell says such a studio would allow whole film-making processes to be done in Scotland, and not just filming at locations before the movies are finished in a studio overseas. "The stage is necessary to inspire our own indigenous film-making talent and TV-making talent to be more ambitious and be more international with the stories they tell," she says. Tupperware Party should be available for release in cinemas this year - 12 months when Gillan will rarely be far from the big screen. Over the course of 2017 she will appear alongside Tom Hanks and Emma Watson in The Circle, reprise her role as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume Two and at Christmas will feature in a follow-up to 1995's Robin Williams hit movie Jumanji. "So look out for those," says Gillan. "And then I'll be making a little appearance in the next Avengers movies." Avengers: Infinity War, expected to be released in cinemas next year, brings together many characters from the Marvel comic "universe", including characters from Guardians of the Galaxy as well as the Iron Man and Captain America stories. Some scenes for Infinity War are reportedly to be filmed in Scotland. "What are the chances of that?" laughs Gillan, hoping that if this is indeed the case she might be able to appear as her character from a galaxy far away in a place not too far from home.	Karen Gillan has come home to Scotland to direct her first feature-length film.
Media playback is not supported on this device Rogers needed 14 stitches in his lip after a challenge by Tyrone's Tiernan McCann at the start of the game. "I think Brendan was quite shocked. Some people were quite horrified," said the Derry manager. "I'll leave it to other people to make up their minds." The Slaughtneil man had the stitches inserted last Sunday and Barton expects Rogers to be out of action for a couple of more weeks. Rogers was named at midfield for the McKenna Cup final and the match video suggested he may have been caught by McCann's right elbow immediately after challenging for the initial throw-in. After the ball was thrown in, McCann came in from the side and the footage showed the Tyrone man clattering into Rogers although the Red Hand county player appeared to be focusing on the ball rather than the Derry midfielder when the contact was made. "Brendan has been very quiet about it and we have been very quiet about it as well," said Barton after Derry's opening 3-13 to 1-10 Division 2 Football League victory over Fermanagh at Celtic Park. "It was quite an horrific incident. I wouldn't like to expand on it to be quite frank. Media playback is not supported on this device "It was an incident that thankfully you don't see very often." Barton added that he "couldn't speak" after the game such was his upset about the incident. "I think it affected the mood of all of us. "It overshadowed for me what was a positive night for football. "I think the amount of respect that was shown between Derry and Tyrone was very evident but it's one of those things I'll let people make up their own minds about." In terms of Sunday's opening league win, Barton felt that his team had laboured badly in the first half before going on to clinch a nine-point victory over the Erne County. "We were very flat at the start of the game. We turned over a serious amount of ball under no pressure. "I was glad to see our first goal going in (before half-time) and I was very happy to see half-time because it gave us an opportunity to restructure and talk about what we felt we were going wrong. "Getting in the ball in early in the second half to our men inside worked nicely in the inclement conditions but we'll have to up our performances over the next couple of weeks."	Derry football manager Damian Barton has described the facial injury sustained by his player Brendan Rogers in last weekend's Dr McKenna Cup final as "horrific".
The first to benefit from "white space" internet will be residents on the Isle of Arran, who have struggled with poor broadband speeds. Domain name firm Nominet is partnering with telecoms firm Broadway Partners to roll it out. They claim it is the first commercial service using the technology in Europe. The service will be available in two packages, one offering speeds of up to 25Mbps (megabits per second) and one offering 35Mbps. There have been several trials of white space technology (TVWS) in the UK. BT ran some on the Isle of Bute and are currently running a small one in Sutton, Suffolk. The technology has been used at London Zoo to broadcast footage of meerkats and has also been considered as a way of providing broadband at sea. BT now believes it can get fibre broadband solutions to almost 99% of UK homes by the end of 2020, so has moved its attention to technologies such as long-reach very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL) and fibre to the home (FTTH). "We think wireless and satellite will be the most likely potential solutions for the final 1-2%," said a BT spokesman. Nominet is convinced that TVWS can play a role. Russell Haworth, chief executive of Nominet, said: "The Arran roll-out shows that TV white space can reach places that other technologies cannot and paves the way for further deployment of this dynamic spectrum management technology." Michael Armitage, founding director of Broadway Partners, added: "TV white space has proved its mettle, cutting through hard to reach rural forested areas on Arran which, in fixed wireless terms, is pretty much unheard of. "This technology will be a powerful tool in the drive to deliver affordable broadband access for all communities throughout Scotland and abroad." It will first be rolled out to residents on the west coast of Arran, with services to the rest of island following in the coming months. Better connectivity could boost tourism, which is the main industry on Arran. During peak season, the population grows from 5,000 to 25,000. The firms are also planning to roll out TVWS in Wales but has not said where or when. Andrew Ferguson, editor of broadband website Think Broadband, said: "TV Whitespace has some advantages over the majority of wireless services, since it is using lower frequencies, which means it can go further and will penetrate some obstructions. "The penalty to operating at these lower frequencies is that speeds may be slower than traditional fixed wireless services. From other trials of white space technology I am expecting speeds to be in the region of 10 Mbps. "If you are just getting broadband for the first time or have an unreliable sub-1 Mbps service, that will feel amazing - and unlike satellite broadband will not have excessively high latency." But he added that as people increasingly demand super-fast broadband, white space technology will be seen as only a "stepping stone" to faster technologies.	Part of the wireless spectrum freed up after the digital TV switchover is being used to provide broadband services in rural Scotland.
Bielik, 17, who underwent his medical at Arsenal last week, signed for Legia from their Polish rivals Lech Poznan in July and has made six appearances in all competitions this season. Arsenal say the deal "is subject to the completion of regulatory processes". The Poland Under-17 international can play in both a holding midfield role and at centre-back. He said: "I've decided to move to Arsenal and although I cannot be sure of what's to come in the future, I'm going to London to fulfil my dreams. "I'm grateful to my team-mates and manager Henning Berg for trusting such a young player and giving me a chance to play for the first team. It's mostly thanks to him that I'm able to move to Arsenal." Berg said: "Krystian is a very talented player, who is going to achieve big success in football in the future." For each position, select whether you think Arsenal are sorted, or if a player is needed.	Arsenal have signed teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik from Legia Warsaw for a reported £2.4m.
It is the first private clinic to offer early medical abortions to women in Northern Ireland under strict legal controls. A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012. Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was "time to move on". She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. "I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. "But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places," she said. "At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. "I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. "I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose." Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: "We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do. "The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers. "We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey."	Dawn Purvis is to step down as programme director of Northern Ireland's Marie Stopes clinic.
Staff were told on Tuesday that the city centre business had gone into liquidation with the loss of 53 jobs. It was opened by Thomas Austin in 1830 and is thought to have been one of the oldest stores in Europe. One worker, Toni McNally, has been employed by the business for her entire working life. In November 2014, the building was sold to the City Hotel Group. The receiver then sold the trading side of the business. "I'm there from I was 14 and I'm just absolutely devastated," Ms McNally told BBC Radio Foyle, "We laughed everyday, we had great customers, our colleagues were great, our bosses were great. "Even for the management themselves it was just horrific." Toni has two children and believes it will be difficult to adjust to being unemployed. "I don't have a clue, I've never even been to the unemployment centre. "The liquidators have set up a clinic for us to go on Friday so we can discuss what we're entitled to and all the rest of it," she said. "We were all like brothers and sisters. I loved everybody that I worked with." Another worker, Jackie McCormill, described how she arrived at the store to find the shutters pulled down. "We pulled the shutter up and stood inside to wait for one of the managers to say that the shop was closed, that the liquidators were in, and that it was all over for us really. "The other girl I was with was actually physically shaking, it's like someone hit you over the head with a hammer, but this has been coming. "Everybody was crying, women all red faced. People's faces were just drained." Jackie said management had done their best to keep the business afloat. "It seems like ten years this recession's going on and it just seems to be going deeper and deeper down. "They tried their best to keep that store and I think they kept it a lot longer than most people would."	Some workers at Austins, in County Londonderry, say they have been left devastated by the closure of the department store.
McKenzie, 38, will take on Jahmaine Smyle at York Hall on 12 November for the English super-middleweight championship. The ex-Norwich and Peterborough man became a professional boxer in 2013 having quit football two years previously. He has a record of eight wins and one draw from his nine fights. McKenzie is the son of former British and European champion Clinton and is trained by his uncle, former three-time world champion Duke McKenzie.	Former Premier League striker Leon McKenzie is to fight for a national boxing title.
Anthony Knockaert headed wide early on but striker Baldock made no mistake shortly after, guiding Gaetan Bong's cross into the top corner. Helder Costa came closest to equalising just before the break but his long-range shot was tipped over by Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale. Wolves pressed late on with several corners but Brighton held on. Walter Zenga's Wolves went into the game having won just two of their past nine away league games with only one clean sheet and they conceded what turned out to be the winning goal after only 16 minutes. Full-back Bong whipped in a pinpoint cross which was headed home by Baldock for his third goal in three games as the Seagulls took control before the break. Top-scorer Glenn Murray almost doubled Brighton's lead early in the second half but his header was narrowly wide and a minute later Knockaert forced a fine save from Carl Ikeme with a long-range left-footed shot. Wolves committed men forward late on but, despite a succession of corner kicks in the dying minutes, Albion held on for victory and their eighth clean sheet in 13 games. Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "It is very timely that Sam is in this form and I am very pleased for him. He's been good for us. "He may not score too many with his head but he showed a desire to get across the defender. "He is a team player, works hard for the team and he is at the right place at the right time." Wolves head coach Walter Zenga: "It was a good game in my opinion but they scored and we didn't. We played at the same level as Brighton. "We were in the game and there was no difference in the teams. I would prefer to play badly and take the points. "In the last four games we have only taken one point, but we must believe in our job."

Torquing Group was criticised for a lack of communication over the Zano after the project folded last week. An apology has been issued along with the new information. The collapse of Zano caused embarrassment for Kickstarter when many disappointed backers questioned whether they would get their money back. In the new update, which was published to the project's Kickstarter page, the firm detailed how its funding had been apportioned across the project. The four largest areas to which more than £2.3m in donations had been distributed as follows: Developing improvements to the Zano prototype had been one significant example of expenditure, the company said. "Ultimately these upgrades coupled with delays caused by the creation of a bespoke and automatic testing rig had significant financial and timeline impacts upon the project," the statement added. The firm also reiterated its intention to "co-operate fully" with Trading Standards within Pembrokeshire County Council. In a closing comment, Torquing added an additional apology: "We would like to make a sincere apology for the understandable disappointment felt by all of those that have supported the project." The BBC had also learned that Kickstarter had contacted Zano backers following the announcement of Zano's collapse last week. "Like you, we're extremely frustrated by what's happened with this project," the message said. It added that Kickstarter had asked Torquing to provide a more detailed update to backers by November 30 - or Kickstarter would pursue an inquiry into the Zano project.	The company behind the failed mini-drone Zano has provided some details of how more than £2.3m in funding was allocated.
A fire crew remains at Plasgran in Manea Road, Wimblington, more than 16 hours after the incident began on Wednesday afternoon. Road closures are expected to stay in place until midday, the fire service said. About 75 firefighters worked into the night to put out the fire. They also prevented its spread to neighbouring properties. The incident was scaled down at 2300 GMT, when the fire was brought under control.	An investigation has begun into the cause of a fire which has severely damaged a plastics factory in Cambridgeshire.
Derek Mackay was accused of "showing contempt for parliament" during a fiery debate on the budget timetable. The finance committee wants Mr Mackay to hand over detailed planning information ahead of the budget, which will be published on 15 December. Mr Mackay said he would publish some extra "high level" information. However opposition members said he had been "ambiguous" and had not been clear about what information would actually be provided. A "fundamental" review of the budget process has also been established in light of Holyrood's new fiscal powers. Mr Mackay has delayed publication of his first set of spending plans until after the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, which he said would make a major difference to the funds available to the Scottish government. The finance committee, led by SNP member Bruce Crawford, brought forward the chamber debate to voice "concern" at how much time they would have to scrutinise spending plans before they are voted on by MSPs. He said it was "unacceptable" that Mr Mackay had refused to hand over any scenario planning information as an indication of how the budget may unfold, despite having previously told the committee that he would give them as much information as possible. All opposition MSPs backed Mr Crawford on this point, signing up to support a motion from Patrick Harvie "urging" the government to put the information in the public domain. During the debate, Mr Harvie said opposition members had chosen not to force a vote on the matter, but worried that Mr Mackay "kept using the same language" as he did when previously writing to the committee. The finance secretary replied: "What parliament asked for was high level scenario planning, and that's what I've said I'll provide. "I've repeatedly said I won't publish a draft budget [before the Autumn Statement], I can't publish a credible draft budget or a number of draft budgets. But I will publish that scenario information that I've pledged to in keeping with what I've said to committee." However, opposition members said Mr Mackay was still not being clear about what information he would actually provide. Labour's James Kelly, who said the finance secretary had provided "seven minutes of waffle" in the debate, said MSPs were "still no further forward" with budget scrutiny. Conservative member Alex Johnstone said it would "take some further time" to work out exactly what Mr Mackay was offering the committee. He said the committee was "offering a compromise" to the finance secretary, noting that "it appears he has not yet accepted that compromise". Mr Harvie said he was disappointed at the "ambiguous stance" Mr Mackay had taken, saying he was "being quite unclear" about what information he would provide. Mr Mackay had earlier said he would "honour the commitment" he had previously given about "sharing as much information as I possibly can". He said he could not produce a draft budget without having all of the information that will come from the Autumn Statement. He added: "I will continue to work constructively with the finance committee and share as much information as I can to give as much certainty as I can, but that doesn't mean we can produce a draft budget." Fellow SNP member Kate Forbes said it would be "downright irresponsible" for the government to publish detailed budget figures prior to the Autumn Statement. Opposition MSPs reacted angrily to Mr Mackay's statements, with several accusing him of "showing contempt" for parliament's role in budget scrutiny. Tory member Murdo Fraser said he "regrets very much" that Mr Mackay had chosen to take a "brazen" approach to the debate, urging him to "keep his word" and hand over planning information. He added: "To do otherwise, frankly, is to show contempt both for the work of this parliament and the finance committee." This was quickly echoed by Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who said Mr Mackay's budget timetable "will severely limit the ability of the parliament's committee's to scrutinise the budget properly". She added: "In addition, by refusing to publish as much information as possible in advance of the publication of the draft budget later this year, Derek Mackay is treating this parliament with contempt, particularly since he is going back on a promise that he has previously made to this parliament." Graham Simpson said Mr Mackay could "bleat all he likes about the Autumn Statement", calling it a "pathetic excuse" for delaying scrutiny, and fellow Tory member Adam Tomkins said Mr Mackay's plans were "profoundly disrespectful" of parliament. Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said "it's come to something" when an SNP figure of Mr Crawford's figure called the government's approach "unacceptable". However, SNP member James Dornan said other parties were "playing political games" over the budget, noting that the education committee he chairs is able to carry out some pre-budget scrutiny. And Mr Mackay later told BBC Scotland that he had committed to giving the committee the extra scenario planning information requested, saying there was "room for consensus" on the issue.	Scotland's finance secretary has pledged to give more information to the finance committee to scrutinise his delayed draft budget.
The Scot collected £200,000, the biggest ever victory cheque for a tournament outside the UK, after prevailing in a high-quality contest. Higgins led 5-4 after the first session in Guangzhou, but 2015 world champion Bingham won the first two on the resumption before Higgins moved 7-6 up. An 84 from Bingham levelled it but 134 and two more tons sealed Higgins' win. It was the 41-year-old's first tournament win since last year's International Championship, also in China, but as an invitation title does not count towards his tally of 28 ranking crowns. The world number six beat Mark Williams, Ali Carter and Mark Allen en route to the final, which featured five centuries in all and nine more breaks over 50.	John Higgins reeled off three centuries from 7-7 to beat Stuart Bingham 10-7 in the final of the China Championship.
In the last three weeks, blooms have appeared along the shoreline on Anglesey and there have been some reports of children being stung. The cold spring meant there were few reports of jellyfish before June. Frankie Hobrow from the Anglesey Sea Zoo advised swimmers to "look but don't touch" and to treat stings with vinegar. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane variety, have been seen by holidaymakers at Benllech beach, on the Menai Strait. Ms Hobrow said: "They have increased over the last two or three weeks with the warmer weather. They get carried around on the ocean currents, they can't swim very well so they rely on being carried around, and we do see this every year once it gets warmer. "The sea temperatures warm up slightly and we get a lot more swarms of jellyfish." Ms Hobrow said the Lion's Mane gives a "nasty sting". She said: "They can grow very, very big - over two metres - but the ones here are fairly small. "They can be painful but it's generally localised pain - it doesn't usually last very long. You can often help if you apply vinegar - that's great because it's acidic." She also said urine could also be used because of its acidity. The MCS's National Jellyfish Survey, which is in its 10th year, said 7,500 jellyfish reports have been made by the public over the last decade. Dr Peter Richardson, the charity's biodiversity programme manager, said: "The scarcity of jellyfish reports before June was unusual and could well be linked to the exceptionally cold spring. "However, as our waters warmed, sightings of jellyfish increased, with moon jellyfish reported in large numbers around the UK, reports of compass and blue jellyfish in the south west, and blooms of Lion's Mane jellies around north Wales and north west England."	The jellyfish population in north Wales has soared after the recent warm weather, researchers have said.
More than 120 old or recent bruises and broken bones were discovered on Keegan Downer's body, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Kandyce Downer denies murdering the 18-month-old, after she collapsed at the family home in Birmingham. The child also had a "terrible" spiral leg fracture which had gone untreated. It left the girl "deformed" with one leg shorter than the other, the court heard. Nigel Power QC said Keegan also had seven recently broken ribs which would have made breathing "very painful", and an historic head injury at least several days old at the time she died. Forensic testing of the house where the toddler died revealed traces of her blood on the cot and bedroom wall. Born in March 2014 to a heroin-addict mother, the otherwise healthy girl was put with a foster carer by social services. The child was then placed with 35-year-old Downer as the legal guardian in January 2015. Keegan was described in court as a "healthy and happy baby" and lived at Downer's family home in Beckbury Road, Weoley Castle. She collapsed at home shortly before 10am on 5 September 2015. When paramedics arrived, Downer had Keegan lying down on a sofa and told them: "I don't know when she stopped breathing, because I was in the bath." Downer later told paramedics she had popped out and left the child alone during that morning. Keegan died from a combination of septicaemia, infection, blunt chest trauma and old head injuries. Of Downer, Mr Power said: "We say there is no other realistic candidate for the many and terrible injuries that led to Keegan's death." The trial of Downer, who also denies causing or allowing the death of Keegan, continues.	A mother-of-four battered a toddler to death months after she was made the child's legal guardian, a court has heard.
House masters, in charge of residential halls at the university, will become known as "faculty deans". Harvard Law School is also deciding whether to change its official seal, because of links to slavery. US campuses have faced a series of protests over allegations of racism. Harvard has not agreed that the use of "master" represented a link to slavery, but it has accepted campaigners' calls for a name change. It will mean changing the job titles of 24 members of staff - but will not affect other uses of "master", such as a master's level degree. Harvard academics say that the word "master" derives from the Latin term "magister" - a form of address for scholars or teachers. It is similar to terms such as "school master" or "head master". But protesters have argued that whatever its original derivation, the word now has connotations of slavery. Student campaigners are also calling for a change in the official seal of Harvard Law School, with a sit-in being held this week. The seal includes the coat of arms of 18th Century college donor Isaac Royall, who as well as establishing the college's first professorship in law, was a notoriously brutal slaveholder. Isaac Royall, whose money helped to endow the university, has been accused of burning slaves alive. A decision on whether to change the seal is expected to be made soon. Disputes about race and identity have affected many US campuses. Carol Christ, director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education, University of California, Berkeley, has said that "symbolic fights are always about real and current political issues" and race and diversity remain major campus issues. "Race is so traumatic and central an issue in American culture," said Dr Christ. Last month, Amherst College, in Massachusetts, accepted student demands to drop links with its informal mascot, Jeffery Amherst, an 18th Century general accused of advocating infecting native Americans with smallpox. And there have been sit-ins at Princeton in a bid to rename a school named after Woodrow Wilson, because of claims the former US president held racist views. The protests by US students are part of a wider international campaign challenging historical titles, statues and emblems. But further demands for "safe space", where some students have called for the right to study away from attitudes or behaviour they find offensive, have been rejected by university leaders and others who have argued for the importance of protecting free speech. In South Africa, a statue of Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town, with protesters attacking the statue as an emblem of colonialism and apartheid. But a call to remove a statue of the 19th Century politician from Oriel College in Oxford University was rejected. Louise Richardson, the university's vice-chancellor, said students needed to be able to debate and confront "ideas that make them uncomfortable".	Harvard University in the US is going to remove the word "master" from academic titles, after protests from students who claimed the title had echoes of slavery.
He faces a number of charges. First, he pulled out of a long-planned trip to Moscow after the US missile strike on a Syrian airfield. It was agreed the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should go instead. Poodle, cried his critics. Next, Team Boris briefed journalists that the foreign secretary wanted to get the G7 to agree new sanctions against Russia at its meeting in the Italian city of Lucca. But Mr Johnson entirely failed to persuade other countries to agree. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there was no consensus new sanctions would help and argued they could push Russia into a corner. Mr Johnson's own view of the Syrian conflict seems to have swerved around like a shopping trolley since he became the UK's chief diplomat in July. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee at the start of 2017, he signalled a shift in UK policy towards Syria. Mr Johnson said the "mantra" of calling for President Assad to go had not worked and the military space had been left open to Russia to fill. The Foreign Secretary told peers President Assad should be allowed to run for election as part of a "democratic resolution" of the civil war. Now, however, Mr Johnson believes the Syrian leader has to go. How much of this is fair? And what might the episode say about Boris Johnson's standing in Theresa May's government? First, the UK was a bystander to the Trump administration's missile strike on Syria. The government was given a courtesy call to say it was coming but the UK was not asked to be involved. Mr Johnson's trip to Moscow (which would have been the first by a British foreign secretary to Russia for five years) was long planned and quickly binned. I understand Mrs May told Mr Johnson it was his call whether he wanted to go or not. After speaking to Rex Tillerson, Mr Johnson and his US opposite number agreed it was best for one man to deliver a single message to Moscow. Mr Johnson then spent a weekend hitting the phones to other G7 countries trying to get a united position agreed ahead of the meeting in Lucca. In its final communique, the G7 did agree to state the Assad regime had to end. But further sanctions - an idea endorsed by Number 10 - got nowhere. It was clearly a snub to Mr Johnson although government sources insist sanctions have not been taken off the table. On Wednesday, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said other countries were "less forward-leaning" than the UK on the issue. Diplomacy is tough. But it may have been unwise for the Foreign Office to suggest sanctions were an ambition when key G7 nations clearly didn't agree. At the weekend, I was told by Team Boris that he was very relaxed about the sniping and criticism being lobbed his way in recent days. And Mr Johnson has provoked quite a lot since he became foreign secretary, largely because of his use of decidedly undiplomatic language. He was taken to task by a Swedish MEP in February for calling Brexit a "liberation". A month before that, Mr Johnson warned the French president not to respond to Brexit by administering "punishment beatings" in the manner of a World War Two film. Guy Verhofstadt, who speaks for the European Parliament on Brexit, branded the remarks "abhorrent and deeply unhelpful". It was several days after President Trump's election that Boris Johnson said it was time for Mr Trump's critics to get over their "whinge-o-rama" - a comment I know left some officials in Brussels agog. Mr Johnson is always keen to speak with the swashbuckling pluck of the newspaper columnist he once was. His many fans in the Tory party might love it. But even Mrs May has hinted at exasperation. At the Conservative Party conference last autumn, the prime minister said: "Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about." It was a joke. But not many prime ministers joke about their foreign secretary's erraticism. Then in December, Mrs May described Boris Johnson as an FFS - saying that in this case it stood for being a Fine Foreign Secretary (and not the punchy abbreviation for a term of exasperation). When Mrs May was home secretary and Mr Johnson was London mayor they had a prickly relationship. She then beat him to the job he craved. Her appointment of the Brexit campaign's most prominent champion to the job of foreign secretary stunned Westminster and it remains one of the most intriguing political relationships within the government. While happy to clip his wings publicly from time to time, Theresa May also needs Boris Johnson on board as she embarks on Brexit. A force so effective in persuading Britain to vote to leave the EU is not a politician the prime minister wants sniping from outside the cabinet as the negotiating trade-offs begin.	There is, to use Boris Johnson's own lingo, a "whinge-o-rama" raging among the foreign secretary's political opponents and in parts of the press about his performance in the current Syria crisis.

He said he had been inspired by Pope Francis's call for peace and dialogue. Demonstrators set fire to the Congress building last month in protest at a secret Senate vote to allow second terms. Paraguay suffered under decades of dictatorship until 1989 and many oppose presidential re-election. Senators say they will continue to campaign for a vote in the lower house. They  argue that Paraguay is the only country in Latin America that does not allow second terms and it needs to modernise its constitution. During the riots, police shot dead a demonstrator which triggered calls for crisis talks backed by Pope Francis. They fell apart when the main opposition, the Liberal Party, boycotted them. The conservative president had the backing of his leftist rival Fernando Lugo, who was president from 2008 to 2012 and also wants to run again.	The President of Paraguay, Horacio Cartes, says he will no longer seek re-election after his bid to change the constitution triggered rioting.
YouTube said the video - its most watched ever - has been viewed more than 2,147,483,647 times. It has now changed the maximum view limit to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808, or more than nine quintillion. Gangnam Style became a worldwide hit when it was released in 2012, largely due to the surreal video. How do you say 9,223,372,036,854,775,808? Nine quintillion, two hundred and twenty-three quadrillion, three hundred and seventy-two trillion, thirty-six billion, eight hundred and fifty-four million, seven hundred and seventy-five thousand, eight hundred and eight. Why was Psy nearly too much for YouTube? YouTube's counter previously used a 32-bit integer, which is a unit used to represent data in computer architecture. This means the maximum possible views it could count was 2,147,483,647. On 1 December, it  posted a statement saying: "We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer... but that was before we met Psy." Google, which owns YouTube, later told website The Verge that engineers "saw this coming a couple months ago and updated our systems to prepare for it". YouTube now uses a 64-bit integer for its video counter, which means videos have a maximum viewer count of 9.22 quintillion. Psy has yet to comment although news of YouTube's change was posted on his Facebook and Twitter pages. The second most-watched video on YouTube - Baby by Justin Bieber - lags behind Gangnam Style by more than a billion views.	The music video for South Korean singer Psy's Gangnam Style exceeded YouTube's view limit, prompting the site to upgrade its counter.
The conditions endured by chainmakers and their demands for a minimum wage caused a national scandal and in 1910 they held a strike. It lasted for ten weeks and is credited with changing the lives of thousands of workers earning poor wages. Artist Luke Perry, from a family of chainmakers, has created the statue after more than two years. Mr Perry's statue was unveiled on Friday morning in Mary Macarthur park, named after the trade unionist who led the women chainmakers 102 years ago. He said: "It's something which is a wonderful piece of our history, but still, I don't think enough people know about it." The statue stands at 10 ft (3 metres) and weighs nearly three-and-a-half tonnes. The area's links with chain making are kept alive every month at a rare surviving chain shop at Mushroom Green in the heart of the Black Country. In 2010, a plaque honouring Mary Macarthur was put up in the park as part of the 100th anniversary events.	A monument to the women chainmakers of Cradley Heath in the Black Country has been unveiled.
The 25-year old striker is at Euro 2016 with Belgium but has fallen out of favour at Liverpool since boss Jurgen Klopp took over last October. The forward joined the Reds for £32.5m in July 2015 under former boss Brendan Rodgers and has scored 10 goals. He has started only eight league games under Klopp and last month said: "I'd like to stay if I remain in the coach's plans. If not, it'll become difficult." Palace, who completed the signings of England winger Andros Townsend from Newcastle and France international goalkeeper Steve Mandanda from Marseille on Friday, were also reportedly interested in Benteke's Belgium team-mate Michy Batshuayi. But the 22-year-old forward has been linked with a £33m move to Chelsea.	Crystal Palace have made a £25m bid to sign Christian Benteke from Liverpool.
The futures of Aston and Coventry stations were discussed by West Midlands Fire and Rescue Authority. The authority, which said it needed buildings for a "modern-day" fire service, approved its budget earlier. Plans to demolish Aston's Ettington Road fire station, which was built in 1923, will go before planners. Phil Hales, deputy chief officer of West Midlands Fire Service, said Aston residents would be consulted as part of the planning process. The authority says that Coventry's Radford Road station, which was built in 1976, is expensive to run and maintain. A new station at Aston could cost around Â£7.5m, while the Coventry scheme could cost an estimated Â£6.7m. English Heritage has said it expected to be consulted on the proposal to demolish Aston fire station if the plan was put forward. "Aston fire station was listed at Grade II in 2010 and recognised as a carefully-designed building which works well with its surroundings and is a powerful symbol of civic pride," a spokesperson said.	Plans to demolish and replace two West Midlands fire stations - one of which is Grade II listed - have been backed by fire service bosses.
The apology came as an independent panel found police "sought to deflect responsibility" on to Liverpool fans. Chief Constable David Crompton has confirmed statements were altered seeking to lessen police blame. "I think that if people are shown to have acted criminally then they should face prosecution," he said. Mr Crompton made his apology after previously unseen government papers about the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989 were released. The documents indicate, for the first time, that South Yorkshire Ambulance Service documents were amended after the disaster, the panel said. The chief constable accepted they also show South Yorkshire Police (SYP) had failed the victims and families on the day of the disaster and the police lost control. "In the immediate aftermath senior officers sought to change the record of events," Mr Crompton said. "Disgraceful lies were told which blamed the Liverpool fans for the disaster.  These actions have caused untold pain and distress for over 23 years. "I am profoundly sorry for the way the force failed." However, Mr Crompton said South Yorkshire Police was "a very different place in 2012" from what it was 23 years ago. David Whiting, Chief Executive of Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: "I sincerely apologise for the shortcomings identified in the report relating to the way in which the incident was managed in the early stages. " Sheffield City Council Chief Executive John Mothersole issued a statement in which he "sincerely apologises" for the actions of the council at the time. Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield South-East, who was at the game, said he had been "absolutely shocked" by the scale of the revelations and called for a new inquest. "To find out that 164 statements by police officers had been subsequently changed to alter what they said, to alter descriptions of the adequacy of the response to the disaster at the time, I think is really truly shocking and there are a lot of answers that still need to be found to questions raised by these findings," he said. "I think it's very clear that the initial inquest cannot stand." The panel went on to say the wrongful allegations about the fans' behaviour later printed in some newspapers, particularly The Sun, originated from "a Sheffield press agency, senior SYP officers, an SYP Police Federation spokesperson and a local MP". The panel said the Police Federation, "supported informally by the SYP Chief Constable", sought to develop and publicise a version of events derived in police officers' allegations of drunkenness, ticketless fans and violence. "The vast majority of fans on the pitch assisted in rescuing and evaluating the injured and the dead," the panel said. In a statement Sheffield Wednesday FC, whose ground hosted the fateful match, offered "sincere condolences and an apology" to all the families who suffered as a "consequence of the tragic events".	The chief constable of South Yorkshire has admitted "grave errors" were made during the Hillsborough disaster and has apologised "profoundly".
But the music in the air is understated these days. Birdsong and the chatter of children have replaced the loud clang and clatter of heavy industry. It is not the hush of contentment, but the quiet of an industrial graveyard. A council leader warns of history repeating itself. A local activist urges the people of Wales to show heart and spirit and fight back. The message to Port Talbot from Ravenscraig is blunt: don't let this happen to you. Ravenscraig steelworks in central Scotland closed in 1992 after a bitter 12-year fight. There is still a numbness here, the pain of a phantom limb still nearly unbearable almost a quarter of a century after amputation. The questions it raises - about the UK's industrial strategy and the way areas are treated when their main source of employment disappears - are still raw. Listen to Mark Mardell's full report from Ravenscraig on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. Workers were given generous compensation and retrained, according to one union leader, but the promised regeneration never came. The 'Craig, as everyone around here calls it with familiar affection, covered an area twice the size of Monaco. Today it is largely a wasteland, the biggest brownfield site in Europe. Very brown it is too. Sure there is a gleaming glass-fronted further education college, a sports centre of dramatic design, a pub and some new homes. But there are also swathes of churned up mud, puddles and scrubby grass. There were ambitious plans for the biggest new town in Europe and an immense shopping centre that would pull in people from all over Scotland. But other retailers didn't like the idea and there was a lengthy court battle that went to the House of Lords. By the time it was over, the recession and the new enthusiasm for shopping online put paid to those dreams. Everyone I talk to speaks as if with one mind. If regeneration is to happen it should be well-funded and immediate. But it is not the answer. The answer is "save our steel". What happened to the people of Ravenscraig - what they fear awaits families in Port Talbot - goes to the heart of a problem that haunts the West and reverberates in its politics. It is one part of the reason for the success of Donald Trump in the US and parties of the hard right and hard left in Europe, as well as the plight of the Labour Party in many parts of the UK. While globalisation may boost the world economy, while its masters feel as at home in Beijing, Birmingham and Berlin, it leaves a remnant floundering in a changing landscape, searching for more secure national identities rooted in a tried and tested past. It explains why we are hearing calls for trade tariffs when once protectionism seemed as old-fashioned as the intense battle over the Corn Laws. Steelworks, like coal mining and shipbuilding, were the source of jobs for generations and decent money. But my visit to Ravenscraig reminded me that it was about more than just cash. I started my life as a journalist on Teesside in the north east of England at the time when closures were always in the air. It seemed each week the Labour MPs would come up with a new "dossier of despair" chronicling decline. Not much has changed - Redcar's steelworks finally shut down last autumn. Later as an industrial reporter I covered the long and bitter miners' strike. The sector, hit by multiple mass extinctions, not only underpinned a region's economy but was a source of pride and purpose. The sort of feeling that people have for their country or their football team, people had for their industry, their plant, their pit. Maybe that's an overly romantic generalisation but there's a truth in it. You don't get that sense of self worth from a call centre or a food court. Nor do you get the power of the unions or a solid commitment to one political party. This is a phenomenon all over Europe and the US. The Rust Belt in the US goes on for mile after mile, rows of corroding chimneys and towers, inspiring Bruce Springsteen's despairing nostalgia for blue collar America. You can see similar discarded husks of heavy industry all over Eastern Europe. But there is a particularly British twist to this story. I remember going to see the heartland of German industry, the Ruhr, six or seven years ago. Mining is dead but steel is very much alive. Standing high up in a steelworks command centre, like the bridge of a ship, you can look down on an area much bigger than Ravenscraig, pumping out smoke and steam. Germany has a strategy that values manufacturing. The SNP government in Scotland would say it does too. When Tata announced the planned closure of the last remaining steelworks, they acted. Details of the deal are sketchy, but it appears the plants were nationalised for a few brief hours and then sold on. It is not just industrial giants Germany and the US who produce more steel than the UK. So do France, Italy and Spain. Perhaps, some would argue, that is because they are behind the times. But the question is obvious - if I have been covering the decline of British steel all my working life, what have successive British governments been doing about it? At Ravenscraig you'll hear mutterings about "Maggie" and "the Conservatives". But it is arguable that all recent governments have seen heavy industry as the past, and banking and services as the bright future - the market embraced with an enthusiasm not matched on the continent. This current steel crisis will pass, one way or another. But it provokes big questions, not only about whether steel is a strategic resource, but about the future of work. That does not mean it will result in a new strategy or new thinking. But this leaves a sense of bitterness in its wake. As one man who worked at the 'Craig for 30 years put it: "You still need steel. You can't make the Forth Bridge out of plastic."	The sports centre at Ravenscraig is a homage, a "symphony in steel", say the architects.
The US Navy said on 8 April that the Carl Vinson strike group was travelling to the Korean peninsula amid tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Last week President Trump said an "armada" was being sent. But the group was actually farther away over the weekend, moving through the Sunda Strait into the Indian Ocean. The US military's Pacific Command said on Tuesday that it had cancelled a port visit to Perth, but had completed previously scheduled training with Australia off its northwest coast after departing Singapore on 8 April. The strike group was now "proceeding to the Western Pacific as ordered". It is not clear whether the failure to arrive was a deliberate deception, perhaps designed to frighten North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, a change of plan or simple miscommunication, the BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says. Either way, US Vice-President Mike Pence was undeterred as he spoke aboard the USS Ronald Reagan - an aircraft carrier docked in Japan - during his tour of the region, vowing to "defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response". North Korea and the US have ratcheted up tensions in recent weeks and the movement of the strike group had raised the question of a pre-emptive strike by the US. On Wednesday, Mr Pence described the country as the "most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security" in the Asia-Pacific. His words came after the North held a show of military might in a parade over the weekend and tested another missile on Sunday, which blew up almost immediately after launch, the Pentagon said. The US also accused North Korea of trying to "provoke something", with US Defence Secretary James Mattis calling the test a reckless move on Tuesday. He said the US was "working closely" with China to engage North Korea. Pyongyang said it may test missiles on a weekly basis, and warned of "all-out war" if the US takes military action. "If the US is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method," Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol told the BBC on Monday.

On Monday, the Supreme Court declared all the actions of the assembly null and void until they stood down. The three legislators say they agreed to leave the legislature to break the continuing stand-off. Without the seats, the opposition loses a critical two-thirds majority. The so-called "super-majority" would would allow the opposition to put a more effective challenge to the government of Nicolas Maduro. They would be able to change the constitution and appoint new Supreme Court judges. "We completely reject that ruling," said the three legislators on a letter that was read in parliament. But their decision would "help free parliament from the institutional ambush they want to lead it into," they added. The request by the three legislators - Julio Haron Ygarza, Nirma Guarulla and Romel Guzamana - was approved by the opposition-held assembly. Members of the pro-government bloc celebrated the decision as "a victory for the people". "We applaud this move, which puts the National Assembly back within the framework of legality," said pro-government legislator Hector Rodriguez. The newly-elected National Assembly had defied the Supreme Court ruling, swearing in the suspended legislators last week. Four lawmakers were barred by the Supreme Court - three from the opposition and one allied with the government - after the Socialist Party alleged irregularities during the 6 December vote for a new assembly. The opposition claimed the the ruling was designed to strip it of the crucial two-thirds majority. Without the four legislators, the opposition has 109 seats and the government 54. With the four banned legislators, the opposition gets the 112 seats it needs to reach the so-called "super-majority". The four politicians are all from the rural and sparsely populated south-western state of Amazonas. Venezuela's Supreme Court has almost always ruled in favour of the government during the last 17 years of socialist government under President Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.	Three opposition politicians in Venezuela have agreed to give up their seats in the National Assembly while the electoral authorities investigate allegations of voting irregularities.
He said his party was on course to win its first ever seats in Cardiff - where it is campaigning heavily - and in the Northern Ireland and London Assemblies. It was "50-50" whether the party would gain representation in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, he said. He declined to put a target on UKIP gains in English council elections. UKIP is campaigning on multiple fronts as it seeks to become the only UK party to get people elected to the National Assembly of Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as the Greater London Assembly. The party has focused much of its time and resources in Wales, where it won 13% of the vote in last year's general election. Opinion polls suggest UKIP is set to win seats for the first time despite a row over its candidate selection process. Mr Farage told the BBC's Daily Politics: "There will be a breakthrough in Wales. I think we are going to win five seats - we may do slightly better than that. Let's see." As for England, Mr Farage would not be drawn on how many seats it would gain but said its record in local government was a good one and he predicted it would consolidate its position in its existing strongholds in Essex and South Yorkshire. "We will make gains. To try and guess how many is virtually impossible. In Thurrock, I think we will become the biggest party on that council, in Rotherham we have a chance of becoming the biggest party on that council. "There are 500 local UKIP councillors. Our local base is growing, the people who have had elected have behaved, on the whole, pretty well and been very diligent and worked very hard. Yes, we will improve." There has been speculation about the future of the party, and a possible change in direction, whatever the outcome of June's referendum on EU membership. Mr Farage said if there was a narrow vote to stay in the EU, a lot of Conservative and Labour supporters would be unable to reconcile themselves with the result and their party leadership's stance and UKIP could find itself "a lot bigger than it is now". If there was a vote to leave, he said UKIP would need to "stay around" to ensure that the people's will was "implemented" but he conceded that it would need to show it could talk about issues other than Europe. And he rejected suggestions that UKIP - which only managed to get one MP elected in last year's general election despite winning 12% of the vote - was treading water nationally, citing a recent YouGov opinion poll which put it on 20%. "We are now at the highest we have ever been as a party - what more can I do?"	UKIP will win at least five seats on the Welsh Assembly as part of a UK-wide "breakthrough" in Thursday's polls, its leader Nigel Farage has said.
In a bid to promote password security, Strathclyde University produced a poster saying: "Bet Jennifer Lawrence wishes she'd used a StR0nG_Pas5w0Rd%." The image attracted criticism on social media, with the Glasgow-based university accused of "victim blaming". The university said the poster had been removed and should not have been made. An image of the poster was tweeted on Monday by Billy McCauley who said: "Pretty shocking victim blaming here. Will you take it down?" A short time later, Strathclyde University tweeted: "The posters are being removed now. They should not have produced and we are looking into how this happened." A spokesman for the university later said: "The posters are in bad taste and have now been removed from campus. The sentiment expressed is not consistent with the values of this university." Dozens of private pictures of Hunger Games actress Lawrence were released on the internet in September. Other celebrities targeted in the leaks included Rihanna, Kate Upton, Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian. It is thought the photos were taken off the stars' iCloud accounts and were shared on other websites.	A university has withdrawn a poster which appeared to ridicule Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence after her nude pictures were leaked on the internet.
The Office for National Statistics found it contained the highest proportion of deprived areas, followed by West Bromwich in the West Midlands. Guildford in Surrey was the least deprived town. The study considered factors such as income, employment, health, education, skills and training and crime. It also looked at disability, access to housing and the built environment in cities and towns in England and Wales. The north-west of England had five of the ten most deprived towns and cities, while the West Midlands had three of the top five. The data revealed that while Oldham was the most deprived overall, West Bromwich came off the worst for employment and income. The town in Sandwell was ranked the lowest out of 109 areas for both aspects and second lowest for education. Where are the most and least happy places in England? Birmingham was also given the lowest ranking for housing. At the opposite end of the table, Guildford, Woking and St Albans were all found to have the highest proportion of the least deprived areas. The study by the ONS also revealed 29 out of 45 towns and cities in southern England had an average house price of more than £200,000, compared with only three out of 64 in the North and Midlands. Through research looking at England and Wales, the ONS found house prices have risen the most in Cambridge since 2010, increasing 47%. Swansea saw prices decrease 4% over the same period. The cheapest place to buy a home is Burnley in Lancashire, according to the ONS. A detached home goes for an average of £166,000 while a semi-detached attracts about £120,000. Flats go for an average of £69,950 while terraced houses are priced at an average of £54,498, making the overall average £78,000. St Albans has the most expensive housing, with an average detached home costing £675,000 or £529,400 for a semi-detached. An average terraced house goes for £400,000 and a flat for £255,000, making the overall average £390,000. Councillor Eddie Moores, Oldham Council's cabinet member for health, said: "In the last five years we've worked hard to improve health, wages, skills and employment opportunities through initiatives like Get Oldham Working, the Oldham Education and Skills Commission and the award-winning Warm Homes Oldham, which has already lifted more than 3,300 people out of fuel poverty. "We've also invested in the borough's biggest post war regeneration programme so that people can benefit from a growing economy and get more opportunities to succeed." Sandwell Council Leader Darren Cooper said: "We have faced massive cuts from central government, and this has taken a huge amount of money out of the local economy. "Some of the ONS indicators are out of the council's control, but we are trying hard to build the local economy and create more jobs, fighting back against the rising tide of austerity." Among the successes were the New Square shopping centre, campuses at Sandwell Colleges Central and Sixth Form Campuses, and the Health Futures University Technical College and there were plans for an expanded Metro and improved bus and road networks, Mr Cooper said.	Oldham in Greater Manchester is the most deprived town in England, an official study into housing and poverty has found.
Dyfed-Powys Police said training would begin on Wednesday ahead of them being deployed on the streets. Cameras are always on but only record once the officer presses a button. Police and crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: "The use of the cameras supports transparency in policing and will aid the investigation of complaints against officers." The move follows a three-month trial in 2015 and any member of the public has the right to request footage taken of them within 31 days. Any recordings not needed for policing purposes are automatically deleted from cloud storage after that time. The force said recordings would only be made if there was "a policing need" and officers would announce when they start and stop filming. Cameras will always be on standby, filming on a 30-second loop, but audio does not record until the officer presses the button. Chief Constable Mark Collins said: "They will provide the public with more reassurance and will help officers to document valuable evidence - leading to swifter justice for victims."	A police force has begun the rollout of body cameras for 800 officers and community support officers.
The Lancastria troopship was carrying between 6,000 and 9,000 people when it was sunk by German dive bombers on 17 June 1940. Only about 2,500 people survived in the largest single loss of life for British forces in the whole of World War II. Relatives and survivors have until 15 May to apply for a commemorative medal. The Scottish government commissioned a medal in 2008, issuing more than 375 since. The upcoming 75th anniversary of the event signals the closure of the commemorative medal application process. The Lancastria, a converted Cunard liner built on the Clyde, was carrying servicemen - including about 400 Scots - and a number of civilian women and children when it was bombed by German planes, sinking within minutes off the coast of France. At the time news of the disaster was suppressed by the British government because of the impact it might have on the country's morale. Nearly six weeks later the New York Times broke the story, printing dramatic pictures of the disaster. Veterans' Secretary Keith Brown said: "We in Scotland feel a strong bond with the servicemen and women who have served us throughout the years and continue to protect the democratic freedoms we still enjoy today. "The commemorative HMS Lancastria medal from the Scottish government is a lasting reminder of our gratitude to those who made the ultimate sacrifice on that fateful day. Their memory is honoured, their place in history is secured." Mr Brown appealed for anyone who believes they or a family member is entitled to a medal to come forward and make a claim.	Survivors and descendants of those killed during Britain's worst ever maritime disaster are being urged to claim medals honouring them.
The choir was established by Henry VIII in 1539 and is currently made up of 20 boys and 12 adults. The Dean of Gloucester said including girl choristers would be an "exciting new chapter" in the choir's history. The aim is to find youngsters from local schools and a range of backgrounds who may not have considered singing in a cathedral choir before. Adrian Partington, director of music at Gloucester Cathedral, said the aim is to "discover" some very talented girls. New recruits will play a full part in the cathedral's musical worship, beginning with rehearsals in September before singing at evensong each Monday from October as well as at Christmas and Easter services. The dean, the Very Reverend Stephen Lake, said: "This will ensure that young girls and boys will be lifting their voices in song at Gloucester Cathedral for many years to come." The cathedral is hosting a "come and sing" open day on 9 April with girls and boys aged between seven and 12 invited to experience singing in the cathedral. Auditions for girls will be held on 23 April.	Girls are being invited to audition to join Gloucester Cathedral's Choir for the first time in its 477 year history.
It said lack of awareness and a shortage of trainees meant police often ended up questioning adults with mental illness or learning issues without one. Home Secretary Theresa May said the situation was "not acceptable". Appropriate adults are trained volunteers who help with communication during police interviews. They are supposed to ensure mentally vulnerable people who are arrested or questioned understand what is happening, and that their legal rights and welfare are safeguarded. They were introduced in the 1980s following miscarriages of justice involving vulnerable people. Local authorities are required to provide appropriate adults whenever children are in contact with police and there is no parent or guardian present, but there is no duty to do the same in respect of vulnerable adults. In some areas, no organised scheme for adults exists. Researchers analysed police data and found appropriate adults were used in about 45,000 of the 1.4m detentions and voluntary interviews of adults each year. It is estimated that 280,000 of those detentions involves a person who is "mentally vulnerable". What does an appropriate adult do? Appropriate adults do not provide legal advice, but assist with rights and broader welfare. Nuala Chapman, an appropriate adult, told BBC Radio 5 live that she would be called after a medical practitioner had decided someone in custody needed support. "We then go to the station, we go through all the processes with them, we make sure they understand what is going on, we go through interview with them and... facilitate communication between all the people in the interview," she said. "Our role ends once they have either been charged or bailed." The report, entitled There to Help, found police were least likely to identify vulnerability in areas which did not have an organised appropriate adult scheme. Custody officers reported spending hours trying to find a suitable appropriate adult. They admitted to sometimes asking random members of the public, or proceeding without one. Chris Bath, chief executive of the National Appropriate Adult Network, the charity which led the study, said: "People with learning disabilities, mental ill health, traumatic brain injuries or autistic spectrum disorders are some of the most vulnerable citizens, and state detention is perhaps the most vulnerable situation. "We have a moral and a legal duty to ensure appropriate adults are available wherever people live." The report's recommendations include: The home secretary said appropriate adults "provide vital support and help to demystify what can be a confusing, sometimes frightening, experience in police custody". Mrs May added: "The status quo is not acceptable and I am concerned that vulnerable adults are not always receiving the support of an appropriate adult. "We are currently examining the recommendations and implementation options to ensure that vulnerable people are provided with the support they are entitled to." Avtar Bhatoa, from the Law Society, said appropriate adults were needed to ensure "fair justice for all". "With the right support, mentally vulnerable people are less likely to suffer an injustice or to waive their right to free legal advice through fear and misunderstanding, which can compound their disadvantage in the justice system, " he said.	Up to a quarter of a million vulnerable people are not being supported by an "appropriate adult" while in police custody, a Home Office report suggests.
Robinson, 21, who previously had two loan spells at the Lilywhites, turned down a new deal with Villa and joins for an undisclosed compensation fee. Newcastle-born former Rotherham man Pringle, 26, signs for an undisclosed fee after one year with the Cottagers. Pringle made nine league starts during a short loan spell at Ipswich in 2016. Robinson told the club's website: "It was obviously a big decision for me leaving Aston Villa, I've been there since I was eight-years-old. "But, if there was ever a club for me to settle down with and sign permanently with, it would be Preston North End." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Championship side Preston North End have signed Aston Villa forward Callum Robinson and Fulham midfielder Ben Pringle, both on three-year contracts.
They have occupied a floor of the university's administration building. The students, from the Fossil Free QUB group, began their action following a winter graduation ceremony on Friday afternoon. They claim they will "indefinitely" occupy the floor, at the rear of the 'quad' in the main Lanyon building. The building is home to the university's finance, academic and student affairs departments. The students are calling for the university to withdraw its investments entirely from fossil fuel corporations and to pursue a renewable energy agenda. One of the students involved, Sean Fearon, said the university was being "intransigent" in refusing to commit to divestment. "They have offered to review their ethical investment policy, which we see as an attempt to slow the campaign," he said. "We want a timetable for a five-year programme for the university to withdraw any investments in fossil fuels. "As the United Nations Conference on Climate Change is ending, it is symbolic that we've taken action to fight for our future and a cleaner planet." He said the students planned to stay in the building until the university negotiated "properly" about their investments. In a statement, a spokesman for Queen's said: "At its meeting on 14 October 2015, the university investment committee agreed to carry out a comprehensive review of its investment policy. "The review is expected to take six to nine months and will be informed by best practice in the area of socially responsible investment. "As part of this review the university has engaged directly with students of Fossil Free QUB. "To help inform the investment policy review a workshop will be held in early January 2016 and will include students from Fossil Free QUB."	About 15 students are occupying part of a Queen's University Belfast building in protest at its failure to commit to divestment from fossil fuels.
Media playback is not supported on this device Sunday's 1-1 draw against Ross County, which took the Hoops nine points clear with four games left, saw anti-board protests and boos at the final whistle. "They can say and do as they please because we have not been producing the right results as we should be. "We know that and we have let ourselves down," Brown said. Manager Ronny Deila's announcement that he will leave at the end of the season because of a lack of improvement in performances has cast a shadow over the remainder of the club's season. But Celtic could effectively wrap up their fifth Premiership title in a row with victory against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday, given their vastly superior goal difference to second-placed Aberdeen, who they face the following weekend. "We need to bounce back from this now," said Brown, in Dublin to promote Celtic's pre-season International Champions Cup match against Barcelona on 30 July. "We need to start getting ourselves together. We need to go back to winning ways. We've got next season to look forward to. "We are going for five in a row now and we want to continue it, we want to get six and seven. "We believe we've got the players in that dressing room that can do that and we've just got to put a lot of faith and trust in ourselves and express a lot more than we have been doing in recent weeks. "As everyone knows there's going to be a new manager but we're concentrating on the last three or four games of the season. "For now Ronny is still our manager and now we need to try and win the league for him as soon as possible and give him something back." Deila resigned days after the Hoops were beaten by Old Firm rivals Rangers on penalties in the Scottish Cup semi-finals. Fans were also frustrated at the club's lack of Champions League progress under the Norwegian. Former West Brom boss Steve Clarke has become the latest to declare his interest in the vacancy, although David Moyes remains the bookmakers' favourite. Media playback is not supported on this device	Celtic captain Scott Brown says unhappy fans have every right to vent their feelings after a season in which the team have "let themselves down".
Cesare Prandelli resigned as Azzurri coach after they were knocked out in the World Cup group stage. Former Italy midfielder Conte, 45, quit as Juventus boss last month, having won the Serie A title in each of his three seasons in charge. He has also managed Bari and Siena to promotion from Serie B, as well as having spells at Arezzo and Atalanta. The Italian Football Federation said in addition to his salary, Conte would receive a bonus for qualifying for Euro 2016, an added bonus for climbing at least five places in the Fifa rankings - Italy are currently 14th - and a third bonus if they reach the final of Euro 2016. Conte is the second big appointment by the Italian Football Federation this week. Carlo Tavecchio, who made a racist comment during his election campaign, was named as its new president.	Italy have appointed former Juventus boss Antonio Conte as their new coach until 2016.
He passed away peacefully in hospital on Tuesday after a short illness. Born in Tourmakeady, County Mayo, he worked as a teacher before securing a part in the premiere of the Brian Friel play Translations in 1980. Lally became a household name in Ireland for his role as Miley Byrne in the RTE soap opera Glenroe and later starred in the BBC series Ballykissangel. He also appeared in the Hollywood movie Alexander and provided the voice for the Oscar-nominated, animated Irish film, The Secret of Kells. As a fluent Irish speaker and advocate of the language, Lally had roles in several Irish language films. He is survived by his wife Peggy and their children Saileog, Darach and Maghnus.	One of Ireland's best known actors, Mick Lally, has died at the age of 64.
Barry Gray's side have taken maximum points from their last four matches, scoring 12 goals and conceding none. In the night's other two league games, Glenavon host Glentoran and Portadown travel to Ballinamallard United. Carrick Rangers play Amateur League side Crumlin Star in a rearranged Irish Cup sixth round tie at Seaview. The winners will have home advantage against Crusaders in the quarter-finals of the competition. "We are just glad to have regular games. There has been so much 'is it going to be on, is it not going to be on' since we have had the problems with the pitch at Taylor's Avenue," said Carrick manager Gary Haveron. Warrenpoint now lie just one point behind fellow strugglers Ballinamallard, Dungannon and Carrick at the foot of the table thanks to a seven-match unbeaten league run which stretches back two months. "We are in a position now where nobody wants to sit out games. All the players are eager to get started again so everyone will be ready to go on Monday night," said 'Point boss Barry Gray. "The players we brought in during January have brought a freshness to the changing room and competition for places. "They have brought quality too and the players around them have stepped up to the mark. "Whether it's enough given our poor start to the season, we'll have to wait a couple of months to find out." Glentoran will be out to avenge a 4-1 sixth round Irish Cup defeat by Glentoran at the Oval when the sides meet again at Mourneview Park. The Lurgan Blues must plan without striker Eoin Bradley, who was sent-off in the 1-1 draw with leaders Crusaders on Friday night. Portadown central defender Ken Oman is suspended for his side's trip to Ferney Park after being dismissed in the victory over Linfield but Ronnie McFall's side should have Garry Breen and Sean Mackle available again. Ports assistant manager Kieran Harding has hailed the impact made by ex-Linfield and Derry City midfielder Philip Lowry since his recent arrival at Shamrock Park. "Philip has outstanding energy and he covers the ground. If we had him from the start of the season, we may not be in the position we are in," argued Harding, whose side have moved up to seventh in the standings. Mallards boss Whitey Anderson lamented his team's performance in a 3-0 loss to Warrenpoint on Friday and has made clear that he expects more from his players. "You can try to play all the good football you want, but unless you can display heart and desire it counts for nothing. That's what I want to see," said Anderson.

Canadian Roger Thomas Clark is said to have been a key adviser for Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht. The US Department of Justice alleged that Mr Clark advised Ulbricht about the best way to run the site and how to evade the police. The Silk Road website was shut down in late 2013 following raids by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. It was a marketplace sited on the dark web through which many people bought illegal drugs. In May this year Ross Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison for creating and running the site. The DoJ alleges that Mr Clark was a "high-ranking" operator on the Silk Road and was instrumental in helping Ulbricht run it. He gave advice about ways to improve the technology underpinning the site, boost sales and on the best way for Ulbricht to hide his real identity, said US authorities. Mr Clark was paid "at least hundreds of thousands of dollars" for this advice, said the DoJ in a statement announcing the arrest. "Clark may have thought residing in Thailand would keep him out of reach of US authorities, but our international partnerships have proven him wrong," said FBI assistant director Diego Rodriguez. On the site and in other underground forums, Mr Clark is believed to have used several nicknames including "Variety Jones, "VJ", "Cimon" and "Plural of Mongoose". Extradition proceedings have been started against Mr Clark to transfer him from a jail in Thailand to the US. He faces charges of narcotics conspiracy and money laundering. If found guilty of both charges he could face 30 years in jail.	A man alleged to have helped run the notorious Silk Road drug marketplace has been arrested in Thailand.
It was always going to be a highly charged farewell, after 112 years, to this football bastion of east London and the one consolation was that at least no-one was seriously injured. This was a hugely significant fixture for the visitors too, Louis van Gaal and his players arriving with their fate in their own hands but little margin for error. They knew victory here, amid a heady mix of nostalgia and fierce hostility, would leave them needing only to beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday to secure Champions League football. Instead, a 3-2 loss leaves them still needing that win against the Cherries - but now requiring that neighbours Manchester City lose at Swansea. Media playback is not supported on this device As a fleet of London taxis brought a succession of West Ham greats on to the Boleyn Ground turf for the big finish to the farewell party, several cynics suggested one cab was on order to ferry Van Gaal away from Manchester United. It has been obvious since Christmas that there has been no great appetite inside Old Trafford to replace Van Gaal - if United were certain he was not the man for the job, former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could have already been occupying his office or at least officially lined up. Even in the hours before this loss at West Ham, Van Gaal's position appeared to be gaining strength with the supposed loss of 18-year-old transfer target Renato Sanches to Bayern Munich in a £27.6m deal. It was later suggested United had not missed out but that Van Gaal had actually vetoed the deal - and why would the club let him do that if he was not going to be in charge next season? The fact that Sanches' agent is Jorge Mendes, who would love to see his client Mourinho installed at Old Trafford, only added to the perceived political intrigue. Media playback is not supported on this device One way Van Gaal could have strengthened his position even further would have been a win at West Ham that would have made United firm favourites to beat City to fourth place in the Premier League, with the potential bonus of an FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace in May. Indeed, so buoyed was Van Gaal by the sudden upturn in his position that he was even able to point out to the media that they were finally posing tactical questions before a game rather than asking about his possible sacking. And for four tantalising second-half minutes it all seemed on for Van Gaal. Antony Martial's brilliance had turned the game, undeservedly on its balance, in United's favour with two goals. At 2-1 up, they were 14 minutes from a win that could have offered the opportunity to put a different spin on their season. It was not to be. Old vulnerabilities quickly returned and saw United beaten by two headed goals from Michail Antonio and Winston Reid - leaving Van Gaal back on the rack. The players dragged their manager out of a hole then threw him back in again. The intention may still be to keep him next season but that decision would have been made a lot easier and more palatable with victory. Now it all goes on the line again on Sunday - but with Manchester City at the controls. The equation is simple. Manchester United must beat Bournemouth and hope Manchester City lose at Swansea - and therein lies that sliver of hope for the 64-year-old Dutch coach. City have been so unreliable, unpredictable and uninspired at times this season that you would not risk too much on the certainty of Manuel Pellegrini's side getting the job done. Of course City will be favourites and only need a point - but they are not a team to be trusted, as seen in their heavy defeat at Southampton and disappointing draw at home to Arsenal in their last two Premier League games. And after beating Liverpool 3-1 and, more impressively, thrashing West Ham 4-1 at Upton Park on Saturday, Swansea are also running into the sort of relaxed good form that makes them dangerous opponents. Confidence has been renewed to such an extent that head coach Francesco Guidolin is expected to be confirmed on a new contract after a Swansea board meeting on Wednesday. City can be fragile and United will hope that vulnerability haunts them one last time. And then all it needs is for United to beat Bournemouth - but United cannot be trusted either. Manchester United's players may have been affected by an arduous coach journey that ended in such disgraceful scenes outside Upton Park - and West Ham co-owner David Sullivan's dismissive response that the visitors should simply have arrived earlier did no credit to him or his club on this landmark night. The kick-off was delayed by 45 minutes but there was still no excuse for a tepid Manchester United first half that lacked urgency, organisation and anything that would be reasonably expected with stakes so high. They were lucky to only trail to Diafra Sakho's early goal, their defence going missing in its entirety shortly afterwards when Andy Carroll raced clear only to shoot straight at David de Gea. It was as if Van Gaal had not impressed upon his players that a door to the Champions League that had looked shut for so long was suddenly ajar. Instead it looked like meaningless, end-of-season stuff. The superb Martial offered brief hope, the normally passive Van Gaal leaping from his seat to punch the air - but the joy did not last long as the visitors' vulnerability in defence was exposed. They simply could not cope with West Ham's pressure. For long spells this was a performance that made you question how such an ordinary side could even be in contention for a top-four place. They were that poor. True, they missed the aerial strength of suspended Marouane Fellaini, who operated with such success to not only combat the likes of Carroll but also score when Manchester United won 2-1 at Upton Park in the FA Cup quarter-final replay. In the final reckoning, however, this defeat was deserved after a display that produced much of the evidence that has left so many United fans questioning Van Gaal's future. Van Gaal will still believe his side can reach the Champions League but the odds are against them now so he may well end up looking to the FA Cup for success. If United win he will undoubtedly paint this as progress - and he will have a point as it would be the club's first major trophy since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. It may not be enough, however, to suggest Van Gaal is pointing United in the right direction, despite his willingness to play youth with the emergence of 18-year-old Marcus Rashford and the signing of 20-year-old Antony Martial - who increasingly looks like a bargain at £36m from Monaco. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward clearly wants his man to succeed and his thoughts on the future remain a mystery but there is no doubt an FA Cup win is a much harder sell than an FA Cup win and Champions League football.

The bridge fell on to the London-bound carriageway of the motorway just after midday on Saturday 27 August. The man from Darlington has been issued with a summons to appear before Maidstone magistrates on 17 February. He will face charges of dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He will also face three counts of criminal damage. A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when the bridge came down.  No one died. The collapse happened between junctions four and three, near the junction with the M26 which links the M25 London orbital with the M20. The road, which is the main route to the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover, had to be closed while two large cranes worked to clear the debris. The road was closed again the following weekend for the remains of the partially collapsed pedestrian bridge to be removed.	A 63-year-old man will appear in court following the collapse of a pedestrian bridge on the M20 during last August's bank holiday weekend.
The bird, which is named LM12, arrived on Thursday, the earliest reappearance of a resident bird there in almost 50 years. Its mate LF15 is expected soon at the Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve near Dunkeld, which operates a live webcam of the nest. The pair fledged three chicks in both 2015 and 2016. Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "One of our eagle eyed volunteers spotted LM12 just after 17:00. "He spent several hours in the nearby trees but didn't touch down on the nest until early this morning when he appeared carrying his breakfast. "From the views we've had of his distinctive chest pattern and long wing tips we are as sure as we can be that it is LM12. "He has also made himself well and truly at home, bringing in sticks and preparing the nest, which is further proof that he is the resident male."	A male osprey has returned to its nest at the Loch of the Lowes reserve after its migration from West Africa.
The Scot had already forged a successful karate career, spending six years on the international stage, and then came close to a 2006 Winter Olympic berth in bobsleigh, before winning rowing gold at the London 2012 Paralympics. But now Smith wants to represent Great Britain in a fourth different sport - and hit the road at Rio 2016 as a cyclist. Born with a club foot, he had to learn to walk in special plaster casts, before undergoing emergency spinal surgery in 2010, meaning he had to learn to walk all over again before going on to win gold at his home Paralympics. Life is all about hurdles - it is how we get over them which defines who we are Now he is preparing for his first serious bike race at the International Para-cycling Cup, a three-day event which starts in Newport, Wales, on Friday. "I hope that it's the start of my journey to Rio," Smith told BBC Radio Berkshire. "To be in Rio in a different sport would be special, so with that in mind my first race is at the velodrome in Wales as a guest rider in the 1km and 4km pursuit." The 35-year-old, who teamed up with Pamela Relph, Naomi Riches, James Roe and cox Lily van den Broecke to win mixed coxed four gold, retired from rowing after London 2012 because of deteriorating health. But Smith, born in Dunfermline and now living in Aviemore, is used to overcoming adversity in pursuit of sporting glory, having been born with both feet facing backwards, and had bones repeatedly broken and reset to correct the problem as a child. Still, he grew up to "fall in love" with karate. After deciding that six years of "beat ups" was enough, Smith gave athletics a try - and he even turned out to have pace to burn. But there are some side effects of having a foot that was nearly amputated at birth. "I set off in athletics and took to the 400m, but due to my feet I couldn't run around the bends and ended up shattering and having stress fractures all through my right foot and up my right leg and into my hips," he said. After being born with a club foot, Smith spent the first three years of his life having his bones broken and reset to correct his foot alignment. By the age of 15, he was competing internationally as a British karate junior. Then, by 2002, he was the brakeman in a British World Cup bobsleigh team. When injury ended his bobsleigh career, he turned to rowing and was soon competing internationally as part of an 'adaptive' mixed coxed four crew. Along with the sports that Smith competed for Great Britain, he also won a shinty junior Scottish title, competed in Austria, France and New Zealand in skiing and claimed a East of Scotland 400m athletics title. "I wasn't massively slow, I was running about 49 seconds in my first year in the sport so I just thought it was just another dream gone. "It was then that it hit me - I had the bug and really wanted to be an Olympian. I was never going to let it go and it turned into a bit of an obsession." By chance, he one day turned on the television and saw bobsleighing. There were no bends, he fancied himself running in a straight line on ice and went for it. He was brakeman for the British four-man bob that fell one hundredth of a second short of making it to the Winter Olympics in Turin. Then a mystery neck injury, a constant pain thought to have been brought on by overtraining, ultimately forced him to give up bobsledding. He calls the realisation that his foot classified him for the Paralympics a "sliding door" moment in his life and chose then to take up rowing. And it is not just because that particular sporting adventure started with World Championship victory in 2009 and finished on the top step of the podium at Eton Dorney. Rather, it was team physiotherapist Patrick Dunleavy's discovery in 2010 that there was something not quite right when manipulating his spine. Doctors investigated, discovering that that mystery neck injury was in fact a tumour the size of a tennis ball embedded in his upper spine, behind his throat. "All I thought about was that I needed to be in London. I never made a team with it [the tumour] in me. But with it taken out there was nothing to stop me from getting to London," Smith said. "There are complications with surgery sometimes and I suffered a blood clot inside the spinal chord. Once they sent me home to Ascot I woke up one morning and was paralysed from the neck down. I was rushed back into hospital for another surgery." Media playback is not supported on this device After his second operation he had to learn to walk again, not that Smith would let something like that stop him from achieving his Paralympic dreams. "I just remember lying there thinking 'I'm still going to be in London and going to win gold'. I didn't mean it in an arrogant way. I just wanted it so, so much and would do anything to get to the start line." Scar tissue from that life-threatening spinal surgery - with surgeons opting to go through the front of his neck and around his windpipe and vocal chords to access the spine - eventually led to his retirement from rowing and now poses new problems. He even has plans to cycle around the world, but after being invited to trial with the GB cycling team he admits his appetite for competition is far from satisfied. "My one love is pulling on that GB top and competing - it's that one moment when you are competing and your heart rate is over 170 and you are giving it everything," he said. "I don't really know what the future holds, I have to go in for more scans to see what is happening with the scar tissue because if that continues to grows to the same size as the tumour it will cause the same problems. "Life is all about hurdles - it is how we get over them which defines who we are." Interview by BBC Radio Berkshire's Adrian Williams.	Life-threatening surgery, broken bones and a lifetime of obstacles have not stopped Paralympic champion David Smith scrapping, splashing and sliding his way to the top.
He died in a Dublin Hospital at 06:40 GMT on Friday. Fr Reid, 82, a  member of the Redemptorist order, secretly acted as a conduit between the republican movement and the SDLP. He was one of the witnesses who confirmed the decommissioning of IRA weapons. In recent years, he was involved in talks with Basque nationalists seeking independence from Spain. In 1988, Fr Reid was pictured praying over the bodies of Army corporals Derek Wood and David Howes who had been dragged from their car, beaten and shot by the IRA. The corporals had inadvertently driven into the midst of a republican funeral in Belfast. The photograph of the bloodstained priest crouched praying over one of the soldiers was one of the starkest images of the Northern Ireland Troubles. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Fr Alec Reid's intervention to administer last rites epitomised his enormous faith and strength of conviction. "His comfort was given amidst the enormous fears and tension on that terrible day in March 1988." Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said Clonard monastery, Fr Reid's base in west Belfast during the Troubles, was "the cradle of the peace process". He told RTÉ Radio he was with Fr Reid on Thursday night in St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and had been due to visit him again on Friday. "What Alec Reid did was, he lived the gospel message. He developed a view which was contrary to the official view, that there had to be dialogue, and he was tenacious." Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, said: "I heard with sadness of the death of Fr Reid. "We all owe a debt of gratitude to him for the role he played in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland." Former SDLP leader John Hume said Fr Reid was "not simply a go between" in the early days of negotiating for peace. "He was an active player in fighting for an end to violence," Mr Hume said. "Without his courage, determination and utter selflessness, the road to peace in our region would have been much longer and much more difficult to traverse. "While we mourn the loss of a great man, we must also celebrate the legacy of peace and an opportunity to reconcile our people that he gave to us. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to waste." Michael D Higgins, the president of Ireland, said: "His ministering of the last rites to the two British corporals brutally killed in 1988 offered us an image of decency struggling to assert itself amidst brutality." There were tears and tributes in west Belfast as news broke of the death of Fr Alec Reid. "He should have got a Nobel Peace Prize," said one man. "But maybe he turned it down. The only prize he wanted was peace." One elderly woman, tears streaming down her face, said: "He should be remembered with respect. "He was someone who children should aspire to be like." Fr Reid's funeral will take place at 12:00 GMT on Wednesday after requiem Mass in Clonard church in west Belfast.	Fr Alec Reid, who was a key figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, acting as a go-between between the IRA and politicians, has died.
Paul Benson almost gave the Daggers an early lead but his header was well cleared off the line by Alex Whittle after nine minutes. The hosts continued to press, with Corey Whitely shooting wide, while York's Vadaine Oliver headed over the bar on the half-hour mark. Jon Parkin wasted a couple of chances for the Minstermen before Amari Morgan-Smith hit the crossbar with a header in first-half added time. York came close again after 50 minutes in bizarre fashion when Dan Parslow's pass eluded everyone and hit the post. Dagenham's Elliott Romain tested Scott Loach with a fine header later on in the second half before Raymond curled home the winner with eight minutes remaining.

His meetings will focus on the relationship between the UK and Russia, as well as issues involving Syria and Ukraine "where we continue to have significant differences", it said. The Foreign Office said the UK "will engage with Russia where it is in our national interest to do so". The timings and details of the visit will be released "in due course". A spokeswoman said: "The foreign secretary has accepted an invitation from Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to visit Moscow in the coming weeks. "The prime minister and the foreign secretary have made clear that our policy towards Russia is to 'engage but beware' and the visit is entirely consistent with this approach. "This is not a return to business as usual and the foreign secretary will continue to be robust on those issues where we differ." A Foreign Office source insisted that the visit did not signal any shift in UK policy towards Russia. "He is not going in order to reset the relationship. He has been clear in his calls with Lavrov that this can't happen till they change course on issues such as Ukraine. "He intends to say the same things face to face as we do in public and in Parliament about Russian activities. While it may be a tough visit, that is what needs to be done." The source added: "Boris has always said we must engage when in our interests. He calls it 'guarded engagement'. He will be robust in the meetings and defend our position. This is not about cosying up, in fact quite the opposite." Mr Johnson's trip will see him become the first minister to travel to Moscow for an official visit in more than five years. On a visit to Kiev last week, the foreign secretary said Russia's annexation of Crimea was illegal and insisted that it should be returned to Ukraine. He has also said there was no case for relaxing sanctions against Russia until it abided by the Minsk peace agreement. Mr Johnson has been hugely critical of Russia recently, accusing it of engaging in "dirty tricks" such as cyber attacks. The Russian embassy in London has responded by accusing him of trying to reopen the Cold War. Speaking in Germany last month, Mr Johnson told the BBC: "You have got to engage with Russia, but you have got to engage in a very guarded way. You have got to beware of what they are up to. "There is no question that, when you look at Russian activity on the cyber front, when you look at what they are doing in the western Balkans, when you look at what has been happening in the Ukraine, you've got to be very, very cautious. "I think it is entirely right to have a dual track approach. We don't want to get into a new Cold War."	Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is to visit Moscow in coming weeks, the Foreign Office has announced.
Tashan Corpe, 27, died in Sedgemoor Road, Bath, on Sunday. Police have charged 30-year-old Josh Farnham of Old Fosse Road, Bath, with murder, grievous bodily harm with intent and actual bodily harm. Rachel Smith, 42, of Sedgemoor Road, has been charged with assisting an offender. Both appeared before Bristol Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Mr Farnham and Ms Smith were remanded in custody to appear before Bristol Crown Court on Thursday. The crime scene is still cordoned off while officers gather evidence. Det Insp Mike Buck from Avon and Somerset Police said: "Our thoughts are with Tashan's family at this tragic time."	Two people have been charged after a man was stabbed to death in his home.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Reds led at the interval only to suffer a second-half collapse as Sevilla became the first team to win the competition three seasons in a row. The defeat means Liverpool will not play any European football next season. "It was 50-60% of our usual quality and we have to accept that," said Klopp, who took charge at Anfield in October. "I am responsible for this performance. I promise everybody we will use it and come back stronger." Liverpool were on course to secure Champions League football - on offer to the winners of the competition this year - when Daniel Sturridge's magnificent strike with the outside of his left foot gave them the interval lead. But the Reds conceded three goals in the space of 24 second-half minutes - Kevin Gameiro netting 17 seconds after the interval, before Coke struck twice. Media playback is not supported on this device "There is no criticism and I have spoken to my players," added Klopp. "What I think about not being in the Champions League is that we have to use the time. "It is not about the size of the squad, it is about using the time in training to get better." Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson was frustrated by the Reds' second-half collapse. "Experience was key after conceding," said the 1984 European Cup winner, who was part of BBC Radio 5 live's team in Basel. "Where was the central defender or captain saying 'circle the wagons for 20 minutes - we do not concede and we get ourselves back into game'? That is something Liverpool just didn't do. "They had one stonewall penalty in the first half but when you go in 1-0 up at half-time in a cup final, what is the first thing anyone says in the dressing room? "You make sure you don't concede in the first 10 or 20 minutes. What did Liverpool do? They conceded in the first 17 seconds." Left-back Alberto Moreno was at fault for Sevilla's first goal, and Lawrenson was also critical of the 23-year-old's performance. "Yet again Moreno, who used to play for Sevilla, has made a massive mistake," he said. "I've lost count of how many mistakes this guy has made. "It's all very good pouring forward but the clue is in the title - left-back. Try defending occasionally. Moreno has made mistakes all season - basic errors. "Where was he for Villarreal's goal the other week? He was trying to score a goal at the other end." Lawrenson said former Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked in October, had to share the blame for not strengthening the left-back area during his tenure. He added: "Liverpool didn't have, by the end of August, another player who could play left-back unless they moved Nathaniel Clyne from the right. "Jose Enrique was never going to play. I'm sorry, Brendan Rodgers gets the blame for me." Lawrenson expects a summer of change at Anfield, but expects Sturridge and Brazilian duo Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho to stay. "I'd imagine Liverpool have spoken to agents and will have an indication of whether players are coming," he said. "If you are in a room with Klopp then I'd think it was hard to say no to him. This summer's transfer window is going to be the biggest ever in the Premier League in terms of money spent. "Firmino, Coutinho and Sturridge are not going anywhere this summer - other than on holiday. "Klopp knew within two weeks of taking over he needed to bring in players. "Why didn't he address it in January? He probably did but could not get the right personnel in."	Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp took responsibility for his side's 3-1 Europa League final defeat by Sevilla - and said they would come back stronger.
Judge Clifford Bellamy said Leicester City Council had not undertaken a "robust risk assessment" of the boy's great-great-uncle who had been jailed for sexual abuse. The city's family court heard the nine-year-old had a "complex" home life. The judge said the boy should be placed into foster care. A city council spokesman said the child has already been moved to an "appropriate placement." The judge explained in a written ruling the boy's mother had mental health problems and separated from his father several years ago and was now in a lesbian relationship. His father has dwarfism, an alcohol problem and had been convicted of having unlawful sex with a 16-year-old girl when he was 21. Updates from this story and more from Leicestershire The boy had been living in the care of his great-great-uncle, who was in his 70s, who had been given an eight-year jail term in the early 1990s. He had admitted unlawful sexual intercourse and a serious sexual offence with his niece when she was aged between 11 and 13. Judge Bellamy said the man had been released on licence after serving five years and was assessed as "low risk". The concerns were raised after the judge was asked to make decisions about the long-term future of the boy at the hearing. He said the council had lacked "any sense of urgency" in bringing the case to the attention of a family court judge. A city council spokesman said: "This case does not appear to have been handled appropriately, or with the urgency required, and our own review is under way. "We have already put in place new systems to improve and oversee the way assessments are carried out, and further work is under way to ensure court proceedings are expedited." The judge also ruled that none of those involved in the case could be identified.	Social services staff have been criticised after a boy spent two years living with a relative who was a convicted paedophile.
David Mackintosh, Conservative MP for Northampton South, announced his decision ahead of a local party meeting where his candidacy was expected to be opposed. The BBC reported millions of pounds of public money loaned to Northampton Town FC appeared to have vanished. The MP has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Mackintosh was criticised over the loan to Northampton Town Football Club from the borough council - when he was leader - to rebuild Sixfields stadium and develop nearby land. About £10.25m of that money is now missing and the loan is subject to a police investigation into "alleged financial irregularities". The football stand remains half built. When contacted by the BBC last week, a majority of his party's local executive council said they would vote to deselect him. Mr Mackintosh had previously said he intended to stand for re-election. But in a statement, he said: "It has been a huge honour to be the member of Parliament since 2015, but I now feel it is the right time for my constituents to have a new representative."	An MP facing deselection after being criticised over his role in a loan to a football club will not stand for re-election.
A spokesman for the bank said they were "working flat out to get these payments updated for our customers no later than Saturday". Its parent company RBS said about 600,000 payments were affected. It said it had now identified and fixed the underlying problem. Ulster Bank said concerned customers should "come into a branch or get in touch with our call centres". "We will ensure no customers are left out of pocket as a result of this issue," a spokesman said. In 2012, the RBS group was hit by a major IT meltdown that led to a large fine. RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers were affected in June 2012 after problems with a software upgrade. On that occasion, the IT failure affected more than 6.5 million customers in the UK over several weeks. The banking group said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds to improve its computer systems since then.	Ulster Bank is working to restore payments and direct debits that were delayed by a computer glitch involving the RBS group of banks.
Homosexual acts are illegal in the East African nation and punishable by up to 30 years in jail. Those who advertised homosexual activities online would also be targeted, the politician warned. Tweeters accused him of homophobia and infringing on the right to freedom of expression online. But Hamisi Kigwangalla argued that homosexuality did not scientifically exist and was a social construct. In a tweet written in Swahili and English he said: "Have you ever come across a gay goat or bird? Homosexuality is not biological, it is unnatural." The 42-year-old, who is a medical doctor by profession, argued that homosexuality could only be associated with an urban lifestyle. He said that in the small town in central Tanzania where he came from, there were no homosexuals. Tweeter: "Consider the fact that your move will only fuel more hatred, violence and increased mob lynchings" Response: "Fulfils my duty as head administrator of the rules and policies of our country! I do not have any trouble with the 'community'" Tweeter : "Freedom of choice, freedom of expression and right to privacy are constitutional justifiable rights. May God change your heart" Response: "Freedoms/rights have boundaries and both are protected by law! The law in Tanzania has boundaries when it comes to sexuality" Tweeter: "It seems politics has made you forget the basics of science. Homosexuality is partly a result of biogenetics" Response: "There is no literature to suggest so. Homosexuality has no any scientific backing! I am a scientist and I read a lot than you think" Earlier this month, Dr Kigwangalla ordered three men he accused of being gay to report to the police for "spreading" homosexual activity through social media, in violation of the law. It is not clear whether they have been charged. Dr Kigwangalla's outspoken comments on Twitter follow the health ministry's move last week to suspend the activities of 40 drop-in HIV/Aids clinics, accusing non-governmental organisations of using them to promote gay sex. The BBC's Sammy Awami in Dar es Salaam says most Tanzanians are strongly opposed to homosexuality - and the gay community keeps to itself. But homosexuality was named as one of the three major challenges facing the country in a parliamentary debate about Aids earlier this month. MP Hussein Bashe said the other issues were drug use and poor education.	The threat to publish the names of suspected homosexuals in Tanzania has been defended by the deputy health minister in a fierce row on Twitter.
Uche Ikpeazu gave the Us the perfect start, netting in the seventh minute with a deflected shot that wrong-footed goalkeeper Russell Griffiths. The forward was central again after 18 minutes, stealing the ball from Aaron Downes and running through before teeing up Berry, whose shot was blocked superbly by Danny Parslow. Berry did find the net 11 minutes after the interval, planting an unchallenged header past Griffiths after Greg Taylor's cross from the left side of the box. He then doubled his tally 16 minutes from time with an angled drive following Max Clark's incisive pass. Only a Griffiths save prevented Ikpeazu from making it 4-0 at the end of a rapid break, before Cheltenham struck a consolation goal five minutes from time when Billy Waters scrambled the ball home from close range after good work by Easah Suliman.

The Chinese-made aircraft went down in the Andaman Sea on 7 June with no survivors. Investigators found the pilot had lost control after entering thick storm cloud. Ice had formed on the wings and sudden crosswinds had led the plane to stall, state media say. The disaster is among the worst in the country's aviation history. The aircraft, a Y-8 transporter made in China, was carrying 14 crew. Most of the passengers were military personnel and family members, including children. Although it was monsoon season in Myanmar (also called Burma), there were no reports of bad weather at the time. Communication with the flight was lost half an hour into the short, routine trip. "The accident occurred due to loss of control after experiencing adverse weather that caused the plane to stall... resulting in a nosedive," state media said. After studying black box data, investigators decided the crash was "not from any act of sabotage, explosion or engine failure". The plane was flying from Myeik to Yangon and the debris was found in the sea off the coastal town of Dawei. It remains unclear why the pilot flew into the storm, given that weather radar normally allows such clouds to be avoided. Myanmar has seen a number of aircraft incidents in recent years:	Bad weather caused a military plane to crash in Myanmar last month with 122 people on board, state media say.
The stark prediction is included in a briefing document prepared by the university and obtained by the BBC. The document also warns of the impact of a "harder" border on staff working at the university's Londonderry campus. "Should border checkpoints be re-established, this would have an adverse impact on staff mobility," it said. Two-thirds of UU's staff from the Republic of Ireland work at the Magee campus in Derry. "There is also some concern that the vote to leave the EU could result in prospective EU students withdrawing their applications," the document continued. UU had 1,332 EU students in 2015/16 - including 1,206 from the Republic of Ireland - who paid a total of £3.3m in tuition fees. UU are calling for the government to provide reassurances about the immigration status of EU students and clarification on their tuition fees and access to student loans. EU students currently pay £3,925 per annum in tuition fees - the same as Northern Irish students. EU nationals studying now will continue to receive current loans and grants until they finish their course. However, the document said: "We are currently awaiting confirmation on ongoing arrangements for EU students in Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU." It also estimated that UU's future share of EU research funding would be worth 17m euros every year. For instance, the university has received almost 10m euros since 2014 from Horizon 2020, an EU research fund. The document said that further funding of 10.5m euros for 2016/17 from that programme is currently in negotiation. Horizon 2020 is worth 80bn euros and awards funding for research and innovation. It is open to UK institutions while the country remains a member of the EU. The document called for clarification "as to whether UK universities can participate in EU research collaboration and funding programmes after the UK formally leaves the European Union". "In a context where we planned to double our external EU research grant income this is of grave concern to the university", it said. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond previously said EU-funded projects signed before the Autumn Statement later this year would be guaranteed by the Treasury after the UK leaves the EU. However, the UU document warned: "There is already substantial anecdotal evidence that UK institutions (including Ulster University) are being asked to leave consortia applying for EU funding."	Ulster University risks losing some 20m euros (£17.5m) in European Union funding and tuition fees as a result of the Brexit vote, warns a report.
On 26 October 1914 Alice Parr arrived at the government's imposing War Office in London, seeking answers about her missing teenage son. Seventeen-year-old Private John Parr had last been seen in August, on the eve of the Battle of Mons. He had been sent to search for two missing platoons and his anxious mother feared the worst when she made her way to Whitehall. "The youngest, the baby," says Iris Hunt, one of Alice's great nieces. "She must've been desperate." As a quarter of a million other boys would go on to do, 14-year-old John had lied about his age to join the Army in 1912. The Parrs shared their small terraced house in Barnet, north London, with another family - overcrowded conditions the youngest brother left behind. He was five years below the legal age at which he could be sent overseas to fight. "He was probably looking for proper clothes and decent meals," according to policeman turned local historian Michael Crick, who has followed Private Parr's paper trail. The brown-haired, brown-eyed boy was working as a caddie at his local golf course when he signed up. "He was looking for adventure and something to do with his life," great-niece Iris says. His life - like more than 700,000 others from the British Isles after him - was cut short on continental Europe. But unlike those whose bodies were never found and who have no headstone, Private Parr entered history as the first of his comrades to die fighting Germany. He would miss the horrors of the trenches, poison gas and mechanised warfare - shot and killed shortly after his 17th birthday. "He's almost an iconic symbol of that first contact of the British Army with that massive German juggernaut crashing through Belgium on its way into France," says military historian Jon Cooksey. There are no known photographs of the 5ft 3in teenager from the north London suburbs, described by his superiors as "clean, sober and intelligent" but "inclined to be insubordinate". After joining his local regiment, the Middlesex, he became a reconnaissance cyclist, trained to ride ahead to retrieve information quickly for commanding officers. When war broke out he and 1,100 other men in his battalion were shipped from Southampton to Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France as the German army was advancing into Belgium. The first major engagement of German and British troops in Europe came at the Battle of Mons on 23 August 1914 and there are conflicting reports of when exactly John went missing around this time. As far as the military was concerned, he was still with his regiment almost half a year later. "According to the records here, the man is still serving with his battalion," an official at the Infantry Records Office wrote on 27 January 1915. Amid the administrative chaos at the start of the war, John's worried mother seems to have known more than those in charge. "I've not heard from him at all and the War Office can tell me nothing," she wrote to the official, underlining the word "nothing". "I have heard from Berlin," she went on. "The address is from a prisoner of war - one of my son's chums - to say that my son was shot down at Mons." And this is where the mystery of Pte Parr's death begins. It has long been thought that he came across German cavalry after heading off on his bike on a reconnaissance mission from where his unit was based near Bettignies - a French village on the border with Belgium - before the August battle. Almost 70 years later, the curator of Pte Parr's local regimental museum recalled L/Cpl W Beart, one of the soldier's fellow cyclists, saying that, on 21 August 1914, the men had caught a "glimpse of Uhlans" - a German regiment. L/Cpl W Beart made it back but the comrade he called "Old Parr" was never seen again. Was one of the Uhlan soldiers responsible for the death of "Old Parr"? The shooting was apparently witnessed by an eight-year-old Belgian girl. Andy Robertshaw, a historian who traced the girl as an elderly woman, says she remembered Private Parr waving his comrade away when the two men were shot at. "Parr was in a ditch, shooting down her road to the east to give his mate time to get back to base," he says. The first British soldier died, the woman said, after a German soldier ran through her garden to shoot him. But on that night, according to Jon Cooksey, there is no way the men could have encountered any enemy soldiers. "Looking at all the documents," he says, "it's more likely he was killed on the 23rd at the Battle of Mons." He adds that John Parr's burial by the Germans in St Symphorien Cemetery, "just three miles from where his battalion fought that day", backs this up. Given the battle claimed some 1,600 British casualties, this raises the prospect that Private Parr may not have been the first to fall. Jon Cooksey has studied troop movements and war diaries on both sides. He says if Pte Parr was killed on the date on his headstone, it must either have been by a trigger-happy Belgian "terrified of the German hordes", so-called friendly fire from a French cavalry patrol or, worse, from his own side. "The point where he is supposed to have been killed couldn't by any stretch of the imagination have been correct," the author and broadcaster says. On 21 August, according to the battalion war diary, John Parr's regiment was 11 miles south of the position it would take up to fight at Mons - German units did not cross the Mons-Conde Canal until the afternoon of 23 August. There is no mention in any of the brigade or divisional diaries of any contact with the enemy, Jon Cooksey says. Nor is there any record of contact with the British in the Germans diaries. "And what a coup that would have been for that German soldier," he adds. "No such record exists." Andy Robertshaw acknowledges it could actually have been a Belgian who unwittingly fired the shot that killed Pte Parr. "If you're a Belgian, you've never seen a British soldier before," he explains. The first contact the Germans and British report is on 22 August 1914, just after dawn, when cavalry patrols from the two sides meet. And this, according to Jon Cooksey, is still another two miles north of where Pte Parr is supposed to have been killed. Back in London, it is now January 1915 and a fraught Alice Parr has heard nothing from those running the war. She received a letter from the captain of John's regiment. "He informed [me] that my son Private John Parr has been missing from the regiment since August the 23rd 1914 and has not been heard of since," she wrote again to the records office. "I should be very grateful for any information as to his whereabouts." There is nothing to indicate when Alice or her family were finally told John Parr would not be coming home. "They didn't get any closure at all," says ex-policeman turned local historian Michael Crick. "And even when they did learn months later that he was killed, they were never able to find out the circumstances." Official records refer to the "late" Private Parr almost a year after his death, on 19 August 1915 but shed no light on what actually happened to him. "In truth, the mystery is probably never going to be solved," Jon Cooksey says.	A ceremony is being held at the WW1 grave of Private John Parr - a teenager thought to have been the first British soldier killed in action in Europe - but 100 years on mystery still surrounds how he died and who killed him.
Thieves stole a 5m (16ft 4in) flagpole - complete with Union Jack - at some point over the weekend. Earlier this month, items intended for an open day, including two generators, food and drink were stolen. Last year, a memorial to the thousands of crewmen who served in Bomber Command during World War Two was damaged by trespassers. Director of the centre Nicky Barr said it was "extremely frustrating". She said: "I had great faith in the human race, but it has been somewhat diminished -  I don't understand why someone would want to target a memorial." More on this and other stories from across Lincolnshire The Lincoln attraction is to honour the air crews' efforts with exhibitions, information and accounts from service personnel and survivors. The centre - set to open in September - still needs Â£2m in donations and events are being held to raise the cash. 125,000 Aircrew served in Bomber Command in World War Two 364,514 operational sorties flown 55,573 aircrew killed in action 25,611 killed flying from Lincolnshire 70% of aircrew were killed, taken prisoner or injured Mrs Barr said fundraising efforts were being hampered by the break-ins. She said: "Whether it was done as high jinks, or whether there is a market for second-hand flag poles, I just don't know. "The reality is the sacrifices made by these guys [Bomber Command crews] allows for the freedom whoever is doing this has got today." Officials have launched a petition in a bid to get further funding from the government to complete the project.	The International Bomber Command Centre has been targeted by thieves for the second time in a matter of weeks.
Six are charged with attempted murder, accused of setting fire to newspaper with which the man had covered himself. The seventh is charged with failing to assist the Polish man, who was only saved by the actions of passers-by after his attackers fled. The attack, which was captured on CCTV, shocked the country. Six of the accused come from Syria, a seventh from Libya. They range between 16 and 21 in age. They arrived in Germany between 2014 and 2016, some as unaccompanied minors, say German media reports. The case has renewed debate about the care of unaccompanied minors, as well as adding to an ongoing argument about whether CCTV cameras help combat crime. Germany surveillance: Security trumps privacy as video bill passed Why are 10,000 migrant children missing in Europe? The attack took place in the Schoenleinstrasse underground station in the southern Berlin district of Neukoelln at about 02:00 (01:00 GMT) on Christmas Day. The alleged ringleader, a 21-year-old Syrian, is accused of lighting a handkerchief and placing it near the man's head, and then running away as the flames spread to the man's backpack and a plastic bag. A train driver used a fire extinguisher to control the flames as passers-by helped to put them out. Six of the suspects surrendered to police immediately after CCTV pictures of the incident in Berlin were released. The alleged ringleader was arrested near his home. He now says he was drunk and cannot remember what happened. But he will be charged as an adult and will face at least three years behind bars if found guilty. They have all been in detention since 27 December.	Seven young migrants have gone on trial in Germany, over a Christmas day attack on a homeless man which could have killed him.
The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members. Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel. Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense. The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011. How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012. The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank. Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way. Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia. If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m. Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption. Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared. Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases. French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him. In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes. Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister. She is accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.	Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers have gone on trial in Madrid over an alleged credit card racket at Spain's troubled Bankia bank.
Ashley Brace, from Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent, could not compete at the Commonwealth Games because of her kickboxing past. She said she was unhappy with the support from the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association (WABA). Chairman David Francis said the organisation did all it could to help. The Association of International Boxing Associations (AIBA) said Brace was ineligible to compete for Team Wales because she had competed in professional kickboxing in the past, which she denied. Organisers of the kickboxing tournaments she competed in have also since confirmed she did so on an amateur basis. A further rule states any boxer returning from another individual contact sport should apply to an international committee to become eligible to box again. Brace said she was never told about the paperwork, which had to be submitted by WABA, and felt the association let her down. She now trains at Bristol Boxing Gym and has her first professional fight in Newport on 30 October. She added: "I would never go back to Team Wales after this, because if you don't have confidence in the people who are supposed to be fighting your corner, at the end of day, what's the point?" Mr Francis said the whole incident was "regrettable".	A former Welsh amateur boxing champion said she is turning professional as she does not have confidence in the governing body.
The first node in the network is a telecommunications satellite that was launched from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. It will use a laser to gather pictures of the planet taken by other spacecraft and then relay them to the ground. One benefit will be to put information on natural disasters, such as flooding and earthquakes, into the hands of emergency responders far faster than has previously been possible. Currently, it can take hours to get the pictures taken by Earth observation satellites down on the ground. Part of the reason is that spacecraft can only transmit their images when they pass over a receiving dish, and they will have visibility of this antenna for just 10 minutes in most cases during every 90-minute tour around the globe. The European Space Agency's (Esa) answer is to fire the pictures upwards instead, via laser, to another satellite much higher in the sky that has a constant view of the ground station. The agency recently put up two Earth observers that are equipped with optical transmission equipment. These will now be able to offload their data through the new relay satellite, which is to be positioned 36,000km above the equator at 9 degrees East. Testing by Esa's industrial partner, Airbus Defence and Space, shows it should be possible for the system to put pictures on the desks of the people who need them within 20 minutes of those images being acquired. For some applications - such as the monitoring of pollution incidents, or illegal fishing or ocean piracy - the time saved could be critical to achieving an effective response. "Some important shipping routes go through the North Pole region, where thick ice flows can cause damage to vessels and even threaten human life," explained Magali Vaissiere, Esa's director of telecoms. "It's also an environment in constant motion which means that data that is two days old is not only unhelpful - it could even be unsafe. "We have already demonstrated quasi real-time performance of below 20 minutes for bringing monitoring information from the coast of Brazil to the user's desk. And with this capability, the European Data Relay System (EDRS) may open up a new horizon to what I would call quasi real time Earth observation." EDRS has been in development for more than 10 years. Getting satellites to talk to each other via a narrow laser beam is no easy task, says Esa project manager Michael Witting. "The difficulty is basically that you have to hit another satellite with your laser beam over a distance of over 40,000km, which is akin to hitting a two-euro coin over the distance of the Atlantic," he told BBC News. With a successful connection, data will move at a rate of up to 1.8Gbps. EDRS will debut with the European Commission as its anchor customer. Brussels is establishing a series of satellites called Sentinels that will systematically map the Earth, to help inform and enforce EU policies. Prodigious volumes of data are expected from these satellites in the coming years and the traditional downlink solutions are no longer regarded as adequate to the task. The relay spacecraft is actually a standard TV platform owned by the Paris-based commercial operator Eutelsat. Esa's laser node, which it refers to as EDRS-A, is a hosted payload on this spacecraft. The launch from the Kazakh Baikonur cosmodrome atop a Proton rocket occurred at 22.20 GMT on Friday (04:20 local time Saturday). The drop-off high above the Earth was confirmed nine hours and 12 minutes later. Many weeks of testing lie ahead. EDRS should go into full service in the summer. A second relay satellite carrying another laser terminal will go up in 2017. Further such platforms will be required to provide fully global, round-the-clock, super-fast connections. Evert Dudok from Airbus said: "We are looking for partners to deliver the system. It can be a dedicated payload but it can also be a hosted payload as we have it on EDRS-A. We want to have this system operational by 2020; that's very important. And I think we can set this optical standard established here in Europe as a global standard, which would be very interesting" The laser technology is very much a German development, led by Tesat Spacecom. Germany has invested more than 280m euros in the capability, through its own space agency (DLR) and through Esa. Eutelsat-9B was built in large part at Airbus factories in Stevenage and Portsmouth the UK. Britain will also be a major downlink point for EDRS through a dish sited at Harwell in Oxfordshire.

Lagavulin is launching a single cask edition of 522 bottles of its single malt to raise funds for local projects. Sales of the £1,494 bottles are set to see £310,000 donated to Islay Heritage to help build a story of the island's past based on its archaeological sites. The Finlaggan Trust, which maintains the historical home of the Lord of the Isles, should also receive £60,000. The Lagavulin 200 Legacy is set to make further contributions to the local swimming pool, cyber cafe and arts and festival organisations, as well as a new partnership with the RSPB to restore and conserve peatlands on the island. Nick Morgan, of Lagavulin's owners Diageo, said: "We have had a fantastic year celebrating the 200th anniversary of Lagavulin, both on Islay and with the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who adore the whisky. "Islay and its remarkable local community are at the heart of Lagavulin. "That's why we were determined there should be a legacy from the anniversary which would directly benefit the island and its people. "We believe that our contribution to Islay Heritage is not only of great significance to the island itself but is an important contribution to conserving and promoting the history and heritage of Scotland." Bottles of the Lagavulin 1991 Single Malt Scotch Whisky cask can only be purchased through an online ballot on The Whisky Exchange. The first bottle will be auctioned separately to raise more charitable funds, and one bottle will be donated to the Diageo Archive and the Whisky Exchange. Steven Mithen, trustee of Islay Heritage and professor of archaeology, said: "Islay Heritage is hugely grateful to the Lagavulin 200 Legacy for the support it is providing to further our knowledge about the archaeological sites and monuments on Islay. "This investment in our heritage will greatly benefit both the local community and visitors to the island. "While some of Islay's sites and monuments are very well known and accessible, others are virtually unknown, difficult to find and rarely visited. "There are no doubt many more waiting to be discovered which will help tell us more about not only Islay's story but that of Scotland, Europe and the path of human culture as a whole. "We are delighted that Lagavulin shares our vision to reveal Islay's past so that it can be explored and enjoyed by everyone."	A whisky distillery plans to invest £580,000 in community projects to mark its 200 years on the island of Islay.
The emails confirmed the Trump camp's interest in receiving help from the Russian government to discredit opponent Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign last year. The Dow Jones was unchanged at 21,409.07 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.08% to 2,425.53. The Nasdaq rose 0.3% to 6,193.3. Wall Street has generally climbed this year, in spite of some shaky moments stemming from unease over the fate of the Trump administration and prospects for its business-friendly agenda. Markets also sank in May amid a furore over US President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating ties between the campaign and Russia. That investigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, a rise in oil prices helped lift energy stocks, such as Exxon Mobil, which climbed 0.6%. But bank stocks lost ground ahead of the release of quarterly earnings this week and a day after the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unveiled a rule making it easier for customers to file collective lawsuits. introduced a The rule forbids companies from requiring that people use an individual, out-of-court process to resolve disputes as part of the contract for their credit card and bank accounts. Bank of America and Citigroup shares fell 1.2% on Tuesday, while Wells Fargo dropped 1%. The rule may be short-lived as it comes amid a push by the White House and Republicans in Congress to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau less powerful. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, said on Tuesday he would file legislation to undo the rule.	The US stock market closed on Tuesday about where it began, recovering after a flash of panic prompted by the release of emails from Donald Trump Jr.

He said he wanted to act "in the best interests" of the university where he studied as an undergraduate. The resignation comes after several of his Bill Cosby shows have been axed in the US. The 77-year-old entertainer has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women. The comedian has not directly addressed the accusations, but his lawyers have described them as "discredited" and "defamatory." Mr Cosby said in a statement on Monday that he had "always been proud" of his association with Temple University, where he had been a trustee for over 30 years. "The Board of Trustees accepts Dr Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university,'' the university said in a statement. More than a dozen women, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson, have come forward claiming that Mr Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them. Some of the accusations date back to 2005 and 2006. A woman from Florida has also accused Mr Cosby of raping her backstage at a show in Las Vegas in 1976. Mr Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Several broadcasters have decided not to continue projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix.	US comedian Bill Cosby has resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia amid ongoing allegations of sexual assault.
The boy was found "safe" this afternoon and arrested on suspicion of wounding and carrying a bladed weapon. Police said he was found on a train from Hereford to Malvern at 16:55 BST. Detectives launched a search for the boy after the attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at about 08:45 BST. A male teacher and 13-year-old girl suffered minor injuries. The boy was apprehended at Ledbury station in Herefordshire. Leah Johnson, 16, a former pupil of Chase College, was travelling on the train when it stopped at Ledbury. She said an officer was waiting on the platform for the boy, who had been standing near the train doors for around 15 minutes. "The policeman was pacing up and down. The doors opened and he just said 'can you come with me?' and he walked off with him," she said. The boy remains in custody at Worcester Police Station. Earlier, there were police officers stationed at each entrance to the school and crime scene tape blocking off the main entrance. Children were brought out individually from the school and handed to parents waiting at the gates. About 100 had gathered by lunchtime.	A 13-year-old schoolboy who disappeared after a fellow pupil and a teacher were attacked with a knife has been arrested, West Mercia Police said.
Wilson was airlifted to hospital from the Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania after Sage Karam's car spun and crashed in front of him on lap 179 of 200. Debris from Karam's car hit ex-Formula 1 driver Wilson, 37, and the Andretti Autosport driver crashed into a wall. IndyCar officials said his death was a "monumentally sad day". Mark Miles, chief executive of IndyCar parent company Hulman & Co, said: "Justin's elite ability to drive a race car was matched by his unwavering kindness, character and humility - which is what made him one of the most respected members of the paddock. "As we know, the racing industry is one big family, and our efforts moving forward will be focused on rallying around Justin's family to ensure they get the support they need during this unbelievably difficult time." A seven-time IndyCar race winner, Wilson, from Sheffield, is survived by his wife, Julia, and two daughters. In a statement his family said he was a "loving father and devoted husband, as well as a highly competitive racing driver who was respected by his peers". His brother Stefan, also a racing driver, paid tribute on social media, saying: "Can't even begin to describe the loss I feel right now. He was my brother, my best friend, my role model and mentor. He was a champion. "He lived for this sport, he loved it. The only comfort I feel is that he lived a life he loved." An Andretti Autosport team statement said: "He was a tremendous racer, a valuable member of the team and respected representative to our sport. While Justin was only part of the Andretti line-up for a short time, it only took a second for him to forever become part of the Andretti family. "His life and racing career is a story of class and passion surpassed by none." Wilson was making his 174th IndyCar start in Sunday's race, but his major motorsport breakthrough came in F1. He won the Formula 3000 series in 2001, and two years later raised £1.2m to finance his F1 entry after setting up a company in his own name. Standing at 6ft 4in, Wilson was unusually tall for F1 - drivers over six feet are a rarity - and he scored his only point from 16 races with Minardi and Jaguar during 2003 at the United States Grand Prix. He moved to the United States in 2004 and enjoyed greater success in Champ Car, finishing as series runner-up in 2006 and 2007 before switching to IndyCar racing in 2008, after Champ Car merged with the Indy Racing League. He finished second in the previous IndyCar race in Mid-Ohio on 2 August, his first podium finish since 2013, while his final victory came at the Firestone 550 at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2012. His appearance at the triangle-shaped Pocono Raceway was only his sixth of this season as he struggled to find a full-time seat. In the past 20 years there have been seven deaths during race meetings in IndyCar, including in the series' previous incarnations as Champ Car and Indy Racing League. In that time one F1 driver has been killed - Wilson's death comes 38 days after Frenchman Jules Bianchi succumbed to the devastating injuries he sustained at last year's Japanese Grand Prix. Four years ago British driver and two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon lost his life aged 33 at the Las Vegas Indy 300. Wheldon was killed when his head hit a post in the fence at Las Vegas Motor Speedway after a crash involving 15 vehicles. His death triggered calls for further safety reviews, including suggestions that open-wheel racing be banned on high-speed, oval tracks, where tightly-packed cars reach speeds of 230mph. IndyCar officials have introduced several safety measures into the sport. This includes safer walls, collapsible barriers designed to cushion impact and the installation of trauma centres at race tracks. McLaren driver Jenson Button is one of many Formula 1 figures to have paid tribute to Wilson. "I raced with Justin as far back as 1989 in karting and remember his smile was infectious," he tweeted. "The motorsport world comes to a standstill once again. Justin Wilson was a great person and racing driver. My thoughts are with his family." World champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram: "I am so devastated to hear of another passing of a great man and driver. I'd met Justin Wilson a few times growing up and he was the ultimate gentleman. Whilst I only knew him a little, I will miss him. We will miss him." Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, former Minardi owner Paul Stoddart, who gave Wilson his first start in F1,said: "Motorsport has lost not just a fantastic driver but one of the true gentleman of the sport. "Justin wasn't just a very fast and capable driver but a true gentleman and one of the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet in the paddock." Scotland's four-time IndyCar champion Dario Franchitti said: "Rest in peace Justin, it was a real privilege to know you and call you a friend." Nine-time F1 winner Mark Webber, who competed alongside Wilson at Minardi in 2003, tweeted: "Last night a very good man left us. So sorry. RIP Justin. My thoughts are with your loved ones." Sage Karam, who was leading the race at the time of the crash, has been released from hospital after treatment for heel and wrist injuries. "I can't find the proper words to describe the pain and sympathy I feel for Justin and his family," he said on social media.	British driver Justin Wilson has died after being struck by flying debris and suffering a serious head injury in Sunday's Pocono IndyCar 500 race.
The latest claim came as a female pupil, who alleged she was raped by a teacher in 1990 while attending its former junior school, spoke to the BBC. Kate, who we are not identifying, told her story to the police two years ago but the case collapsed. Gordonstoun said it was committed to assisting the police. BBC Scotland spoke to Kate, who claimed she was raped by a teacher while on a camping trip in 1990 when she was a 12-year-old pupil at Gordonstoun's prep School, Aberlour House. She eventually told her story to the police but the case collapsed after another witness withdrew her statement at the last minute. Kate, who now lives in England, has now joined a group of former pupils who are pressing for a change in Scotland's corroboration laws and asking the school to deal with the many claims of bullying and abuse. She said: "I do remember feeling very isolated, because it was the first night of the trip it happened. I just had no idea what had just happened to me. "I hold the school in great esteem but obviously there were failings at the time. "An apology is always a nice thing to hear. I know it's a different era but it would be nice to hear an apology." Police Scotland confirmed that it has been contacted by another former pupil in recent days concerning what it calls a historical matter at Gordonstoun. In a statement, Gordonstoun said: "We were shocked and saddened to hear of Kate's account of her experience at Aberlour House. "Cases of this kind must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and we are committed to managing any case of historic abuse as openly as possible, assisting the police with any inquiry and, above all, supporting victims in any way we can. "We have given the investigating police unrestricted access to the archive records we hold for Aberlour House. "We were surprised and disappointed that her case did not go to court and remain available to assist future investigations."	Another former pupil of Gordonstoun public school in Moray has contacted police over claims of historical sexual abuse, it has emerged.
A Monitor report published in February called for the closure of acute services including the A&E department. The trust that runs the hospital was put into administration by the health regulator Monitor on Monday. Support Stafford Hospital campaigners and police said up to 30,000 people had joined the mile-long march, from the town centre to the hospital. The campaign group said the town's Market Square was so full of protesters it took 45 minutes for it to clear after the march started at about 1400 BST. Thousands of people had previously signed a petition calling for Stafford Hospital's services to remain and a campaign shop from the protest group has been set up in the town centre. By Chris KingBBC Radio Stoke For the past four years the name "Stafford Hospital" has been a byword for everything that is bad about the NHS. Today, 30,000 people turned out with their banners and placards to send out the message that they believe their hospital is now safe, and they are prepared to fight for its future. The special administrators were not there today but they will find it hard to ignore the views of so many people. Last week they told me that they were starting with a blank sheet of paper when it came to the future of services at the Mid Staffordshire Trust. This afternoon the people of Stafford gave them a clear indication of what they'd like them to write on it. Jean Tabarner, one of the marchers, said she had had cancer and that Stafford Hospital had saved her life. She said: "We've got to try - if you don't try, no-one will listen. We've got to keep plugging away and hope that the administrators listen to what the people around here want." Sue Hawkins, chair of the Support Stafford Hospital group, said she believed it was important for people to move on from what had happened in the past at the hospital. She said: "We've got a safe hospital today and we're looking to the future." She added: "We need to have an intensive care unit here, we need to have an accident and emergency 24 hours a day and we believe that's possible. "We know there have to be changes, we know there may have to be some alliance with another hospital to achieve that." Stafford Borough Council leader Mike Heenan, who joined the marchers, said: "The important thing is delivering services locally, for the local people. "That's what we're fighting for - so that acute services can stay in Stafford." Monitor has given the administrators for the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, Ernst and Young, 145 days to work with local healthcare organisations to produce a "sustainable plan" for the future of services at the Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals. The Contingency Planning Team (CPT) report to Monitor last month said staffing levels at the hospitals were not sufficient to meet required standards in the long term, given the current range of services and number of patients. It said some services, including accident and emergency, intensive care and maternity, could be provided at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital Trust and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust instead. Unison officials said earlier this week the administrators had told the union that they "were not bound by the recommendations". The town of Stafford has a population of about 63,000 people, while its surrounding borough is made up of 122,000 people. The area covered by the health trust extends beyond that, also taking in homes covered by the Cannock Chase Council area. Staffordshire Police said there was no trouble during the march.	Thousands of people have marched in opposition to plans to downgrade Stafford Hospital's services.
Len Richards has been named as the new chief executive of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (CVUHB). Mr Richards, who moved from the UK to Australia in November 2013, is expected to start his new post in June. CVUHB chair Maria Battle said he brought "broad international" experience to the role. Mr Richards is currently the deputy chief executive for South Australia Health, a government department responsible for public health in Adelaide. He said there was a lot of hard work to do on the board's financial situation, which is forecasting a Â£31m deficit for the 2016-17 financial year.	A new boss for health services in south Wales has been appointed all the way from Australia.
To secure more rights for people with disabilities, she makes frequent visits to courtrooms where the world of beauty contests is but a dream. But the first Miss Wheelchair India contest in Mumbai in late November changed much of that. She found herself amid the humdrum of the green room, glitter of the stage and the usual chatter one associates with a beauty pageant. But there were some marked differences - the stage was much smaller than the ones set up for Miss India pageant and the contestants were treated as winners even before the event started. Ms Kewlani's reply is an emphatic "no" when asked if the smaller stage and venue dimmed the importance of India's first Miss Wheelchair contest. "Nobody really cared about how many people attended the event or how big the stage was. It was a night to celebrate the courage and fighting spirit of the contestants. We all won that night." She says that her "rich and challenging" life has taken another positive turn after winning the contest. "Polio made me wheelchair-bound early on in life but I never saw it as a disability and worked hard to be trained as a media professional like other normal people in the country. "And winning the pageant is just another way of showing that disability cannot stop you from feeling and looking beautiful," the 41-year-old says. Divya Arora feels her first runner-up crown has strengthened her belief that "beauty is boundless". Ms Arora, who earlier worked for a leading newspaper, says her faith that "disability can never overshadow her beauty and abilities" helped her do well in the pageant. The contest is the idea of tax consultant Sounak Banerjee whose life changed in 2006 when muscular dystrophy forced him to use a wheelchair to get around in the bustling city of Mumbai. Mr Banerjee liked watching Bollywood films and TV shows but often found the absence of people with disabilities in the entertainment industry "disturbing". "Disabled people are also consumers of the entertainment industry but they are seldom represented," he says. He then came up with the idea of the Miss Wheelchair India contest to fill the gap and provide a platform they could call their own. Planning the event was tough due to a lack of funding and human resources, he says but adds that the struggles were forgotten when the final day approached. "I felt satisfied and happy when I saw these women wearing their best costumes and a winning smile. It all came together nicely in the end - I had done something for these courageous contestants," he says. "I found the contest very unique because it honoured beauty irrespective of contestants' physical disabilities," says scientist Gopika Anand, 31, who won the second runner-up crown. Ms Anand met with a road accident while studying engineering and was soon confined to a wheelchair. But she persevered, completed her course and found work as a scientist at a leading consumer manufacturing firm. Shelly Bhutani, another contestant, hopes that the corporate world will take notice of the event in the future. "I feel we too deserve to be in front of the camera and get brand endorsements like Miss India winners," she says. Ms Arora, however, felt the organisers were not well prepared for the event and did not provide the kind of support she had hoped for. Mr Banerjee accepts that a lack of sponsorship made the job of organising the event tough. "I agree that there were problems at the event. We will work harder and hope that more people will support the event next year," he says. But other contestants want to see change at a more basic level. India is not known to be a disabled-friendly country as most public places, monuments and buildings do not have facilities catering to their specific needs. Bhavna Sharma, who won the contest in a category that honoured people who are disabled but not necessarily confined to a wheelchair, says citizens with disabilities do not feel inferior and have achieved success in almost every field. "But it's the country's poor infrastructure for disabled people that lets us down," the 27-year-old says. Some years ago Neenu Kewlani travelled all over India in a chauffer-driven car to highlight the problems faced by those with physical challenges while commuting. She says the problem is even more severe in rural areas and smaller towns where people with disabilities are virtually confined to their homes. Nearly every contestant expressed concern over a lack of sensitivity about disability rights. But not one of them is willing to give up hope. Ms Kewlani says there is a long way to go in making India a disabled-friendly country but "we are not ready to give up as we are fighters". "Facilities are improving in cities but we will continue to put pressure on governments to ensure they provide better opportunities and infrastructure for the disabled," she adds. Calcutta-based Sarmistha Sinha says disability rights activists will have to continue fighting like other marginalised sections of the society. An accident in 2006 confined the 41-year-old doctor to a wheelchair, but she says her "thoughts and ability to stay positive remained free". Ms Sinha won in a category which honoured married women in a wheelchair. But winning was not everything for her as she wanted to use the platform to showcase her talent. The wheelchair dancer saw the contest as an opportunity to present her skills and meet people like herself from all over the country. "I only wanted to dance as such opportunities are rare but the feeling that I have won a beauty pageant is slowly sinking in," she adds. For Gopika Anand the real winning moment came when she saw her father's moist eyes as the results were announced. "I was overwhelmed to see her with the crown. I am very proud today to be recognised as Gopika Anand's father," says Anand Mohan. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

And yet, according to the Islamic Society of Nevada, there are six mosques and around 30,000 Muslims in this oasis of neon. For the Islamic minority in Sin City, life is not always easy. Gazing out of a bus window at the garish lights, Talibah Abdul-Wahid, a student who also teaches pupils at the city's Masjid as Sabur mosque, is worried. As an American Muslim in a black hijab, the traditional shawl covering head but not face, she does not always find these journeys pleasant. "I get people who don't want to sit next to me, people who whisper things like, 'Does she have a bomb on her, is she going to harm us?'" she says. This week, Ms Abdul-Wahid, 19, joined fellow Muslims and members of other faiths to condemn the murders of 14 people in California, which are being investigated as an act of Islamist terrorism. Surrounded by banners proclaiming Islam's respect for America and promotion of tolerance, freedom and democracy, they talked about the violence, the backlash and about Donald Trump. The Republican presidential candidate responded to the killings in San Bernardino by proposing the suspension of all Muslim immigration to the US, a statement that sent chills up Muslim spines. Islam, said one of the speakers, Dr Zia Khan, a Las Vegas cardiologist, had once again been "tarnished and ridiculed by unscrupulous politicians". Such language, he argued, would "fan the flames of hate and lead us down the very path that our enemies want to see us go". There is a weary feeling here about the cycle of events; a violent attack followed by an expectation that the Islamic community will publicly restate a commitment to peace. At the Masjid as Sabur mosque, the imam Fateen Seifullah, thinks such an expectation is hypocritical. "It is just inconsistent," he says, "we're not mentioning it when people are being gunned down by white supremacists, by people with distorted ideologies in this country who go into the theatres, who go into the schools, who go into the abortion clinic, who went into the church." In other words, why are such killers rarely referred to as Christian extremists, even when they claim to be driven by Biblical teachings? "We would be safe if we just referred to criminals as criminals, murderers as murderers without putting religious titles on them," says Mr Seifullah who argues that Mr Trump's response to San Bernardino has "given people approval" to be racist and bigoted, "to think that it's OK to discriminate against one group of people over another." Half a century after "intense civil rights struggles," he warns, "we can go back to that. There are people who are embracing his rhetoric and that's frightening." As he spoke, across town the man himself was preparing to address supporters at a rally near his golden Trump Tower hotel complex. In the crowd, many supporters brushed off talk that the presidential hopeful was making life difficult for Muslims. "Hopefully his comments did not bring out the worst in those that might be on the fringe," said Chris Patterson, wearing a Trump T-shirt, scarf and badge. "As far as I know no-one really here goes out and attacks people for what they do," he adds. Norma Ash from Maine, sporting a baseball cap bearing Mr Trump's slogan "Make America Great Again" was more incendiary, arguing in favour of violence against mosques in the US. "I think they should bomb mosques," she says, clarifying when asked that she means mosques in the US, "I think they should because they keep coming here and making trouble. "You don't know what they are. You don't know if they are bad people or good people." Pew Research Center's 2014 Religious Landscape Study found that 0.9% of US adults identify as Muslims. A 2011 survey of Muslim Americans, estimated that there were 1.8 million Muslim adults (and 2.75 million Muslims of all ages) in the country. That survey also found that a majority of US Muslims (63%) are immigrants. Demographic projections estimate that Muslims will make up 2.1% of the US population by the year 2050, surpassing people who identify as Jewish on the basis of religion as the second-largest faith group in the country (not including people who say they have no religion). A recent Pew Research Center report estimated that the Muslim share of immigrants granted permanent residency status (green cards) increased from about 5% in 1992 to roughly 10% in 2012, representing about 100,000 immigrants in that year. Source: Pew Research Center Her sentiments were not echoed by anyone else we spoke to at the rally which was, in some ways, a rather strange event. The mogul's speech, during which he repeatedly inveighed against the media penned in to the centre of the hall, was interrupted several times by protestors. As security guards attempted to drag one black protestor from the room, someone in the crowd cursed profanely and shouted that he should be set on fire. It was a lone voice but one adding to a sense of foreboding among the Muslims of Las Vegas. "Over the recent weeks, comments from people like Donald Trump have definitely added fuel to the fire, says Talibah Abdul-Wahid. "Before I leave to school, I'm always worried, is this going to be the last time I'm going to go home? Is this going to be the last time I see my family?" Nevertheless, Ms Abdul-Wahid says she will not stop wearing her Islamic attire. "If we stop wearing our hijab, if we stop claiming to be Muslims that means that people like Donald Trump win, that we completely disregard the constitution and that we believe that we are terrorists when we're not."	Hard-gambling, hard-drinking, hard-living Las Vegas is not, you might think, a natural fit for Islam.
McBryde leads Wales against Samoa and Tonga this summer in the absence of Warren Gatland and Rob Howley, who coach the Lions in New Zealand. "The game on Saturday gives players a stage to be measured," he said. "We'll see how they react to pressure of playing at the Principality." Cardiff Blues face the Ospreys at the Principality Stadium on Saturday before the Newport Gwent Dragons play the Scarlets in the double header with Gatland naming his Lions squad on 19 April. "I can only speculate in regards to the selection on the 19th [of April] for the Lions," said McBryde. "We are just expecting there to be a few players from the teams that are playing this weekend to be selected. "But we are just looking forward to seeing how they react to playing at the Principality and looking forward to the good occasion. "There were some quite consistent performances during the Six Nations, so there could be as many as 9/10 Welsh players selected for the Lions tour." Media playback is not supported on this device McBryde says he will be picking a squad to win both Tests when he names the Wales touring party for the summer of 24 April, and that Judgement Day could also have ramifications for the Wales squad. "We have always said that we would measure the players by their performances in the Pro12, their performances against one another in the derbies and in Europe, especially against the Irish provinces." he told BBC Wales Sport. "But this game is a big one from a selection point of view. We are looking to name the squad on the 24th to allow the players to prepare both physical and mentally prepare for the tour ahead. So the double-header does allow us to focus on the players with a close microscope. Media playback is not supported on this device "We are going there with the mentality to want to win both Tests. That is in the forefront of our minds and the selection will be based on this. "We can't control injuries or players being asked to join the Lions, we know we can't account for that. "We can take a strong squad down there and make sure our squad is right for the two games against Samoa and Tonga. "Maybe there will be one eye on the short term and one eye on the long term with the World Cup just two years away."	Robin McBryde says there is still an opportunity for players to play their way into the British and Irish Lions and Wales squads if they impress at Judgement Day.
Robin Li was in the passenger seat when he made a video call to an artificial-intelligence developers conference in the Chinese capital. But while autonomous vehicles are tipped as the future of motoring, they are banned from China's public roads. Police began an investigation after the video went viral. The footage shows another Baidu executive in the driver's seat, but with his hands off the steering wheel. Mr Li reportedly told his audience the vehicle was on autopilot and that the journey was smooth. Baidu, which has not commented on the incident, is one of many firms developing prototypes of self-driving vehicles that will use mapping and artificial intelligence technology. At the conference, Baidu announced that it had built an alliance with 50 partners to develop and promote self-driving cars. They include Ford, Daimler, five Chinese car manufacturers, mapping firm TomTom, and chipmakers Intel and Nvidia. Baidu said it hoped to have autonomous cars on China's roads by 2019 - so long as the law allowed it - before expanding to other markets including the US. Earlier this year Baidu also opened up its self-driving car codes to software developers via the 'Apollo' open-source platform in the hope it would spur innovation. Two of its autonomous vehicles using Apollo version 1.0 were on display at the developers conference, the Wall Street Journal said. Google parent company Alphabet, Ford and GM have also built and are among those testing self-driving cars.	The head of Chinese online search giant Baidu is being investigated, after riding in one of the firm's driverless cars on a Beijing ring-road.
Libor - or London inter-bank offered rate - is used by banks to set the cost of lending money to each other. The New York attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman said government bodies and not-for-profit organisations had been defrauded of millions of dollars. The Libor scandal has already cost Barclays $453m. That sum was paid to the US Justice Department, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the UK's Financial Services Authority in 2012. As part of the latest legal settlement, Barclays admitted what had already been firmly established; that some of its dealers rigged Libor rates in a system of mutual back-scratching between 2005 and 2009. Mr Schneiderman said: "There has to be one set of rules for everyone, no matter how rich or how powerful, and that includes big banks and other financial institutions that engage in fraud or impair the fair functioning of financial markets." Other banks that have reached settlements with the US authorities in similar Libor cases include UBS, which paid $1.5bn (£940m), RBS, Deutsche Bank and ICAP. But Mr Schneiderman said Barclays was the first bank to settle cases brought by individual US state authorities. For its part, Barclays said it was "pleased" to have settled this latest legal threat in the US. "We believe this settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders and clients," it said.	Barclays bank has paid a further $100m (£77m) to settle a claim by 44 US states that it rigged the Libor rate system between 2005 and 2009.
Sheikh Obeikan, who was an adviser to the royal cabinet, opposed moves to relax gender segregation. The dismissal comes shortly after Sheikh Obeikan attacked plans by "influential people to corrupt Muslim society by trying to change the natural status of women". Saudi officials did not give a reason for Sheikh Obeikan's departure. His recent comments were taken to be an attack on tentative steps towards relaxing some stricter interpretations of Saudi law. King Abdullah has promised women the right to vote in future elections, has opened the country's first co-educational university and introduced measures against domestic violence. The head of Saudi Arabia's religious police, the "mutawa", was also replaced in January, with the new head widely seen as more moderate than his predecessor. Sheikh Obeikan achieved a degree of notoriety several years ago with a decree suggesting that unrelated Saudi men and women could mix so long as the man drank the woman's breast milk, thus creating a maternal bond between them.	Saudi King Abdullah has sacked one of his most hardline advisers, Sheikh Abdelmohsen al-Obeikan.
The 46-year-old has been on the Premiership club's coaching staff since 2004, took over as head coach in 2009 and became director of rugby in 2010. "It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position. I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team," Cockerill said. Head coach Aaron Mauger will take over on an interim basis. Tigers are fifth in the Premiership, 15 points adrift of leaders Wasps having lost five of their 12 league games so far this season. The were beaten by 16-12 by Saracens on New Year's Day. Cockerill, who has spent 23 of the last 25 years of his career with Tigers, said he "respected the board's decision" to make a change they see as being "in the best interests of the club". He added: "This club has made me the person and the coach I am today and I will never forget what they have done for me. I will miss being part of the Tigers family." Last month, following the 18-16 Champions Cup win over Munster, Cockerill said reports claiming he faced the sack and that described the coaching structure at Leicester Tigers as toxic were "rubbish". Former England and Tigers hooker Cockerill spent 10 years with the club as a player from 1992 before returning to Welford Road as an academy coach. After two spells in interim charge he was appointed full-time head coach in April 2009, with Tigers winning the Premiership title and reaching the European Cup final in his first season in the role. Leicester have never failed to reach the Premiership semi-finals under Cockerill and as well as winning the final in 2008-09, they were also victorious in 2009-10 and 2012-13. Tigers chairman Peter Tom CBE said: "We thank Richard for his loyal and dedicated service as a player, coach and director of rugby. He has a great passion for the club and for the game of rugby, and has shared in many massive occasions with the Tigers. "The club always has aspirations to contest the major honours in the game and that remains unchanged but the board believes this is the right time to make a change." As a player, hooker Cockerill made 262 appearances for Tigers, winning five league titles, two domestic cups, two Heineken Cups and he also played 27 times for England. BBC Radio Leicester commentator and ex-Tigers fly-half Bleddyn Jones I am not surprised. Tigers cannot stand the fact they are in fifth position and quite a bit away from the top four; they want to be top two and won't get there this season. They haven't been there for the last three or four seasons and that is one of the reasons that Tigers have reluctantly had to say goodbye to Richard. His record is second to none. He is man and boy with the Tigers and if you cut him in half he would be Tigers colours through and through.	Leicester Tigers have sacked director of rugby Richard Cockerill after nearly eight years in charge.
The Northampton hooker is expected to be named skipper by new head coach Eddie Jones on Monday. Hartley has been banned for over a year in total during his career. But Rugby Football Union chief executive Ritchie said he had "paid the penalty", adding "I don't think it precludes him [from being captain]". Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Ritchie added: "It is primarily a matter for the head coach, and I'm not going to hinder that in any way. "It's a matter of balance and perspective, and Dylan I'm sure brings many positives as well to the set-up." Ritchie confirmed the RFU is monitoring the case of young flanker Sam Underhill, who plays for Welsh region Ospreys. The 19-year-old is English and is on the radar of England boss Jones, but is ineligible to be picked for his country while playing outside the English Premiership. Underhill - who has captained England at Under-18 level - is studying at Cardiff University and is contracted to Bridgend and the Ospreys. However, Ritchie says Underhill's case may be viewed differently to the likes of those who play in France, and that he may be treated as a special case given his age. "I think we need to look at that, and we are having some discussions about that," Ritchie added. "We want to keep people who have played in our age-grade teams, as he has. We maybe need to look at whether it is different for elite squads compared to development squads." Ritchie says French club Toulon's bid to join the Premiership is a "long shot". The Toulon president Mourad Boudjelall has written to Premiership Rugby this week about the prospect. The RFU council would have to approve any change to England's elite competition, and Ritchie believes there are numerous obstacles in Toulon's way. "I think it's a challenging proposition," Ritchie said. "I would think it's a long shot, but having said that it's for others to discuss as well, and we've not really sat down and had a proper, considered conversation about it yet. "But in some ways it's interesting Mr Boudjellal thinks that playing rugby in England is good for Toulon, so we should look at that as a positive." Despite England's disappointing performance at the World Cup, the RFU says it is on course to meet legacy targets. Early evidence shows participation is increasing, including 8,000 adults returning to the game during and after the tournament, and the RFU has launched programmes to get more schools and clubs playing the sport, and will also provide 100 new artificial pitches across the country. "We really are trying to use the opportunity the Rugby World Cup gave us to grow the profile of the game - and participation in the game - across the country. The hard work has started for us now as we try and maximise the opportunity," said the RFU's rugby development director Steve Grainger.	Dylan Hartley's disciplinary record should not prevent him being appointed England captain, according to the head of English rugby Ian Ritchie.
The group claim they are owed $40,000 (Â£23,500) by the Illinois-based outfit WorldWide Fan Clubs. The company had been charged with managing subscriptions and fan records for Duran Duran, with 75% of profits going to the musicians. Its owners declined to comment when contacted by the Associated Press. According to their legal action, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Duran Duran also contend that the company - which operates out of the town of Glenview - failed to keep accurate accounts of fan club activity since they gained the contract for the work in 2010. It also stated they have made repeated requests for the unpaid fees to be settled. Part of their brief was to process subscriptions from fans, while their headquarters would also serve as a warehouse for the distribution of band merchandise. They were entitled to keep 25% of proceeds for their activities. Duran Duran were formed in Birmingham in 1978, with its core members Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor still in the line-up today. They have enjoyed a string of hits in both the UK and US, including Hungry Like The Wolf and Rio. In 2012, they performed at a concert to mark the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in Hyde Park. The band are currently at work on their 14th studio album.	Pop band Duran Duran have taken legal action against the US company charged with running their fan club over unpaid revenues, court papers have revealed.
Wellington monument on the Blackdown Hills, in Somerset, was built in 1817 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris. The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding. Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was "crucial". Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo. But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been "expensive and unsustainable". Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to "understand this unique and somewhat complex monument". "We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected," he said. "The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk." Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a "more effective repair approach".	A computer model of one of the world's tallest three-sided obelisks is being made to find out why it is falling apart.
But this is also a story which has cut to the heart of the country's political conscience and raised questions about so-called VIP culture. On Wednesday evening, as chairman of the Pakistan's People's Party (PPP) Bilawal Bhutto was visiting Karachi's Civil Hospital, so too was Bisma, a 10-month old child who needed urgent medical care. The infant's father Mohammad Faisal Baloch, from Karachi's poorest Lyari district, alleged he couldn't gain entry for more than an hour because of the security protocol surrounding Mr Bhutto's visit. "Doctors told me they could have saved her if she was brought in 10 minutes earlier," he told local media. Bisma was his only child and was suffering from respiratory problems. The story has created a storm in Pakistan even though there are conflicting reports about whether it was the traffic jam caused by the visit, or a single security guard's decision not to let the family through, that caused the delay. Much of the outrage is focused on the dilemmas of ordinary people trying to live their lives amid politicians with enormous security details, albeit politicians who may have cause for enhanced security - Bilawal's mother Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi in 2007. "What if Bisma has died, Bhutto is alive, long live Bhutto" is one tweet which despondently reflects the anger people are pouring out on social media. The PPP had been using the slogan "Bhutto is alive" to counter efforts by political rivals to weaken the party. The news of Bisma's death put social media in Pakistan on fire. #Bisma, #RIPDemocrazy and #VIPCuture immediately started trending. Bilawal Bhutto also tweeted: "Anguished over Bisma's death. Am personally inquiring into this heart-breaking incident to ascertain what went wrong." Such tragic controversies and the resultant inquiries are not new to Pakistani's elite, especially the PPP. In 2010, a woman had to give birth in an auto-rickshaw when the motorcade of the then president Asif Ali Zardari, who is also the PPP's co-chairman and Bilawal's father, blocked traffic in the city of Quetta. The woman's brother Mohammad Yaseen had told media at that time: "We pleaded with the policemen as it was an emergency but they refused, citing orders that no one should be allowed to move until the president had passed." Bisma's father has described a similar situation five years on. Opposition parties such as Imran Khan's Tehrik Insaf all jumped on the chance to criticise the PPP, which rules Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. A PTI leader, Naz Baloch, tweeted after meeting the bereaved family that Bisma's father refused a job offer from the PPP but asked for improvements to their local Lyari General hospital.  Lyari ironically is a PPP stronghold, but has remained underdeveloped for too long, many feel. Although the death of Bisma has been a catalyst for yet more criticism of Pakistan's so-called "VIP culture", ultimately what it may show is just how much development still needs to come to parts of Pakistan, given how easy it is for a toddler to quickly develop an illness which brings her right to the brink of death.	The tragic death of a toddler has gripped Pakistan's social media conscience over the past 24 hours.
An area of the town near the swimming pool had been evacuated for most of the morning and early afternoon. Other residents close by had been advised to open windows, stay indoors near walls and to avoid going outside. An exclusion zone remains in force on the river while experts make safe the sea mine which was spotted on Monday. It is thought to be a British mine, dating from the  1940s or 1950s. The evacuation affected three streets, with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500m of the device. There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile, and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation. Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services, affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay. Ch Insp Elliot Brown, the local area commander for Inverclyde, stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure, and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock. Lt Cdr Tim Castrinoyannakis, the officer in charge of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Unit, said that due to the deterioration of the mine it was not possible to conclude how much explosive material it still contained. He said that because of this it was decided to move it to a safer place before dealing with it. Inverclyde Council said: "Thanks to residents and businesses in Gourock for their patience while the cordon and safe evacuation procedures were carried out today."	Residents are returning to their homes after an operation to move an unexploded mine discovered in the Firth of Clyde.
Fraudsters posing as TalkTalk workers have switched their caller ID - the incoming number which appears on mobile phone screens - to that of The Flower Shop in Caversham, Reading. The shop said "confused" callers asking for the telecoms firm had started contacting them on Friday. The case is being assessed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. A TalkTalk spokesman said: "We can confirm that this incident is not related to TalkTalk." Shop manager Denika Potter said some of those ringing the business had been abusive after the fraudsters had tried to dupe them into providing their bank details. She said many people recognised they were being targeted by scammers, but mistakenly thought the call had originated from the florist. "Most customers are nice, accept it and apologise," said Ms Potter. "Some are very annoyed, which you obviously may be if you are getting lots of missed calls from a number." She said the calls were "disturbing" her staff's daily work and added:  "We are a small business and we're having to stop to answer the phone all the time." An Action Fraud spokesman said it could take up to 28 days to determine whether there were "sufficient lines of enquiry for an investigation based in the UK".	A family-run florist says it is being besieged with up to 120 calls a day in a phone cloning scam.
Google confirmed the plan to the BBC's Newsround programme, saying it wanted to focus on "formats that work well for both users and advertisers". Long unskippable adverts are seen as a nuisance by many viewers, and Google has introduced shorter formats. One media agency said the move reflected the difference between online video and linear television services. "The 30-second ad is a legacy from TV times," said Will Smyth, head of media at the Agenda21 agency. "It's a standard TV unit which has been put online, but it's not the most effective way to advertise. "This will encourage advertisers to be more creative about the way they use the platform." Many other websites, including the BBC's international offer, feature unskippable 30-second ads on video content. "Demand from advertisers for video content is high, but there's a shortage of quality content," said Mr Smyth. "It's good business for everyone to focus on 'skippables' - people aren't forced to sit through ads, and advertisers don't need to pay if their ad is skipped."	YouTube is to scrap "unskippable" 30-second advertisements on the video-streaming service, from 2018.
The miracle involved the healing of a Brazilian man with several brain tumours in 2008, the Vatican said. Mother Teresa died in 1997 and was beatified - the first step towards sainthood - in 2003. She won the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the poor in the slums of Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta). "The Holy Father has authorised the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to proclaim the decree concerning the miracle attributed to the intercession of blessed Mother Teresa," the Vatican said on Friday. She is expected to be canonised in Rome in September. Beatification by the Catholic Church requires one miracle, while the process of becoming recognised as a saint requires proof of at least two miracles. Mother Teresa was beatified in 2003 after Pope John Paul II accepted as authentic a miracle attributed to her. He judged that the curing of an Indian woman suffering from an abdominal tumour was the result of the supernatural intervention of the late Mother Teresa - a claim challenged by Indian rationalists. There are few details about the recovery of the Brazilian man, whose life the Vatican says was saved in the second miracle. His identity has not been disclosed to maintain the discretion needed for the investigation, the Catholic New Agency has said. It says he was unexpectedly cured from brain tumours in 2008 after his priest prayed for Mother Teresa's intervention with God. Born Agnes Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in Skopje, Macedonia, in 1910, she founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1949, dedicating her life to caring for impoverished and sick people in Kolkata. Known as the "saint of the gutter", she earned worldwide acclaim for her efforts. Her critics, however, accused her of mixing with dictators and peddling a hardline Catholicism.	Pope Francis has recognised a second miracle attributed to Mother Teresa, clearing the way for the Roman Catholic nun to be made a saint next year.
The pair appeared in front of thousands of fans at a news conference in Los Angeles - the first of four events called to promote the Las Vegas fight. "The movement, power, ferociousness - he has not experienced this," said UFC lightweight champion McGregor, 28. Mayweather replied: "I guarantee you're going out on your face or your back." The former five-weight world champion, 40, said he was an "old man" but "still had enough" to beat McGregor, who has never boxed professionally. He teased McGregor, claiming he "only made $3m in his last fight" and referenced the Irishman's submission defeat by Nate Diaz in 2016, his only loss since joining UFC three years earlier. "We know 'Mr Tap Out' likes to quit and you will wave that white flag," added Mayweather. McGregor's suit for the event contained pin-stripes which were comprised of an offensive two-word insult. He was first to break the silence as the pair stared at one another following lengthy walks to the stage. He began dancing in front of Mayweather before both addressed the crowd with expletive-laden speeches. "His little legs, little core, little head, I'm going to knock him out inside four rounds, mark my words," said McGregor. "I'm a young, confident, happy man that has worked extremely hard for this." Dublin-born McGregor said the boxing match offered "a limited set of rules" and pointed to demands he says Mayweather's team have made in agreeing to a fight which will reportedly earn each man around $100m (£78.5m) He added: "All these rules and restrictions - the gloves have to be 10oz, give him the gloves, no problem. No Mexican-made gloves, no problem. No gloves made of horse hair, fine. All I need is a gum shield, line me up to the ring and I'm good to go." The fight has drawn criticism from some within boxing given McGregor's lack of record within the sport. As both men took to the stage, their appearance was the top trend globally on Twitter. Mayweather retired from boxing after taking his record to 49 fights unbeaten with victory over Andre Berto in 2015. He has held 11 major world titles but has not stopped an opponent inside the distance since 2011, a point McGregor referenced on stage. The two men will appear at further promotional events in Toronto, Canada, on Wednesday, Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday and London on Friday.	Conor McGregor promised to knock out Floyd Mayweather inside four rounds when they faced off for the first time to promote their 26 August bout.
The display in Block 27 places the former camp in the broader context of Nazi Germany's systematic attempt to wipe out Europe's Jewish population. It is being overseen by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust institute. Earlier in Warsaw, Mr Netanyahu accused Iran, one of Israel's strongest foes, of planning a new Holocaust. By Adam EastonBBC News, Warsaw The new permanent Shoah exhibition has replaced the dilapidated one that was installed in 1960s communist-era Poland. It is an impressive, powerful exhibition. Upon entering a darkened room a prayer can be heard. The next room displays a panorama of slides and video of pre-war Jewish life in Europe. One room is devoted to Nazi ideology, showing video of speeches by Hitler and Goebbels. A map points out the numerous Jewish extermination sites across Europe. One of the most moving displays highlights the 1.5 million Jewish children murdered by the Nazis. An art installation reproduces their pencil drawings made during the Holocaust on stark white walls. There is also a Book of Names, running to 58 volumes, which aims to list all the names of the six million Holocaust victims. Finally, there is a room for visitors to sit and reflect upon the horrors they have just seen. On Thursday, he was taken around the exhibition at the former camp before making a speech at the opening ceremony, Yad Vashem reported on its Twitter account. The original Jewish exhibition at Auschwitz dated back to the 1960s and had fallen into neglect, prompting the Israeli government to decide recently on a revamp. An estimated one million Jews, together with some 100,000 people of other ethnicities and backgrounds, died in Auschwitz and the adjacent Birkenau camp, in gas chambers or from starvation, disease and forced labour. The new display features: Mr Netanyahu used a visit to the Polish capital on Wednesday to warn that Iran was now a major threat to the Jews. Iranians are going to the polls on Friday to elect a new president, with the hard-line incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, not eligible for a third term. Mr Netanyahu said the Iranian election on Friday would "change nothing" in the Islamic republic's alleged quest for nuclear weapons. "This is a regime that is building nuclear weapons with the expressed purpose to annihilate Israel's six million Jews," he said. "We will not allow this to happen. We will never allow another Holocaust." Tehran denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. Iran is viewed as a threat in Israel because of its aggressive rhetoric, its support for militant groups in the region, its arsenal of long-range missiles and its nuclear work. However, critics of the Israeli prime minister have accused him of citing the Holocaust too frequently in the context of Iran. Aluf Benn, editor of liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, wrote in an editorial last week: "Shoah [Holocaust] warnings have taken over the political and military discourse."	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opened a Holocaust exhibition at the Auschwitz Nazi death camp site in southern Poland.
The Cumbernauld-based firm, which also makes Rubicon and Tizer, said it would cut Irn Bru's sugar content from about 10g per 100ml to just below 5g. It will reduce the calorie count per can from just under 140 to about 66. AG Barr said the move was part of a "long-standing sugar reduction programme". It confirmed in a stock market announcement on Wednesday that more than 90% of its portfolio would contain less than 5g of total sugar per 100ml by this autumn. Tizer is already below that threshold, while the Rubicon carbonates range will all have less than 5g of sugar per 100ml by the middle of this year, the company said. The UK government plans to introduce a levy on sugary drinks in April 2018. The Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) will have two bands in the UK - one for soft drinks with more than 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher one for drinks with more than 8g per 100ml. Ministers hope the move will help tackle the nation's obesity problem. A spokesman for the company said: "Irn Bru will still be made with sugar. We are not removing all the sugar, but we are reducing the amount. "Having worked on this for some time, we are carefully blending and balancing a mix of sugar, sweeteners and our original and best flavour essence to deliver the great taste of Irn Bru but with less sugar. "We're doing this because evidence shows that most consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. "86% of consumers are concerned about the amount of sugar in food and drink that they consume. "That said, we have taken the soft drinks sugar tax thresholds into account when determining the levels of sugar reduction, but never compromising on taste." In the past year, the company has introduced two new drinks - Irn Bru Xtra and Rubicon Spring - both of which contain no added sugar. Chief executive Roger White said: "Evidence shows that consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. "We've responded by significantly reducing sugar across our portfolio in recent years, through reformulation and innovation. "Today's announcement builds on this progress and we are now expanding our successful sugar reduction plans to include our iconic Irn Bru brand." He added: "We will continue to respond to our consumers and adapt to their changing preferences, offering great tasting products that are right for this generation of consumers and the next."	AG Barr is to halve the amount of sugar in its leading Irn Bru brand, ahead of a government crackdown on the fizzy drinks industry.
The Stanford University analysis of 68 million days' worth of minute-by-minute data showed the average number of daily steps was 4,961. Hong Kong was top averaging 6,880 a day, while Indonesia was bottom of the rankings with just 3,513. But the findings also uncovered intriguing details that could help tackle obesity. Most smartphones have a built-in accelerometer that can record steps and the researchers used anonymous data from more than 700,000 people who used the Argus activity monitoring app. Scott Delp, a professor of bioengineering and one of the researchers, said: "The study is 1,000 times larger than any previous study on human movement. "There have been wonderful health surveys done, but our new study provides data from more countries, many more subjects, and tracks people's activity on an ongoing basis. "This opens the door to new ways of doing science at a much larger scale than we have been able to do before." The findings have been published in the journal Nature and the study authors say the results give important insights for improving people's health. The average number of steps in a country appears to be less important for obesity levels, for example. The key ingredient was "activity inequality" - it's like wealth inequality, except instead of the difference between rich and poor, it's the difference between the fittest and laziest. The bigger the activity inequality, the higher the rates of obesity. Tim Althoff, one of the researchers, said: "For instance, Sweden had one of the smallest gaps between activity rich and activity poor... it also had one of the lowest rates of obesity." The United States and Mexico both have similar average steps, but the US has higher activity inequality and obesity levels. Global sleeping patterns revealed by app data Has wearable tech had its day? Is that fitness tracker you're using a waste of money? The researchers were surprised that activity inequality was largely driven by differences between men and women. In countries like Japan - with low obesity and low inequality - men and women exercised to similar degrees. But in countries with high inequality, like the US and Saudi Arabia, it was women spending less time being active. Jure Leskovec, also part of the research team, said: "When activity inequality is greatest, women's activity is reduced much more dramatically than men's activity, and thus the negative connections to obesity can affect women more greatly." The Stanford team say the findings help explain global patterns of obesity and give new ideas for tackling it. For example, they rated 69 US cities for how easy they were to get about on foot. The smartphone data showed that cities like New York and San Francisco were pedestrian friendly and had "high walkability". Whereas you really need a car to get around "low walkability" cities including Houston and Memphis. Unsurprisingly, people walked more in places where it was easier to walk. The researchers say this could help design town and cities that promote greater physical activity. Follow James on Twitter. Reporter conflict of interest: I made 10,590 steps yesterday but clocked up only 129 on Sunday, I left my phone on the kitchen table all day - that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.	US scientists have amassed "planetary-scale" data from people's smartphones to see how active we really are.
The Hemel Hempstead-born 37-year-old succeeds fellow Briton Ian Poulter, who hosted the 2015 event at Woburn. This year's tournament was the first since 2008 and was won by Sheffield's Matthew Fitzpatrick. The Grove has only ever held a European Tour event once before in its history - when Tiger Woods won a World Golf Championship tournament in 2006. "We knew the British Masters would get great crowds," said Donald. "The British people love coming out and supporting their events and supporting the British players. It was a fun and successful week. "Woburn was a tremendous venue and Ian did a brilliant job as the ambassador. It's my turn next and I will be looking forward to coming back and hopefully having even more success and bringing even more people to this amazing tournament."	Luke Donald will host the 2016 British Masters at The Grove in his home county of Hertfordshire.
LL Camps in Bushey, Hertfordshire, was closed by Ofsted last week and director Ben Lewis has been charged with possessing indecent images of children. Following the closure, parents vented their anger on the firm's Facebook page at the initial lack of information. But camp co-founder Tal Landsman has now said refunds will be issued. Ofsted closed the camp on 6 August and the company's website was taken down soon after. One parent whose child was due to attend the US-style day camp wrote it was an "utter disgrace". Another was concerned about parents who "could not afford alternative care without the refund". A man whose children had gone to the camp told the BBC: "Fortunately, for us they were only going for one further day, and then they were going to a different camp. "Had it been the situation that they were due to be there this week and all of next week, we'd be in a bit of bother." But on Wednesday, Mr Landsman confirmed parents would be able to fill in a refund form which has been placed on a holding page on the company's official website. Mr Lewis and Mr Landsman opened the holiday club in 2010.	Parents of children due to go to a summer camp whose director has been charged with possession of indecent images have been offered refunds.
"I'm frustrated to say the least, but very pleased that we've stayed in this division," Hodges told BBC Cornwall. "In a couple weeks time I'll be pleased we're still in this division, but we're going to have to raise the bar." The Cornish side were safe going into their final game, which they lost 4-0 at relegated Bishop's Stortford. "Well done for staying up," he added. "But we've underachieved by a country mile." Having been play-off semi-finalists in 2015-16, after finishing fourth in the table, the White Tigers dropped to 19th in 2016-17, letting in 99 goals from their 42 league games, more than any other side above the bottom three. Hodges says he will meet chairman Peter Masters this week to discuss plans for next season. "There are a lot of decisions to be made on players," he said. "There's a few bonuses there for players who have done very well and competed, and others know that they've not been up to the standard."	Lee Hodges says his Truro team have underachieved by a "country mile" by finishing the season one place above the National League South drop zone.
The test ran between Victoria station and Exchange Square through to Market Street at about 02:00 GMT. A new tram stop at Exchange Square for Metrolink's Second City Crossing is due to open before Christmas. The crossing would mean extra capacity for trams and will link St Peter's Square with Victoria station. It is expected to be completed by 2017. Trams will travel along Princess Street, Cross Street and Corporation Street to reach Victoria. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said the scheme was an essential part of the Metrolink expansion. Peter Cushing, TfGM's Metrolink director, said: "We're at the start of an extensive testing and commissioning process to make sure all the physical infrastructure is ready for us to get passenger services in the run up to Christmas."	The first test trams have run on the new section of track for the second crossing through Manchester.
The events were organised by the Right2Water group. RTÃ‰ reports that demonstrations were held in various parts of the country including Dublin, Cork and Galway. The Right2Water campaign is made up of community groups, political groupings and trade unions. Brendan Ogle of the Unite trade union said the demonstrations were the first step in a significant pre-election campaign by Right2Water. "Water has been a catalyst in the fight against austerity but people are crying out for a change in how our country is run and that will be visible on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Donegal, among other counties today," he said. The Irish Department of the Environment said three out of four people are now paying water bills. This figure includes those on private schemes as well as those paying through Irish Water. The department added that it did not think it prudent to advise people to get into debt by not paying their bills and urged them to engage with Irish Water.	Thousands of people in the Republic of Ireland have participated in 30 demonstrations about water charges.
Police said the 14-year-old reported feeling unwell and required hospital treatment. He was later discharged from hospital and is recovering at home. The incident happened in Holywood, County Down, on Saturday. The PSNI said the tablets were "as yet unidentified" but warned of the "potential dangers" they posed. The 17-year-old, has been charged with possessing a Class A controlled drug with intent to supply; possessing a Class B controlled drug with intent to supply; possession of a Class A controlled drug; possession of a Class B controlled drug and supplying a Class A controlled drug. He is due to appear at Newtownards Youth Court on 14 February.	A 17-year-old boy has been charged with drugs offences after a 14-year-old boy was treated in hospital after taking half of a 'Darth Vader' tablet.
That's the verdict of scientists who have analysed ancient DNA of the extinct animals for mutations. The studies suggest the last mammoths died out after their DNA became riddled with errors. The knowledge could inform conservation efforts for living animals. There are fewer than 100 Asiatic cheetahs left in the wild, while the remaining mountain gorilla population is estimated at about 300. The numbers are similar to those of the last woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean around 4,000 years ago. Dr Rebekah Rogers of the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said the mammoths' genomes "were falling apart right before they went extinct". This, she said, was the first case of "genomic meltdown" in a single species. "You had this last refuge of mammoths after everything has gone extinct on the mainland," she added. "The mathematical theories that have been developed said that they should accumulate bad mutations because natural selection should become very inefficient." The researchers analysed genetic mutations found in the ancient DNA of a mammoth from 4,000 years ago. They used the DNA of a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago, when populations were much larger,  as a comparison. Woolly mammoths were once common in North America and Siberia. They were driven to extinction by environmental factors and possibly human hunting about 10,000 years ago. Small island populations clung on until about 4,000 years ago. "There was this huge excess of what looked like bad mutations in the genome of the mammoth from this island," said Dr Rogers. "We found these bad mutations were accumulating in the mammoth genome right before they went extinct." Knowledge of the last days of the mammoth could help modern species on the brink of extinction, such as the panda, mountain gorilla and Indian elephant. The lesson from the woolly mammoth is that once numbers drop below a certain level, the population's genetic health may be beyond saving. Genetic testing could be one way to assess whether levels of genetic diversity in a species are enough to give it a chance of survival. A better option is to stop numbers falling too low. "When you have these small populations for an extended period of time they can go into genomic meltdown, just like what we saw in the mammoth," said Dr Rogers. "So if you can prevent these organisms ever being threatened or endangered then that will do a lot more to help prevent this type of genomic meltdown compared to if you have a small population and then bring it back up to larger numbers because it will still bear those signatures of this genomic meltdown." Scientists think the genetic mutations may have given the last woolly mammoths "silky, shiny satin fur". Mutations may have also led to a loss of olfactory receptors, responsible for the sense of smell, as well as substances in urine involved in social status and attracting a mate. Love Dalen is professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and head of the team of scientists that originally published the DNA sequences of the mammoths. He said they found "many deletions, big chunks of the genome that are missing, some of which even affected functional genes". "This is a very novel result," he said. "If this holds up when more mammoth genomes, as well as genomes from other species, are analysed, it will have very important implications for conservation biology." The research is published in the journal, PLOS Genetics. Follow Helen on Twitter.	The last woolly mammoths to walk the Earth were so wracked with genetic disease that they lost their sense of smell, shunned company, and had a strange shiny coat.

Members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from more than 100 countries marched five abreast into Saint Peter's Basilica on a cold winter's day under a cloudless sky, squinting in the bright sunlight. The knights were hatless, but wore long black woollen cloaks with the distinctive eight-pointed white cross of their order embroidered in front. The dames (about 30% of the members are now women), wearing similar robes and coiffed with black mantillas, followed behind. The procession, including aid workers and volunteers bringing up the rear, took more than half an hour to wind around the basilica, into the square and up the steps into Saint Peter's. At the high altar Pope Benedict's number two, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, led a special Mass to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the founding of the order by Brother Gerard, a Benedictine monk who opened a hospital for sick and poor pilgrims in Jerusalem at the time of the Crusades. In 1113 Pope Paschal II formally recognised the independence of the Knights with a Papal bull, the original of which is still held in Malta's National Archives. The Knights have had a long history of displacement around the Mediterranean. After being evicted from Jerusalem by Saladin towards the end of the 12th Century, they set up a new headquarters in Cyprus, and subsequently on the island of Rhodes where they created an independent state. During the Middle Ages they were more warriors than hospitallers. For two centuries they were the masters of Malta but they were again evicted, this time by Napoleon who occupied the island on his way to Egypt. They finally settled in Rome in 1834, where they continue to enjoy many of the privileges of statehood, such as the power to appoint and receive ambassadors, print stamps, and issue passports, without actually having a real state to govern. Today the Knights are a unique sovereign entity in that they rule over no territory except a palace in one of Rome's smartest shopping districts, a church and an elegant villa overlooking the city. They have observer status at the United Nations, just like the Vatican, and Pope Benedict is a member of the monastic order, having joined 15 years ago. He gave his blessing to the knights at the end of the Vatican Mass urging them to continue their work for the world's neediest people. He reminded them that they are not practising "mere philanthropy" but must always stay true to the order's original Christian ideals, and to Church teaching. The order's international headquarters is in a palace situated in Rome's Via Condotti, a short distance from the Spanish Steps. High fashion boutiques nearby offer neat handbags for sale at prices ranging up to $3,000. The atmosphere inside reminded me of an Oxbridge College or a London Club. Inside the porter's lodge there are cubby holes for letters addressed to His Highness, the Grand Master - who is British - and to senior officials. Matthew Festing is an expert on 17th Century European painting. He used to run the Northern England office of the auction house Sotheby's before being elected for life five years ago to become the leader of the Knights of Malta. He now enjoys the title of prince, and holds the equivalent rank of a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. Sitting in his cosy private apartment decorated with gold brocade wall coverings, fine antique furniture and paintings, he explained to me how the Knights are changing. "The fact that we are called Knights is a function of the past really," he said. "We were originally recruited from the aristocratic families of Europe." The order has now become a worldwide organisation, and it tries to attract the most talented people from many areas outside Europe. "We have a very different makeup from what we did perhaps 50 years or 500 years ago, but fundamentally the talents we are trying to attract for our members are the same," Mr Festing said.	Four thousand Knights of Malta, heirs to one of the great orders of European chivalry of mediaeval times, and the fourth oldest religious order in the Roman Catholic Church, took over the Vatican briefly on Saturday.
London turned down the chance to host the Grand Depart, citing the cost of staging the event - reported to be about £35m - as the reason. It will be the first time since West Berlin in 1987 that Germany has hosted the opening stage of road cycling's premier race. La Manche in north-west France will host the 2016 Grand Depart. This 2015 event started in the Dutch city of Utrecht, a year after thousands came to Leeds to watch the cyclists set off.	The 2017 Tour de France will begin in the German city of Dusseldorf, it has been announced.
Some of the men come from families with close links to the government. One has escaped from custody. The victim, Zouhoura, is the daughter of an opposition leader and was threatened with death if she spoke about the attack. A video of her rape sparked a wave of protests in Chad in February. Africa Live: More on this and other news stories	Seven men have been sentenced to 10 years for the rape and kidnapping a schoolgirl in the Chadian capital, Ndjamena.
Treating wounds in Welsh hospitals or in the home and at clinics by nurses costs the NHS in Wales around £156m a year. The Welsh Wound Innovation Centre (WWIC) aims to improve treatments and lower hospital admissions and stays. Based in Llantrisant, it will include working with patients at the nearby Royal Glamorgan Hospital. Wound care - which includes dealing with problems like pressure sores and infection after surgery - is thought to account for around 5% of the NHS's overall budget and is rising. The new centre is co-headed by Prof Keith Harding, head of Cardiff University's Wound Healing Research Unit, which has been researching wound healing for more than 22 years. This has included pioneering work in the use of maggots for cleaning wounds. In a typical hospital, between 25% and 40% of beds are occupied by patients with a wound, while nurses in the community can spend between 25-75% of their time treating them. "Treating patients with wounds, whether chronic, acute or traumatic, is a surprisingly expensive problem for the health service - not to mention the emotional costs it inflicts on patients and their families," said Prof Harding. He said the centre would look at improvements to wound prevention and treatment, aimed at fewer hospital admissions and shorter stays. WOUND HEALING CASE STUDY - Lauren Brimble, 27, from Abertillery, had bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has suffered leg ulcers. She took part in clinical trials for new dressings developed by the Wound Healing Research Unit. "We found the Cardiff research unit on the internet and although I was out of the area I arranged to see them and they took me on. "I was in excruciating pain with my left leg, I've never known anything like it and no pain killers would make a difference. But they got on top of it. I had different trials of dressings on each leg over the summer - the right one is fine now and the left one has improved significantly. "The treatment is ongoing but it's been amazing. It's one of those things that unless you've had it you can't understand what it means and the effect it has on your life." The WWIC was set up with £2.5m funding from the Welsh government, as well as the seven local health boards and the private sector. It hopes to be paying for itself within three years through grants and commercial sources. The centre is already supporting the work of five small businesses based in Wales, as well American and Australian companies. It employs 31 people and aims to attract at least 11 investments from abroad, creating a further 45 jobs over the next five years. It recently won a research award from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to help scientists develop a diagnostic test to improve the treatment of chronic wound management. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "Our population is getting older and the time and cost associated with treating and managing wounds is set to increase. Only by looking at new ways of treating wounds can we manage this trend and improve people's quality of life."	A new £4m research centre to tackle the "silent epidemic" of wound care has been launched.
The vote held on Friday was for 68 seats out of the 290 in parliament. It meant that nervous Iranians woke up on Saturday morning to an all new political landscape. For the first time in 13 years moderates and reformists now have a majority in parliament. While it was not a sweeping victory for the supporters of President Hassan Rouhani, it was still a surprise win, especially given the months of heavy campaigning against the government's policies. Hardliners had a majority in the outgoing parliament. In the three years since Hassan Rouhani took office, they have bitterly opposed most of government's plans, organising a fierce attack on the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Some MPs have even gone so far as to describe Foreign Minister Javad Zarif as a traitor. The popular moderate who negotiated the nuclear deal has regularly been subject to harsh criticism in parliament and is under constant threat of impeachment by fundamentalist MPs. Now almost all those MPs have been unseated by moderate or reformist counterparts, and those who remain either supported the deal or at least never attacked it as vociferously as their unseated comrades. Many observers argue the nuclear deal not only brought an end to years of harsh international sanctions but was also the deal-breaker in the elections. The people were saying no to those who had promised to stop the deal. What puts this victory in a more meaningful context is the fact that it was achieved despite almost all well-known reformists being banned from running in the elections and a complete lack of media coverage of their campaign in the run-up to the elections. State TV and media never gave equal coverage to reformists or moderate candidates and even led a campaign against the deal in recent months. The only medium available to pro-government candidates was the internet and social media, which they used to the maximum in getting their message across, especially to the young and women. The triumph of the reformists should lead to a major realignment within parliament, making it more supportive of President Rouhani. But it will by no means end the president's problems when it comes to delivering his election promises. The nuclear deal has hit some rough patches on its way to implementation. Apart from domestic oppositions from hardliners in parliament and other unelected bodies, there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome outside of Iran. The international banks still have not opened up to Iranian businesses and in the US, conservatives in Congress are doing all they can to derail the deal. Any more delays in its implementation and ensuing lifting of sanctions would harm President Rouhani's economic reform plans and would prepare the ground for hardliners to recover from the this week's defeat in order to reshape their campaign against the government. Time is not on the moderates' side and the new momentum could die down easily if it is not supported by economic rewards. This is a worry that every unseated hardliner MP is focusing on from now onwards.	The run-off parliamentary election win by the moderate government of Iran is a crucial victory for them.
Police were called to the A35 at Bloxworth, near Wareham, at about 09:10 BST after they were discovered by a dog walker. Tests are under way to "determine the contents" of the cigarettes and HM Revenue and Customs has been informed. Dorset Police urged anyone who may have found other packets in "unusual circumstances" to contact them. No arrests have been made.	About 34,000 cigarettes have been found in a layby in Dorset.
"Is it Hillary Clinton?" Daniel Aston, 20, is puzzling over a picture of a woman who looms very large in the history of his home town. "It's Margaret something," offers 19-year-old Andrew Jones. Only Liam Foster-Jones, of the three unemployed friends, seems certain about who the imperious features and swept-back helmet of hair might belong to. "It's Margaret Thatcher," he says. The name doesn't seem to mean much to them. It would have been a different story 36 years ago, when the Thatcher government closed Consett's steel works, with the loss of 3,700 jobs. The devastation inflicted on this remote town high on the edge of the Pennines, where unemployment soared to 36%, made the national news and became a symbol of the harsh medicine the Thatcher government thought it had to administer to Britain's heavy industries. It sowed the seeds for the electoral wipe out the Conservatives would experience across large parts of Northern England and Scotland, which it still trying to recover from today. Thatcher and "the Tories" remain dirty words to the former steel workers in Consett but few young people I spoke to could recognise her and those that did regarded her as a distant historical figure. "I don't really have an opinion [about her] but my dad doesn't like her because she shut down the steel works," said 20-year-old Adam Stokoe. "So my dad has strong opinions about that. I'm not from that time period so I don't really think about it that way. I only think about now. What's going to benefit me." Consett has never had a Conservative MP but the Tory vote held up surprisingly well in other parts of the North-East while Thatcher was in power. In 1983, the party took 34% of North East votes, and had five MPs. It was only after she left office that anti-Tory attitudes really hardened, with the party's share of the vote slumping by 10%. It currently has just three MPs in the region. Theresa May is attempting to change that on 8 June and has urged traditional Labour supporters to "lend" her their vote. She will have experienced at first hand how difficult it is to break the voting habits of a lifetime in this part of the world when she stood for election in North West Durham in 1992. (By a strange coincidence, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was also standing for Parliament for the first time that year in the same constituency.) They still remember Mrs May at Consett Working Men's Club - because, claims the barman, they wouldn't let her through the door. It had nothing to do with her politics, he adds, it's just that the club is one of a tiny handful left in the UK that does not admit women. "Your wife can't chase you in here," says one regular, looking up from his racing form. He doesn't want to talk about politics. Mrs May won 28% of the vote in North West Durham - a score that has not been beaten by a Conservative candidate there since - but although one local poll put the party in with a chance of winning on 8 June it is not high on their target list. There was certainly little enthusiasm for Mrs May's brand of Conservatism in the town's Steel Club, although the lifelong Labour voters I spoke to were equally scathing about their traditional party of choice. "I don't like Jeremy Corbyn. He hasn't got a brain in his head as far as I'm concerned," said Christopher Bell, a 69-year-old retired steel worker and club steward. He and his partner, Linda, voted for Brexit in last year's referendum and are worried about the strain they say is being placed on local services by East European immigrants. Linda, who voted UKIP in 2015, said she would not return to the Labour fold until the party was led by "somebody that's going to stand up for English people, working class people - because the Conservatives like the rich and they like to keep them rich". Thirty miles south in Darlington, a constituency with a narrower Labour majority of just over 3,000, people seemed more receptive to the Conservative message. The town has had a Tory MP before - Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in the 1980s - and the party has hopes of retaking the seat on 8 June. "I will vote for Theresa May. Not necessarily because she's a Conservative but I think she's the only person for the job. Given the other options," says Alex Blackham, owner of a cafe in the town's indoor market. "If she'd been Labour or an independent then I would have been voting for her as a person. I think that's what politics comes down to sometimes." Clive Hinson, a 59-year-old assembly line worker who was about to tuck into one of Mr Blackham's full English breakfasts, blames Thatcher for the closure of the dump truck factory he worked at in the 1980s. But he adds: "Funnily enough, I'll be voting Conservative. Because I think Corbyn is a waste of time. "He can't give a definitive answer on defence. He's got all these plans for spending loads of money but the figures just don't add up....so much though I don't want to vote Conservative that's the way I'm voting." He says the North East has "forgiven but not forgotten" Thatcher, comparing the reconciliation process to what happened in Northern Ireland or South Africa. Like Mr Blackham he voted for Brexit in last year's EU referendum. Most of the older working class people I spoke to - the traditional bedrock of Labour support in the area - needed no prompting to criticise what they saw as Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership ability and charisma. He seemed to go over much better with younger, more cosmopolitan voters. "I would vote Corbyn all day every day," said Stephen Lock, who runs a comic book stall in the covered market with wife June. "He's such a man of the people by the looks of it. He's looking after the general working people. He seems to have great ideas. They may be a little outdated in the modern day, but he's not the person they're painting him out to be. They are trying to make him out to be weak and I don't think he is." The couple returned from 13 years in France, where they had a gardening business, after the Brexit vote. "We thought we had better come back and do something else here. It's affected us quite heavily," said Stephen. They are torn between voting Labour and Liberal Democrats - and are not impressed by what they see as the disloyalty of Labour MPs who openly criticise their leader. "The Labour Party is shooting itself in the foot by not acting and standing as one," said June. "You have got career politicians that are more concerned about their own personal interests than their constituents." There also appeared to real enthusiasm for Corbyn among Darlington's student population, who blame the media for portraying him in a negative light. "You don't see a lot of coverage of, like, nice things about him," said 18-year-old Emily Frewin. "But when you actually read into it he is a nice person." Theresa May avoids talking to the voters, she adds, but "he seems like he wants to talk to everybody, not just the rich people". "He does seem to be getting slandered quite a lot," agrees 20-year-old software development student Josh Walker, "when he's trying to fight for us." If the Thatcher factor was ever a major impediment to a Tory revival in the North East, it has undoubtedly faded with time. The party's tactic of detaching Theresa May's name - it was emblazoned across the battle bus she toured the North-East in - from the Conservative brand appears to be working with some voters, who might feel a little queasy at the prospect of putting their cross next to a Tory candidate. Some told me they had flirted with a Conservative vote, only to think better of it - Mrs May's support for a free vote on fox hunting, not an issue that has exactly dominated the airwaves, was mentioned by several people as a reason for not switching to the Tories. And there will always be some who will never forget, or forgive. Like the Darlington woman who greeted Theresa May's name with a horrified cry of "she's another Maggie Thatcher!". But on the basis of this highly unscientific sample, Thatcher is no longer the bogey figure she was and Labour can no longer rely on the loyalty of its traditional support base.	The Conservatives are hoping to win back seats in the North-East of England on 8 June - has the party finally escaped the shadow of Margaret Thatcher which helped make much of the region a no-go area for them?
Ramunas Macnoris is charged over separate gun attacks in Newry, County Down, early last Thursday when two men, both aged 32, were shot in the legs. The 26-year-old, of Lambfield House, Dungannon, was also charged with having a firearm. The accused, who is originally from Lithuania, was remanded in custody, A detective objected to bail, saying police feared he would reoffend, flee the country or interfere with witnesses. However, a defence lawyer argued he could be released under stringent conditions, including staying 40 miles away from Newry. Refusing bail, the judge said there were "genuine fears" about the concerns raised by the detective. The accused is due to appear in court again via videolink next month.	A man charged with attempted murder and kidnapping is allegedly part of an international drugs smuggling gang, a court has heard.
Nordtveit's low shot took a deflection off Sammy Clingan's heel to beat keeper Lee Camp just before half-time. Substitute Elyounoussi produced a fine shot on the turn in the 87th minute and another replacement Ruud made it 3-0 to Norway with a fine volley. Northern Ireland started well but rarely threatened in the second half. Before the goals, home skipper Steven Davis, Martin Paterson and Gareth McAuley were all thwarted during a frantic goalmouth scramble. It means Northern Ireland have won just one of their last 14 friendlies. They started brightly with full-back Ryan McGivern's drive being tipped away by goalkeeper Rune Jarstein. Northern Ireland were knocking the ball about well and the atmosphere at Windsor Park seemed optimistic. However, O'Neill's men were unable to make the breakthrough and were hit by Norway's opening goal in the 44th minute. Aaron Hughes half-cleared a corner as far as Nordtveit, whose shot beat Camp via the unfortunate Clingan. Grant McCann, a half-time substitute, had a decent crack at goal soon after the break with his 25-yard drive being tipped away by Jarstein. Paddy McCourt came on with just over 20 minutes to go, replacing Shane Ferguson. The Celtic man was watched from the stands by club boss Neil Lennon, returning to the ground where he was once barracked by his own fans on international duty. David Healy then came on as a substitute to become Northern Ireland's most capped outfield player on 92, passing Mal Donaghy. Elyounoussi extended the visitors' lead three minutes from time when he beat Camp at the near post with a fine shot. Ruud's superb injury-time volley made it 3-0 despite the Nottingham Forest keeper getting a strong hand to it. Northern Ireland: Camp, McAuley, Hughes, Jonathan Evans, McGivern, Corry Evans, Clingan, Davis, Ferguson, Shiels, Paterson. Subs: Mannus, Hodson, McGinn, Healy, McCann, Duff, McQuoid, McCourt, Carson, McGovern. Norway: Jarstein, Hogli, Rogne, Demidov, Riise, Henriksen, Nordtveit, Grindheim, Pedersen, Abdellaoui, Huseklepp. Subs: Pettersen, Reginiussen, Elyounoussi, Ruud, Jenssen, Braaten, Berisha.	Goals from Havard Nordtveit, Tarik Elyounoussi and Espen Ruud ensured Michael O'Neill's first match as Northern Ireland boss ended in defeat.
Byron Davies asked if a message from William Graham supporting the so-called "black route" for a Â£1bn Newport relief road came from a "spoof" account, as party policy was to review the options. Antoinette Sandbach accused Mr Graham of "not willing to put his vote where his principles allegedly are". Group leader Andrew RT Davies said the online row would "not be repeated". Mr Graham backed a Conservative motion in the Senedd in January calling for a review of the possible routes for an M4 relief road. But following the debate he tweeted: "I am confident that when the public inquiry is held the 'black route' will be chosen", referring to the Welsh government's preferred option. Some critics have claimed other routes would cause less environmental damage. It prompted responses from two of Mr Graham's colleagues asking whether he supported or disagreed with Conservative policy to review the alternatives. Group leader Andrew RT Davies told journalists on Tuesday he had "spoken to" each of the members who were "all signed up to the group position". "If people want to go on to Twitter to have a tittle-tattle that's neither here nor there," he said. "The people involved know my views on it and I'm confident it won't be repeated."	Three Welsh Conservative AMs have been "spoken to" by their leader for arguing about the party's M4 policy on Twitter.
HM Revenue & Customs wants to target businesses that have failed to register for tax, and individuals who fail to declare the money they make online. It said this "hidden economy" could equate to Â£5.9bn a year in tax. HMRC has launched a consultation on extending its powers to collect extra data from firms and individuals. No specific firms have been named, but sellers on internet marketplaces such as online advert site Gumtree, holiday home rental site Airbnb and e-commerce giant eBay could be among those targeted. In the consultation document published online, HMRC said data played a key role in enabling it to detect those not paying tax. Existing laws allow HMRC to access certain data but it wants to broaden its scope. "Data can be particularly powerful when it is collected from third parties who facilitate trade, either between businesses, or between businesses and consumers," the consultation document said. "This is because they can provide information in bulk about the activity of large numbers of traders, and because third party data can be used as an independent check against the data that taxpayers themselves report to HMRC." The document said the extended powers would affect businesses acting as intermediaries or providing electronic payment services. HMRC stressed it would not target individuals who sold personal possessions, only businesses that failed to pay tax owed. It said it would not seek to find out what people bought online, but rather what was sold and not declared. "Effective tackling of the hidden economy will ensure a level playing field between those businesses and individuals who comply with their tax obligations and those that do not," the consultation said. It said those who were tax compliant "should see little or no impact". The 12-week consultation runs until 14 October.	Internet companies may have to provide more information on people and businesses who sell goods and services online, in a crackdown on tax evasion.
The 19-year-old produced a spell of 5-3 in 19 balls as six Glamorgan wickets fell in the last 13 overs of day one. Ben Cox's aggressive 93 off 99 balls was the mainstay of the home innings, while Ed Barnard (60) and Tongue (41) led the lower-order resistance. Timm van der Gugten, with 4-66, was the pick of the Glamorgan attack. Worcestershire counter-attacked hard from their poor start as Cox, having come in on a hat-trick on 14-3, hit 15 fours before being brilliantly caught by Andrew Salter within sight of his century. After two double century opening stands in three matches, this time both Worcestershire openers were back in the pavilion inside eight overs, Daryl Mitchell, who had scored 534 runs in his previous five innings, going for a third-ball duck. Netherlands seamer van der Gugten claimed four of the first six wickets to fall in an accurate display, including Tom Fell and Brett D'Oliveira in successive balls. But, in only his sixth Championship game, Tongue outshone everyone. He improved his best with both bat and ball, aided by some superb slip catching in the dramatic closing overs as only Jacques Rudolph (49 not out) reached double figures. Worcestershire's Ben Cox told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "It was an edgy start, going in at 14-3, and I wasn't backing myself. But, on a wicket like that, it sometimes suits my game to go out and try and put the pressure back on them. "Fortunately my edges didn't go to hand. And iIt was a good catch (to get me out), but it's 93 from a position where we were really struggling and we're in a good position now. "We couldn't be happier after that spell from Tonguey. That's one of the best spells I've kept to. We said it down at Glamorgan that there's going to be times that he has those spells, he clicks and hits the zone." Glamorgan's Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport: "First and foremost it was a great spell of bowling (by Tongue), it's one of those spells where Joe (Clarke) took a brilliant one-handed catch, the keeper (Cox) took a brilliant one-handed catch and it's obviously not ideal to be in this position because it's quite a good wicket. "Coming back, we've got to have a strong mind-set and when we bowl again. we probably gave 20 to 30 runs too many, but there's still plenty of time left in the game. "If your mind-set's good on this wicket, it gives you opportunities to score, Cox almost got a hundred by playing really positively."	Worcestershire's teenage seamer Josh Tongue tore Glamorgan apart with five wickets as they fell to 76-6 in reply to the hosts' 267 all out at New Road.
The university said the move at Singleton Park was "precautionary". South Wales Police received a call at about 13:30 BST after concerns about the safe storage of chemicals before a controlled explosion took place. Nobody was injured and a police spokesman said a cordon erected was precautionary while the chemicals were removed. Student Alex Jones said there was "some panic" at the start of the incident and lectures were moved away from the area to other buildings. South Wales Police said the incident was not treated as suspicious and there was no risk to the public. The university said the controlled explosion was carried out by the Royal Logistics Corps bomb disposal unit after the chemicals "had become unstable".	Part of a Swansea University campus was evacuated on Thursday after the discovery of "unstable" chemicals.

Jayden Stockley headed wide from Jonny Hayes' cross early in the second half and Rangers quickly capitalised on that miss when Kenny Miller tucked in. A powerful Lee Hodson shot doubled the home side's advantage. The hosts' Clint Hill and Aberdeen's Ryan Jack were each dismissed for two bookings, with Andrew Considine heading a late consolation for the Dons. The Ibrox side had started the day level on points with Hearts but trailing them on goal difference. However, with Hearts held to a draw by Ross County, Mark Warburton's side go two points ahead of the Tynecastle side and remain eight behind leaders Celtic. Rangers had lost at Hearts in midweek while Aberdeen were coming off a 3-0 defeat by Celtic in Sunday's League Cup final, with the Dons aiming to end a 25-year wait for a win at Ibrox. But that run continues with Warburton's side winning by the same scoreline that they lost by at Aberdeen's Pittodrie in September. The visitors had their chances in Glasgow with James Maddison - who scored a stunning free-kick winner in the sides' last meeting - seeing a set-piece effort bounce wide. Stockley got a foot to a Graeme Shinnie cross to draw a save from Wes Foderingham and came close to putting Derek McInnes' side ahead three minutes after the break. Hayes got round his man to cross from the left but Stockley could not direct his header from six yards on target. Maddison failed to get a hold of a couple of shots before Rangers' second but the midfielder did deliver the free-kick for Considine's goal. Captain Lee Wallace fired wide in the hosts' best first-half advance and it was the composure of Miller that finally broke the deadlock. Moments after Stockley's miss, 36-year-old striker Miller, deployed in midfield, latched on to Joe Garner's speculative cross and finished first time. Barrie McKay had the vision to find Hodson inside the box amid a spell of pressure and the Northern Ireland international lashed a shot into the roof of the net for Rangers' second, having started ahead of regular right-back James Tavernier. McKay's replacement Harry Forrester forced a save from Joe Lewis as the pressure continued. Defender Hill had earlier escaped unpunished following a risky challenge on Shinnie inside his own box but bookings for fouls on Maddison resulted in the 38-year-old's dismissal. Jack, 24, followed Hill up the tunnel after being cautioned in the wake of a lengthy spell of pushing following a Rangers foul, the Dons skipper having earlier been booked for impeding Michael O'Halloran. And there were further bookings in stoppage time to take the tally to 11. Rangers' Mark Warburton: "The players were more than irked by comments made about them, by comments questioning their battling qualities and their desire. "But they responded really well, there was a lot of nonsense written about them and they more than answered those questions. "First half nobody really controlled the game, it was pretty neutral. But, second half, we stepped on and won second balls and I felt we deserved to win." Aberdeen's Derek McInnes: "From penalty box to penalty box I thought we were the better team. "We really got after Rangers, we pressed them high, we were competitive, we were winning tackles, we were fully committed. I thought we really frustrated them. "But we said to the players at half-time, it was important in the final third to carry more of a threat ourselves,. We got in good areas and rushed that last wee bit. "We had more opportunities to apply pressure with the ball rather than just without the ball, and Rangers scored when we were having our best spell. "We started the second half really on the front foot, got into good areas, still should be doing more with it, but Jayden's is clearly the one we all remember.

The cyclone did not follow the course it was expected to take, and hit populated areas. It has destroyed schools and medical clinics, and thousands of homes.	Thousands of people are homeless after a powerful cyclone hit the islands of Vanuatu on Saturday.
James, 29, who presents the drive-time show, studied drama and had a number of shows on the students' union radio station before rising to fame. The DJ, who is covering Radio 1's Big Weekend in Norwich this bank holiday, said he was "completely honoured". Father Ted co-writer Graham Linehan and broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray are also receiving degrees. James said: "My affair with UEA continues - it really is wonderful and I'm completely honoured to be given this. "I spent a very happy three years there and it's the place where I fell in love with drama and radio, so it's very special to me. "As soon as the ceremony is over, I'll set about officially changing my name on all credit cards, mortgage documents and, most importantly, the Radio 1 website." James and Linehan will receive an Honorary Doctorate of Letters at a ceremony in Norwich in July, with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour presenter Murray being given an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law. Other names being recognised for their distinguished careers include comedian Arthur Smith, author Erica Wagner, actor Samuel West and the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James.	BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James is to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of East Anglia (UEA).
Roslyn Condie, of Mossdale, near Castle Douglas, admitted being the owner of a dog which was dangerously out of control last September. A court heard how her Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Nipper, bit the postman on the leg leaving a puncture wound. Sentence was deferred on Condie for six months. Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how the incident happened while the postman was delivering mail in the village of Mossdale. Local residents gave him first aid and he later had medical treatment for the bite. Fiscal depute Jennifer McGill said there was concern in the area over the dog which had on occasion escaped from the garden of its home. A solicitor for Condie said she had had the dog since it was a puppy and it was very affectionate. She now kept it muzzled when taken out and the garden fences had been made escape proof. Sheriff Brian Mohan handed out the warning that a second bite would bring destruction and deferred sentence on Condie stressing that she should keep the dog under control with appropriate measures.	A sheriff has warned the owner of a dog which bit a postman delivering the mail that her pet will be destroyed if it bites someone again.
Police said a boy on the bank saw his father's boat capsize on the River Wey in Guildford at about 13:10 BST on Monday. Insp Claire Sutherland said the boy jumped into the fast-flowing river to try to save him but members of the public shouted to come back. Divers are trawling the river in Millmead. Members of the public have been urged not to go into the water if they spot the missing kayaker, but to call 999 immediately. A flood warning is in place for parts of the River Wey, following heavy rain and storms over the weekend. A police helicopter, firefighters and ambulance crews were all at the scene on Monday. The river from Millmead to Stoke Lock is a popular with kayakers. Wey Valley Kayak Club, which has about 400 members, is situated about about one mile down river from where the man capsized. It tweeted on Monday morning the Wey from Godalming Wharf to Thames Lock was not safe.	A search has resumed for a man missing after his kayak overturned on a river in Surrey.
While the site has remained quiet about its canary's demise, it has hosted a discussion on the subject by a group of lawyers. A warrant canary is a statement saying a company has not received secret requests for user data by government or law enforcement officers. It is named after the birds that were taken down mineshafts to alert workers to toxic gases. If the canary died in the mine the workers knew they had to leave quickly. Similarly, the existence of a warrant canary on a website indicates the "all clear". When it disappears, visitors might assume the website has received classified requests for data. Many websites publish a warrant canary in an effort to be transparent with visitors. The concept gained popularity after the extent of US government surveillance was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden. In the US, law enforcement can issue requests for user data that come with a gagging order, preventing the demand from being disclosed. Demands known as national security letters are designed to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct an investigation without interference or alerting the target. But critics say the confidential nature of national security letters, which can be issued without a court order, makes them ripe for abuse by law enforcement. Reddit, Adobe and Tumblr are among the sites that have published warrant canaries. The disappearance of a warrant canary usually only reveals that a website has received at least one secret surveillance request. They are often written in broad terms, as their legality has not been tested in court. "The more practically useful and informative they are, the more legally risky they are too," said Brett Max Kaufman, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Before it was killed, Reddit's warrant canary said: "Reddit has never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information." One Reddit member asked whether websites could print an individual warrant canary on every member's profile, making it immediately obvious when a specific user had been targeted by a secret request. "The government would have a pretty strong argument in that case that the removal of the individual's canary was simply an end-run around the gag order, and that it would jeopardise the government interests in completing its investigation without interference," said Mr Kaufman. "That's not to say an individualised canary could never be lawful." While the disappearance of a warrant canary could indicate that a company has received a classified data request, it remains possible that Reddit removed the canary to avoid a future fight over its legality. "I strongly suspect it is the first," said Alex Abdo of the ACLU. "Unless they received a national security request, nothing else would have changed between the 2014 transparency report and now. "If they abandoned it for the second reason, Reddit likely would not have issued the very cryptic statement that they could not comment on the disappearance of the canary." Reddit did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. One Reddit member questioned whether the government could force a website to falsely keep its warrant canary online, disguising the existence of a national security letter. "If the government asked a company to leave its warrant canary up (and therefore communicate something false to the public), the company would have the right to challenge any gag (under the First Amendment... or under certain provisions of the USA Freedom Act) in court," said Mr Kaufman. "But if a court upheld the government's request... the public would be none the wiser, at least for some time. "Indeed, that would be the entire objective from the government's perspective." When asked whether the disappearance of Reddit's canary was a cause for alarm, Mr Abdo said it was "difficult to know". "It's possible that the request was very targeted and in pursuit of someone we would all agree should be investigated," he said. "But we don't know the facts at this point, and we don't even know which legal authority the government was relying on. "And we might not know either of those things for a long time."	In March, online community Reddit killed its "warrant canary" - a statement on its website declaring that it had not received any secret data snooping requests from government or law enforcement agencies.
Net income fell to $3.11bn (Â£2.03bn) compared with a year ago for the personal computer giant. As its PC business continued to slow, the firm had relied on sales of its chips that go in data servers. But the firm said demand for its server-chips was slowing. However, Intel said its latest quarterly numbers were largely in line with expectations and that the results were "solid". "We executed well in the third quarter and delivered solid results in a challenging economic environment," said Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich. The US-based firm also noted the introduction of its "breakthrough 3D XPoint technology, the industry's first new memory category in more than two decades." Reports have said that Intel's bid to buy Altera Corp for $6.7bn in an attempt to expand parts of its chip business could be given the go-ahead from the EU as soon as this week. The deal had been cleared by the US Department of Justice, but there were several antitrust issues surrounding it. Intel hoped that its buy-up of Altera would help boost its higher-margin chip business, particularly for data-servers - and help it focus on chips for cars and watches, among other devices. In a report released in line with its latest quarterly results, the firm said its outlook for the fourth quarter "does not include the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other significant transactions that may be completed after OctoberÂ 13."	The world's biggest chipmaker, Intel, reported a 6% fall in net income for the three months to September and cut its fourth quarter outlook for its important server-chip business.
One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were "ready to fight" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened "severe disciplinary sanctions" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011. Many of the mutineers in January were thought to be former rebels who joined the army after the conflict.	Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues.
Anne Marie Waters, a former Labour activist and founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, has previously called Islam "evil". Her leadership bid has split the party, with some MEPs threatening to quit if she was allowed into the race. But the UKIP National Executive Committee, which vets all would-be candidates, has allowed her to stand. The other candidates to replace Paul Nuttall - who stood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election - are: Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay on the 29th and 30th of September. Ms Waters's leadership bid was backed by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson and she has previously been blocked from standing as a UKIP election candidate. James Carver, UKIP West Midlands MEP, said he "sincerely hoped" Ms Waters did not win - but added that she should be allowed to stand. He said: "Her train of thought, I think is going about it the wrong way... there are many British Muslims in this country and that is a good thing." The party's former leader, Paul Nuttall, has previously said her views made him "uncomfortable". Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on the burka, the closure of all sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will strike a chord with many voters. She has argued that UKIP could regain support if it had the "guts" to be "honest about Islam" and challenge the view that it had "nothing to do" with jihadist violence. Last month, former leader Nigel Farage told BBC's Sunday Politics that "if UKIP goes down the route of being a party that is anti the religion of Islam, then frankly it's finished".	An anti-Islam candidate has been allowed to stand for the UKIP leadership.
The UN has said media restrictions and violence meant the environment was not conducive to free, credible elections. Unrest started in April after President Pierre Nkurunziza said he would run for a third term - something protesters say is illegal. The president says he is entitled to a third term because he was appointed for his first term, not elected. The presidential election is scheduled for 15 July. East African leaders have called for a further two-week delay. Africa news highlights: 7 July The electoral commission spokesman told the BBC turnout for the parliamentary poll had been low in the districts of Bujumbura where there had been protests, but that in some provinces outside the capital it was as high as 98%. The ruling party - the CNDD FDD - was ahead in every province of the country, Burundi's electoral commission announced. They won 77 out of 100 elected seats in parliament, AFP news agency says. The BBC's Maud Jullien says all of the country's private broadcasters have closed in recent months, and many civil society leaders have left the country claiming their lives were under threat.

The 33-year-old American, who has served two doping bans, recorded a time of 19.57 seconds in Oregon. It bettered the 19.68 secs he ran in May which, at that stage, was the best in the world. "I wanted to go out and make a statement, and that's what I did," Gatlin said. Gatlin has been the dominant sprinter in 2015, having also achieved the quickest time in the 100m (9.74 secs). He will go up against 100m and 200m world-record holder Usain Bolt in both events at August's World Championships in Beijing. In a race run in a legal wind of 0.4 metres per second, Gatlin finished ahead of Isiah Young (19.93 secs) and Wallace Spearmon (20.10 secs) to record the joint-11th quickest 200m in history.	Justin Gatlin became the fifth-fastest 200m runner in history as he won Sunday's final at the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships.
The US firm has struggled with hefty losses that have thrown its Japanese parent into a crisis, putting the conglomerate's future at risk. Westinghouse has suffered huge cost overruns at two US projects in Georgia and South Carolina. Toshiba said the bankruptcy would not affect Westinghouse's UK operation, which employs more than 1,000 workers. However, the firm warned that the writedown of its US nuclear business could see Toshiba's total losses last year exceed 1 trillion yen ($9.1bn; £7.3bn), almost triple its previous estimate. The Japanese government confirmed on Wednesday that it was aware of Toshiba's plans. Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa said the move was aimed at "shutting out risks from the overseas nuclear business." "We want to make this our first step toward recovering our solid business," he said. Toshiba initially alerted investors in December 2016 that it faced heavy losses linked to a deal done by Westinghouse. Assets that it took on are likely to be worth less than initially thought and there is also a dispute about payments that are due. As a consequence, Toshiba initially hoped to sell its majority stake in Westinghouse. The Japanese company was also twice given permission to delay reporting its earnings until 11 April. The nuclear services business brings in about one-third of the industrial giant's revenue. Toshiba says it expects a 712.5bn-yen ($6.3bn; £5bn) writedown because some of its US nuclear assets were worth far less than estimated. A Westinghouse bankruptcy filing should help limit future losses for Toshiba. The difficulties at Westinghouse have sent Toshiba shares into freefall, losing more than 50% since the company first unveiled the problems in December 2016. In February, the company's chairman stepped down and the firm delayed publishing its results over disagreements with its auditors. The financial problems have some analysts speculating over whether the Japanese conglomerate can even survive the crisis, as it will probably be forced to sell many of its premium segments, such as the lucrative memory chip unit. So while a Westinghouse bankruptcy might stop things from getting even worse for Toshiba, it is still not clear whether the struggling giant will manage to find its feet in time. The Japanese government is unlikely to allow Toshiba to collapse, given its large workforce and its importance to the nuclear industry, said Amir Anvarzadeh, an analyst at BGC Partners. But with its nuclear problems, "the question is whether the rest of the business will be big enough to service its debt," he said. Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business reporter Westinghouse is long established engineering company which constructed the United States' first commercial nuclear reactor in the 1950s. It still provides technology for nuclear power stations around the world. However, massive cost over-runs at power station projects in South Carolina and Georgia, as well as heavy losses linked to the takeover of another nuclear business in 2015, have brought it to the brink of collapse. The bankruptcy filing will allow the company to continue operating while it renegotiates contracts and holds talks with its creditors. Toshiba said that only Westinghouse's US operations would be affected by the bankruptcy. Its European business, including the UK, as well as its Asian, Middle East and African operations would see no impact, helped by the firm securing $800m (£650m) of extra financing, Toshiba said. However, the bankruptcy could still have far-reaching consequences for the UK's future nuclear plans. Toshiba has a 60% stake in NuGen, a joint venture with France's Engie, which has the contract to build a new nuclear power plant in Cumbria in the UK. As part of Toshiba, Westinghouse was due to build the reactors for the new plant. A collapse of the firm could delay the project or even put its future in limbo. It is estimated that the Moorside plant would eventually provide as much as 7% of the UK's energy needs. NuGen said in a statement that it "will continue in a 'business as usual' manner" to get permits and licences for the project, and "will continue to increase value and attractiveness of the project to potential future investors". It added that it "cannot comment on specific financial issues relating directly to Toshiba or Westinghouse". Last month, Toshiba said it would continue to work on the development of Moorside, but would not be involved in its construction. A Toshiba spokeswoman said on Wednesday that it was "assessing the feasibility of the project, but at the moment, nothing is decided". Toshiba said: "The Chapter 11 filings have made planned supply of the AP1000 [nuclear reactors] for the UK project uncertain, and we have therefore recorded an impairment loss covering the cost of the NuGen project. "However, if you consider the project in terms of the overall power generation business, there is no change in the business climate."	Westinghouse, Toshiba's US nuclear unit, has filed for US bankruptcy protection.

The company's management team says the internet means that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. Playboy's circulation has fallen dramatically from its peak in the mid-1970s. We have been asking what you think of this change; on Twitter, on Facebook and on our story. Many of you think it is a most welcome move and might even help encourage a more respectful portrayal of women in the media. Others think it is simply a smart marketing choice. Some, rather wistfully, see it as the "end of an era". Other people say that without the nudity, it is the beginning of the end of Playboy. However, many others are pointing out that if you want to see naked people, you can just go online. As Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders put it: "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free." Quite. Maybe there is a bigger problem. Is the magazine itself outdated as a form of media? Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000. Finally, some people are simply very happy that a certain well-known trope will now be true.	Playboy magazine has announced it is to stop publishing pictures of fully naked women.
The Premier League got under way this weekend, with many teams showing off their new signings, but who impressed and who had a debut to forget? From scoring a wonder goal to being booked after barely a minute on the pitch, BBC Sport takes a look at how some of those making their top-flight bow got on. Dimitri Payet, signed by West Ham from Marseille in the summer, created more chances than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season and he certainly added a creative edge to the Hammers' attack in Sunday's shock 2-0 win at Arsenal. The 28-year-old took the free-kick that caught out Petr Cech and allowed Cheikhou Kouyate to head home the opener, and was a lively presence throughout. Newcastle's signing of Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum from PSV was certainly one of the more impressive captures of the summer, and the 24-year-old made a strong impression on his Premier League debut. Wijnaldum headed Newcastle ahead against Southampton on Sunday, but the hosts could not hold on as the Saints fought back to earn a 2-2 draw. There were plenty of reasons to be impressed with Swansea's performance as they held defending champions Chelsea to a 2-2 draw, and Andre Ayew was one of them. The Ghana forward showed cat-like instincts to pull a rebound from a Thibaut Courtois save to catch out John Terry, before calmly steering the ball home for one the opening weekend's best goals. The same could not be said for Andre's younger brother, however. Jordan Ayew started for Aston Villa at Premier League new boys Bournemouth, but the former Lorient striker failed to make an impression and was substituted on the hour. His replacement, Rudy Gestede, instead caught the eye as he grabbed the Villa winner. With fellow debutant Wijnaldum impressing, Aleksander Mitrovic was evidently keen to make an impression when he climbed off the bench in the 75th minute. Sadly, it was not the kind of impression he would have liked as, less than a minute after coming on, he was booked for a foul on Matt Targett. Youthful naivety from the 20-year-old. Exciting, fast and skilful. Memphis Depay certainly looked like a signing that will get Manchester United fans on their feet, but what his Premier League debut performance lacked was a goal threat. The 21-year-old Netherlands winger had a couple of half chances, but never really looked like troubling Michel Vorm in the Tottenham goal during Saturday's 1-0 win for Louis van Gaal's side.	New season, new faces.
It will sell investments worth £12m in firms where more than 10% of revenue comes from extracting thermal coal or the production of oil from tar sands. The Church said it had a "moral responsibility" to act on environmental issues to protect the poor, who were the most vulnerable to climate change. The Church manages three investment funds worth about £8bn. "Climate change is already a reality," said Rev Canon Professor Richard Burridge, deputy chair of the Church's Ethical Investment Advisory Group (EIAG). "The Church has a moral responsibility to speak and act on both environmental stewardship and justice for the world's poor who are most vulnerable to climate change," he said. "This responsibility encompasses not only the Church's own work to reduce our own carbon footprint, but also how the Church's money is invested and how we engage with companies on this vital issue." Analysis: Helen Briggs, environment correspondent With the global campaign to move money out of fossil fuels gaining momentum, the Church of England's commitment to divest for the first time from the most polluting forms of energy is being seen as a significant step. The church joins several UK institutions that have already signed up to the movement, including Glasgow University and the British Medical Association. But for some, the announcement does not go far enough. The Church of England says it will withdraw investments worth £12m from companies that make money from extracting thermal coal - used in generating electricity - or producing oil from tar sands. This is but a fraction of its total investment portfolio and some are already calling for the church to go further by divesting from all fossil fuels. But the church takes the view that engaging with fossil fuel companies is productive for other forms of energy, such as oil and gas, which may be needed as the world moves towards a low-carbon economy. The new policy "marks the start of a process of divestment as well as engagement with fossil fuel companies and better aligns the Church's investment practice with its belief, theology and practice", added Bishop Nick Holtam, who is the Church of England's lead bishop on environment. The Church said it also wanted more intensive engagement with companies that made a significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. It recently filed shareholder resolutions at BP and Shell calling for more transparency over climate change. Christian Aid's director of policy and public affairs, Christine Allen, said the policy ought to prompt energy firms to rethink their businesses: "The openness to further divestment from intransigent companies must be heard as a final warning to the energy industry: shift investment out of fossil fuels and into renewables or your investors will do so for you. "Every pound divested by churches, public institutions or individuals is a sign that we are serious." The Church of England does not directly invest in tobacco, pornography or payday lenders. Two years ago, it emerged that the Church had indirectly invested in Wonga - which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, admitted to being "embarrassed and irritated" about. It has since ended that investment.	The Church of England is adopting a new climate change policy and will cut its investments in fossil fuel companies.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 28-year-old, who won Olympic bronze in 2012, cleared 2.33m to finish second behind Italian Gianmarco Tamberi. Team captain Asha Philip was fifth in the women's 60m but Dina Asher-Smith suffered a minor hamstring injury in her semi-final and missed the final. And Lynsey Sharp and Adelle Tracey both failed to reach the 800m final. Sharp, the European and Commonwealth silver medallist, finished second in her heat, but her time of two minutes, 02.75 seconds was not quick enough to progress as a fastest loser. "Even though it may not look like it was a success, to me it was because I've learned a lot," said the Scot. In May 2014, Grabarz questioned his future in the sport after a knee operation left him jumping, in his words, "like a 16-year-old girl" and that failing to clear 1.80m on his return to training was "the most depressing day of his life". However, a first-time clearance of 2.33m saw him beat Erik Kynard, the man who won silver at the London Olympics, on countback. "I'm ecstatic, I just can't quite believe it," he said after winning Britain's third medal of the Championships. "If someone said I'd get that result two years ago I wouldn't have believed it, I would have bitten their hand off." Media playback is not supported on this device American Barbara Pierre won the women's 60m title in 7.02secs - 0.02 ahead of Dutch favourite Dafne Schippers. Philip crossed the line in 7.14 seconds to miss out on a medal. "I'm gutted," she said. "I came here for a medal, I wanted a medal. I came fifth and I didn't run a personal best or a season's best." Asher-Smith's withdrawal from the final was a precautionary move, given the Rio Olympics are only five months away. American Ashton Eaton won his third successive heptathlon title to add to the pentathlon title won by his Canadian wife Brianne Theisen-Eaton the day before. It makes them the first married couple to win gold medals at the same world championships. "I was thinking it doesn't matter what happens to me," said Eaton, who was born and lives in Portland. "Brianne is the one that stole the show. I am really happy about that and proud of her," he added of his wife, who finally ended a frustrating run of second-place finishes at major championships. Eaton's winning total of 6,470 points in the seven-event competition was 188 clear of nearest rival Oleksiy Kasyanov of Ukraine. Meanwhile, in a meeting in Slovakia, Tom Bosworth broke the 20km walk British record, finishing in one hour 20 minutes and 41 seconds. The 26-year-old Briton took one minute 22 seconds off the previous best, set by Ian McCombie in 1988.	Robbie Grabarz won high jump silver on another otherwise disappointing day for British athletes at the World Indoor Championships in Portland.

Even with the usual caveats attached to opinion polls, a 65% to 17% majority for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK suggests little room for doubt. The British and Irish governments have both made it clear they don't think now is the time to hold a border poll. Sinn Fein are campaigning for a poll and the DUP have discussed, in their words, calling Sinn Fein's bluff. But after weeks of controversy about flags and national identity, politicians' claims about Catholic unionism, and a census showing a growing number identifying themselves as Northern Irish, what lies behind that headline figure in the Spotlight opinion poll is particularly revealing. Not surprisingly, more than 90% of those who identify themselves as Protestants told the pollsters they wanted to stay in the UK. But on the other side of the religious divide, a substantial 38% of Catholics also favoured remaining within the UK - three percentage points more than the number who backed a united Ireland. While only 5% of Protestants don't intend to vote or haven't decided which option they would pick, more than a quarter of Catholics are either undecided or not planning on voting. As avowed believers in a united Ireland and the party running a border poll campaign, Sinn Fein might be surprised to learn that nearly a quarter of those who identified themselves as Sinn Fein voters - 23% - told the pollsters they would back the status quo in a border poll. More than half of SDLP supporters - 56% - also said they would opt to stay in the UK if a poll was held tomorrow. Prime Minister David Cameron said the survey for the BBC Spotlight programme on the potential outcome of a border poll should lift the spirits of all those who value Northern Ireland's place within the union. The results of the 2011 census, released in December last year, revealed that just over a fifth of the population considers itself "Northern Irish". That posed a political puzzle - in a border poll would these people tick a British or an Irish box? Well, those who identified themselves as "Northern Irish" for the BBC Spotlight poll back staying in the UK by a significant margin - 72% to just 7%. At the DUP conference late last year Peter Robinson hinted that his party hopes to make inroads into Catholic unionist territory. Since then commentators have expressed the view that the union flag dispute and the ensuing protests make this a pipe dream. The Spotlight survey suggests the main parties have a long way to go to reach across the religious divide. Those identifying themselves as DUP supporters are 97% Protestant, while UUP supporters are 99% Protestant. Those backing Sinn Fein are 99% Catholic, while SDLP supporters are 92% Catholic. Alliance, as an identifiably centre ground party, is the one bucking the trend - with 51% Protestant backing and 36% Catholic support. Alliance's support for a "designated days" flag flying policy at Belfast City Hall stirred controversy and led to attacks on the party's offices and a death threat against its only MP, Naomi Long. However the Spotlight poll suggests raising the flag on 18 designated days is the most popular compromise across the community as a whole. Of those interviewed, 44% backed the designated days policy, in comparison to 35% wanting the union flag raised throughout the year. A further 10% told the pollsters no flag should be flown at the City Hall, while only 2% opted for the union flag flying alongside the Irish tricolour. Although designated days was the most popular option, flag flying polarises unionists and nationalists. 73% of unionists want the union flag up at Belfast City Hall 365 days a year, while 64% of nationalists support the 18 day policy. Even though the designated days compromise got more support than any other option, just over half of those interviewed thought the union flag protestors were right to take to the streets when Belfast City Council made its decision in early December. This result may reflect some people's belief in the right to protest, even if they don't back the aim of a particular demonstration. However this support appears to have dwindled sharply during the course of January, as by the time the Spotlight survey was carried out more than three quarters of interviewees wanted the protests to stop. They told the pollsters this was for a variety of reasons, the main ones being the violence sparked by some protests and the disruptive impact on business. Although the Stormont politicians might take heart from this shift of opinion, the protest organisers will point to the fact that by late January 45% of unionists still believed the demonstrations should continue. This shows a degree of resilience given the barrage of negative publicity generated by the protests. The poll was carried out for the BBC Spotlight programme by Ipsos Mori, whose researchers interviewed more than 1000 adults at 64 locations across Northern Ireland between 17 and 26 January. The full details are available as a pdf, 897kb in size. They include findings on how people rated individual politicians' handling of the flags crisis, which parties those interviewed support and whether those surveyed believe the Stormont system favours one community over another.	A BBC Spotlight poll strongly indicates voters in Northern Ireland would reject a united Ireland in a border poll.
Avon's Parisian office says only current orders will be guaranteed and it is unsure if its self-employed representatives will be able to get supplies after the end of October. Avon has been in France for almost 50 years. It employs about 120 staff in Paris, supporting 11,000 representatives who visit customers in their own homes. Angry workers in France have accused Avon of keeping them in the dark for months and not acting in line with Avon's publically stated values of being a socially responsible company that upholds values of trust, respect and integrity and a culture of "open and candid communication". Estelle Croissant, an Avon employee responsible for supporting the direct selling representatives, told the BBC that a workers' council representing Avon staff in France was challenging the company for not following the correct redundancy process. "They have not respected all the processes according to their own rules and values," she said. "We now know an administrator has been in place since May this year, but no scheme to assist the workers is yet in place. We just feel abandoned. "We knew that the business was not good, but we have all been very committed and worked relentlessly over many months to help the company to try and become profitable." Further meetings are taking place between workers' representatives and the management. Avon is one of the world's largest beauty companies and sells most of its products through direct selling by self-employed representatives who visit customers in their homes. The US parent company has been through a string of reorganisations and management changes. Two years ago, it turned down a takeover offer from rival cosmetic company Coty. Asked by the BBC about events at its French subsidiary, a spokesman for the parent company refused to make any comment or even confirm the closure was taking place.	The French operations of the US cosmetics giant Avon Products are to be closed by the end of the month.
25 February 2016 Last updated at 10:01 GMT Having undergone significant restoration, it will make its first journey in ten years along the East Coast mainline. The steam engine was initially built in Doncaster, but took its name from the Edinburgh to London service on which it ran. After the last original locomotive class member was withdrawn in 1966, the train toured the world, becoming an icon of British engineering.

Imagine a situation where most people with a common condition are undiagnosed and where opportunities are repeatedly missed to identify the problem and to offer good care. What is this condition? It's dying. Each year, an estimated 92,000 people in England are believed to need end of life care but not receive it. As a practising GP I have seen distressed relatives after a patient has died in hospital. Often they have not had a chance to see their relative before they died and were unaware of the seriousness of the condition, despite repeated admissions with deteriorating conditions. Many such patients are never formally identified as at risk of dying and not assessed for end of life care. One relative said something that haunts me to this day: "I wish the doctors had told me that my mother was dying." As a result too many people still die in distress with uncontrolled symptoms, or have futile interventions when this will not make any difference. All of us, including doctors, must do more to talk about dying. A new ComRes research for the Dying Matters Coalition confirms there is a widespread reluctance to talk about dying and death. That is why we want to encourage people to talk more openly about dying and bereavement and to make plans around end-of-life care. Most people have not made a plan of their choices and wishes in the event of a serious illness. People often think there is plenty of time when the situation arises but often this is not the case and it can be too late. Doctors are trained to cure, but as people live with long-term conditions, the medical profession needs to change how it works with dying patients. We need to bring dying back into people's homes, rather than in hospital, care homes or hospices. As increasing numbers of people develop and live with dementia, it is vital that doctors talk about the kind of end-of-life care people would choose, while people are healthy. There's a huge change required in our culture, starting with the medical profession. Having learnt a lot from the Canadian communications expert Prof Stephen Workman, I would urge doctors to do three things. First, be compassionate but direct when talking about dying. Doctors speaking to relatives about an ill patient who is giving cause for concern, should not just say "your husband is seriously ill", but should add "It is possible that he could die". This allows all involved to prepare. Secondly, be honest and don't offer false hope. Think twice about offering a false choice of procedures like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) when someone is actually dying and chances of recovery are minuscule. Instead offer supportive care to keep the patient comfortable and allow them to die a natural dignified death. And, thirdly, when doctors diagnose a serious illness they should ask the patient whether they would like to talk about what they can expect and what is likely to happen. Most people die from frailty in old age, and will be well known to health and social care services. Importantly, this gives opportunities for talking about end of life wishes and advance care planning. My ambition is to reduce the fear of dying and increase knowledge and awareness of palliative care. It is vitally important that every person who is coming to the end of their life is spotted early enough and supported to make a good advance care plan. I know just how hard it is to address issues like this in the frenzy of busy surgeries and wards. But we as doctors need to up our game. All of us, especially doctors can play a part in ensuring everyone is able to have a good death.	In this week's Scrubbing Up opinion column, Prof Mayur Lakhani chair of the Dying Matters Coalition, urges doctors to be more open and frank about preparing patients and their families for the end of life.

The "deplorable" conditions violated a ban on cruel and unusual punishment in the US Constitution, its report said. Jail officials, it said, had failed to address a "dramatic increase" in suicides over the past two years. But the sheriff's office said it was "disappointed" the report "fails to fully recognise" improvements made. "The report also mischaracterises and significantly understates the incredible efforts made to improve our suicide prevention practices," the sheriff's office said in statement. The US justice department said the nation's largest jail system - with about 19,000 prisoners - had completed some of the reforms required by a 2002 court agreement. It also applauded steps to expand community supervision programmes, saying a rapid increase in the number of prisoners who are seriously mentally ill was putting the system under strain. But it said "serious systemic deficiencies" and "deplorable environmental conditions" remained for those being held at the jail, violating the US constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Among the criticisms in the report was a lack of response to an increase in suicides and suicide attempts at county jails. "Fifteen suicides in 25 months produced almost no discernible change in the jails' custodial practices," the report said. Other findings include: The sheriff's office said it remains committed to working with the Justice Department on the issues. Jails in the US are generally for people being locked up in the short-term, but the prison system throughout the state of California, where inmates serve longer sentences, has also come under scrutiny for overcrowding.	The condition of mental healthcare inside Los Angeles County jails is so poor that it is unconstitutional, the US justice department has said.
It said it plans to replace them with less obtrusive surveillance. However Muslim leaders have called on worshippers to continue boycotting the sacred compound for now. There were deadly clashes after the metal detectors were set up, which Palestinians saw as an Israeli attempt to assert control over the site. Israel said they were necessary to prevent weapons being smuggled in. It followed the killing on 14 July of two Israeli policemen by Israeli-Arab gunmen, who police say had hidden their weapons on the hilltop site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as Haram al-Sharif. The Israeli prime minister's office said the state security bodies had recommended replacing the metal detectors with "advanced technologies and other means". It said the new, unspecified, measures, costing 100m shekels ($28m; Â£21m), would be put in place over the next six months. Until then, extra police would be deployed around the site, it added. However, the Muslim body which oversees the holy compound, the Waqf, called on worshippers to stay away from the site until it advised otherwise. Many Palestinians had been refusing to visit the complex as long as the metal detectors were there, holding prayers in the street outside the Old City instead. Tom Bateman, BBC Jerusalem correspondent The crisis at this revered site was about much more than the existence of the airport-style gates and electronics of the metal detectors themselves. For Palestinians, their installation symbolised what they saw as an attempt by Israel to assert further control over the site of their holy shrine in occupied East Jerusalem - the mosque that also acts as a powerful symbol of their national aspiration. For Israel's government, the move represented the need to secure what one minister called "the most sensitive location on Earth" - Judaism's most holy place - after the murder of two Israeli police officers close by. Leaders will have felt pressure from within their own constituencies not to be seen to back down. International calls for a solution have added to the pressure on both sides - which were dealing with complex internal politics too - but it is still not clear this crisis has been entirely resolved. The installation of the metal detectors the day after the police were killed drew angry protests from Palestinians and days of clashes with Israeli security forces. The violence left four Palestinians dead in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, while three Israeli civilians were stabbed to death by a Palestinian who had said he was avenging Israeli measures at the holy site. On Monday the UN's Middle East envoy warned of "potential catastrophic costs" even beyond the region if the issue was not resolved by Friday, when Muslims traditionally flock to the site for prayers. There is speculation that Israel agreed to remove the metal detectors in return for Jordan letting Israeli embassy staff leave the country following a diplomatic stand-off. Jordanian authorities wanted to question an Israeli security guard who Israel said shot dead a Jordanian who had attacked him with a screwdriver in a residence next to the embassy. A second Jordanian who died was inadvertently killed by the gunfire, Israel said. Israel said the guard had diplomatic immunity and both he and all the staff were confined to the embassy compound amid attempts to find a solution. In a phone call on Monday night, Jordan's King Abdullah and Mr Netanyahu discussed the crisis surrounding the holy site and the incident at the embassy. The king called on Mr Netanyahu to remove the metal detectors. At around the same time, it was announced that the embassy staff had returned to Israel. Jordan, which has a large Palestinian population, has an historical role as custodian of the Jerusalem holy site. Mr Netanyahu's office said the embassy staff's return "was made possible thanks to... tight co-operation" with Jordan. The Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem's Old City is sacred to both Jews and Muslims. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and holiest site in Judaism. It is also the al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The area, in East Jerusalem, has been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Middle East war. The site is hugely politically sensitive and has been subject to a delicate set of arrangements - commonly referred to as the "status quo" - governing access, security and administration, for the past 50 years. Under the arrangement, Israel is responsible for security and a Jordanian-funded religious trust, or Waqf, looks after the day-to-day running of the site. Palestinians said the placing of the metal detectors upset the status quo, which Israel has repeatedly pledged to maintain. Israel said Palestinians were using the issue as a pretext to spread hostility against the Jewish state.	Israel has removed metal detectors from outside a holy site in East Jerusalem after uproar from Palestinians over their recent introduction.
Curle led the Cumbrians to the League Two play-offs this season, where defeat by Exeter ended their promotion hopes. He has a year to run on his current deal and will meet with the board to discuss the ongoing plans next week. "I need to show a level of commitment," Curle, 53, told BBC Radio Cumbria. "But this is my career, if the football club can't match my ambition then sometimes you've got to say 'Thank you, I've enjoyed my time, but it's time to move on'. "It's an opportunity for the club to tell me what the plan is, short, medium and long-term - what are the aspirations? If we get an opportunity to get investment towards the football side, I think I will spend it well. "If the football club says 'We like what you're doing, bought into what you're doing we're going to try to improve certain situations at the club, this is our plan and structure' then, excellent. "If not, I've got a year on my contract and after June I go into my notice period, which isn't good for me or the club. "I've got a fantastic relationship with the key stakeholders, the backing they've given me I'm proud of because it shows there's a relationship there we need to maintain and improve." Under Curle, Carlisle have gone from battling at the wrong end of League Two to challenging for a return to the third tier for the first time since relegation in 2013-14. "I don't want to walk away. But I want to be able to compete, there has to be a plan in place," Curle added. "If there's no plan, eventually it catches up with you and the good work you're trying to do is diluted. "I need people still to buy into it, we need to steer money towards the first team, towards what Carlisle United is representative of." Defeat at St James Park was a cruel one for the Cumbrians, as a 95th minute injury-time goal from Jack Stacey took Exeter to Wembley, 6-5 on aggregate. "The players have represented myself, the football club and the supporters extremely well," Curle said. "We aim to finish top of the league next season. We won't have the biggest budget - there's a misconception that we are one of the high-fliers in this division. "Our budget is in comparison to teams between 12-16th in the division, we're competing with teams that have fantastic budgets and location in their favour. "But the players we have brought in have good character and ability and they give me everything."	Manager Keith Curle wants to continue the job he has started at Carlisle United beyond his current contract, but wants assurances he will be backed by the club's board going forward.
A blogger posted screenshots suggesting a Carmarthenshire councillor shared a Facebook post by a far-right group. The post said: "When a dog attacks a child it is put down. Shouldn't we do the same with sex predators?" Tegwen Devichand said she did not remember sharing the post and opposed the death penalty. Ms Devichand, who is Labour deputy group leader at Carmarthenshire council, said: "I couldn't put a horse down, let alone a human being." The post which Ms Devichand appears to have shared was initially posted by far-right group Britain First. Ms Devichand opposes plans to remove English-stream education at Ysgol Llangennech which were approved by Carmarthenshire council in January. "People should have choice, it shouldn't be forced on them," she said. The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". Plaid Cymru has accused Labour members of working with UKIP to undermine the council's decision. She also said Labour had not contacted her about the matter and she had not been told the party was investigating. Ms Devichand said she was complaining to the police about a "hate campaign" against her. On Sunday Labour said a different member connected to the row had been suspended. Plaid Cymru Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said over the course of the weekend "we have seen Labour members and an elected councillor exposed for sharing the propaganda of ultra-right groups. "This is in addition to another elected councillor branding Labour's own education policy as 'apartheid'." "Launching an investigation into the Llanelli Labour party is a welcome first step, but the party's head office must take swift and immediate action to stamp this out this type of divisive campaigning." A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature very seriously. The local party in Llanelli have made us aware of complaints and an investigation is under way."	Labour has launched an probe into complaints about members connected to a row over the move to change a primary school to Welsh-medium education.
The 1920s window at St Paul's Church in Grangetown, Cardiff, depicts air, sea and land battles alongside religious images and trench scenes. The church says the masonry around the window must be replaced. Repairs could cost tens of thousands of pounds.	An appeal has been launched to raise money to refurbish one of the largest stained-glass windows in Wales honouring casualties from World War One.
HM Inspectorate of Probation found delays in getting offenders to start their work, and said too many were let off if they did not attend. In one case, an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced. The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report's recommendations. Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or "community payback" - may be given for offences like shoplifting, theft, drug offences, or criminal damage. Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance, decorating or litter-picking in 2014. Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report. The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement. Some of the problems identified were: Seven years ago the government, then led by Gordon Brown, placed an order for 10,000 orange bibs. They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-branded scheme known as "community payback". It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences, involving clearing communal paths and gardens, picking up litter and painting over graffiti, were a "tough" alternative to imprisonment. When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly. The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself. If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved. Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment. They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and "were determined to... desist from future offending". Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that "match the circumstances of the offender". The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a "wasted opportunity". "Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court." He called for "urgent remedial action". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted "much more effective rehabilitation" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not. "It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts. "We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them."	The way that offenders sentenced to unpaid community work in England and Wales are managed and supervised has been criticised by inspectors.
The two-time Australian Open champion, who gave birth to Leo in December, won 6-3 4-6 7-6 (9-7) against Japan's Risa Ozaki at the Mallorca Open. It was the 27-year-old Belarusian's first match since losing at the French Open in June 2016. Azarenka was sixth in the world when she announced her pregnancy last July. She was a game away from defeat when play was suspended on Tuesday because of fading light. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. But she showed her trademark resilience to twice break 74th-ranked Ozaki's serve when they returned on Wednesday, then going on to fight back from 5-3 down in the tie-break. Azarenka was given a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Open, which is scheduled to be her only competitive action before Wimbledon. The former Wimbledon quarter-finalist has used her protected ranking to play at the All England Club in the tournament which starts on 3 July.	Former world number one Victoria Azarenka saved three match points before winning on her comeback from a year out after the birth of her son.
They also rejected a plan to introduce free parking for the first 30 minutes. The changes were proposed by four DUP MLAs, but Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard said their motion was based on "seriously misguided logic". He added that enforcing the 30-minute free parking system would be "extremely resource intensive". However, the assembly did pass a Sinn Féin amendment calling for a review of on-street parking arrangements which Mr Hazzard said he was "minded" to implement. "I'm certainly not opposed to a review of sorts - a strategic review of on-street car parking policy and the direction of travel," the minister told BBC News NI. "What I was opposed to, with the DUP motion, was their pre-determined outcome of any such review, that we would set in stone before we began a massive reduction in penalty fines, I don't think that would be appropriate." The rejected DUP motion was signed by ex-minister Edwin  Poots, and his party colleagues William Humphrey, George Robinson and Alex Easton. They said "greater flexibility" was needed in parking policy to encourage more trade in town and villages. Parking enforcement in Northern Ireland was privatised in 2006. Initially, fines were levied at £60, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight. However, in 2012, Stormont MLAs voted for the penalty to be increased to its current level of £90 - or £45 if it is settled within 14 days. The then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy said at the time that bigger fines would "act as a greater deterrent to those who choose not to park properly". The current minister said "at least two thirds" of people who receive parking tickets pay within two weeks, and therefore pay at the lower rate of £45. "I think, when we look across many states, this is an appropriate amount, "Mr Hazzard added. Last month, a Belfast City Council committee voted to end the council's annual policy of offering free car parking in the city centre in the run-up to Christmas.	MLAs have voted against DUP calls for a significant reduction in the £90 mandatory parking fine during a debate in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The comedian and actor has been married to Malaak Compton-Rock for 19 years. A statement issued through his lawyer confirmed the split: "Chris Rock has filed for divorce from his wife, Malaak. "This is a personal matter and Chris requests privacy as he and Malaak work through this process and focus on their family."

Vickilee Galloway, 37, set her dog on Stacey Findlay after the two women started arguing in February last year. Part of Ms Findlay's ear was torn off. A man was also attacked. Galloway admitted assault by inciting her pet to attack Ms Findlay. Sentence at the High Court in Aberdeen was deferred, and she was remanded in custody. She also pled guilty to being the owner of a dog that was so dangerously out of control that it attacked Brian Pennie. Both victims had parts of their ears missing and needed hospital treatment. Advocate depute Gillian Ross told the court that the incident happened after Galloway fell out with Ms Findlay while drinking in Mr Pennie's flat. She said: "The accused started telling the complainer that her name was not in fact Stacey." Ms Ross said Galloway then told her pet dog Jake to attack the other woman. She told the court: "She used the words 'get her', 'Jake attack', or something similar. "She was bitten on the arm which caused her to fall to the ground. "The dog then started biting and attacking her left ear." Galloway eventually managed to get the dog under control by grabbing his collar after it injured Mr Pennie and an ambulance was called. Galloway sobbed in the dock as Lord Kinclaven remanded her in custody. Sentence was deferred until 5 October at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.	A dog owner has admitted ordering her Staffordshire bull terrier to attack another woman in Peterhead.
Shares in ITV rose 1.3% after the broadcaster said it had appointed EasyJet's boss Carolyn McCall. ITV's previous chief executive, Adam Crozier, left in June, but Ms McCall will not take up her new post until January next year. Carillion shares leapt 19% on the news it was part of a consortium granted HS2 contracts by the government. Carillion, in the wider FTSE 250, announced on Monday that it had appointed the accountants EY to support its strategic review, which has been launched after it issued a profit warning last week and announced the departure of its chief executive. Carillion's shares were trading at about 67p, although this was still well below the 191p level they stood at prior to last week's profit warning. Staying in the FTSE 250, shares in Weir Group rose 8% after the company, which makes pipes and valves for the energy and mining sectors, said revenue and operating profit for the full-year were set to beat expectations. Weir said it been helped by a faster than expected recovery in the North American oil and gas markets. The FTSE 250 index closed 112 points, or 0.6%, higher at 19,520. The pound weakened slightly against both the dollar and the euro. The pound fell 0.3% versus the US dollar to $1.31; sterling was also 0.3% down against the euro at 1.14 euros.	The FTSE 100 closed 25 points, or 0.35%, higher at 7,404, after ITV announced its new chief executive.
The CM11 armoured vehicle carrying five soldiers was returning to base when it fell into the Wangsha river in Pingtung county in the south of the country. The driver and tank captain survived. The drill was part of preparations for next week's annual Han Kuang military exercise. President Tsai Ing-wen has sent her condolences. The CM11 was returning from a firing test at about 10:30 local time (02:30 GMT) when an apparent mechanical failure in one of the tracks left the driver unable to make a required left turn, the army said. The driver was able to escape with light injuries. The four others were pulled unresponsive from the vehicle. The captain was revived and later taken to a military hospital in neighbouring Kaohsiung city. The soldiers reportedly belonged to the Eighth Army Command. President Tsai demanded a speedy investigation into the cause of the incident. She is scheduled to preside over the military exercises, which simulate possible attacks by Beijing.	A Taiwanese armoured vehicle has plunged from a three-metre bridge in heavy rain after a military drill, killing three soldiers, officials say.
He was elected with 571 votes, ahead of Michael Henderson and David Noakes with 184 and 109 votes respectively. A total of 883 (27%) of the 3,220 registered voters turned out with four blank papers and 15 spoilt papers. Mr Parkinson will serve for four months and said there were "very important decisions" to be made in that time. Before the by-election some criticism was made of the Â£50,000 cost, a fifth of a general election, for the short term of the office - the by-election had to be held under the island's Reform Law. Mr Parkinson said: "The voters of St Peter Port North deserve to be represented every bit as strongly as the voters of any other district. "These next four months will set the scene for the general election, it will help to define the issues on which the general election will be fought." Mr Parkinson served in the States from 2004-2012 and was the minister of Treasury of Resources from 2008-2012. He previously stood in the South East district and said he had "enjoyed biking around getting to know the St Peter Port North district better" while campaigning. He campaigned with three key policies; diversifying the economy, reforming the corporate tax system and solving the affordable housing crisis. His term of office will end at the general election on 27 April. The by-election was called after the death of Deputy Martin Storey in July.	Former treasury minister Charles Parkinson is returning to the States of Guernsey after winning the St Peter Port North by-election.
Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said a  new charter arrangement would end the long-running row over seafarers' pay. The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â£4 an hour. The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month. The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink. Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents. Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept. Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised. He said: "I'm very pleased to see an agreement in principle now in place to end this long running issue around the freight vessels serving the Northern Isles. "The new charter basis will allow the wage issue to be resolved. Going forward, I can confirm that all crew members will be paid at least the minimum wage." Serco Northlink was awarded the six-year Â£243m Northern Isles contract in 2012. It operates three ferries and two cargo boats to the Northern Isles on a route which is heavily subsidised by the Scottish government.	An agreement has been reached to ensure foreign workers on freight boats serving Orkney and Shetland are paid at least the minimum wage.
The Court heard that a further pregnancy would be a "significantly life-threatening event" for both the mother and child. Mr Justice Cobb said the woman had the "same human rights" as everyone else and this was not a case of "eugenics". He has authorised health and council services to intervene and perform the sterilisation. The name of the woman has not been released, to protect the identify of her children. The Court of Protection, which rules in cases when people are unable to make decisions for themselves, heard the woman has no contact with any of her six children. All are being raised by carers. The 36-year-old's history was described as "extraordinary, tragic, and complex". Two of the children were born at home in conditions described as "unhygienic and overrun by pets". There is evidence that barbecue tongs were used as forceps, although this was denied. In another birth, the woman - known only as DD - contested there was no father and the pregnancy resulted from a "tablet from a health food shop". Mr Cobb's judgement said: "The ethical, legal and medical issues arising here are self-evidently of the utmost gravity, engaging, and profoundly impacting upon DD's personal autonomy, privacy, bodily integrity, and reproductive rights." It said there were considerable concerns about the woman's safety. Doctors said the wall of her uterus was "tissue-paper thin" and likely to rupture in childbirth, leading to almost certain death of the infant. Mr Cobb insisted: "Those who lack capacity have the same human rights as everyone else. "This case is not about eugenics, this outcome has been driven by the bleak yet undisputed evidence that a further pregnancy would be a significantly life-threatening event." He has authorised a sterilisation operation, but there will be no notice given to the woman or her long-term partner, who also has learning disabilities. Rebecca Schiller, the co-chairwoman of the human rights in childbirth charity Birthrights, said: "Taking away a person's ability to have a child is truly draconian. "It may be justified in extreme circumstances, but immense care must be taken to safeguard the rights of people with mental health conditions."	A mother of six with an IQ of 70 should be sterilised for her own safety, the Court of Protection has ruled.
Oxford City Council said the money had mostly been used for "ground investigations of possible sites" but nowhere suitable had been found. Two cemeteries still have space, in Wolvercote and Botley, but they are expected to be full by 2018 and 2021. The council said it had not given up and was "still exploring options". Linda Smith, board member for leisure, parks and sport, said the council has been "searching for a suitable new burial site for many years". She added: "But ultimately, as with new housing sites, we have run out of suitable land within Oxford. "So far all the council-owned sites that we have identified have, following ground investigations and surveys, had to be discounted. "Either due to the size of the site, the ground conditions, a high water table or a covenant restricting the use of the site." After the two remaining cemeteries are full the council said only the reopening of family plots, the use of a few reserved plots, and the interment of ashes would be possible. The last increase in burial space in Oxford was in 1932.	A council has spent £30,500 unsuccessfully searching for new burial sites in Oxford over the last four years.
Media playback is not supported on this device Former heavyweight world champion Haye, 36, made a series of graphic descriptions of hurting Bellew, with the BBBofC warning both fighters. Bellew, 34, stopped Haye in round 11, with the Londoner subsequently having surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon. "Some of the comments went too far," Haye told BBC Sport. It is expected that any sanctions against Haye will be announced after a BBBofC meeting on Wednesday. "If I have to pay a fine, I'll happily pay and take whatever punishment I need to," he said. Haye added he now has a "different kind of respect" for WBC cruiserweight champion Bellew and would not repeat such comments before a rematch, which he reiterated his desire to pursue. "When you get into that beast mode before the fight, you're not thinking about political correctness, you're not thinking about fines, you're just thinking about getting in the ring," he said. "When you're in that beast mode you say things which rub the average person up the wrong way." Haye suffered an Achilles injury in the sixth round at the O2 Arena, with Bellew capitalising to score a knockdown. A second knockdown in the 11th round saw Haye's corner throw in the towel, which the fighter now believes could have kept him from doing "irreparable damage" to his ankle and foot. "It was a strange situation - I was getting into my flow and it felt like I stepped on a bear trap," he said. "I saw Tony look down and think 'I've got you here,' so it just became about survival - trying not to get knocked out while trying to knock him out on one leg, which is pretty tough. "I knew it was completely ruptured - the pain was terrible, when I put my foot down I could hear it crunching, but the adrenaline is so high when you're fighting you can conjure up the energy from somewhere to keep going. "I believed if I landed that one shot I could change the outcome of the fight but I was fighting a current world champion - I gave it my best shot but came up short." Bellew said he is considering retirement following his win, but admitted an offer for one further fight could be too lucrative to turn down. Haye admits a rematch "solely depends on Tony" but sees a second bout as the first step as he seeks to regain a world heavyweight title belt. "I still believe it, more now than ever, that if I'm fit and healthy, I can beat anybody," he said. "Maybe [Tony] is happy with the victory over me and if that's the case, I wish him nothing but luck. If he wants to do it again, then great. "Very few people on the planet believe I'm the best so I need to win that fight again, bare minimum, and then people can maybe look at me for world title fights. "For me, focus on the leg, and I will become the world heavyweight champion."	David Haye expects a fine from the British Boxing Board of Control for his comments in the build-up to Saturday's defeat by Tony Bellew.
No-one was in the vehicle when it careered rear-end first into the side of the building in Dromore Road Retail Park in Omagh at about 17:00 BST on Thursday. Simon Burke said his wife and son, who were in the shop at the time, had were "very lucky" to escape injury.	A car has smashed through a wall of a shop in County Tyrone after rolling down a hill.
Members of the 130th (St John) Field Ambulance are being honoured with the rededication of a plaque to them. The Archbishop of Wales and the Duke of Gloucester, who is the Grand Prior of St John, are among 200 invited guests. The service, at 14:00 BST, is being held at St John the Baptist in Cardiff city centre. Welsh assembly's presiding officer Dame Rosemary Butler attended. The 130th unit was made up of St John Ambulance-trained men recruited from coalfields across south Wales. The men served at some of the most important battles of World War One and 11 were killed in action or died from wounds. They provided support at the battle of Mametz Wood on the Somme in July 1916 and at Pilckem Ridge during the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917. The men won 25 military medals for gallantry, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, two Croix de Guerres and three Military Crosses.	A service to remember Welsh medics who won gallantry medals in World War One is being held in Cardiff.
The self-styled Islamic State group said two days ago that Abu-Zakariya al-Britani detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base in Tal Gaysum, south-west of Mosul. He is believed to have been originally known as Ronald Fiddler. Fiddler, 50 and from Manchester, was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2002. IS has now published a photograph of Fiddler, who was also known as Jamul-Uddin al-Harith before taking the nom-du-guerre Abu-Zakariya al-Britani. He had been seized by US forces in Pakistan in 2001, before being sent to Guantanamo. US interrogators found he provided useful information to them about the Taliban's methods, and he was released after two years. The Daily Mail reported Fiddler received a million pounds in compensation from the government when he came back to the UK. The BBC has seen IS registration papers signed by Fiddler in April 2014 when he crossed into Syria from Turkey. He volunteered to be a fighter, saying his knowledge of Islam was basic. His wife told the Daily Mirror that she and their five children went to Syria try to persuade him to come back, but failed, and they ended up having to flee for their lives from IS territory. Afzal Ashraf, a former counter-terrorism adviser to the United States in Iraq, told the BBC this incident demonstrated that "some of the people in Guantanamo Bay were up to no good". "It also throws into question some of the organisations that were supporting him, that brought him back [from Guantanamo]. "Some of them were associated a little too closely with this radical ideology, and they use the legal system - freedoms of speech, the importance of the rule of law - in order to subvert some of our systems in the UK and elsewhere." BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the "pipeline" of British and European jihadists who once crossed the Turkish border into Syria, into IS-controlled territory, has now "pretty much dried up". He added: "Guantanamo Bay was incredibly bad in the ideological fight against extremism. It makes it very difficult for America, Britain and other countries whose nationals are there to maintain any kind of moral high ground, because they [detainees] were imprisoned without trial. "And what do you do about the estimated 400 British jihadists who are still out there? If they don't die on the battlefield, are they going to try and come back? How do you monitor them? Do you believe the people who say 'I've turned my back on all of that'. "Most people will probably want to do exactly that. Some, though, may have other ideas." According to figures published by the UK government last year, about 850 people regarded as a national security concern have gone to become fighters in the Middle East. Of those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15% are dead. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. "As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British nationals in these areas."	A British IS fighter who died in a suicide bomb attack on Iraqi forces in Mosul is a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, the BBC understands.
Reports suggest Chinese buyers are acquiring the clothing retailer, which started in London in the 1850s. Its illustrious fans have included the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and actors such as Cary Grant. But after the British firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on China and last year saw its UK sales fall 16%. Hong Kong-based YGM Trading, which bought it for £15m four years ago, said Aquascutum is due to be sold in March 2017 to two buyers. The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by British soldiers during the First World War, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer Edmund Hillary in the first confirmed ascent of Mount Everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with Sean Connery wearing one in Another Time, Another Place in 1958 and Sophia Loren in The Key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its Nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration. Under YGM's ownership, the company's primary focus has been China, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Last year it closed 14 stores in China amid declining sales, but opened one in Europe. In the UK, its three remaining standalone stores are in Westfield London, Great Marlborough Street and Jermyn Street.	Aquascutum, whose luxury raincoats have been worn by royalty and film stars, is being sold for $120m (£97m).
Jon Rahm's status as one of Europe's most exciting prospects was confirmed by a fine victory on the PGA Tour at Torrey Pines last Sunday. The 22-year-old capped his maiden triumph with a thrilling eagle at the last, where he holed a snaking 60-footer to finish three clear of the field. Rahm, who hails from Barrika in the Basque country of northern Spain, has made an extraordinary start to his professional career. He secured his Tour card within just four events of joining the paid ranks seven months ago. Having completed a stellar college career at Arizona State, where he won the prestigious Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus awards, the youthful Spaniard was third at Congressional last year before finishing runner-up at the Canadian Open last July. His rapid rise accelerated further with this victory over a strong field in California. It is little wonder Europe's Ryder Cup captain, Thomas Bjorn, was among the first to recognise the achievement. "Congratulations on your first PGA Tour win," Bjorn tweeted. "When you win, you might as well do it in style! What a finish." It is a significant result for Bjorn because it has elevated Rahm into the world's top 50. All indicators suggest the Spaniard, currently ranked 46th, is likely to remain in this upper echelon for many years to come. And with a place in the top 50 comes the freedom to pick and choose tournaments on both sides of the Atlantic. With his PGA Tour card secure, the Spaniard is on schedule to be free to accept European Tour membership in time for next year's Ryder Cup. Rahm has already stated his desire to play for Europe in Paris and under new rules would only need to play four events each season to satisfy the Tour's membership criteria. "I've thought about the Ryder Cup a lot," he said during the World Cup at the end of last year. "I so want to play in the matches; who doesn't? But right now I need to establish myself on the PGA Tour." That task has already been accomplished with astonishing speed and it means the 2018 Ryder Cup can be firmly on Rahm's radar. "The next one is in France and that is close to home for me," he said last November. "I will be doing all I can to be there. So to answer your question: yes, I will be joining the European Tour at some stage. "I am very much a European, and I want to play there. But I have taken a different route to professional golf in that I have gone to college in the US. "Once I have the freedom to fly back and forth a bit more it will happen. It is my dream to represent Spain in the Ryder Cup." Phil Mickelson's brother Tim coached him at Arizona State and is now the Spaniard's agent. Phil is convinced his sibling has unearthed a golfing gem. "I think there's an intangible that some guys have where they want to have the pressure, they want to be in that tough position," Mickelson said. "They want to have everything fall on their shoulders. And he has that." Before Rahm's sensational finish, Woods was the last player to win at Torrey Pines by making eagle on the closing par-5 back in 1999. Now the 41-year-old continues his latest comeback amid so many reminders the game is now being dominated by a much younger generation. Aside from Rahm's triumph, there have been PGA Tour successes this year for Justin Thomas (aged 23) and Hudson Swafford (29). Woods is heading for the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour where a similar story has been developing. After 26-year-old Tommy Fleetwood's Abu Dhabi victory, the 21-year-old Korean Jeunghun Wang collected his third title by winning in Qatar last Sunday. This week, of course, the largest galleries will gravitate towards Woods even though the 14-times major champion was less than convincing in his PGA Tour comeback last week. Rounds of 76 and 72 led to a missed cut and it was clear that understandable rust remains after such a lengthy lay-off. Woods has won twice in Dubai, but this time making the cut would represent satisfactory progress. He is playing the second of four events in a hectic five-week schedule. How his troublesome back stands up to the rigours of a 17-hour flight to the Middle East, even in the comfort of his private jet, will be Woods' primary concern. But the magnificent Majlis course at the Emirates Club, still the best in the Middle East, will provide an ideal test as he continues to feel his way back into Tour level competition. It will be fascinating to follow his progress but, given the way things are going, do not be surprised if he is overshadowed by someone nearer half his age by the time we get to Sunday's final round.	While Tiger Woods inevitably generates a frenzy of interest during his return to the European Tour, the continent has already got plenty to be excited about thanks to a new Spanish superstar in the making.
Speaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now "a mess". The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its "fair share" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were "many difficult challenges" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been "as close a partner as the president has had" adding that "we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. "It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can," he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on "what went wrong", saying: "There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up." Mr Cameron, he said, became "distracted by a range of other things". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, "wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention "averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict". But he added: "And despite all that, Libya is a mess." He also criticised what he called "free riders" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: "But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game." Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State. In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the "Libyan people were given the opportunity" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter of "huge regret" they had not taken it. He stressed that - unlike in Iraq - the post-conflict planning was locally driven. "Gaddafi was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats," he said. "An international coalition came together to protect those people and to help the Libyan people, who then got rid of Gaddafi. "And they had an opportunity to build what they said they wanted." Responding to President Obama's interview, Downing Street said "coming to the aid of innocent civilians who were being tortured and killed by their leader was the right thing to do". The government has tried to support stability in Libya and is "working hard to support the UN-led process to establish a stable and inclusive government that will allow them to build a peaceful future", a spokesman said. "But ultimately a positive outcome for Libya is not just up to the international community - this process needs to be led by the Libyan people," he added. The US National Security Council spokesman added: "With respect to Libya, the president has long said that all of us - including the United States - could have done more in the aftermath of the Libyan intervention." He said the UK had "stepped up on a range of issues" including meeting the 2% commitment and pressing other Nato members to do the same. Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said it was "a bit rich" for the US president to single out the UK and France, as they had carried out more air operations in the Libya campaign than any other country. 15 February 2011 - Protests against Colonel Gaddafi's regime erupt in Libya 20 February - Anti-Gaddafi rebels seize control of Libya's second city Benghazi 21 February - David Cameron, on a tour of the Middle East, condemns violence by the Gaddafi regime.

The 29-year-old, who plays on the right side of midfield, joins Carrick from Mid Ulster League side Crewe United. In addition to his stint at Crusaders, McAllister has also had spells with other Irish League clubs Ards, Ballymena United and Donegal Celtic. McAllister is Carrick's eighth signing during the current transfer window with Aaron Smyth and Kyle McVey already among the arrivals. Carrick face Ballinamallard United in the Irish Premiership on Friday night after taking just two points from their last six games.	Carrick Rangers have signed former Crusaders midfield Eamon McAllister.
Cosmetic lenses are available to buy on the internet, in novelty stores or at market stalls, close to Hallowe'en. Trading standards officers said the law stated that lenses should be sold with an optician or medic present. Youngsters buying the lenses may wish to recreate the look of the Twilight films and Vampire Diaries TV show. Cosmetic lenses are used to change the colour of the eye, and are also known as plano or zero-powered lenses. Trading standards officers and health experts say young people are known to share them, leading to an increased risk of corneal ulcers and infections. Alistair Bridge, director of strategy at the General Optical Council said: "Opticians make sure that contact lenses fit properly and that wearers receive expert advice on how to wear and store them safely. "They will also offer important advice such as not to sleep in contact lenses and to never share or swap lenses, which can spread eye disease." Leon Livermore, Chartered Trading Standards Institute chief executive, said: "Cosmetic contact lenses are often made and distributed on a one size fits all basis and not tailored to the wearer's needs which can increase the risk of eye health issues." "We would advise against buying products like these online or from retailers as without professional supervision there are more likely to be health concerns for the individual."	Fans of the Twilight film series have been warned that they could be putting their sight at risk by sharing cosmetic contact lenses bought online.
The firm predicted that the move would help drive the development of autonomous vehicles. Called Apollo, the project will make a range of software, hardware and data services available to others, especially carmakers. Other firms in the sector, such as Tesla and Google, have tended to keep key developments secret. Baidu, often described as China's Google, has been developing self-drive vehicles since 2015. Making the announcement ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, it said technologies for use in restricted test environments would be available as soon July. There will then be a gradual roll-out of other technology, with an aim to offer its full range of developments to support self-driving for highways and city roads by 2020. In a statement, Baidu's group president Qi Lu said it wanted to create a "collaborative ecosystem" using its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) to "encourage greater innovation and opportunities, making better use of our technology to drive the evolution of the entire industry". This move could be likened to Google's decision to release Android, the free operating system for smartphones, says James Chao of IHS Markit. Even though it was free to use, it became a success for Google because it drives users to the company's various mobile apps and services. By becoming the supplier of the "brains" for more cars than just the ones it makes itself,  there are clear benefits. One is potential revenue from carmakers in the long term. And what is also crucial to the development of self-driving vehicles is data. The more cars using its technology, the more data it should be able to harvest. "It really sounds like they want to treat this like a smartphone platform," Mr Chao said. "The holy grail for software in cars is to become the Android or iOS that everyone is using, and this is their strategy to do that." Baidu's statement alludes to opportunities in the US, but also in its home market. "China is the world's largest market for automotive sales and production. It has many car brands and an open environment that is ripe for collaboration," group president Qi Lu said. Analyst Mr Chao agrees. "I can think of at least 20 Chinese carmakers who would be perfect candidates," he told the BBC. "They don't have huge research budgets or the resources to figure out how to make self-driving vehicles themselves. "These are firms that tend to rely on suppliers so they can build a car and so this fits in perfectly for them." He said this could mean that Baidu's technology will be used in millions of cars on China's roads by 2020. However, bigger international carmakers who are already working on autonomous vehicles are unlikely to follow suit. Motivated by the widespread pollution problems, Beijing has pushed for more electric vehicles and Chinese carmakers have responded significantly. And in the race for driverless car technology, Chinese companies are taking big strides. Along with Changan and Geely, Baidu is one of the big players, with AI research being done in both China and Silicon Valley. But it is not clear how the software and hardware Baidu has developed compares with that of its rivals. Some analysts say it has done less testing, and therefore has less data to work with, than Google and Tesla.	Chinese internet giant Baidu has said it will share much of the technology it has created for its self-driving cars.
The alarm was raised at about midnight on Thursday when the men became stranded after their boat lost engine power. Three lifeboats and a rescue helicopter went to the scene. It has been described as a "major recue operation". Mark Barnett from the Lough Swilly lifeboat described it as a community effort. "The fishermen had gone out in their boat around Malin pier and then decided to head a little east," he said. "The fishermen are fine but had a lucky escape. "They had been out for half an hour when the engine broke down and they started to drift. "They had no mobile phone signal to raise the alarm."	Three fishermen have been rescued off the coast of Malin Head in County Donegal.
Media playback is not supported on this device But the Uruguay striker, 27, can now train and play in friendly matches, with new club Barcelona confirming: "He will join the first team's training session, scheduled for Friday. "The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou." It is not known if he will play in Monday's game with Mexico's Club Leon. A full explanation of the Cas ruling, which still prevents him from playing "organised" matches but now allows him to take part in all "football-related activities", will be published at a later date. He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico. But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month. Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment. Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: "The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed." But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was "excessive", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended. World players' union Fifpro said it was "disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions" and "remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code". It added: "We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment." In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities. His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had "misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate". Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: "Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team." "By allowing Suarez to train, Cas appears to have taken into account the club's interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate," said Hannah Clipston, a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes. "What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender." Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance. He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. In 2011, he was also given an eight-match suspension and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.	Luis Suarez's four-month ban for biting an opponent has been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).
Cumberbatch has apologised and said he was "devastated to have caused offence" after using the word on a US TV show to describe black actors. "I think it's ridiculous," Selma star Oyelowo told Newsbeat. "When you look at what he was actually saying it's clear that he's a huge supporter of black performers." David Oyelowo was speaking at the UK premiere of Selma, in which he stars as 1960s civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr. Cumberbatch mentioned David Oyelowo and Chiwetel Ejiofor as part of a wider discussion with US talk show host Tavis Smiley about diversity in the film industry. "To attack him for a term, as opposed to what he was actually saying, I think is very disingenuous and is indicative of the age we live in where people are looking for sound bites as opposed to substance." More: Why the word 'coloured' is offensive The actor also said he had spoken to Cumberbatch about the controversy that flared up online over the past few days. "I reached out to him in support and said I think it's ridiculous," he said. When asked if he felt Hollywood and the film industry had an issue with diversity, Oyelowo replied with a resounding "absolutely". "You can see that in the fact every time a film of this size and stature comes up. "We're talking about diversity again and that's because there isn't enough of it." He cited his recent role in Interstellar as one that wasn't specified as a black character and noted "to get to the point whereby myself and Ryan Gosling are going up for the same role is going to be great". "That's not to say that that doesn't happen, it just doesn't happen often." Oyelowo suggested there needed to be more diversity among people with the power to finance and get films made. "Excellence is the best weapon against prejudice. I intend to be part of the solution and not the problem. "You've just got to keep on banging out good performances." Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for the best actor Oscar for his role in The Imitation Game, and while David Oyelowo missed out on an acting nomination for Selma, the film is in the running for best picture at next month's ceremony. So does David think the negative publicity Benedict has been getting will harm Cumberbatch's career? "Absolutely not," said Oyelowo. "I think it's just part of the silly news cycle that we all feed off and it will go away like chip paper as it does. "He's a brilliant actor, he gives a brilliant performance in Imitation Game and, like I say, it's just a diversion from what we should be talking about, which is that astounding performance."

Talk in Europe today moved swiftly from Brexit to possible Frexit (France voting to leave the EU), Swexit (that's Sweden) and more. Leaders of Europe's increasingly influential Eurosceptic parties queued up today to crow over the British vote and make political capital out of it. "It's now a reality for everyone. It is possible to leave the EU," proclaimed Marine Le Pen of France's National Front (FN), a leading contender in next year's presidential election. The mood in Brussels is resentful and despondent, while governments across Europe are scared. They feel the heat from angry electorates who share many of the criticisms of the EU highlighted during the UK's referendum campaign. That's why you've been hearing the words "EU" and "reform" of late from the nervous mouths of some you'd least expect, such as Germany's Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk, the Brussels-based President of the European Council. Because they're so worried, the EU is preparing to get tough with Britain over the terms and timing of a new trade relationship. This is not about punishment - well, not much. It's more a desire for the process to be painful to put others off exiting, while Europe's leadership tries to re-group and, perhaps, reform. But there are divisions here too that threaten to drive the EU even further apart. France rather relishes the idea of making an example of Britain. And Paris will flex its muscles far more now that the UK has voted itself out of having a voice at the EU table. But the countries of Central and Eastern Europe aren't keen to alienate the UK. They rely on Britain to support them in maintaining tough sanctions against Russia. And Poland in particular also worries about its 800,000 citizens living in the UK. Germany is somewhere inbetween. Mrs Merkel urged fellow EU leaders not to rush to conclusions about the Brexit vote as that "would only divide Europe more". She is a devoted European but she doesn't relish the idea of a resurgent France. She'll miss the UK's competitive approach to the single market, its loathing of EU protectionism and the British sense of humour she's said to be so fond of. Of course, until the UK formally notifies EU leaders of the intent to leave (which, to their irritation, could take months) everything stays the same. In theory. But next week's summit of EU leaders will be a very awkward one for David Cameron. Nothing has changed on paper yet in Brussels. But the EU has been turned upside down.	In all the years I've covered European politics, I've never seen this continent so Eurosceptic or the future of the European Union so uncertain.
They said this will amount to double the number of apprentices created each year - currently about 28,000. All parties are promising to create more apprentices or equivalent schemes to get unemployment down. Labour highlighted its pledge to create 100,000 additional apprentices. The Lib Dems said they would fund their promise by moving cash from Jobs Growth Wales, the Labour Welsh Government's existing job-creation scheme. Eluned Parrott, the Liberal Democrats' candidate for Cardiff Central, said: "Providing high-quality skills training is vital to boosting our economy and helping people to build careers and get on in life. "Labour's own evaluation report said that Jobs Growth Wales locked people into low wages and that 73% would've found work without it. "We all know this scheme is a failure, but Labour refuses to face the facts. "The Welsh Liberal Democrats would instead invest in apprenticeships and training, which will actually give young people professional skills and help them get on in life." On Labour's policy, Deputy Skills Minister Julie James said Wales already had "one of the best records in Europe" on apprenticeships. "This pledge is the next step to ensuring that we have the skills base that projects like Wylfa Newydd and the South Wales Metro, will demand," she said. "That is why so many voices within industry are so enthusiastic about this pledge." Plaid Cymru has promised to created 50,000 new apprentices, while the Welsh Conservatives say they will lift the current 16-24 age restrictions on the Jobs Growth Wales scheme. It helps firms employ 16-24-year-olds for six months by covering the cost of the minimum wage. The Tories aim to replace it with a scheme called Journeys to Work, open to all ages, with jobs lasting for a year. UKIP say they back industry-supported apprenticeships, along with more vocational options in post-14 education.	The Welsh Liberal Democrats would create 140,000 extra apprentices over the next five years if the party wins power in May's elections.
The male in his early 30s was found with critical injuries in North Woolwich Road, Silvertown, at about 13:30 GMT. He was pronounced dead at the scene and inquiries are under way to locate his next-of-kin, the Met said. No arrests have been made. Two other cyclists were killed in the capital within hours of each other on Monday. Anita Szucs, 30, died after an apparent hit-and-run on Bounces Road, Enfield, while Karla Roman, 32, was killed in a crash with a coach on Whitechapel High Street, Tower Hamlets.	A cyclist has died in a crash with an HGV in east London.
5 January 2016 Last updated at 08:38 GMT After the war, the dormitories in south London became temporary accommodation for immigrants from countries like Jamaica who were invited to live in the UK. The tunnels, which are 120ft below the surface, have now been opened up for public visits by Transport for London (TfL) and the London Transport Museum. BBC London's Alice Bhandhukravi reports.	Beneath Clapham South Tube station lie a warren of tunnels which provided shelter for 8,000 people during World War Two.
The 19-year-old woman was attacked between 20:30 and 21:00 on Wednesday. Officers cordoned off an area of the park as part of their investigation, and were believed to be following a positive line of inquiry. Anyone with information was asked to contact Police Scotland.	Police are investigating the rape of a woman in Queens Park in Glasgow's Southside.
Up to a dozen A-29 Super Tucano aircraft would be sold to Nigeria to help fight Islamist militant group Boko Haram, unnamed US officials said. The deal, which is not yet official, will require approval from Congress. Boko Haram's deadly insurgency has displaced more than two million people. The deal, said to be worth up to $600m (Â£490m), was agreed by the Obama administration, but was reportedly halted on the day it was due to be sent to Congress, after a catastrophic incident involving the Nigerian military. About 90 people, mainly women and children, were killed in January when the Nigerian Air Force mistakenly bombed a camp in the country's north-east, which was hosting thousands of those who had fled Boko Haram. An aid distribution was taking place at the time of the attack, according to medical charity MSF. The Nigerian government indicated last month that the deal might be back on, following the first phone call between President Muhammadu Buhari and President Donald Trump. "President Trump assured the Nigerian president of US readiness to cut a new deal in helping Nigeria in terms of military weapons to combat terrorism," Mr Buhari's office said in a statement. The US congressional source said human rights concerns remain, despite support for the sale from some lawmakers, Reuters news agency reports. The US Air Force described the A-29 aircraft as a "game-changer" when they were deployed in Afghanistan in 2016. They can be armed with two wing-mounted machine guns and can carry up to 1,550 kg of weapons. But the aircraft that would be sold to Nigeria come with a "very basic armed configuration," one of the unnamed US officials told Reuters.	The Trump administration plans to sell military planes to Nigeria despite concerns over rights abuses and a botched air strike that killed scores of civilians in January, US media say.
Services from Douglas to the UK were disrupted after the Ben-my-Chree, which sailed from Heysham, Lancashire, struck the pier on Sunday. The Isle of Man Steam-Packet Company confirmed no passengers or crew were injured. Four crossings between Douglas and Heysham were been cancelled following the the collision. Chief executive Mark Woodward apologised to passengers and said it was an "unfortunate incident", adding the company would "do all we can to minimise the disruption". A company spokesman said that on arrival in Douglas Harbour, the Ben-my-Chree "encountered significantly stronger than forecast easterly winds" and the vessel made contact with the King Edward Pier. He said engineers worked through the night to assess any damage and a diving inspection had been carried out. He added the Ben-my-Chree would return to service later, though its sailing at 19:45 GMT would be subject to "prevailing weather conditions".	A ferry crashed into a pier on the Isle of Man as the captain tried to dock in strong winds.
Both Jenny Rathbone and Mike Hedges are applying separately to take part in a ballot which, if they win, will allow them to propose a bill to ban the fees. Mr Hedges said the fees were a "tax" on some of society's poorest with students among the biggest hit. But one letting agent said a ban could hit efforts to professionalise the sector. The Welsh Government said it was happy to consider how such legislation might work. The charges have already been banned in Scotland, while the UK government is planning to consult on doing the same in England. There are currently no firm plans to do the same in Wales, although the Welsh Government has said it was "actively considering" the move. Ministers have faced criticism for not acting sooner. AMs from all of the assembly's opposition parties have supported a ban. Assembly members can propose bills - proposals for new laws which when passed by the assembly become acts - from outside the government through a random ballot process. Mr Hedges said: "They are a tax on some of the poorest people in society who are engaged in private rented accommodation." The Swansea East AM said it was a big problem in university cities and a "big problem anywhere where there is more demand for housing then there is housing". Mr Hedges believes that about 20 AMs may apply to take part in the ballot - although only Mr Hedges and Ms Rathbone are currently known to be proposing banning the fees. Cardiff Council AM Jenny Rathbone said Mr Hedges' attempt "doubles the chances of one of us being picked". Catherine Iannucci, 21, originally from Barry and studying her third year of history and politics at Cardiff University, lives in a house with six other tenants. She said they have had to pay Â£80 each to take the home off the market - amounting to a fee of Â£560 for the agency. Ms Iannucci, who is a part of the group Labour Students and has conducted research on agency fees for Ms Rathbone, said: "It's a significant amount of money. "We don't really know what they're for and we don't know what that's gone towards." She also had to pay a deposit of a month's rent, plus Â£50. "In the middle of term, because we look around February time - nobody has that money to just throw away easily. It does put you under a lot pressure for the rest of the term," she said. She said she would be in favour of a ban as long as it meant that rents did not go up as a result. Douglas Haig is the director for Wales and vice-chairman of the Residential Landlords Association - which also owns Cardiff property management company James Douglas Sales and Lettings. He said his firm does charge fees, adding: "There are fees that go to landlord, there are fees that go to the tenant." Mr Haig said he did not condone "sharp practices" in the sector but warned that banning fees may make it harder to professionalise the industry. "If we just outright ban fees, then we're going to have a number of consequences," he said. "The most important is around the professionalisation of the sector... If you are taking away money from the sector, that's going to be very difficult to continue providing quality. "I don't think the vast majority of agents out there are actually profiteering. "There are costs in running these businesses that people are unaware of and as increased state regulation comes in, those costs continue to rise." A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are happy to consider how legislation on this might work. "We want to look at the evidence from Scotland and see wider consultation to ensure that a ban on fees does not push rental costs up." The next scheduled ballot for backbench bills is on 25 January.	Letting agents' fees for tenants could be banned in Wales under proposals from two backbench Labour AMs.
He is the first American Secretary of State to visit the city. In a meeting with Somalia's president under tight security at the airport, he said: "Next time I come, we have to be able to just walk downtown". The US backs the Somali government in its fight against Islamist militant group al-Shabab, which still controls many rural parts of southern Somalia. African news as it happens: 5 May 2015 The meeting with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and civil leaders was held at Mogadishu airport, as Mr Kerry isn't leaving its heavily fortified perimeters. Mr Kerry said: "I visited Somalia today because your country is turning around". The more recent changes he pointed out were Somali forces pushing al-Shabab out of big towns and a "determined international effort" to put virtually all of Somalia's pirates out of business. BBC Somalia analyst Mary Harper says the US plays a crucial if controversial role in Somalia, supporting the weak central government in its fight against al-Shabab. Al-Shabab leaders have been killed in US drone strikes. Our correspondent points out that America is careful to take a less visible role than it did in the 1990s, when the bodies of US servicemen were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.	The US Secretary of State John Kerry has arrived in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, on an unannounced visit.
In 2014, a report by the public protector said Mr Zuma had "benefited unduly" from the upgrades. Mr Zuma said the auditor-general and finance minister should determine how much he should repay to end the dispute. The announcement comes a week before a constitutional hearing on the matter. Africa Live: BBC news updates How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown The refurbishment of the residence in the village of Nkandla, in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, has turned into a major political controversy in South Africa. Some of of the money was spent on building an amphitheatre, swimming pool, and cattle enclosure. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who have called for a corruption investigation, say they are pressing ahead with their court case regardless of the president's latest offer. Following Mr Zuma's announcement #PayBackThemoney is trending in South Africa - this was the phrase EFF MPs chanted at the president in parliament last year. Many commentators seem sceptical. Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News President Jacob Zuma's delayed willingness to pay back the money spent on the upgrades to his Nkandla residence could be a calculated move to avoid embarrassment at the Constitutional Court hearing expected next week. But it could also be linked to the forthcoming local government election. The Nkandla scandal has been a sore point for the governing African National Congress (ANC) which President Zuma leads, especially as the party faithful go out to campaign for votes. Political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni told me that it could also be related to the president being "politically vulnerable as he enters his 'lame-duck' period and following his mis-appointment of finance ministers" at the end of last year. Another consideration could well be an attempt to avert another episode of the chaotic scenes we saw during the opening of parliament last year when Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) heckled and disrupted the president's state of the nation address. Security personnel had to be called into the chamber to remove the MPs who would not stop shouting "pay back the money'" while President Zuma desperately tried to deliver his speech. Punches at South Africa parliament Why did Zuma sack two finance ministers in a week? All figures in 2013 financial terms Source: Public protector report	South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has agreed to repay some of the $23m (£15m) the government controversially spent on upgrading his private rural home.
The two-and-a-half minute clip - which sees Daniel Craig reprise his role as the superspy for a fourth time - gives a closer look at the film after a teaser was released in March. Featuring car chases, exploding planes and shady crime organisations, it bares all the hallmarks of classic Bond. Spectre will be released in UK cinemas on 26 October. The new trailer begins with a first look at Ralph Fiennes in his new role as MI6 boss M, questioning Bond about a rogue mission to Mexico City. The spy is then seen in Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra - played by Monica Bellucci - the widow of an infamous criminal. After a suggested quick tryst with Sciarra, Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the crime organisation known as Spectre. Having previously only seen him as a shadowy character in the teaser clip, Christoph Waltz is also finally revealed as Bond villain Franz Oberhauser. There is also a first glimpse of Sherlock star Andrew Scott, who stars as Max Denbigh, the new head of the Centre for National Security. Fans on Twitter were quick to give their reaction to the new trailer and many noted it featured some of the theme to 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service. "This looks absolutely stunning!" Ben Peyton wrote, while Rene Friedrich said it was "so much better than the teaser. Finally, how it should be: a blend of iconic, new, fast, quotable". However, Dekan Apajee said: "As trailers go this is more of a spoiler."	The first full-length trailer for the 24th James Bond film, Spectre, has been released online.
The men, aged 26 and 24, were in a house in Melrose Street when three men armed with a knife, hammer and batons forced their way into the property just before midnight on Saturday. After assaulting the men, the gang left with a sum of cash and personal items. They also smashed a number of windows. The men in the house received medical treatment for their injuries. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.	Two men have been assaulted by an armed gang in south Belfast.
Media playback is not supported on this device Cheshire, 21, who has missed much of the past three years because of repeated concussions, finished sixth. "I'm really happy with my progression, but I just couldn't put it down tonight," she told BBC Sport. "It happens and I'm going to take positives from being out there against the best in the world." Japan's Ayana Onozuka (89.80) took gold in Sierra Nevada ahead of France's Marie Martinod (87.00) and American Devin Logan (84.20). Cheshire was regarded as a potential medallist at the Sochi Winter Olympics, but a heavy crash in training resulted in a serious concussion that meant she missed the event. She suffered two further concussions and experienced panic attacks over the next 18 months, only returning to full-time competition this season with under a year to go to the Pyeongchang Games. "I'm over all of my head injuries," she said. "I'm in a really good place, feeling super-confident and enjoying it more than ever." Earlier on Saturday, James Woods and Izzy Atkin qualified for their respective slopestyle finals, which will take place on Sunday. Woods, who finished fifth in Sochi, scored 86.00 to finish fourth in his heat while Atkin, who won GB's first ski slopestyle World Cup gold medal earlier this month qualified in third place. Although GB's Tyler Harding, Cal Sanderson and Michael Rowlands all missed out, organisers subsequently revised their rules and have added a semi-final on Sunday with the top four to qualify for an extended 16-strong final.	British halfpipe skier Rowan Cheshire crashed in all three of her final runs, but still secured Britain's best-ever World Championship result in the event.

I feel like I'm playing well right now and can't wait for the second week. I'll be back on Centre Court on Monday but before the action starts again, I thought I'd use this column to answer some of the questions you sent using Twitter and Facebook. Q) What did Seppi say to you to make you laugh at the end? (John Parsons) I didn't really hear exactly what he said, but he said it and then laughed, so I laughed as well. Q) Does Ivo Karlovic have the best serve and how do you prepare for facing it? (Alan Bingle) He has one of the best for sure. It's difficult to pick who has the best. To prepare for it I usually have my coach or whoever it is I'm hitting with stand just behind the service line and basically just serve from there and try to react. I ask them to try and ace me for 10 minutes so I get used to seeing the ball go past me, and also reacting to a serve coming at me from that height. Media playback is not supported on this device Q) What do you think about Wimbledon's dress code? (Danyal Khan) It is very strict but I do like that it's all white because it's different. We don't have that the rest of the year and that is one of the things that makes Wimbledon unique. Q) Should the rules of tennis be changed since toilet breaks & medical time-outs are being increasingly used to break up sporting momentum, and the integrity of the sport? (James Walker) Yes, they should be. Why not? They could get rid of the medical time-outs, for sure. You can't get rid of toilet breaks but you could have them at the end of the set. Normally the toilets are right by the side of the court. Maybe on the outside courts it's not the case but normally they are right there and there's no reason for a toilet break to last 10 minutes. But sometimes we play for four or five hours and you're drinking so many fluids, you can't get rid of them altogether - what if someone needs to go? You don't want to see what might happen on the court! Q) What is your pet preference after dogs? (Alexander Broadbean) That's a good question. We talked about having a cat before but none of my family ever had cats while I was growing up. I think with what I do for a living, having cats is actually not a bad thing because they don't need as much attention as dogs. I had a hamster when I was a kid, called Whisky. He escaped down the floorboards never to be seen again and I was absolutely devastated. Q) Who would win a fastest sausage-eater contest between your dogs Maggie May and Rusty? (Amanda C) Rusty's a quicker eater. He's just bigger. He's a boy and wolfs his food down. Q) Would you ever consider Grand Slam doubles? (Jake) I would like to. I couldn't at Wimbledon because the doubles is best-of-five sets. You look at some of the matches, you can be out there for three-and-a-half or four hours. There's no way physically I would be able to do that here. But I would like to play because I love the Grand Slams and doing well in the doubles is good. I respect the doubles players, my brother's one, and often doubles matches can be very exciting, especially in the latter stages of Grand Slams. It is a part of our game that a lot of club players play and I think it should be shown more on the TV. Q) Where did you watch Heather Watson's match against Serena Williams and were you on your feet shouting? (Rachel Grace) Media playback is not supported on this device I watched it at home. I watched the first set and the beginning of the second, and then I snoozed for 20 minutes and woke up at 5-4 in the second set. Then I watched the whole of the end of the match. I don't really jump up and scream when I'm watching because of the dogs - Kim was doing that and the dogs were going crazy. I normally go very quiet and quite insular when I'm watching matches that I'm into. With boxing I do that as well - individual sports. With team sports it's different, but with individual sports and when I care about the outcome, I tend to not say a whole lot. Q) Who would play you in a movie and why? (Sandy) Andrew Garfield - I've been told we look alike. Q) Who was your sporting hero growing up? (Greg) Andre Agassi. I loved watching him when I was a kid. He had a great personality - very charismatic, very different. Q) Do you prefer scrambled eggs or fried? (Josh) Scrambled. I've just got into cooking them on my own and I do them pretty well. I learned from watching Gordon Ramsay on the internet. Andy Murray was speaking to BBC Sport's Piers Newbery. You can follow Murray on Twitter,Facebook and Instagram.	Saturday's match against Andreas Seppi was a tough one but I got through it, and the crowd on Centre Court really made a difference.
Its shares slid 7.6% to their lowest level since March, and the company was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, the UK's main share index. Operating profit before transformation costs for the six months to 25 September fell 5% to £320m from £342m. Royal Mail is now seeking cost savings of £600m a year, up from a previous target of £500m. Royal Mail reported a 1% rise in revenue to £4.6bn for the half year to 25 September, but analysts said this was lower than forecast. The trend of fewer letters being sent through the post continued, with total letter revenues falling by 3%, although parcel revenues grew by 3%. "The fall in the volume of letters and an 8% dip in marketing mail after the Brexit vote in June is causing concern about what can be assumed going forward," said David Kerstens, equity analyst at Jefferies. He added that pension costs were set to rise sharply and that cost savings would be very hard to achieve without sacrificing quality of service. Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive. said the Christmas period would be crucial for the full-year results. "Extensive planning, which began in the spring, will help us to manage our busiest time," she said. "This includes the recruitment of over 19,000 temporary staff and opening nine temporary parcel sort centres." Also on Thursday, Royal Mail competitor UK Mail - which is being bought by Deutsche Post - said half-year revenues had fallen to £230m from £237m a year earlier, although pre-tax profits rose to £5.8m from £2.2m.	Royal Mail shares have fallen after the company reported lower profits and increased its target for cost savings.
So what happens next? If the politicians are not in a position to produce a budget, the civil service could take over. Legislation allows the permanent secretary in the Department of Finance to take control if a budget act has not been passed at least three working days before the end of the financial year. The official can access a sum of money not exceeding 75% of this year's budget and direct how it is spent. If we get to the end of July and there is still no deal that official then has the right to spend an amount equivalent to 95% of this year's budget. So that implies significant in-year cuts at Stormont unless a budget is produced by either an Executive or a direct rule minister. This contingency plan was mooted during a previous budget crisis but was described by the then Finance Minister Arlene Foster as "dramatic and draconian." The current finance minister, MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã“ Muilleoir, has emphasised that the legislation means "monies will continue to flow". However the TUV leader Jim Allister, who is also a senior barrister, said his reading of the law suggests it will not be so straightforward. He believes that the Executive must at least issue a draft budget before the permanent secretary is empowered to take control. Short of that, he thinks it could require emergency amending legislation at Westminster. Whoever is correct, the budget uncertainty will have an impact. Voluntary and community groups which rely on Executive will shortly have to put staff on notice of redundancy as they cannot be sure what funding they will get in the coming financial year.	The political crisis means that the Northern Ireland Executive still has not agreed a budget for the 2017/18 financial year.
Media playback is not supported on this device In Wayne Bennett's first competitive game in charge, England were pipped by one point to fall to defeat at Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium. The 17-16 loss, along with Australia's win over Scotland put hopes of reaching the final in doubt, although there are still two matches to play. "It's only the first game of the tournament," the 28-year-old said. "If we dwell on the bad things we won't do very well. We have to look at the positives, we have the right man in charge [in Bennett]. "This will take a day or two to get over, we have to focus, we did a lot of good things and we need to take that into next week." One positive of Saturday's loss was the continuation of the Leeds Rhinos man's terrific scoring record, crossing for his 29th international try in 29 games. Hall has the opportunity to take his tally to 30, five more than Sam Tomkins and extend his lead as the top scorer in England Test history. "Its bittersweet," Hall added to BBC Sport. "It was a great assist from Gareth Widdop, but ultimately the bigger picture stuff, that we lost the game is hard to take. "It's fine margins, that's Test match rugby and the most disappointing thing is that we had enough to win the game."

He was pronounced dead at the scene and his next of kin have been informed, Kent Police said. The driver of the car was injured. Witnesses are being urged to come forward.	A man has died after he was hit by a car in Swanley on Saturday night.
It is the second time the hooker has skippered the Lions during the tour, having led them to a win over the Chiefs. Coach Warren Gatland made the decision after the Lions lost the opening Test against New Zealand 30-15 on Saturday. The second Test against the All Blacks is on Saturday, 1 July. "We are obviously hugely disappointed with the result but it is important to regroup," said Gatland. "We know there are a lot of players motivated to go out and get a result for the whole group. "A few players put their hands up for selection from the Chiefs game and played their way into the Test team so they know that there is another opportunity for them on Tuesday against the Super Rugby champions." Wing George North and centre Jonathan Joseph will both start against the Hurricanes, while Jack Nowell is at full-back. Lock George Kruis is on the bench having played the whole 80 minutes of the first Test against New Zealand.

A leaked document said a group of organisations, also featuring two local NHS trusts, had come together and was the last remaining bidder in the process. The BBC understands it could be led by private firm Interserve. Pending further discussions, the deal is due to be awarded in December. In the leaked document, clinical commissioning groups said the public-private sector consortium would "bring together a wide range of skills and expertise". Discussions are expected to take place over the coming weeks, before an official proposal is submitted. If successful, the consortium will co-ordinate cancer care - from diagnosis through to treatment - in the county. Outsourcing contracts to cover both cancer and end of life care in Staffordshire were announced last year. Together, they are expected to be worth £1.2bn and cover a 10-year period. The contracts will cover the areas controlled by Stafford and Surrounds, Cannock Chase, Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire CCGs. Trade unions have previously described the involvement of private companies as a "huge gamble". Campaigners are expected to hand over a petition on Thursday against awarding the contracts to the private sector.	A £690m cancer care contract in Staffordshire is expected to be awarded to a consortium including private firms.
Matthew Daley, 35, killed Donald Lock, on the A24 in Findon, near Worthing, last July after the 79-year-old ran into the back of his vehicle. He was convicted of manslaughter after he admitted stabbing Mr Lock to death, claiming diminished responsibility. Daley was told he would initially serve his time in a secure mental hospital. Lewes Crown Court heard Daley was a paranoid schizophrenic whose mother, Lynda, had pleaded with mental health experts to have him sectioned. She told the court the day she heard Mr Lock had been killed was "the day that all your nightmares came true". Daley was charged with murder, but never denied killing Mr Lock on 16 July last year. Daley will be held in Hellingly medium-secure psychiatric hospital in East Sussex under the Mental Health Act. Should his health improve, he will then be transferred to prison. Mr Justice Singh said the killing was a "violent, unprovoked attack" in front of members of the public, aggravated partly by Mr Lock's age and the use of a weapon. "It's clear from the verdict that the defendant's responsibility for the homicide was substantially impaired," he said. "It does not follow that it was completely extinguished." Prior to the start of the trial, Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised for not doing more. It has since announced an independent review into 10 killings involving patients known to the Trust, including the case of Matthew Daley. Mr Lock's son Andrew said the sentencing of Daley did not did not remove from the family's memories the horror of what happened. "However, at least we can move on knowing that the public are properly protected from a man who, whilst badly treated by the NHS by a catalogue of failures, is a danger to the public if not properly supervised and medicated," he said. "It is important to note Mr Justice Singh's observation this was not a public inquiry into the failings of the NHS. "But it is now up to the NHS that the systematic arrogance that exists in the medical world changes for good and that they wake up to the fact that we all deserve to be listened to."	A man who stabbed a retired solicitor 39 times after a crash between their cars has been given life and will serve at least 10 years.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Great City Games, an open and free event for the public, is due to take place in Manchester on Friday. Organisers said the event will go ahead as planned, but a decision on Sunday's Great Manchester Run "is expected in the next 24 hours". The FA Cup final, EFL play-offs and the PGA Championship are also this week. An eight-year-old girl was among those killed in Monday's suicide bombing at Manchester Arena, at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK terror threat level has been raised to its highest level of "critical", meaning further attacks may be imminent. Manchester United cancelled a news conference on Tuesday, due to be held prior to their Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday, and will wear black armbands for the match. The club said: "Our thoughts are with the victims and their families at this terribly difficult time." United's players held a minute's silence at training on Tuesday, and the club closed its megastore, museum, cafe and stadium tours to the public. A staff event scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Manager Jose Mourinho said: "We are all very sad about the tragic events; we cannot take out of our minds and our hearts the victims and their families. "We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. "I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one." Ajax manager Peter Bosz said: "What happened yesterday evening in Manchester is something we all feel in Ajax and on behalf of all of us at Ajax we express our sympathies with the victims that fell. The feeling that prevails is the final does not have the glow it should have. "Tomorrow evening should be a football feast but because of the events in Manchester we are affected. It is horrible. My sympathies are heartfelt." Football's European governing body Uefa announced a minute's silence will be observed prior to the final. The opening ceremony will also be considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. Aleksander Ceferin, president of Uefa, said he was "deeply saddened" and shocked that "so many innocent people lost their lives". A Uefa statement said there was "currently no specific intelligence" to suggest Wednesday's game could be a target for further attacks. "Uefa has been closely working with local authorities and the Swedish FA for many months and the terrorist risk had been taken into account since the very beginning of the project," it said. "Furthermore, a number of additional security measures were implemented following the attacks in Stockholm last April." There will be a minute's silence observed at Headingley cricket ground before England's one-day international against South Africa on Wednesday. Both sets of players will also wear black armbands during the game. The South Africa team have been told there will be extra police officers on duty at the ground and increased security at team hotels and practice. There will also be a minute's silence before Saturday's Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden Park. The Scottish FA's security and integrity officer, Peter McLaughlin, said: "We remain vigilant to the threat posed by global terrorism and are engaged in constant dialogue with colleagues at Police Scotland and the National Counter-Terrorism Security Office. "This ongoing communication and intelligence-sharing is part of our operations protocol for all events at the national stadium, including the forthcoming Scottish Cup final." A number of leading athletes are scheduled to participate at the Great City Games on Friday, while a public half marathon and 10km run are due to be staged in Manchester on Sunday. Wembley hosts Saturday's FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea, and the League Two and Championship play-off finals on Sunday and Monday respectively. A Football Association spokesperson said: "Fan safety is of paramount importance and we have robust security measures in place at Wembley Stadium. "In collaboration with the Metropolitan Police and the local authorities there will be an enhanced security operation for all upcoming events. "All supporters are encouraged to arrive for events at Wembley Stadium as early as possible for security checks and to avoid any delays in entering the stadium." The English Football League (EFL) added it "takes security issues extremely seriously" and urged supporters travelling to Wembley to "be vigilant of their surroundings at all times, stay alert and not be alarmed". The Metropolitan Police says extra armed officers will be deployed at this weekend's major sports events in London, with a full review of the security and policing operations under way. "Over the coming days as you go to a music venue, go shopping, travel to work or head off to the fantastic sporting events you will see more officers - including armed officers," said commander Jane Connors. Golf's BMW PGA Championship starts at Wentworth on Thursday. "As with any major event, security is the highest priority," said European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley. "It was before Monday night and it remains so. "We're in constant dialogue with the police and security services. We are comfortable we will react in the right way if in fact we need to significantly increase our security." Cricket's Champions Trophy will take place from 1-18 June at venues in Birmingham, London and Cardiff. A statement from the International Cricket Council [ICC] read: "The ICC and ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] place safety and security at the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Women's World Cup this summer as the highest priority. "We operate on advice from our tournament security directorate - in conjunction with the ECB and relevant authorities - to ensure that we have a robust safety and security plan for both tournaments. "We will continue to work with authorities over the coming hours and days and review our security in line with the threat levels." England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said his team had met their security advisers on Tuesday morning before Wednesday's match against South Africa. "On behalf of the England cricket team, I'd like to offer our thoughts and prayers to everybody in Manchester affected by the tragic events," said Morgan. "I'd also like to give our support to those in and around things and those most affected and those who helped out and continue to help out." The domestic rugby union finishes this weekend, but the National Counter Terrorism security office has been in touch with Sale Sharks and every other Aviva Premiership club asking for details of any events planned by them over the next couple of weeks. There will also be tighter security at horse racing's Epsom Derby on 3 June, with Surrey Police announcing firearms officers on patrol around the grounds. Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman said: "The Epsom Derby is a fantastic event which attracts thousands of people and spectators from around the world and I am confident that this year's festival will be no exception." England Women's cricketer Danielle Wyatt was at the Ariana Grande concert and said: "Thank you for all messages - I'm safe. Was at the concert enjoying myself like many others - thoughts with victims & families." Manchester United and Spain goalkeeper David de Gea tweeted: "Much rage, much pain. My condolences to the victims' family members involved in the atrocious attack to the heart of the city." Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard said the "beautiful city" of Manchester "will stand together in this dark hour", captain Wayne Rooney said he was "devastated" by the news and winger Ashley Young said he was "absolutely shocked". Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand: "My thoughts & prayers are with all the families & friends affected by last night's attack in Manchester." Former Lancashire and England cricketer Andrew Flintoff: "In the toughest of times the people of Manchester showing why this is such a great city, standing together in the face of such evil." Manchester City players - including captain Vincent Kompany, goalkeeper Willy Caballero, forward Leroy Sane and defender Pablo Zabaleta - also tweeted their support for those affected. Lucy Bronze, from City's women's team, said her "thoughts are with those affected" and urged people to "stick together". Olympic and world 100m champion Usain Bolt tweeted: "Thoughts & prayers goes out to people of Manchester and all those who are affected."	Sporting events and venues in England are conducting major security reviews after 22 people were killed in an attack at Manchester Arena.
The issue has been described as the biggest challenge facing police focussed on breaking up organised crime groups. Police Scotland said they made more than 2,100 arrests in relation to organised crime last year. They estimate 220 gangs are currently dealing in drugs, firearms, high-value theft, fraud and human trafficking. Some 122 people arrested in the last 12 months were described by officers as being principal players involved in serious and organised criminal activity. Police Scotland said it had enjoyed "significant successes" in detecting and disrupting criminal networks. Senior officers believe most gangs are still profiting from "traditional" crimes but are using online resources to do deals and avoid detection. Det Ch Supt Gerry McLean, head of the organised crime and counter-terrorism unit, said organised crime is still down to "profit, power and people". But with fierce debate around the use of the Regulations of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to access communications, officers know there is a balance to be struck when tracking people. Det Ch Supt McLean said: "[Gangs] are taking the additional step or layer of security around their communications because of the success we have had over the last decade or so in communication strategies that show where calls were made and placed. "They want to take themselves away from conventional itemised telecommunications billing and use apps based on their phone. "We've got to be alive to the possibility that they will use any kind of means to communicate, what we are seeing more use of is the use of encrypted devices - telephones with software within them that have been about for a number of years." The officer added: "I think discussions around Ripa and in terms of how law enforcement can secure communications data in the future is something they are alive to and will change their methodology. "Particularly the type of crime groups we are targeting - that top 20% - the ones that have got perhaps the most to lose are always looking at new methods of communications. "We're firmly in the camp of trying to catch criminals but we need to give that reassurance to the community and there is a balance to be struck." A number of high profile cases have concluded this year where the leaders of organised crime groups have been jailed. Stephen Nisbet, who ran a drug business despite being in jail for murder, was sentenced to 12 years as part of an operation that led to 66 people being arrested, including his brother James Nisbet junior. Stephen was jailed for 12 years, while James was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Scotland's first "cuckoo smurfing" case - a complicated international money laundering scheme - was also concluded with Muhammad Hameed, Saleem Shikari and Shahid Aslam jailed for a total of nine years. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "There's no place for serious organised crime in Scotland and I'm proud of the efforts of our law enforcement agencies in taking on and taking down these criminals who are exploiting law-abiding communities and businesses. "Today's latest figures show another successful year of operations in dismantling these criminal operations. As we move into 2016, there will be no let-up in our efforts."	Organised criminals are using apps and encrypted messaging to evade them, senior police officers believe.
Lara Clarke, from Brownhills, has previously made near-life-sized cakes of Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Jennifer Lawrence. Her latest creation, baked to celebrate the Defender model, fed 2,000 people at an event at the factory in Solihull on Monday. The half-scale replica weighed 600kg and featured working headlights. Comprising 32 sponge cakes, 50kg (110 lbs) of butter cream, 20kg (44 lbs) of ganache and 50kg icing, it took her 150 hours to produce. Ms Clarke said the bake was so heavy it had to be delivered by fork lift truck. "We arrived by van and everyone was coming round to have a look," she said. "They couldn't believe it was a cake. There was plenty to go round and everyone on the factory floor got a piece." It was baked to celebrate the two millionth Defender rolling off the production line - the figure includes its predecessors the Series I, II and III models. Ms Clarke said it started after she tagged JLR in a tweet about a small Land Rover birthday cake. "They got in touch and asked if I could make a cake in the shape of an engine to mark the opening of their new engine plant. "A woman then asked me if I could make a Land Rover cake. "It was originally meant to be quite small, but I asked them if they wanted something that would really impress people." Ms Clarke said she was getting married in October, a week before the Cake International competition at Birmingham's NEC. Rather than enter this year, she said she planned to bake "the best wedding cake that's ever been seen".	A giant cake has been made in the shape of a Land Rover by an award-winning amateur baker from the West Midlands.
Terence Brannigan, chair of the Maze/Long Kesh development Corporation, was speaking after roads around the former prison site were congested on the first day of the event. Mr Brannigan said rural roads were "not designed for that kind of traffic" But he said work was under way to put the new infrastructure in place. "In 12 months time it won't be the same," he said. "But let's not pretend that in 12 months time we are going to have two roads linking up to the motorway network. "The work is going on now, as we speak,  in respect of putting two links into the motorway, one from the east and one from the west. "We are doing environmental studies now in order to get clearance. We will then have to go to planning and from that we will then be able to build the two roads." Up to 80,000 people are expected to attend the three-day event, which has moved from its previous home at the King's Hall in Belfast. On Wednesday, First Minister Peter Robinson said he hoped any problems with access would be overcome. Mr Brannigan said getting the infrastructure sorted had been a priority for the corporation, but acknowledged there was a  "rigorous process" to complete. "If people have to sit in queues for a long period of time, it can spoil what is a magnificent show, a fantastic event and the showcase for Northern Ireland," he said. "The money has been ring-fenced so we can't complain that we haven't got the money, we can't complain that we are not getting the support. "But there is a due process we have to go through.  It is frustrating, nonetheless it is a process we must go through." Visitors to this year's show have been urged to use public transport. The Balmoral Show website contains details of how to get to the show by car or by public transport.	About £20m has been pledged to construct two major roads linking the new site of Balmoral Show to the motorway network, it has been claimed.
The Scotland striker does envisage a return to the domestic scene in his homeland - but not in the near future. Naismith was not an automatic first choice after Norwich dropped down to the Championship in England. "They changed the manager and, looking forward, it's going to be really exciting," said the 30-year-old. Naismith moved to Carrow Road from Everton in January 2016, but he was unable to help prevent Alex Neil's Canaries being relegated and fell out of favour under his fellow Scot. After Neil was sacked in March, the striker was a more regular starter as Norwich ended the season with another Scotsman, Alan Irvine, in interim charge. Naismith realises more game-time will again be his goal under former Borussia Dortmund reserve-team coach Farke. "That's a factor," he said. "As you get older, it's all about routine and playing, so that's when you do need to think about playing more. "I've got two years left of my contract there, I still think I can contribute massively and help the club get to where they want to be, and we'll see how it goes in pre-season." Naismith has worked under a number of managers in his career and hopes Farke will have a similar impact on him as Roberto Martinez did at Everton. "You've got a new manager, a German, so it's something new for me," he said. "I'm hoping to learn lots from him. "Growing up, I had a lot of British-based managers who gave me my fundamental learning skills for what I've got and the type of player I am. "I had Martinez - that was the total opposite - and he gave me a whole new dimension on how to play the game. "I loved that and now, hopefully with the new manager, I'll learn much more. "The club has had a shake-up and no player at the club is safe - and that's probably a good situation for the club in terms of moving forward." Farke has already added Marley Watkins, the former Inverness Caledonian Thistle winger, from Barnsley to his forward options, but Naismith has no thoughts of being squeezed out at Carrow Road. "I signed expecting to see out my contract and that's what I think I'll be doing," said the Scot, who scored seven times in 32 appearances in the 2016-17 season. "I'll go down for pre-season. Obviously, when any new manager comes in, that can change if you're not in his plans. "I'm going back to work as hard as I can, show my worth and hopefully he accepts me and wants me to be a big part of his squad." Naismith's former club, Rangers, are embarking on a reshaping of their squad under new manager Pedro Caixinha, but Naismith does not see himself returning to Scotland just yet. "I think I will come back to Scotland at some point to play, to finish off hopefully, and I'll assess my options when that day comes, but I don't like to think too far in front," he added.	Steven Naismith is aiming to impress new Norwich City head coach Daniel Farke and has no plans to leave Carrow Road before the end of his contract.
The 19-year-old striker has appeared three times for Newcastle's first team. "It was my first time away from home. My mum's not there to do everything for me, so I've got to be a big man for myself," he told BBC Radio Northampton. "The football's obviously a bit different tempo-wise but I've managed to adapt to it and I'm enjoying it." He continued: "A little bit (of homesickness), missing my family a lot but other than that it's alright." Toney came through the Cobblers' youth ranks and scored 13 goals in 60 senior games, and is also the youngest player to represent Northampton. He was named the Under-21 Premier League's player of the month for September after two goals in three appearances for Newcastle legend Peter Beardsley's side. He also appeared in the Premier League as a substitute in September's 2-2 draw with Chelsea, and says that he is working on physical strength to compete in the top flight. "If you're not sharp, you're not involved," he said. "I wouldn't try to disrespect the League Two standard, but they are sharper (mentally) and know what they are doing a lot more. "You're trying to get stronger every day, especially at that level you need to be strong and fit, and that's the main thing I'm working on."	Ivan Toney has admitted he struggled with homesickness following his summer move from home-town club Northampton Town to Newcastle United.
Prison inspectors discovered the average period of stay at the facility near Gatwick Airport had risen from 28 to 48 days. Twenty-three people were held for more than a year. The Home Office said it did not want to detain people for longer than necessary but some had prolonged the process. Brook House holds almost 400 adult male asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national offenders. Despite a push by the Home Office last year to reduce the number of people being detained, inspectors could not identify why periods of detention had lengthened. The report added that some detainees at the G4S-run centre had been held for excessive periods due to "unreasonable delays in immigration decision making". Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said the lack of analysis made it "hard to see how detention periods could be systematically reduced and the inevitably negative outcomes for detainees mitigated". A 2016 Home Office review said fewer people should be detained in immigration centres, while pointing out that each place cost Â£34,000 a year. In response to the report a spokesman said: "Detention is an important tool that helps us remove those with no right to be in the country and it is vital that this is carried out with dignity and respect." But he said some of those being held had attempted to frustrate the removal process by failing to provide accurate and timely information about their identity. He said of the people leaving detention in 2016, 64% left within 29 days and 93% in less than four months. The centre was assessed as "reasonably good" on safety, respect, activities, and preparation for removal or release, but inspectors were concerned that the residential units "very closely resembled" a prison. Director of the removal centre, Ben Saunders, said inspectors had "rightly" identified the purpose-built design was stark in some places, and G4S would work with the Home Office, which owns the buildings, to soften the environment. Brook House opened in 2009 but a year later was branded "fundamentally unsafe". A further report in 2012 found there were still "significant concerns", but in 2013 inspectors saw sustained improvement.	Four men have been held for more than two years at Brook House immigration removal centre as the average length of detentions has grown, a report found.
The move comes a day after a federal appeals court in San Francisco lifted a ban that had been in place since 2008. Many Californian gay couples then rushed to get married. But the opponents say the appeals court acted prematurely because by law they had more time to appeal before the ban can be lifted. Friday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court followed a ruling by the US Supreme Court against supporters of the California ban on gay marriage. On Saturday the Alliance Defending Freedom, which supports the ban, filed the petition asking the Supreme Court to overrule the order by appeals court. The group argued that by law it had 25 days to challenge the Supreme Court ruling, and therefore that the ban should not have been lifted. The Alliance Defending Freedom described the appeals court order as "the latest in a long line of judicial irregularities". The gay marriage ban - known as Proposition 8 - was approved by voters in 2008, months after California's supreme court decided such unions were legal. The two couples then launched the legal challenge. As the state of California refused to defend the proposition, the group that sponsored it stepped up to do so. But on Wednesday the Supreme Court ruled that a private party could not challenge the earlier lower court ruling, as it could not demonstrate it would suffer injury if same-sex marriages were allowed.	Opponents of same-sex marriage in California have filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court to try to halt gay weddings in the state.
Thick smoke has been billowing from the fire in Slitting Mill Road in Rugeley, Staffordshire, since the blaze began on 5 September. The fire service said a controlled burn was taking place over fears water supplies could be contaminated. It is not known how long it will take to put the fire out. More updates on this and other stories in Staffordshire Resident Steve Povey said he and others were also concerned about "something toxic" in the air that could affect people's long-term health, including his pregnant daughter. Alison Shaw, manager of the nearby Horns Inn, said the pub's takings were also down because of the blaze. "Last week alone we have been down Â£3,000... we're very angry about it." MP for Cannock Chase Amanda Milling also said it was "unacceptable" the fire was still burning. The fire service said it was informed there was to be a two-hour controlled burn on the land on 5 September, but later received a 999 call to say it had got out of control. Dermot Hogan, group manager of Staffordshire Fire Service, said he was aware of residents' frustrations. Crews have been smothering part of the fire with soil, using foam to suppress the smoke and trying to remove burnt waste, he said. The Environment Agency said there were fears the water run off could contaminate the local watercourse and potentially impact groundwater supplies. Staffordshire County Council confirmed the land owner was instructed to remove rubbish from the site in June, and has since been served with enforcement notices.	Residents are angry they have to keep their doors and windows shut 10 days after 1,000 tonnes of waste caught fire on farmland.
The England Lions batsman ended on 117 as the hosts made 255-6 in 92 overs in their pursuit of overhauling Kent for second spot and £43,000 prize money. Skipper Daryl Mitchell weighed in with 67 as he completed 1,000 first-class runs for the fourth time in his career. Ben Cotton picked up 3-46for Derbyshire on his firstteam recall. The visitors have not managed a Championship away victory and are hoping to avoid going an entire season without a win on the road for the first time since 2008. Worcestershire batsman Joe Clarke told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "It was quite difficult out there. The pitch is very slow. Once you get in, it is a lot easier but to start with it is very tough. "It has got a little bit more pace in it now but this morning it was very slow and credit to Daryl Mitchell. He did a fantastic job in getting us through that period. "It meant a lot to get a hundred because we've been struggling a little bit with the bat.  In the last few weeks, we haven't been getting the scores we'd have liked and to be there at the end is very pleasing. Derbyshire bowler Ben Cotton told BBC Radio Derby: "It was nice to take a couple of wickets on my return. It took me a while to settle in for the first five or six overs, then I found a nice rhythm and took the wickets we needed. "You've just got to put as many balls as you can in the right area and hopefully there is enough there to take an edge or get an lbw. "Tony Palladino and Tom Milnes started well after tea and put some pressure on them and due to their hard work I took a wicket and managed to get another near the end as well."	Joe Clarke made his fifth County Championship century of the summer as Worcestershire batted out the opening day against Derbyshire at New Road.
William Porterfield completed his 16th Ireland century as they added 73 runs before declaring on 240-7 to leave the Dutch needing an unlikely 343 to win. Stephan Myburgh's 85 steadied the Dutch after Wesley Barresi suffered a duck. A 60-run partnership by Ben Cooper and Peter Borren left the Dutch on 186-4 as played was halted at 18:30 BST. After a number of rain delays in the contest, Ireland utilised their right to play for another hour after the scheduled finish time of 18:00 BST before captains Porterfield and Borren shook hands. Resuming on their overnight 167-4, Porterfield batted for just 11 more overs before declaring for the second time in the game. By then Porterfield had shown all his class in an excellent 108 while Kevin O'Brien had chipped in with a quick-fire 50. The visitors' unlikely run chase took an early blow as Tim Murtagh trapped Barresi lbw without scoring. However, a second-wicket partnership of 107 between Myburgh and Dan ter Braak helped ensure that they would leave Dublin with a share of the spoils. Simi Singh was best with the ball for Ireland in the second innings with 2-19 as unbeaten knocks of 37 and 25 from Cooper and Peter Borren ensured the dogged Dutch earned a deserved draw. The result moved Ireland to the top of the Intercontinental Cup table but they will need to beat Scotland in November and hope that Afghanistan slip up in the one of the two remaining games to retain the title.	Ireland's hopes of retaining the Intercontinental Cup were dealt a blow as they were held to a draw by the Netherlands at Malahide.
Csongor Sandor, 30, of Dallow Road, Luton, was arrested in June after police, acting on information, found a photo of the attack on his phone. Other images of children were also found stored on the device. At Luton Crown Court he admitted sexually assaulting a child under 13. Sandor also admitted three counts of making indecent images of children. The court heard that at the time of his arrest, police found a photo of a young girl being sexually assaulted by Sandor which he had taken three months previously. The former police officer, from Budapest, had been living in the UK for four years. The court was told he had been employed at an Amazon depot in Hemel Hempstead and was described as a "man of good character". Judge Michael Kay QC said although Sandor appeared willing to seek help to tackle his urges concerning children, he posed a risk to the public of committing further serious offences. He jailed him for eight years and eight months and told Sandor that once he was released he would be made subject to an extended period on licence for five years. He has also been put on the sex offenders' register.	A former Hungarian policeman living in the UK has been jailed for almost nine years for sexually assaulting a child, in a case a judge said showed "extraordinary levels of perversion".
"I'm 64," he said of his fascination with the 1836 battle. "When I was five or six years old, this thing began." Collins' collection includes a fringed leather pouch used by Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie's legendary knife. "There's things in there that will make your mouth drop," the Genesis star said in San Antonio. The donation was accepted on Tuesday by Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, who is campaigning for a new historical centre to house Collins' collection. "Texans are deeply indebted to Phil Collins,'' Patterson said. "He is giving us back our heritage. "Now these Texas treasures need a home where all can see them and study from them and learn about how Texans won our liberty.'' The legendary battle, named after a former mission in San Antonio, saw 1,500 Mexican troops lay siege to 200 Texans fighting for Texas independence. Collins said he first became interested in the Alamo after watching a 1950s TV series about Crockett, the famed frontiersman who died in the conflict. The Grammy and Academy Award winner's collection includes more than 200 items and is thought to be the largest in private hands. "My nine-year-old son was saying, 'Why are you going to give it all away, Dad? I thought I was going to have it,''' he told reporters.	Singer Phil Collins has handed over his large collection of Alamo memorabilia to a Texas museum, calling the donation the end of a six-decade "journey".
The X-47B jet is being designed by weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman for the US Navy. It was in the air for 29 minutes during its maiden flight and reached an altitude of 5,000 feet. Officials say it will help form part of a new generation of unmanned drones and works like a smaller version of the B-2 Stealth Bomber. As such it would be very different from the current fleet of remote controlled military planes like the Predator and Reaper. Instead the X-47B would be virtually invisible to radar and fly at much faster speeds than those older, propeller driven machines. In a statement Captain Jaime Engdahl, a programme manager for the warplane, said: "Today we got a glimpse towards the future as the Navy's first-ever tailless, jet-powered unmanned aircraft took to the skies." The flight was primarily designed to test the jet's guidance and navigation systems and the aerodynamic control of the tailless design. It was controlled from the ground by a joint team of the company's engineers and Navy specialists. Northrop is building the bomber as part of a Â£395 million contract signed in 2007. Janis Pamiljans is vice-president of Northrop Grumman's Aerospace Systems sector. "Designing a tailless, fighter-sized unmanned aircraft from a clean sheet is no small feat. "Commitment, collaboration and uncompromising technical excellence among the Navy [and] Northrop Grumman made today's flight a reality. "We are indeed honoured to have given wings to the Navy's vision for exploring unmanned carrier aviation." Although it will be several years before the X-47B is ready for operations officials say it should have its first test flight from an aircraft carrier in 2013. Follow Radio 1's technology reporter Dan Whitworth on Twitter	Military chiefs in America say a new, unmanned stealth bomber has carried out its first test flight.
It is certainly the most quotable, and without question the most revelatory: inside a previously hidden world, showing sport as raw and brutal and beautiful and comic, aped many times but never quite matched. Living With Lions, the fly-on-the-kitbag story of the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa, is 20 years old. It came to both define that epic trip, and give it an eternal youth. Two decades on, a special BBC Radio 5 Live programme has brought together the men who made it and those who became its unwitting stars. This is the inside story of the ultimate inside story. Cameraman and director Duncan Humphries (DH): "My mate Fred and I had been making commercials about mops and buckets. We were looking for something more fun to do, so we went to the pub at midday. By 3.30pm we had this blinding idea: why not do a film about the Lions?" Director Fred Rees (FR): "We went to tour manager Fran Cotton. He said: 'Sounds like a good idea, it'll cost you thirty grand.' "My father and I, who ran a production company, decided we'd take the risk, because we were told by Fran and everyone else that once we had the rights then BBC or ITV would come on board and give us the money to actually make it. So we paid the £30,000, and went to the BBC and ITV, and instead they all said: 'You're mad, the Lions are never going to win, no-one's going to want to watch this film, we won't give you any money.' "We were terrified. What do we do now? We're on the edge of a cliff. Either we've lost all this money, or we have to find a whole load more to make the film. So, in great stupidity or wisdom, we remortgaged my house." Winger John Bentley (JB): "These two may have had a conversation with Fran, but [coaches] Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer actually objected to their presence. They didn't want a circus. They decided to ignore these guys. "On the first Friday, all the players went for a drink. These boys were there. They explained they wanted to do it fly-on-the-wall. I told them they wouldn't get it, and they needed a player to help them." DH: "We all got full Lions training kit. So every day we filmed with them we were wearing the same kit as them. Straight away we started blending into the background. "It had never been agreed that we could put microphones on Telfer and McGeechan. But we just did it, every day. And they assumed it must have been in the contract. Which it wasn't." FR: "We lived in a limbo. We weren't the journalists, and we weren't the team. We lived in a place in between. We were ignored most of the time, which was great for the film. You don't want people conscious you are filming them." JB: "If it's any consolation, Martin Johnson ignored all the players too." Minutes before the opening tour match, against Eastern Province, captain Jason Leonard gathered his team-mates around him in a tight circle. His speech - set against the sound of clattering studs, nervous retching and wild exhortations ("Squeeze the arms! Squeeze!") - was Churchill meets Barking via several broken noses ("What more do you want to achieve? It's there for us…"). We nearly never knew it happened. DH: "Before he called the lads together, Jason threw us out. So Fred and I had a conflab, and we thought, if we don't get in the first dressing room, by the time the Tests come round we won't have a chance. We had to get in there. "So we went to see Fran. 'Fran, we shook hands on this.' 'Leave it to me.' Fran walked in, tapped Jason on the shoulder with his big hand, and that was it - we were in." JB: "The camera had never been in a Lions dressing room. Neither had I. But we didn't even notice they were there." FR: "There was a lot of swearing. We had one 20-second section with Keith Wood where he dropped 13 f-bombs. "We phoned him up afterwards and told him. He said: 'Yeah, that sounds a bit much. I might have to open a supermarket or something.' So we halved the swearing, and when we played it back to him, he said: 'That really doesn't sound like me - you better put it all back in.' JB: The phantom puker was Neil Jenkins. And sometimes Keith Wood too." The hand-held camera Bentley asked for was passed on to team-mate Rob Wainwright and then his fellow Scot Doddie Weir. While Weir's first attempt at self-filming did not go well ("Take two, because in part one I had a wee swear…") the next few weeks revealed just how strong a bond a Lions tour can forge - and what it's like when that bond is forcibly broken. In the tour match against Mpumalanga, Weir's knee was wrecked by a brutal stamp at a ruck. When he was told in the dressing room by doctor James Robson that his tour was over, Humphries' camera was there to capture his reaction. Media playback is not supported on this device Doddie Weir (DW): "You say it breaks your heart to watch it. It broke mine too. "I tried to look cheerful for the boys. It's the way I've always been, to show a positive side. But I was going home, and it had been a wonderful trip and a wonderful tour. "The rugby was pretty special, yet the biggest wrench for me was leaving the 35 players. Bentos [John Bentley] was pretty special. He was my new mate. Leaving that was the biggest thing. The video picked that up, and our camaraderie." DH: "It was close to feeling like I was intruding on private grief. Bentos and Rob and Doddie had been so brilliant and open to us, and so you'd developed more of a relationship with them. "Witnessing Doddie - who had been playing so well on that tour - there was a moment when you wondered about turning the camera off. But you stay, and if someone says 'sod off', you sod off slightly slower. "When I stopped filming, I said: 'Doddie, I'm really sorry.' It wasn't a nice thing to film, but it shows Doddie as the person he is." DW: "I was a shy boy. Meeting John Bentley, who was the main social convenor, really opened my eyes." JB: "There were some lonely days. My wife had the tour itinerary, and she would send letters and photos of the kids. My daughter was six months old when I left, and she was changing in front of my eyes. It was a big ask for me. "After I went to see Doddie to say goodbye, I went back to my room and cried my eyes out. I didn't want to be there then. And Doddie was the nicest man in the world. I love you Doddie, I really do." DW: "You're pretty special, Bentos. You're my favourite." JB: "I really love you. This is a wonderful opportunity to tell everyone you love me. Tell me you love me. Please." DW: "I'll text you." Media playback is not supported on this device After beating Western Province, the squad retired to Cantina Tequila in Cape Town for a few beers. And then several more. With champagne. And tequila. And a lot of singing - even from Martin Johnson. FR: "The Lions weren't holding back, so we didn't think they minded filming it. We just rocked up." DH: "I went in the car with Jonno and Geech [Ian McGeechan]. By then we were part of the trip." JB: "We had a great night. It finished some time on Monday. That's the real side of touring. "People ask why Wonderwall became such a big song for us. We were in the bar that night, and it just came on. We didn't choose it. We hadn't played it in the dressing room.  Rugby tours are all about singing, but that just came on and we all sang it. "The words just worked. 'I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now…'" DH: "We wish you'd chosen another song, because it cost us a fortune in rights to use it." Media playback is not supported on this device Forwards coach Telfer was a man possessed on that tour. Convinced - correctly - the Test series would be won or lost up front, he hammered his forwards on the training pitch, then stirred their souls afterwards. The lines have lost little of their power over the past two decades. "There are two types of rugby players boys - honest ones, and the rest…" "This is your (bleep) Everest, boys. Very few ever get a chance in rugby terms to get for the top of Everest. You have the chance today. "They don't think (bleep) all of us. Nothing. We're here just to make up the (bleep) numbers… "You have to find your own solace - your own drive, your ambition, your own inner strength. Because the moment's arrived for the greatest game of your (bleep) life." DH: "We used to call Jim 'Grandad', although not to his face. He was this gentle, grey-haired man. And then he would turn up for training, and this monster would appear." FR: "It's one of the magic things, that we managed to capture Jim and Ian making these amazing speeches. They have no ego, those two. "It wasn't about them, and them feeling they were achieving. It was all about the players. Jim's words, and his delivery, are gold." DH: "You would hear Jim rehearsing, all grumbling and mumbling. And then he would deliver it perfectly, and you would think, 'Where did that come from?'" JB: "We talk about groundbreaking footage for the viewers. I'd never seen those speeches. None of the backs had. They were made to the forwards. None of the forwards had mentioned it. I watched it, and thought, 'Wow!'" Ian McGeechan (IM): "It's the happiest I've ever seen Jim. That was him coming out. It was brilliant." JB: "It was magical footage. You couldn't script it. That wasn't pantomime; that wasn't done for the camera. They were just lucky to have caught it." DH: "I was a table away when I filmed it, but I don't think they even knew we were there. They were so, so focused. "I remember the build-up to the Everest one. The sound man said: 'Jim's off on one…' He was grumbling, he was mumbling, doing the rehearsals in his own mind. I thought, 'Don't muck this zoom up.'" Three hours before the second Test, with the Lions 80 minutes away from a historic series win, McGeechan sat his players down in the team hotel. His speech would be different in tone to those of Telfer, but its impact was just as significant: "On that field sometimes today, all it will be between you is a look. No words, just a look. That will say everything. And the biggest thing it will say is 'you are special'." JB: "That Geech speech smashes me." FR: "There's so much heart in there. There is something very beautiful about that speech." JB: "I was sat there crying. Crying, and scared to lift my hand to my face because of the crying. "Because he spoke about the things that were outside the room, like your family. I missed mine so badly. I hadn't seen them for seven weeks. All of us did. Geech understood." DH: "We had two Churchillian speakers. A few years later, the speeches on behind-the-scenes films felt too rehearsed. But there were times when I was filming when you could feel the hairs on the back of your neck rising." Tour over, series won, Fred sat down to edit the hundreds of hours of footage down to just under three hours. DH: "The blokes who ran the four Home Unions were shocked, when they came to watch it, by all the swearing." FR: "We played them the final sequence. When Jerry Guscott drops the winning drop-goal in the second Test, [chairman of the Lions committee] Ray Williams leapt to his feet and shouted: 'Yes!' They were OK with the swearing after that." JB: "When we had the tour reunion, Fred and Duncan came to it. They became like friends." FR: "The film is two hours 50 minutes long. The Lions win the Test series in the last five minutes. If they'd lost the series, it would still have been the same film. "We knew we'd made something pretty magical. We released it as a VHS, and it quite quickly became the most successful rugby video there had been. You can never know how the world will react, but we knew we had something special." DH: "In 2005 I was filming an advert with Jonno and Brian O'Driscoll. Brian was asked what got him into rugby. He replied that the Living With Lions film had been one of the big reasons. "Jonno started laughing. 'This bloke made it.' Brian took my hand, shook it and said: 'Thank you very much.'" JB: "Everyone around me said it should have been called 'Living With John Bentley'. "I heard from the tour press officer when the film had been put together, and was told that I should have a look before it came out. So I went into the garden, and shared the news with my wife of what I'd been doing. "She went ballistic. 'You were supposed to be playing rugby! What the hell were you doing? Why are you having to look at it?' "A week or so later, I was away playing with Newcastle. I phoned home to see how the kids were. My wife told me a package had arrived for me. "'Oh really?' 'Yes, it's a video from your trip to South Africa.' "'Oh God…' "'Well I've watched it, John, and it's just you being an idiot. As usual.'" IM: "My wife tells me that when she's feeling depressed, Living With Lions is one of the videos she puts on. For that moment in time, it was the watershed moment. The Lions were here to stay."	It might just be the greatest sports documentary to ever come out of Britain.
American Wambach, the world's all-time leading international goalscorer, was arrested on Saturday for drink-driving. Court documents connected to her arrest said "the defendant tried cocaine at age 25". Mini USA, one of Wambach's sponsors, said it was withdrawing adverts for the car featuring the 35-year-old, who retired in December. In a statement, the company said: "This behaviour is against the values we promote as an organisation and the safety of everyone on the road is a priority here at Mini." Wambach, who scored 184 goals in 255 games and helped USA to 2015 World Cup glory, was arraigned on Tuesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Portland. She was not present, but her lawyer entered a plea of not guilty on her behalf. Court documents said Wambach has no prior arrest record. In the documents, officers wrote that she first used marijuana at age 24 and her last use was at 25. A Portland police spokesman said it is standard for officers to ask about prior drug use.	World Cup winner and two-time Olympic champion Abby Wambach has admitted taking cocaine and smoking marijuana.
Howe, 37, has overseen three of the club's six promotions since he was first appointed manager in 2008-09. The new deal is believed to take Howe through until 2020. He had two-and-a-half years left on his previous contract with the Cherries. "We've been in discussions since gaining promotion. I'm very pleased to have committed my future to here," he told the club's website. Following a short spell as manager of Burnley, Howe returned to manage the club at the end of 2012, leading them to promotions from League One and the Championship within three seasons. "I'm delighted Eddie has committed his future to the club," owner Maxim Demin said.	Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has signed an extension to his contract.
Mr Sarao, who traded from his parents' home in Hounslow, west London, is accused of market manipulation that caused a 1,000-point fall on the US Dow Jones index in 2010. US prosecutors allege he made about $875,000 (Â£600,000) from the move. He faces 22 charges in the US, including fraud charges, all of which he denies. The charges include "spoofing" - the practice of buying or selling with the intent to cancel the transaction before execution. He was arrested in April after being charged by the US Justice Department. After spending four months in custody in the UK, he was released on bail last year. The "flash crash" on 6 May 2010 sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly plunging by more than 1,000 points before recovering. Mr Sarao, 37, is accused of using software to "spoof" markets by generating large sell orders that pushed down prices. He then cancelled those trades and bought the contracts at the lower prices US authorities allege. They claim he made roughly Â£27m in profit over five years from illegal trades. Mr Sarao has denied doing anything wrong and previously told the Westminster court in May he was simply "being good at my job". The hearing, at Westminster Magistrates' Court, continues on Friday.	A hearing into whether Navinder Sarao, the so-called "flash crash" day trader, can be extradited to the US has begun.
For its 3-2 victory over a team backed by phone-maker Samsung, SKT's five members shared a prize of $2m (Â£1.64m) between them. The win is the third time in four years that SKT has taken the title. It also won the title in 2015. The final ran for six hours and was held in front of almost 20,000 LoL fans at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. SKT's Lee Sang-hyeok, aka Faker, was named as the most valuable player of the tournament. The total prize pot for the tournament was $5m with $750,000 going to second place team Samsung. The money available to teams taking part was increased by fan contributions. Writing on the Rock, Paper Shotgun gaming news site, Philippa Warr said the final had been "breathtaking", as the Samsung team had fought back from losing the first two games. However, she said, everything had changed in the "beautiful" third game, which lasted 70 minutes and saw Samsung wrest a keenly contested win from SKT. Samsung then took the fourth game more easily to set up the decider. In the event, Warr said, SKT's "fluidity" and experience had won through, giving them the title, cash and Summoner's Cup trophy. League of Legends is a massively popular game involving two teams of five players fighting over a small map Each player controls a hero outfitted with a variety of attacks or defence abilities, and the winner is the first to destroy their opponent's base. According to statistics from Riot Games, which created LoL, about 100 million people play the game every month.	South Korean team SKT Telecom T1 has won the 2016 world championships of the League of Legends (LoL) video game.
Scottish FA regulations prohibit players from betting on any football. Annan Athletic chairman Henry McClelland and Inverness player Lewis Horner were this week charged by the national body with gambling offences. "We have to have an adult conversation regarding a number of issues relating to gambling," Wishart said. "The effectiveness of the rule when people are still gambling, is it fit for purpose in the modern day, why are individuals still gambling, are there financial problems, mental health problems, addictions behind the scenes? "Since the rule was brought into place, there's been nobody charged with spot-fixing or match-fixing, which is very, very important, and therefore the game perhaps is suffering from poor headlines and I don't think the situation at the moment is helping the image of Scottish football." Wishart admits he is uncertain whether the existing regulations are adequate, and reiterates his belief that Scottish football's authorities must join forces to tackle the problem. "Sometimes I move from one side to the other," Wishart told BBC Scotland of his appraisal of the rules. "I can absolutely see why the rule is in place, because we want to stop and discourage people from spot or match-fixing. And that was the original purpose of the regulation. "But since then, [the Scottish FA] have brought in a specific regulation that addresses spot and match-fixing, and has much, much heavier sanctions. If we sit in Scottish football as stakeholders and don't do anything, don't address or discuss the issues then I don't think we're doing our jobs. "Because at the moment player after player, perhaps betting on games across Europe, now we've got a chairman and we may have others as well, traipsing up the steps at Hampden to massive negative headlines, and I don't think it's doing our game any good. I would just call for a proper and adult discussion on all these issues." PFA Scotland's chairman, former Dundee United midfielder John Rankin, told BBC Scotland in April that gambling is "rife" throughout Scottish football. Ex-Inverness player Barry Wilson believes there should be an amnesty for players regarding historical bets - a suggestion Wishart says should be considered. "Certainly, we should be looking at and considering an amnesty," Wishart added. "There are a number of people who have been charged for what are ostensibly historical issues going back a number of years when perhaps they weren't aware on the rules. "So I thought perhaps an amnesty would give us a start from zero, and then with a renewed education programme we cam move on from there. "We're trying to address the issue and the individual. We see the problems individuals have that perhaps people in the public don't see, where people have mental health problems, financial problems and addiction issues, which are huge things. "I think we have to get away from the headline-makers - are people breaching the regulations? Yes, they are. That's wrong and if people are breaching a rule, we have to look at the effectiveness of that rule, and the issues around that, and that's where we're trying to take the conversation."	PFA Scotland's chief executive Fraser Wishart argues the effectiveness of Scottish football's gambling rules should be examined.
Local MP Ian Lucas said people were concerned about the impact it could have if the prison on Wrexham Industrial Estate assumes a local name. In a letter, prisons minister Jeremy Wright says local names are "generally avoided as most local people object". He said it was likely people would be invited to propose names for the Â£212m prison which is due to open in 2017. Work is expected to start in August, creating up to 1,000 jobs, to build the prison which will house 2,100 inmates, making it the largest prison in the UK. The overall project spend is lower than the original Â£250m estimate and the construction will involve local business and enterprises, with 100 apprenticeships created.	Wrexham's new super-prison is unlikely to be named after the county borough, says the prison minister.
Daniel Smith, from Rochdale, was just 21 when he was commended for his brave actions in Iraq. But he has since found it difficult to get treatment, his marriage has failed and he is struggling to find work. For a number of nights each week, Mr Smith parks in a lay-by and sleeps in his car, to get away from people and control his anger management issues. "I just don't like being around people sometimes I just want to close myself off. Basically I don't like living on people's sofas, I am not relying on people to put up with me. When I am depressed I would rather be alone so I've just got used to doing it now," he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. "I have got my quilt and stuff in the back and I have got my internal wifi here so it's like a mobile house." It is thought Mr Smith's PTSD was sparked after the vehicle patrol he was part of was blown up by roadside bombs twice in a week in 2005. The medically trained fusilier tried to help many of his colleagues who had received terrible injuries. "I took a lot of guilt because obviously I thought I did my best at the time when I was treating them. I didn't really think they would die, I just thought they would be injured or go back home, but they passed away and obviously that was a big shock to us and I didn't know how to take that," he said. "I became a bit scared then. I didn't know what to think or what my next step would be. Because it happened to me twice and I thought it will happen to me third time unlucky." The Ministry of Defence citation when he received his medal said: "With no regard for his own safety and with his focus firmly on saving those in the vehicle, he commenced the evacuation of the casualties from the burning chaos." What is PTSD? Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder caused by witnessing or being involved in a frightening or distressing event. People naturally feel afraid when in danger, but the legacy of some traumatic events is a change in perception of fear. They may feel stressed or frightened in day-to-day life. Diagnosing PTSD But Mr Smith, now 31, blames himself for not being able to save his friends and does not think he deserves the medal. In fact, he does not really remember being awarded it by Prince Charles. "I didn't really take it all in, I was very numb that day because I was on medication anyway so my mood and my temperament wasn't the best," he says. Figures from veterans' mental health charity Combat Stress show Mr Smith is not alone. It has seen a 28% increase in veterans seeking mental health support from April 2014 to 2015, treble the 9% increase seen the year before. Almost 6,000 are registered with the charity, and it says it has never been busier in its 97-year history. Mr Smith says he got good treatment at first, with six weeks of intensive therapy, but it tailed off, leaving him frustrated and bitter. Eventually he got a medical discharge from the army. His marriage failed because of his anger, which also caused him to lose his job as a bailiff. "At the time I was blown up I didn't really think it would affect me. It didn't feel reality at the time but a year later it had time to sink in, your depression kicks in, you're drinking. You don't realise you are changing, but other people see you are and you just become very angry towards them," he explains. His father, Gary, says he has been "pushed from pillar to post" since leaving the army and the family has so far spent over Â£3,000 to try to get him diagnosed and treated. "Basically all they have done is put a sticking plaster over a gaping wound and just sent him into general society to pick up the pieces which is really difficult, because society doesn't pick the pieces up from remnants of the army," he says. "There was no follow-up from the NHS, there were no papers handed over from the military to the NHS to follow on his treatment." His father says he worries about his future, as without treatment or a support network he thinks a long-term recovery is unlikely. And Mr Smith says he is bitter about how he has been treated by the army. "I feel like I have been cast aside until the next person comes along because I haven't done anything wrong," he says. The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on individual cases. But it said: "The government is absolutely committed to the mental health of our armed forces and provides a wide range of support both during and after service. "We work closely with other government departments and agencies so that where necessary, there is continued effective treatment and support on transition to civilian life." Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.	Better support is needed for members of the armed forces who leave the military with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), one of the youngest recipients of the George Medal has said.
As first reported by The Express, the settled community in the Hovefields area of Wickford reported hardcore-laden lorries arrive at the weekend. The lorries were followed by large mobile homes. Basildon Council said it is aware of "an alleged breach of planning laws". Essex Police has also been informed. The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford. Dale Farm was Europe's largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011. Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday. After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road. Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through. "If the council does not prosecute over this and deal with the situation urgently they will have a Dale Farm II, but bigger." Phil Turner, leader of Basildon Council, said: "Basildon Council is aware of an alleged breach of planning laws in the Hovefields area. "We share the frustrations of residents, but the council does not have powers of arrest and must follow the proper legal process. "As a public body, we must act within the existing legal framework, as set out by Parliament, and this adds considerable time and cost in dealing with such situations. "However, residents can be assured that the council is taking all appropriate steps to deal with unauthorised development." Essex Police said it was investigating a criminal damage report involving the fence and has urged any witnesses to contact them. A police spokesman said: "Essex Police is aware of an unauthorised traveller development on land near Hovefields Avenue. "We are liaising with the local authority and will continue to monitor the situation."	Residents have called for urgent action amid claims that a new mass Traveller site is being created at the end of their road in Essex.
Fears have been expressed by some in the industry that a breakdown in the current agreement could result in more cash machines charging a fee. LINK - which operates the network of 70,000 ATMs in the UK - said that its commercial model is "under review". Some banks are thought to be unhappy about the fees they currently pay. As a result all 38 members of the LINK network are due to have a series of meetings to try to reach an agreement, beginning next week. At the moment around 75% of ATMs are free to use. But Peter McNamara, the Chief Executive of Note Machine, a member of LINK, said that consumers could face being charged at many more of them. "If the proposals that are being put forward by LINK went ahead, we estimate that you could be losing up to a quarter of the free-to-use ATM sites in the UK," he told BBC Radio Five Live. At the centre of the dispute are the so-called interchange fees. When a customer of one bank uses a cash machine belonging to another bank, the customer's own bank pays a fee to the operator, in the region of 25p. It's thought that banks with a large number of card-holders feel they are being unfairly penalised. "Some of the very big banks have a lot of cardholders who do a lot of transactions, and they feel that perhaps their share of what they are putting in the pot that pays for ATMs is disproportionate and potentially too high," said Mr McNamara. "They may go outside the LINK mechanism to find a cheaper way of making those machines run, which is the risk in the system that could develop." LINK said the discussions could take several months. "We operate in a competitive market and there are other ATM networks in the UK available for card issuers and ATM operators if our model becomes unattractive," a spokesperson said. "We are working hard to avoid this situation."	The operator of the UK's ATM network has said it is working hard to keep cash withdrawals free for millions of bank customers.
The firm, which has had a presence in the city for more than 30 years, says it follows a restructuring review. The office will shut later this year but a new "commercial trading site" will open in the city in September. Staff are to be offered redeployment around the UK, a spokesman said. Union Unite called it a "big blow" for the finance sector in Birmingham. Regional secretary, Gerard Coyne, said: "[Royal Sun Alliance] have made us aware of their intention to close the Birmingham office. Updates on this and more from Birmingham and Black Country "We will now enter into discussions with them and try to get them to review their decision in Birmingham as it's a big blow to our members and the finance and insurance sector in the city." Royal Sun Alliance told staff on Wednesday that 190 jobs were at risk of redundancy but was "committed" to staying in the city. It has been at its current site in Colmore Row for 20 years. A spokesman said the firm's review showed it could work more effectively "if teams doing the same kind of work, or focused on the same kinds of customers, are situated together". "Unfortunately, a number of our employees will be impacted by these changes and we will be working closely with them over the next few months and will look to redeploy our people wherever possible."	One of the UK's biggest insurers Royal Sun Alliance is to close its Birmingham office, putting 190 jobs at risk.
The then-prime minister called the German leader days before the EU referendum, as opinion polls seemed to show voters moving to the Leave camp. But he later abandoned the idea of getting her and other EU leaders to make a statement granting concessions. No 10 decided it could be portrayed by Vote Leave as a sign of weakness. Newsnight has learned that Mr Cameron telephoned the German chancellor to ask whether she would be willing to issue a statement with fellow EU leaders granting the UK concessions on free movement. Under the plan, thrashed out at a meeting in Downing Street, the president of France Francois Hollande, the European Council president Donald Tusk and the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker would all put their names to the joint statement by EU leaders. The former prime minister approached his German counterpart after Vote Leave had dominated the campaign in the wake of the publication of official migration statistics at the end of May. These showed the government had once again failed to meet its net migration target. The idea of a joint statement by EU leaders was eventually shelved. Newsnight understands that at an EU summit after the EU referendum the German chancellor made it clear to Mr Cameron that there could be no compromise for EU members on rules governing the free movement of people. The appeal by Mr Cameron to Mrs Merkel followed a discussion among senior Downing Street aides who said that the prime minister should reprise the success of "the Vow" in the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Cameron and the other main Westminster parties had moved to shore up the pro-UK vote in the final stages of that campaign in 2014 by pledging to devolve further powers to the Scottish parliament. The move considered by the prime minister, revealed by Newsnight in an investigation into the EU referendum campaign, shows that Downing Street came close to ripping up a key element of its strategy in the final stages. This was to focus on the economic risks of Brexit and to avoid discussing immigration on the grounds that Vote Leave would always say that the UK could never control its borders while it remained a member of the EU. In the end Downing Street maintained the focus of its campaign on the economy. Lord Cooper of Windrush, the Conservative peer who was the main pollster for the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, told Newsnight that the pro-EU side's failure to address concerns about immigration had been a weakness. He said: "The people who are very, very concerned about immigration, what they wanted was purely and simply for the UK to be able to have total control of its borders and total control of the flow of people into this country. And we didn't have an argument that could remotely compete with that. "It meant we couldn't really engage in the campaign on that vital issue. We didn't have much option but to keep trying to pivot back to the economic risks." One Downing Street source told Newsnight: "Fundamentally a question was put to the British public - would you be willing to be a little bit poorer to get control of immigration? We staked our chips on everyone going, 'Well, I don't want to be poorer.' They staked their chips on everyone going, 'I want to control immigration,' and they won." Lord Cooper also told Newsnight that the pro-EU side was forced into "humanely" phasing out a claim by George Osborne that a British exit from the EU would cost the average household £4,300 because voters did not believe it. Lord Cooper said: "The problem with that figure - the £4,300 - was firstly it sounded implausibly large to the ears of most people. Secondly it sounded strangely specific…The figure was sort of humanely phased out because we found when we tested the reaction in focus groups, we found people just rejected it. They didn't believe it." Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, said he feared that the death of the Labour MP Jo Cox a week before polling day could have ended his campaign, when news broke shortly after the UKIP leader Nigel Farage had launched a controversial poster on immigration. But Mr Elliott said that the UKIP poster had little impact on the Vote Leave campaign because he had distanced the official Leave campaign from UKIP. Nicholas Watt was reporting for Brexit Britain - a BBC Newsnight special one month on from the referendum result. A day of discussion and debate is being held in collaboration with Intelligence Squared at the Royal Geographical Society in London, from 13:00 BST on Saturday 23 July, followed by a special programme on BBC Two at 18:00 BST and afterwards on iPlayer. The hashtag for the event is #BrexitBritain.	David Cameron made a late appeal to Germany's Angela Merkel for limits on free movement of people if the UK voted Remain, BBC Newsnight has learned.
Tierra del Fuego judge Lilian Herraez ordered the authorities to seize boats and other assets worth $156m. Argentina claims sovereignty of the islands, which it calls the Malvinas. The oil companies named in the case are not based in Argentina and it is not clear how the measure will be implemented. Drilling for oil in the territorial waters around the Falklands began in 2010 despite opposition from Buenos Aires. Judge Herraez says the new ruling will take steps to try to seize the companies' assets abroad. The five companies mentioned are: Premier Oil Plc, Rockhopper Exploration Plc, Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd, Noble Energy Inc and Edison International Spa. Three of the companies are British-based, one is American, based in Texas, and one is French-owned, based in Italy. Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands in 1982. Argentina occupied the South Atlantic archipelago for 74 days, before British forces regained control. During the conflict, 255 British and about 650 Argentine servicemen were killed, along with three Falklands civilians. Argentina accuses Britain of colonialism, saying the islands lie some 700km (450 miles) off its coast. Britain has held the Falklands for 180 years and says the wishes of its 3,000 residents should be respected. The vast majority of them want the islands to remain a British overseas territory. "They want to remain British and that view should be respected by everybody, including by Argentina," said David Cameron after a 2013 referendum in which the islanders gave almost unanimous support for the status quo. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said at the time that Britain was "arrogant" and "bordering on stupidity" for refusing to negotiate on the future of the islands.	A federal judge in Argentina has ordered the seizure of assets of five companies drilling for oil in the Falkland Islands.
MSPs on the Equalities and Human Rights Committee said more needed to be done to tackle the problem in schools. Committee convener Christina McKelvie said it had heard "gut-wrenching" evidence from young people during its inquiry into the issue. But she stressed there was already some "inspiring" work being done. The committee's report said it had uncovered "a real sense that prejudice-based bullying is on the increase". It concluded that racism "has made a resurgence", gender-based bullying and harassment "appears to be commonplace", and bullying towards young lesbian or gay people "is still prevalent". The committee has made 29 recommendations, among them measures it wants the Scottish government to adopt in its forthcoming refreshed anti-bullying strategy. These include a preventative approach to bullying, improved research to understand the extent and nature of the problem, mandatory recording of bullying incidents and more training for teachers. The government and councils are also urged to "ensure that consent and healthy relationships be taught from the beginning of primary school in an age-appropriate manner to safeguard children" amid evidence of children as young as 12 being coerced into sexual activity. The Scottish government welcomed the report and said it would consider its recommendations carefully. The committee had spent eight months listening to evidence about bullying. Ms McKelvie, an SNP MSP, said: "We heard some gut-wrenching and heartbreaking stories. One stark reminder of the reality faced by far too many bullied young people is that 27% of LGBT children have attempted suicide. "But we have also heard of some inspiring and great practice going on around Scotland - and there are schools where bullying is now seen as not cool. "We are trying to bottle that attitude change and roll it out across the whole country." Susie McGuinness, a 19-year-old Glasgow University student, told her story of bullying and classroom harassment to MSPs while they were taking evidence for the report. She said: "I know from my own experience that there are instances of girls who have been filmed being assaulted, and that there is footage of rape going around schools and not being reported or dealt with. "People need to realise that sexual harassment and bullying of this nature is happening to girls aged 12 or 13. By primary 6, I was sitting in classes in which boys were taking it in turns to shout 'rape' the loudest and I'm not alone." The children's commissioner for Scotland, Bruce Adamson, said the report was a "call to action" for the authorities. "Bullying impacts children in a number of ways," he said. "It cuts right to the heart of their identity and their human dignity but it also has an impact on their access to other rights - like their  ability to have a full education, to engage in cultural activities to engage in playing. "And as we've seen from this report, and some of the really powerful evidence given, it has a real impact on things like their health including their mental health. "At the most extreme we see issues where it actually engages the right to life where a number of children, particularly children from the LGBTI community, have contemplated suicide - so this is a real call to action." A Scottish government spokeswoman said it funds its national anti-bullying service, Respectme, to support children, young people and their parents. She added: "Bullying of any kind is unacceptable. "That is why it is important for all schools and local authorities to have anti-bullying policies in place and it is vital that local authorities and teachers challenge any racist, homophobic and abusive behaviour in our schools."	Human rights should be taught from the earliest age possible to change attitudes to bullying, according to a Holyrood committee.
Craig Harvey, 31, denies assaulting consultant radiologist Marcel Strauss at Wishaw General on 24 February. He is also accused of assaulting a prison officer and wrestling with three others before trying to escape from the ultrasound department on the same day. Mr Harvey pled not guilty to all the charges during an appearance at the High Court in Glasgow. It is alleged that he repeatedly struck Dr Strauss on the arm with a blade, which was attached to a piece of plastic, to the doctor's severe injury and permanent disfigurement. Prosecutors also say that he assaulted prison officer James Muncie when he was "in lawful custody" and that he tried to detain the guard against his will in a toilet while holding the razor blade. The charge further alleges that Mr Harvey demanded the prison officer remove his handcuffs and attempted to strike him with the blade before struggling with him, which resulted in Mr Muncie striking his head. It is also claimed that he struggled with three other prison officers and attempted to escape from their custody in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. Mr Harvey faces a third charge of being in possession of a weapon. He is due to stand trial on 27 September at the High Court in Livingston.	A prisoner is to go on trial accused of attacking a doctor at a hospital with a razor blade.
Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. "Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced," Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. "Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality," Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says "the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. "There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa," he told BBC Sport. "For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. "For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all." It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. "Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa," Bility wrote. "If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes." Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.	The man overseeing Fifa's presidential polls should step aside due to conflict of interest, says the Liberian FA.
Individual world champion James Guy swam a superb final leg after Dan Wallace, Robbie Renwick and Calum Jarvis had put Britain in contention. The US were led off by swimming great Ryan Lochte but could not hold on. "They've always been the best 4x200m team in the world but we really stepped our game up tonight," said Wallace. "It always makes you confident to have the world champion anchoring your relay but I think we set him up pretty well and it was a great race." Britain clocked a time of seven minutes 4.33 seconds to claim the nation's first ever men's relay gold at a World Championships, with the US and Australia completing the podium. The US had won the event, which will be part of the Olympic programme in Rio next year, at the last five World Championships. Guy, 19, won the individual title on Tuesday and took the British quartet from third to first on the final leg of the relay. "The way things have been going in racing and training, the work is paying off," said Guy. "The personal bests are finally dropping down." Britain now stand third in the overall medals table behind the United States and Australia with five gold, one silver and two bronze medals after six of eight days in Kazan. In Friday's other events, Andrew Willis finished fourth in the men's 200m breaststroke but Lizzie Simmonds failed to progress in the 200m backstroke. Ben Proud and Fran Halsall qualified for Saturday's 50m freestyle and butterfly finals respectively.	Great Britain's men overhauled the United States in a dramatic 4x200m freestyle relay final to win gold at the World Championships in Russia.
In 2016, there were 5,826 reported cases, with holidaymakers losing Â£7.2 million in total, an average of Â£1,200 per person. The most common scams involved plane tickets, online accommodation bookings and timeshare sales. Action Fraud said reports of scams had risen consistently over the past five years. More than a quarter of those affected said the scams had a significant impact on their health or finances. About 260 people said they needed medical treatment as a result, or were at risk of bankruptcy, according to Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre. Sports events and religious festivals are a common target for scammers due to the limited supply of tickets resulting in higher prices. Holidaymakers are being persuaded to part with their cash with fake accommodation websites and adverts, with fraudsters are also hacking into official accounts to target people. Tony Neate of fraud prevention group Get Safe Online said holidays are seen as a "big-ticket item" so present "the perfect opportunity for cyber criminals to swindle unsuspecting victims out of their hard-earned money". He said people should do as much research as they could about the organisation they are booking through "and ensure that they are a reputable travel operator that is a member of a recognised trade body like Abta". "By booking in haste, you could not only risk losing a huge amount of money, but also disappoint family and friends when it comes to that long-awaited escape," he added. Scam victim Stephanie Gager used cash and a bank transfer to pay for a non-existent holiday. She says when she received paperwork with all the right logos and flight information on, she assumed it was legitimate. She was asked to pay a deposit and then told the company she would pay the remaining balance within a fortnight. However, she was then told she had to pay into a bank account "immediately" to get the holiday at a low price. "When I got to the airport they said to me, 'you're not booked on the flight'. Of course I was devastated," she told BBC Breakfast. "[Airport staff] said this happens a lot, it's worth paying that extra more to actually make the flight." She admitted in hindsight she should have heard alarm bells at the point she was told to pay money into a bank account, and has since been given advice about how to avoid fraud. Authorities say they believe criminals are taking advantage of the lack of awareness of the UK's strict regulations on travel companies. Fake websites have encouraged tourists to pay via bank transfer or cash, claiming these are the only methods which are protected by their own bogus insurance policies. But in reality, these methods make it harder for people to get their money back. Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel trade organisation Abta, said: "Abta is regularly contacted by members of the public who have been caught out by increasingly sophisticated travel-related frauds. "We know at first-hand that the loss and shock of finding that your flight or holiday accommodation has not been booked can be very significant." Get Safe Online, Abta and City of London police have launched a campaign to warn travellers about the dangers of holiday booking fraud. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning	The number of British tourists hit by booking scams rose by 19% last year, according to Action Fraud.
Mr Poots made the comments on the BBC's Nolan Live on Wednesday night. Speaking to Sinn Féin's Alex Maskey, Mr Poots said: "We'll do business with you because it's in the interests of Northern Ireland. "We have peace in Northern Ireland, so we'll hold our noses and do business with you." He added: "I do not like doing business with Sinn Féin. I hold my nose about what has gone on in the past, about the activities of the IRA over 25 years, of the murders that took place and there's a stench that still rises from that in many homes across Northern Ireland." Mr Maskey said the comments had shown Mr Poots in his "true colours" However, speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster on Thursday, Mr Poots said "many people across Northern Ireland find it appalling that Sinn Féin are in government". "They have an association with the IRA, who committed over 2,000 murders in Northern Ireland, and that's something that's very hard for all of us to accept, but we do it because we want to ensure there aren't thousands more people lose their lives as the result of Troubles in Northern Ireland in the years to come," he said. "Whenever I look across the benches at Stormont, I see people who have been charged and convicted and served lengthy prison sentences for the most heinous of crimes, and that is not the case for republicans. "I work with those people because they have got a mandate, but that doesn't mean I have to like it." Speaking on the Nolan Show, the DUP's Simon Hamilton said he "understood entirely" what Mr Poots had meant. "I think my generation maybe didn't suffer as much as others did during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, but that doesn't mean that I don't forget what the IRA did," he said. "But I have a family of my own now and I don't want them to grow up into the sort of Northern Ireland that many people had to live through in the 70s and 80s and because of that I'm prepared to work with, and my party is prepared to work with, Sinn Féin who have a mandate from the electorate. "I know what Edwin meant when he talked about a stench and it is that legacy of violence, IRA violence, down through the 70s and 80s and into the 90s that left a lot of people dead, left a lot of people injured." Mr Hamilton, the health minister, has come under criticism recently over the DUP's policy of keeping its ministers in office for only a few hours each week while talks continue to resolve the current Stormont crisis. Asked about his position, he said he would resume his duties for one day next week.	The DUP's Edwin Poots has defended comments he made that party members have to hold their noses when doing business with Sinn Féin.
The 25-year-old has been with Carlisle since 2008, making 160 appearances for the club and turned down a new deal to join the Saddlers. "We knew he was after a new challenge. He can come in and be a dominant number one for us," Walsall manager Jon Whitney told the club website. Meanwhile, 22-year-old goalkeeper Liam Roberts has agreed a new one-year deal. The contract signed by former Chester loanee Roberts, who has made one senior appearance for Walsall, includes the option of a further year in the League One club's favour. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Walsall have signed goalkeeper Mark Gillespie on a two-year contract from Carlisle United on a free transfer.
The 65-year-old said he was going to "miss it dreadfully" but there always comes a point when things must end. Sir Eric also served as secretary for communities and local government between 2010 and 2015. He is one of several high-profile MPs who are standing down, including George Osborne and Alan Johnson. Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Tuesday she intended to call a snap general election, a move that was backed by MPs the following day. The election will take place on 8 June. Labour MP for Nottingham North Graham Allen also announced on Saturday that he is to step down as an MP, due to ill health. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Eric said: "I think it's always better to leave when people are asking why you're going, rather than why you're staying. "I'd always decided this was going to be my last Parliament having served 25 years and came to the view that it was time Brentwood and Ongar had a new MP." He said he had told Mrs May of his decision, and wrote on Twitter that he would be continuing in his role as the prime minister's special envoy on post-Holocaust issues. Which MPs are quitting - and who might stand? In a letter sent to his local Conservative association, Sir Eric wrote: "It has been an enormous honour to represent the constituency for 25 years; Brentwood and Ongar is a wonderful place to live. "Throughout that quarter of century, I have enjoyed success and some setbacks, but have always been sustained by the friendship back home in the patch." He added that he was grateful for the invitation to serve a further five years but that after "much heart searching" he had concluded it was the "right time for Brentwood and Ongar to have a new representative in Westminster". Sir Eric, who was born in Yorkshire into a Labour-supporting family, joined the Keighley Young Conservatives in 1968, going on to become chairman. He was knighted in 2015. Formerly a Eurosceptic, in 2016 he joined the group of Conservative MPs supporting the campaign to remain in the European Union subject to David Cameron's renegotiations. Sir Eric was responsible for the Localism Act of 2011 that changed the powers of local government in England. The measures effected by the Act include more elected mayors and referendums.	Sir Eric Pickles, the former Conservative Party chairman, has announced he is standing down as Brentwood and Ongar MP after 25 years.
Thanet District Council said it was considering a 2% rise in the authority's part of the council tax. Councillor Rick Everitt, cabinet member for finance, said the council had seen a 28% reduction in government funding over the past two years. "Further cuts to the council purse are really unwelcome," he said. The council said figures from the Department of Communities and Local Government showed the council was likely to be left short of £580,000 for the next financial year. Mr Everitt said: "Having already suffered a reduction of 28% in government funding over the past two years, resources are stretched to the absolute limit. "This additional reduction of over half a million pounds has forced us into a corner." From Monday, the council will be asking for residents' views on which services should be a priority. The council said final figures were expected in December and would be debated at a meeting in January.	A Kent council claims it is being "forced into a corner" as proposed cuts to government grants could leave a shortfall of more than £500,000.
President Mourad Boudjellal emailed Premiership bosses proposing the move from the Top 14, which a spokesman said they would consider. Boudjellal has made public his frustrations with the Top 14, related to the salary cap and bonus payments. He told French newspaper L'Equipe: "If this is not possible the next season, maybe the one after that." He said he was "serious in my approach" and claimed the move would give the Premiership "huge added value". The Cote d'Azur club have risen up the French leagues under Boudjellal's reign to become multiple European champions. Any switch would require the approval of the French Rugby Federation and the Rugby Football Union, the governing body for rugby union in England, which said it had not been contacted by Boudjellal. Rugby union is familiar with cross-border competitions, with Italian clubs playing in the Pro12 league against Welsh, Irish and Scottish opposition. In the southern hemisphere, the Super Rugby tournament features teams from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It will include sides from Argentina and Japan for the 2016 season, which starts in February. However, given the complications of any move, informed observers of the game say it appears unlikely to happen. Top 14 clubs have a larger salary cap than those in England, at 10 million Euros (£7.7m) compared to £5.1m. However, the 12 Premiership clubs will see their cap rise to £6.5m per club for 2016-17 and £7m for 2017-18. The extra money that French clubs are allowed to spend on salaries has enabled them sign some of the game's biggest stars. Among them are World Cup-winning All Blacks Dan Carter (Racing 92), Ma'a Nonu (Toulon) and Conrad Smith (Pau), plus South Africa's 2007 world champion winger Bryan Habana (Toulon). Former England number 10 Jonny Wilkinson, Ireland fly-half Johnny Sexton and New Zealand centre Sonny Bill Williams have also played Top 14 rugby in the past. Toulon have agreed to release Quade Cooper for three rounds of the Sevens World Series as the Australian targets the Rio Olympics. The 27-year-old fly-half will compete in Sydney (6-7 February), Paris (14-15 May) and London (21-22 May). "As a rugby player growing up, you never think you'll have the chance to play at an Olympics," said Cooper. The international, who has won 58 caps for the Wallabies, added: "I'll be doing everything I can to make the squad." For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.	French side Toulon say they want to leave their domestic league to play in the English Premiership.
This hard-fought-for policy united local political parties, but doubt now hangs over it. There are several reasons why. Firstly, although the legislation is in place, it needs a final green light from government. The Northern Ireland Executive must demonstrate its finances are on a sustainable footing. Does a potential £490m blunder over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme undermine that? This is, perhaps, arguable. We are talking about finding £20-30m a year for 20 years to cover an RHI overspend, a small part of a £10bn annual block grant. But the crisis has put other hurdles on the horizon. The Northern Ireland Assembly must pass a rate recommended by the finance minister in the year before it applies. How soon will there be an executive or assembly the other side of an election? And will there then be a greater reluctance about paying for corporation tax with a £200m cut to the block grant? Any return to direct rule from Westminster might not offer an immediate solution either. European Union state aid rules apply until Brexit and they only allow devolution of corporation tax to a region which has "institutional autonomy". It is premature to pronounce Northern Ireland's big economic idea as dead. But in the here and now, things look mightily challenging - can Invest NI promote a rate and a date to overseas companies with any certainty? Even before the political crisis, some experts felt 2018 was ambitious anyhow for companies to adapt to new rules. And all the while, the main UK rate of corporation tax is falling, blunting the attractiveness of what Northern Ireland wants to offer.	Northern Ireland's political crisis could kill off plans to cut corporation tax to 12.5% in April 2018.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told a BBC Radio Wales election phone-in he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests, but still wanted him to become prime minister. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not," he said. "The alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want." Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Gething rejected listeners' suggestions that Welsh Labour was failing to support the party's UK leader. "I want a Labour prime minister - and that means Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister," he said. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not - it matters whether I think he can do the job in running the country. "It matters whether I think this country will be better off having a Labour prime minister than a Tory." Mr Gething admitted he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two Labour leadership contests, but accepted the party had voted "decisively" for him to be its leader and candidate for prime minister. He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs "being returned from Wales in large numbers". "We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales," he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. "I don't think we will be wiped out here," he said. "We've got a good record in government ... we're directly engaged in our local communities," he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was "appalled" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the "triple lock" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a "more open relationship" with the EU than a "hard" Brexit, calling for "full and unfettered" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was "economically beneficial". "There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment," he said. "I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: "A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves."	Labour figures in Wales are not trying to distance themselves from party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a Welsh Government minister has insisted.
Vincent Hudson has been charged with the historical offence on a boy under the age of 16, Cumbria Police said. A spokesman for the force said the attack was reported to have taken place in 2001. Mr Hudson, 54, of Loweswater Avenue, Whitehaven, is due to appear before North Cumbria Magistrates' Court later, the spokesman added.	A man from Cumbria has been charged in connection with the rape of a boy 14 years ago.
In recent months, state media have been stressing the waters have been China's "since ancient times". Now, state media are rolling out masses of fresh material aimed at discrediting The Hague tribunal's ruling. State media anticipated the Permanent Court of Arbitration's findings. Almost immediately, outlets including Xinhua news agency released a prepared statement describing the decision as "illegal and invalid". "China has repeatedly declared that the arbitration tribunal does not have jurisdiction; China neither accepts nor recognises it," Xinhua said. It then released a government statement saying China "has territorial sovereignty and maritime rights over the South China Sea islands" and "resolutely opposes a few countries' illegal violations" - a reference to the US and its allies in the region. But it hinted at a way forward, saying there is potential for China to enter into "joint developments" in order to "achieve win-win results" and peace and stability in the South China Sea. State-run CCTV cited the foreign ministry's view that the tribunal proceedings were "null and void". It featured British, Iranian, Pakistani and Lebanese experts who questioned the verdict. Oxford academic Antonios Tzanakopoulos told the TV that he did not find the tribunal's points "fully convincing". CCTV also hinted at possible negotiations with the Philippines. It showed former Filipino ambassador Alberto Encomienda saying American interference had triggered the case. He added: "There's a lot we can do, not in terms of what China can do for us, but what we can do together for the region." There was an immediate attempt to control online discussion in China. In the minutes before the announcement, Sina Weibo's hashtag #SouthChinaSeaArbitration was number one in its top 10. Its landing page carried more than 170,000 posts. Once the result was out, the hashtag disappeared from Sina's ranking. State media and its millions of followers - including Xinhua, People's Daily and CCTV - adopted a similarly-named hashtag, #SouthChinaSeaArbitrationCase. It quickly rose to number one in the ranking, with posts overwhelmingly dismissing the Hague ruling. Meanwhile, over at censorship-monitoring website Free Weibo, "South China Sea" became the most-censored term. The press room was packed but the statement from Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay lasted just two minutes. In four short paragraphs, he explained that experts were now analysing the ruling and called on all concerned to exercise "constraint and sobriety" at what he described as a "milestone decision". There were no celebrations, hardly even a smile. And there's a reason for that. This is not the same government that first brought this case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration three and a half years ago, in the aftermath of a standoff at Scarborough Shoal. Two weeks ago, Rodrigo Duterte was sworn in as Philippine president. All the indications are that he is more willing to seek accommodation with the Chinese than his predecessor, Benigno Aquino. Here in Manila, many believe that the new president may have sought promises of Chinese investment, in return for a quiet, dignified response. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world. You can follow BBC Monitoring  on Twitter and Facebook.	Chinese media have not lost time in reinforcing Beijing's insistence that it does not recognise an international tribunal's ruling against its claims to rights in the South China Sea.
It clears the way for the team to make their debut appearance the tournament, which will be held in Gabon from 14 January to 5 February. After the news emerged, thousands lined the streets of the capital, Bissau, to watch the squad parade by on Tuesday. Guinea-Bissau play Group A rivals and hosts Gabon in Saturday's opener. They will also face Burkina Faso and Cameroon in the group stage having achieved a fairytale qualification - one of the biggest shocks in Nations Cup history. Yet the bonuses that had been promised them for qualifying remained unpaid, leading to the players going on strike at the weekend. It was only settled after a delegation of three players went to see the country's president, Jose Mario Vaz, Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. They have since all received between 10,000 and 23,000 euros in outstanding fees, Lusa added. "In the early hours of Sunday, the players received everything they had to receive," a government spokesman told the agency. A charter plane, borrowed from Congo-Brazzaville, was due to fly the team to Libreville on Wednesday. The former Portuguese colony frequently beset by coups, eliminated former champions Congo and Zambia in qualifying last year. They were a Leicester-like long shot when the qualifiers began, having previously won only four matches in Nations Cup and World Cup qualification combined since first entering international competition just 22 years ago.	Guinea-Bissau's players have ended their strike after being paid outstanding wages, four days before the start of the Africa Cup of Nations.

Pieces from the board game, which hasn't been played for 1,500 years, have been found in Qingzhou City in China. Archaeologists found a 14-faced dice made of animal tooth with ancient Chinese writing on it. They also discovered 21 game pieces with numbers painted onto them, as well as a broken tile decorated with two eyes. The game is said to be called "bo", but researchers are unsure how it was played. The tomb was built to bury rich Chinese people around 2,300 years ago.	An ancient board game has been found in a Chinese tomb.
Church members have voted to raise the cost of a wedding from £296 to £415 and for a funeral service from £102 to £160 from January next year. The fees include the costs of lighting and administration for the first time. The moves come despite a warning from some members of the Church's governing body, the General Synod, that the rises could have an impact on poorer couples. The Rev Canon Simon Killwick, a vicar in Moss Side, Manchester, said: "Such a fee increase seems to me hard to justify in times of financial austerity and even harder to justify in poor inner-city parishes. "The Church of England ought not to be seen to be making a big increase at this time and ought not to be making it difficult for the poor to access these services at a time when a simple ceremony can be had at a register office for around £100." Canon Killwick said the right to waive fees in cases of hardship put clergy in the "invidious position" of means testing parishioners. "Waiving can cause real ill feeling," he said. "The poor don't want to be patronised by fees being waived, they want their church to be affordable to them. "It would be a crying shame if poor people end up being married in register offices because the Church of England has priced them out of their parish church." But the Rt Rev John Packer, the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, said the changes reflected the "reality" of the costs, and  reduced confusion over different fees being charged by different parishes. He told the General Synod that the fees raised about £35m a year for the Church, including £15m towards the pay of clergy. "The reality of what it costs matters, and it seems to me that those who are being married within our churches do understand that," he said. The increases were approved after a 4% rise in the number of Church of England weddings in 2010. Last year the General Synod rejected plans to increase the price of both weddings and funerals by 50%.	Fees for Church of England weddings are to increase by 40% and the cost of a funeral service by more than 50%.
It was responding to a global study that suggested investing heavily in computers and classroom technology does not improve pupils' performance. Highland Council has a plan to give every P6 to S6 students access to a tablet computer. The local authority said the study also suggested that good teaching coupled with technology could benefit pupils. The study of schoolchildren in more than 70 countries was carried out for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The think tank said frequent use of computers in schools was more likely to be associated with lower results. The OECD's education director Andreas Schleicher said school technology had raised "too many false hopes". But he added that the findings of the report should not be used as an "excuse" not to use technology, but as a spur to finding a more effective approach. A spokesperson for Highland Council said: "Highland Council is committed to providing technology rich environments in schools, this includes appropriate access to technology for learning purposes. "We are also committed to reducing inequalities where pupils do not feel excluded due to not having access to appropriate technology for their learning. "We welcome the OECD report which demonstrates that when good teaching is coupled with appropriate technology it leads to improved outcomes for children and young people." Highland Council plans to increase the availability of the devices for P1 to 5 pupils to share and give every P6 to S6 student their own tablet. The proposal is also expected to help the council save money. The project could form part of the local authority's new IT contract. The aspiration was first discussed at a meeting of Highland Council's education, children and adult services committee in February. Councillors heard that the use of tablets at Alness Academy and other schools had led to pupils producing better work.	Highland Council has said it remains committed to giving more schoolchildren access to technology.
Although the EY Item Club think tank predicts the economy will grow 1.9% this year, it expects that performance to fizzle out as inflation rises. The economy's stability since June's Brexit vote was "deceptive", EY said. Meanwhile, a senior Bank of England official told the BBC that inflation may surpass its 2% target. In an interview to be broadcast on Monday, the Bank's deputy governor Ben Broadbent told Radio 5 live that sterling's weakness would fuel inflation, but that controlling prices with tighter monetary policy could hit growth and jobs. The dilemma facing policymakers was underlined in the Item Club report. It expects inflation to jump to 2.6% next year before easing back to 1.8% in 2018. That will cause growth in consumer spending to slow from an expected 2.5% this year to 0.5% in 2017 and 0.9% the year after, the report said. Business investment is also forecast to fall due to uncertainty surrounding Britain's future trading relationship with the EU, dropping 1.5% this year and more than 2% in 2017. EY predicts that the impact of weaker consumer spending and falling investment will cause UK GDP growth to drop sharply to 0.8% next year, before expanding to 1.4% in 2018. Peter Spencer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: "So far it might look like the economy is taking Brexit in its stride, but this picture is deceptive. "Sterling's shaky performance this month provides a timely reminder that challenges lie ahead. As inflation returns over the winter it will squeeze household incomes and spending. "The pressure on consumers and the cautious approach to spending by businesses mean that the UK is facing a period of relatively low growth," he said. The report said that exporters will benefit from the depreciation of sterling, which last week tumbled against a basket of currencies. Exports will increase by 4.5% in 2017 and 5.6% in 2018, EY forecast. But Mr Spencer did not expect this to be enough to offset a wider slowdown. "With activity in the domestic market flat, GDP growth will become heavily dependent upon exports next year," he said. "But once the UK has left the EU certain sectors, such as aerospace, automotive, and chemicals that trade extensively with the EU will be a lot more vulnerable and may need to be supported by subsidies and more robust industrial policies," he said. Some of the economic challenges were spelled out in Mr Broadbent's BBC interview with 5 live's Sean Farrington. The deputy governor, echoing remark's by the Bank's governor Mark Carney last week, said that letting inflation run ahead of the 2% target might ensure the economy does not suffer. Tighter monetary policy to meet the target could lead to "undesirable consequences" such as lower growth and higher unemployment, he said. It's a "trade off", he added.	Britain's economy faces a "prolonged period" of weaker growth as consumer spending slows and business curbs investment, according to a report.
This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume. Wales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated. This was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters. The bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights. As well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'. There was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships. But Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite. "There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long," said Coleman. "We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that." Wales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed. It is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home. With every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium. He saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him The messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack. Despite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making. In the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection. Hal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu. There was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: "When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off." From a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players. Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football. For all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success. The vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends. Even when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best. These genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football. The death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side. Captain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal. "My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today," he said. "He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him." Speed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of "There's only one Speedo" heard at every game. A friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not. Succeeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud. Coleman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey. Absent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait. The current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success. "The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves," he said. "We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack." Wales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup. Planning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement. Just as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff. Returning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.	Standing hand-in-hand like theatre actors at their curtain call, Wales' players were met with a spine-tingling rendition of the national anthem from their fans following their European Championship semi-final defeat by Portugal.
The Dow Jones rose 0.2% to 19,251.78, while the wider S&P 500 gained 0.3% to 2,204.71, just missing a new record. The  Nasdaq rose 0.5% to 5,333.00. Banking shares performed strongly, with Wells Fargo up 2.2%, Bank of America rising 1.5% and Goldman up by 1.2%. Financial shares have climbed by over 15% since the election. President-elect Donald Trump's plans to reduce corporate tax and regulations are expected to benefit the sector. Meanwhile, analysts are predicting the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, in another boost for banks. Financials in general are "benefiting from the feeling that interest rates are done going down and we are going to see a much more favourable interest rate and spread environment for financials," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. Mr Trump's announcement that Japanese telecoms and internet firm SoftBank had agreed to invest $50bn in the US also boosted markets, with Sprint shares rising 1.5%and T-Mobile gaining 1.8%. Other telecom stocks also rose. AT&T shares increased by 1.9% after the firm said its new streaming television service DirectTV Now has gained more subscribers so far than expected. Verizon shares climbed 1.2 % after the wireless carrier said it was selling 29 data centres for $3.6bn. Chipotle was one of the top fallers on the S&P 500, dropping 7.6%, after it said sales had not recovered as well as expected. Quarterly sales have been falling over the past year since food safety issues led to the temporary closure of dozens of Chipotle restaurants across the US.	(Close) The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a fresh high for a second consecutive day after a rally in financial shares boosted the index.
It happened at about 20:30 GMT on Saturday at the Antrim Road shop. Two men wearing hooded tops made a purchase, then one asked the assistant for another item. When she opened the till, one of the men brought out a knife. He lunged towards the woman, jabbing the knife in her direction. The second man them removed cash from the till. Both were challenged by a male member of staff as they left and one of the robbers took the knife out again. They then fled on foot. Neither member of staff was injured, but police said they were left very badly shaken. Detectives have appealed for witnesses to contact them.	A woman working in an off-licence has been threatened with a knife during a robbery in north Belfast.

The attack was discovered on Wednesday, and made public on Saturday. The encrypted credit card details of up to 90,000 people may have been accessed, the mobile phone firm said. The Information Commissioner's Office, which examines data breaches, confirmed it was aware of the incident. Carphone Warehouse says the data could include names, addresses, dates of birth and bank details and it is contacting all those affected. Those who think they have been the victim of fraud should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040. Carphone Warehouse said the "sophisticated" cyber-attack, which happened in the past two weeks, was stopped "straight away" after it was discovered on Wednesday afternoon. The affected division of the company operates the websites OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk, and provides services to iD Mobile, TalkTalk Mobile, Talk Mobile and some Carphone Warehouse customers. The retailer's owner, Dixons Carphone, has apologised for the attack and said additional security measures have been brought in. It has also taken the affected websites down. Carphone Warehouse customer Kerri, from Petersfield, in Hampshire, said she believed her email address had been hacked, and "things stolen", since the breach. "I am extremely upset as well as worried and scared," she said. "Firms like Carphone Warehouse need to be held accountable for security breaches." Some customers complained they should have been made aware when the breach was first detected. Technology analyst Tom Cheesewright said the company may have been trying to assess the level of damage before making the announcement. "I don't think we'll know until the Information Commissioner's Office looks at this - whether they did the right thing, whether they were prudent in waiting a few days." he added. He said it was likely the data would be sold on. "There's a ready market in this sort of information. You might pay Â£5-10 for one set of credit card details, maybe twice that for a full identity," he said. The details may then be used to shop or take out loans: "It's a very good start for a full case of identity theft." He urged customers to watch for - and report - any suspicious activity on their bank accounts or credit reports. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office said: "We have been made aware of an incident at Carphone Warehouse and are making enquiries." The Metropolitan Police said its Cyber Crime Unit had been notified of the breach by Carphone Warehouse but no formal allegation of a crime had been made. The Met said it had not had any reports of fraudulent banking activity. Here are a selection of your comments on this story. Paul, Liverpool says: I knew something wasn't right when a few days ago I couldn't access the iD Mobile website. I simply put this down to corporate governance. I questioned this further when two days later I still couldn't do so from my own iD mobile phone. Naturally one must ask how much was known and how quickly this attack was mitigated, especially given Talk Talk had been targeted as late as October last year. David, Romford writes: As a Talkmobile customer, I have just visited the Carphone Warehouse and Talkmobile websites to find out more.  Guess what?  I could find absolutely no mention of this on either website!  It seems like they are trying to sweep this under the carpet.  Not good enough. Ruth comments: I have received the email from Mobiles UK and have contacted my bank etc., and noted the information about credit rating concerns. I have never had an issue with credit rating and have never used these companies. I don't think it's fair that customers like me should now have to consider paying upwards of Â£14 per month to these credit rating companies just because my records held by Carphone Warehouse have been compromised.  I cannot afford to pay this. Judith, Lee on the Solent says: E2Save - one of those Carphone Warehouse affected accounts - have prevented me from changing my password on my account. If the breach has already taken place, what is the point of bolting the stable door now that my details may have been taken? They should unlock my account so that I can change my password, but they will not let me! Alan James Bell writes: I've received an email telling me that my account information 'may have been stolen'. So far, my bank accounts look normal. I wanted to check with Experian if someone had applied for a credit card using my details. But, of course, to do so, I have to give Experian all my personal details! In other words, put all my info out there on to yet another server for the Russian / Chinese hackers to exploit! Vicki tells us: I am a Carphone Warehouse customer and to say the very least I am so unhappy and angry about this situation they have put us in. I hope they will compensate for the worry that everyone is going through right now.	The UK's data watchdog is "making inquiries" after Carphone Warehouse said the personal details of up to 2.4 million of its customers may have been accessed in a cyber-attack.
The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes. "If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid," the Italy international said. "I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game." AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour. Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to "face this issue head-on". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: "They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable." Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: "I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit." There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby. And in April, champions Juventus were fined 30,000 euros (£25,000) after their supporters racially abused the AC Milan players.	Mario Balotelli has threatened to walk off the pitch if he is ever again subjected to racist abuse from fans.
During a drive to tackle overflowing bins around Leith Walk, officials found that more than half of firms they visited did not have the correct waste collection contracts in place. They discovered evidence that some were using communal bins meant for residents to dispose of their waste. One leading councillor accused the businesses of "abusing the system". Transport and environment convenor Lesley Hinds said their actions "undoubtedly" resulted in overflowing bins, litter and fly-tipping. Compliance officers visited 406 traders during the Our Edinburgh initiative to address anti-social behaviour like littering. A total of 215 did not have the correct waste collection contracts in place. They also carried out a detailed inspection of one bin at Bernard Street and three-quarters of its contents were found to be trade waste. Five businesses were handed a Â£200 fixed penalty notice on the back of the investigation. Ms Hinds said: "We have focussed phase two of Our Edinburgh on the Leith Walk area as it's been identified as a hotspot for overflowing bin complaints and it's becoming clear why. "Communal bins are meant for residents' household waste so it's unacceptable that businesses are abusing the system, which undoubtedly results in overflowing bins, litter and fly-tipping. "That's why this campaign aims to provide information and advice to businesses in order to ensure they have the right waste collection arrangements in place, as well as penalising those that continue to break the rules." Three further bins have been examined and found to contain up to 50% trade waste, according to the City of Edinburgh. It said five more businesses will receive fixed penalty notices as a result.	More than 200 businesses in part of Edinburgh have been found to be breaking rules on using communal bins.
But for the average backbench MP, the chance to make laws can seem a distant possibility. Their best chance comes around once a year, in the form of a random ballot. The prize? A chance for MPs to promote their pet project in the House of Commons by introducing it as a Private Members' Bill. Private Members' Bills can be introduced in three different ways. The first are "Ten Minute Rule" bills, where MPs make a speech of no more than 10 minutes to outline their position. Second are presentations to the Commons, where an MP might formally introduce the title of their bill. The third and most likely to make it onto the statute book are the "Ballot Bills", so-called because MPs take part in a random draw to decide who gets to propose a bill in the Commons. The system has its critics, among them the SNP MP who sponsored the "Turing Bill" to pardon gay men for obsolete sexual offences. "It is absurd for legislation to be decided by the deputy speaker pulling balls out of a jar. It seems altogether too random," John Nicolson says. If this sounds confusing, it's probably because it is. In a report on Private Members' Bills, the Commons' Procedure Committee called the process "impenetrable" and "enormously damaging to the reputation of the House and to the legislative process". Chairman of the committee, Broxbourne MP Charles Walker, says: "One thing you have to do in this house is accept failure, but you need to have a fair crack at failure, and I don't think most backbenchers now have a fair crack at failure." Even if an MP is lucky enough to propose their Private Members' Bill to the Commons, it is far from guaranteed that it will become law. Opposing MPs can stop these sorts of bills progressing by "filibustering" or "talking them out" during debates held on 13 Fridays throughout the year - a process the Procedure Committee report describes as "speaking at inordinate length on the bill to ensure that the debate cannot conclude" before the set time limit. Mr Nicolson's Private Members' Bill, the Sexual Offences (Pardons) Bill, fell after a government minister used up the time allotted for debating it by speaking for 25 minutes. There were cries of "shame" and "shameful" from some MPs as Justice Minister Sam Gyimah's speech brought the debate to a close. Speaking to the BBC Mr Nicolson said: "I think voters consider filibustering to be wrong. And I agree with them. "Filibustering is archaic, and often used to frustrate the Private Members' Bill process. If a minister doesn't talk out a bill, a hard core of obstructionist MPs often do it, talking nonsensically for lengthy periods until the time allocated for the bill is over." Mr Gyimah defended his opposition to Mr Nicolson's bill, saying "I understand and support the intentions behind Mr Nicolson's bill, however I worry that he has not fully thought through the consequences." Conservative MP Philip Davies, a regular attendee of Friday debates on Private Members' Bills, mounted a passionate defence of talking out. Speaking to a Procedure Committee evidence session Mr Davies said: "I support a bill by not speaking at all, and stop a bad bill from going forward by running out of time. "If the purpose of me contributing to the debate is to try to stop bills that I think are bad, this is the mechanism that I have to use, under the rules," he continued. "If there was another mechanism of blocking them that didn't involve me speaking in the debate, the chances are that I would use that mechanism and therefore nobody would hear another point of view. You would only hear one side." Mr Davies concluded: "When we have a debate, whether people like the outcome or not, at least people get to hear that there is a different opinion on a particular bill." Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had a similar experience of a bill being talked out in 2015. Her "NHS Reinstatement" bill ran out of time after MPs spent four-and-a-half hours debating the two-clause Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) bill. Ms Lucas told the Procedure Committee the bill was one that "certain MPs have 'on the shelf' for the purpose of clogging up Private Members' Bill time on Fridays". The Brighton Pavilion MP told the BBC: "What really turns the public off politics is witnessing the childish way some MPs speak for a huge amount of time in order to 'talk out' bills and prevent them from being concluded and voted on." While talking out has many opponents, there are ways of clamping down on the practice that already exist. In its recommendations for changes to the Private Members' Bill process, the Procedure Committee suggested that the Speaker and his deputies overseeing debates on them should make greater use of their existing ability to impose time limits on speeches. Equally, an MP sponsoring a Private Members' Bill can attempt to close a debate before it runs out of time. The problem is that to do so 100 MPs have to be present in the chamber - a requirement the committee's report called a "a formidable hurdle" to overcome on Fridays, when many MPs have already returned to their constituencies. In the end, opponents of talking out may be disappointed, because the Procedure Committee stopped short of calling for a ban. Warning against applying more rules to Commons debates, the committee instead suggested limiting opportunities to indulge in the practice. "The more rules there are, the greater the opportunities to game them," it said.	When proposing new laws, ministers can fill the statute books from the relative safety of their positions in government.
Since December, the commission has been examining whether funding for the Â£16bn plant, to be built by developers EDF Energy, broke state aid rules. Hinkley Point C would be the first new nuclear power station to be built in Britain since 1995. Anti-nuclear campaigners have called the commission's decision a "U-turn". Antoine Colombani, commission spokesman for competition and for vice-president Joaquin Almunia, said: "Our discussions with the UK authorities have led to an agreement. "On this basis, vice-president Almunia will propose to the college of commissioners to take a positive decision in this case. In principle a decision should be taken within this mandate." A spokesman for EDF said the recommendation was "another positive step forward for this vital project". "Hinkley Point C is an important project which will deliver Europe-wide objectives, offering the prospect of reliable, secure and low-carbon electricity for many decades to come as well as boosting jobs and skills." Andrea Carta from Greenpeace said: "If competition commissioner Almunia has backed state aid for Hinkley, it risks a backroom deal prevailing over the rule of law. "Only a year ago the Commission said that Hinkley was 'in principle incompatible under EU state aid rules'. "Now, under pressure from the UK government and French nuclear operator EDF, the commission is preparing to perform a U-turn. "European commissioners should oppose the plan and resist rushing through a controversial and far-reaching decision in the dying weeks of this commission." Gary Smith of the GMB union said: "We lobbied the commission to move ahead on this important project for the UK economy, so we are very pleased at this latest development and look forward to the recommendation being accepted." The recommendation must now be approved by the commission's College of Commissioners in the next few weeks. A final decision is expected in October.	Plans to build a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset have been recommended for approval following a European Commission investigation.
Felix Barrow sustained many broken bones and spent three weeks in a coma when he was knocked over outside his home in Swanmore in October last year. His parents were told he might never walk again, but they said he has now exceeded all his doctors' expectations. The family has raised nearly Â£100,000 for the services that saved his life. Felix was on his way to school when he tripped in the road and was hit by a car as he was getting to his feet. His mum Vanessa said the accident was "horrific" and added: "You just think this can't be happening to you. "It was just a normal Wednesday, normal things going on, and your life is turned upside down into an unrecognisable sate where you are thrust into a hospital environment. "At first I don't think we really realised the extent of his injuries. "It's been a slow process of learning to do things again, learning to walk, learning to eat, drink normal fluids." She added that her son has surpassed all expectations and made "amazing" progress. Felix's dad Stuart said his life was saved by the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance, which flew him to hospital, and the Southampton General Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. He said: "We wanted to repay them for saving his life. It's been fantastic, the whole community has come together." The family set up a charity, Fit For Felix, inspired by his love of running and named by his friend Bradley. It has now raised Â£93,850 by organising a range of activities including fun runs, bike rides, and sponsored swims.	A 12-year-old boy left with a severe brain injury after he was hit by a car has returned to school after making an "amazing" recovery.
The unnamed man was stopped at Turin Airport wearing a pilot's uniform and using forged ID cards, police said. He was charged with endangering air transport security and impersonation. The suspect led police to a garage containing neatly pressed white shirts with epaulets, black trousers and jackets, like those worn by pilots. No motive for the man's actions was reported immediately. Police have established he sat as "third pilot" in the cockpit of an Air Dolomiti plane which flew from Munich to Turin in April. He did not touch the controls, however. Air Dolomiti is part of the German airline Lufthansa, which gave no details when approached by the Associated Press news agency but insisted he could not have boarded the plane without a ticket. Investigators are now trying to establish if the man flew on other planes. Police had long been investigating the suspect, who had allegedly created a fake identity as a Lufthansa pilot named Andrea Sirlo, complete with a Facebook page which included fake flight attendant friends. They said they had been alerted several months ago after he introduced himself as a captain to a civil aviation lieutenant, who became suspicious because he seemed too young for the job. Police tracked him down from photos on his Facebook profile, in which he is apparently shown posing in uniform and sunglasses in front of planes. Officers approached him in a bar outside Turin Airport's check-in area, dressed in a pilot's uniform with no company logo on it, and sipping coffee. In the garage, officers also found fake IDs and fake flight theory manuals, the Italian news agency Ansa reports. "On at least one occasion in 2012, pretending to be a pilot of a foreign commercial airline, and with a fake name, he succeeded in flying as the third pilot in the cockpit," police said in a statement. According to Ansa, a flight took place on 6 April. In addition, a profile on a website where users can track their flights also shows a "Pilot Andrea Sirlo" flying from Munich Airport to Turin on 23 October last year. The case has echoes of the 2002 Hollywood film Catch Me If You Can, in which Leonardo Di Caprio played Frank Abagnale, a real-life con-man who flew as a fake Pan American pilot in the 1960s. Sirlo is the name of a flight corridor over Turin.	Police in Italy have arrested a jobless man who posed as an airline pilot, tricking his way into riding in the cockpit of at least one jet.
The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland. It has not yet been determined whether the police officer who arrested her should face charges, a prosecutor said. The 28-year-old African-American was arrested after a confrontation with a policeman who had pulled her car over. She was found dead three days later. In recent years, the deaths of black Americans in police custody have caused much debate and protests in the US. Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail. The family have denied that she was suicidal and have accused the jail of being "reckless" in disregarding her safety and failing to keep her free from harm. The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said. A video of the arrest shows Mr Encinia giving Ms Bland a warning. The situation quickly escalates, with Mr Encinia appearing to threaten Ms Bland after she refuses to get out of her car. He unsuccessfully tries to pull her out and tells her "I will light you up". Ms Bland's family has alleged Mr Encinia falsified an assault allegation to take her into custody. An attorney representing Ms Bland's family, Cannon Lambert, said on Monday that the grand jury's decision was consistent with what the family believed was an attempt by authorities to cover up the events surrounding Ms Bland's death. "They continue to do things we are disappointed in," he said. Ms Bland's sister Shante Needham has said Sandra had called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm. Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias. Video footage from the jail did not show what happened inside Ms Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious. Mr Mathis has said there is nothing in that investigation "that shows anything happened but she killed herself".	A grand jury has decided not to indict anyone in the case of Sandra Bland, who died in a Texas jail earlier this year.
Marcy Smith was woken up by her son David to find their house in Glovertown, Newfoundland and Labrador, completely engulfed in flames. The whole family was able to escape, but their house is destroyed and their dog and cats did not make it. Mrs Smith said if it wasn't for her son, she and her daughter probably wouldn't have survived. David was on FaceTime to his father at the time, so was the only one awake and saw the flames out of the corner of his eye. "Within seconds of him getting us up, the flames were everywhere," Mrs Smith told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. "It happened so fast. We were standing in the kitchen by the wood stove and the flames just ate around me and David. The entire kitchen just disappeared while we were standing in it." She said the fire was started by some rubbish she burned in the wood stove, something she had done "a thousand times" before. The fire alarm did not go off. The family had nothing but pyjamas on when they fled, but Mrs Smith said the community has rallied behind them, donating clothes and shoes and even a bike for her son. "All he understands is that me and his sister and him got out. He does not understand that he is the only reason we did," she said. "He did a huge thing for such a young boy. I am so proud of him and I am going to tell him for the rest of his life until he understands what a big thing he did."	An 11-year-old Canadian boy saved his whole family from a devastating fire, his mother says.
Sir Peter Blake received Liverpool's Citizen of Honour at a ceremony at the city's Liver building. The 84-year-old also gave Mersey ferry Snowdrop a dazzle ship makeover entitled Everybody Razzle Dazzle. Sir Peter, who was born in Kent, said he hopes Liverpool people will accept him as an "honorary Scouser". Lord Mayor of Liverpool Roz Gladden said: "Sir Peter has helped shape Liverpool's cultural significance on the global stage for more than five decades - from Sgt Pepper to Everybody Razzle Dazzle. "His work with The Beatles was one of the seminal moments in popular art in the 20th Century and 50 years on still resonates around the world as we will see with our 50 Summers of Love programme." She said he had continued to make outstanding contributions to the cultural life of the city "underlining the depth of feeling he has for Liverpool and the city has for him". Sir Peter said: "As well as my music links with the city, I'm proud of my association with Liverpool Biennial and Tate Liverpool and hope to continue my relationship with the city." He said he treasures "the warmth and good humour of the people of Liverpool". Citizen of Honour awards were introduced in 2008 to recognise individuals who have enriched the image of Liverpool and its citizens. Recent recipients include James Barton, founder of the nightclub brand Cream, and Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts film director David Yates. The Snowdrop ferry was due to be returned to its original paintwork at the end of 2016 but it has been extended until 2019.	The artist who created the album cover for The Beatles' Sgt Pepper album has been given a top honour in the band's home city.
Edmund, 21, is leading the British team as Andy Murray sits out the tie on clay following his Wimbledon victory. Although Murray is not playing, the British number one has flown out to support his team-mates. "If any of the players want to ask me anything, I'll help or try and give some advice," Murray told BBC Sport. "I'm not here to start telling anyone what to do. We've got a great team - this team has won the Davis Cup before. "The guys that are here helping, they do a great job and I've had that advice from them over the last few years." In Friday's second match, British number five James Ward takes on Dusan Lajovic, the world number 81. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. Saturday's doubles match will see Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot take on world number 405 Tipsarevic and Nenad Zimonjic. World number 67 Edmund made his debut in last year's final against Belgium as Britain won the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936. Ward, ranked 240 in the world, earned a crucial win against American John Isner in the first round of last year's competition. Serbia's world number one Novak Djokovic pulled out of the tie following his surprise defeat by American Sam Querrey in Wimbledon's third round. Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent Kyle Edmund has clocked up some useful tour wins since making his debut in last year's final and can be expected to be a major part of the GB team for another decade. Captain Leon Smith says he can "absolutely" see him as a top-10 player of the future. James Ward, with his grass court shoes in his suitcase, was planning to fly to Rhode Island last Wednesday, before a call from his captain that morning altered his plans. He has not won a tour level match since last year's Wimbledon, but the hope is that his Davis Cup experience will come to the fore. Friday's first rubber could be critical to the outcome of the tie. Edmund might be ranked 338 places above Janko Tipsarevic, but before a string of injuries the Serb was good enough to qualify for the 2012 World Tour Finals.	Great Britain's number two Kyle Edmund will take on Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic in the opening match of their Davis Cup quarter-final in Belgrade on Friday.
The Robins striker opened the scoring by latching onto Asa Hall's cross, before combining with Hall again to double his tally from close range. Holman glanced in Danny Wright's cross for his third, completing the rout when Wright touched on Jack Munn's cross, allowing him to break free and finish. He now moves to second in the National League scoring charts on 23 goals. The Colchester United loan man scored 14 of those with Woking before Christmas prior to being loaned out again to Cheltenham, for whom he has now scored nine in 10 games. Cheltenham remain two points clear of local rivals Forest Green at the top of the National League, while Woking slip to 13th. Cheltenham manager Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: Media playback is not supported on this device "Dan Holman has had a little bit of a quiet time for him because he'd only got one goal in the last three games. But everything he hit went in. "That is the striker that he is. He strikes great balls in. In training, we see it all the time. He'll get the headlines but I thought Danny Wright was magnificent. He was a great foil. "We looked strong. I was really pleased with the way we saw the game out. Another game gone and confidence is good from our point of view." Woking manager Garry Hill told BBC Surrey: Media playback is not supported on this device "Dan Holman will be the difference between Cheltenham winning the league. We couldn't stop him. You allow yourself to defend games instead of chasing them because you've got someone up top who can put the ball in the net. "The player who has done the damage is a player that we had at our football club. Does it hurt? Yes, in one way. But, in another way, we couldn't hold onto him. "For the first 30 minutes, we probably played the best football that we have done in the last six or eight games. We moved the ball very well and were on top."	Dan Holman scored all four goals against his old club as Cheltenham Town comfortably beat Woking.
China's growth, seen as a driver of the global economy, is a major concern for investors around the world. The news comes as the International Monetary Fund said it expected China's economy to grow by 6.3% this year and 6% in 2017. Beijing had set an official growth target of "about 7%". Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has said weaker growth would be acceptable as long as enough new jobs were created. But some observers say its growth is actually much weaker than official data suggests, though Beijing denies numbers are being inflated. Analysts said any growth below 6.8% would likely fuel calls for further economic stimulus. Economic growth in the final quarter of 2015 edged down to 6.8%, according to the country's national bureau of statistics. Asia Business correspondent Karishma Vaswani on what the figures tell us China editor Carrie Gracie - Is slower growth China's 'new normal'? Can you trust the figures? After experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China's economy has experienced a painful slowdown in the last two years. It's come as the central government wants to move towards an economy led by consumption and services, rather than one driven by exports and investment. But managing that transition has been challenging. Some argue that China's focus on creating an economy driven by consumption is misplaced. They say as the country attempts to rebalance its economy, it should focus on productivity in order to sustain high growth. "While higher consumption can support growth in the short run, there is little in economic theory that emphasises the expenditure side of GDP as a driver of growth," HSBC's John Zhu said in a note. Mr Zhu also said that China's current stage of development would require more investment, not less, and that the country would rebalance naturally towards consumption and services in time. "Pushing the economy along those paths too soon would be dangerous," he said. Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business correspondent It's said so often that it has become a financial markets cliché - when China sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold. The drama of China's stock market crash over the last year has affected investor sentiment and data out today is unlikely to improve matters. But frankly, news that China is slowing down shouldn't come as a surprise. The government has been broadcasting this for some time now as it attempts to transition from a state-led investment and manufacturing economy to one more dependent on services and consumption. Those two aspects now make up 50.5% of the economy, up from 48.5% in 2014. But the real concern is just how badly China's economy is likely to do in the future, and whether these figures can be trusted at all. Critics say China's data is unreliable and that real growth figures may be much weaker. Recent provincial economic data has indicated that growth could be much lower than what the government says it is. China's headline annual economic growth numbers are important to the rest of the world  - but so too are other monthly economic data as they can provide a more in-depth look at the economy and where it's heading. Monthly industrial production (IP) and retail sales numbers for China were also released on Tuesday, with both December numbers coming in just slightly worse than expected. Industrial production - or factory output - expanded 5.9% in December, down from 6% in November. Retail sales grew 11.1%, down from 11.3% in November. "[The] health of the labour market, retail sales and industrial production data are all key indicators for growth," said Catherine Yeung from Fidelity International in a note. "Like any economic data, it's important to look at the themes and trends that drive them and not just the headline figure. "When you look at China with this lens, we're not seeing a meltdown, just a slowdown," she added. Others said Tuesday's numbers were actually a relief. "GDP was generally in line with what many, including the IMF, expected," said economist Tony Nash. "China's growth in 2015 was equivalent to the size of the entire economy of Switzerland or Saudi Arabia," he said. "That's not an easy feat and shows the magnitude of the accomplishment," he added.	China's economy grew by 6.9% in 2015, compared with 7.3% a year earlier, marking its slowest growth in a quarter of a century.
He spoke of his opposition to nuclear weapons and the need to retrain workers based at Faslane submarine base. The left-wing MP, whom pollsters have put as the frontrunner, is holding rallies in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow. Mr Corbyn's opponents include fellow MPs Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall. The outcome of the contest will be made public at a special conference on 12 September. The Scottish Labour Party is also in the process of choosing a new leader with MSPs Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh fighting for votes north of the border. Mr Corbyn was in Aberdeen on Thursday afternoon and later visited Dundee. A Labour analysis estimates 19,000 Scottish jobs are dependant on the Faslane submarine base. Mr Corbyn opposes the renewal of Trident and believes the existing nuclear arms should be decommissioned. Speaking to journalists in Aberdeen he said: "My life has been one of a moral opposition to nuclear weapons "We've put forward serious proposals for a defence diversification agenda for the whole of the UK to ensure jobs are not lost, those skills are not lost, the engineering capability is not lost "Instead, they're not making nuclear weapons, they're making something that is safer and more useful to the whole world." Mr Corbyn rejected the SNPs aim of Scottish independence but said he was willing to work with the party to fight the Welfare Reform Bill. He also said he did not support English laws for English issues, adding: "It's a UK Parliament and all members of the UK Parliament should be able to vote on all issues that are before the UK Parliament". On Friday afternoon, he will be in Edinburgh before holding his fourth rally in Glasgow later that day. In June, Mr Burnham and Ms Cooper were in Scotland to speak to supporters. Mr Burnham said he was the only candidate who could unite the party in all nations and regions of Britain. When she was in Edinburgh, Ms Cooper said she opposed the creation of a separate Scottish Labour party. Ms Kendall agreed with that assessment saying a split between Scottish Labour and the UK party was not the answer to combating SNP support. Labour in Scotland lost 40 of its 41 MPs at the May general election.	UK Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn has begun a tour of Scotland as part of his campaign for votes.
At the end of his speech launching the party's manifesto, Mike Nesbitt said: "Domination doesn't work, partnership does." Ulster Unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled. But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt's comments. Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks. He turned to Mr Kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said: "It wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know Danny was listening." The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members. Under questioning from journalists, Mr Nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake. "What I have said consistently is vote Ulster Unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community, within your constituency and within the country," he said. He added that he "wouldn't withdraw a word" of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election. "The fact is, if we are going into [Stormont] Castle, it will be with a nationalist party," he said. "Now, would I rather go in with Sinn FÃ©in or the SDLP? I would rather go in with the SDLP." Mr Nesbitt went on to say that, on Monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with "very little criticism and a lot of support for what I was talking about". "I am confident in my position and I'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer," he said. "But people will come back on 2 March to thinking about the Â£85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the DUP and Sin FÃ©in in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots." The manifesto, entitled 'Real Partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing PSNI numbers to 7,500, prioritising the York Street interchange, standing up for the LGBT community and "guaranteeing" that no group is worse off because of Brexit. In a section entitled 'Cleaning Up Stormont', the party calls for: On the theme of the election being a referendum, he said it was about "incompetence, arrogance, cronyism and the strong whiff of corruption". He must hope that message will resonate more strongly than the continuing controversy over his remarks about transferring to the SDLP.	The Ulster Unionist leader has denied he made a mistake by saying he intends to give the SDLP his second preference in the Assembly election.
The incident happened on the A630 Sheffield Road just outside Conisborough, near Doncaster, at 17:00 BST on Saturday. South Yorkshire Police said officers were called to the scene after reports that a motorbike had left the road north of Archers Way. The force is appealing for any witnesses to contact them.	A 25-year-old man from Doncaster has died following a motorcycle crash in South Yorkshire.
The 45-year-old's Honda Fireblade crashed in the opening practice session of the Jurby Motodrome racing meet on Saturday morning. The Andreas Racing Association said Carswell sustained serious injuries in the crash and was taken to Noble's Hospital, where he later died. An investigation into the crash is due to take place, the association said.	TT rider Gary Carswell has died after a crash during a practice race on the Isle of Man.
But, if the venerable founding father had lived in Northern Ireland over the last few months he could have changed it to "death, taxes and another RHI story every day". The News Letter continues firing journalistic wood pellets on the ever-burning fire. Its political editor Sam McBride reports on two leaked documents that reveal the names of two civil servants who told figures in the renewable heat industry in July 2015 the scheme was soon to end. The paper has received business emails appearing to indicate that information was circulating about the scheme's imminent end. It's been claimed that a spike in RHI applications in the two months before the scheme's October 2015 closure was due to details of its ending being widely known. However, the News Letter points out that the department have not confirmed or commented on the latest revelation, and adds that there is no suggestion that the civil servants named acted improperly. Sam McBride also sets out, across eight lengthy bullet points, the newspaper's justification for publishing the names of the civil servants and stresses that it is "not alleging corruption". Watch this space. Elsewhere on Planet RHI, the Irish News reports that a charity watchdog is investigating after a green energy group said it would be "ethically improper" to warn Stormont about flaws in the scheme. The managing director of Action Renewables, a group paid to process RHI applications, made the comments to the Irish News last week. Now the Charities Commissions says it has "opened a concern" on Action Renewables. Meanwhile, the Irish News' front page is dedicated to the naming of a soldier who shot dead a man in Belfast 45 years ago, a move welcomed by the man's widow. Mary Thornton, speaking outside court on Wednesday, said: "The way I look at it is, he shot him, so why not?" She added that the inquest had helped her family answer questions about the death of an "ordinary father who lived for myself and the children". Elsewhere, Thursday's papers firmly put Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the firing line after he wrongly told Westminster that a PSNI officer shot on Sunday had died. "Apologise!" says the News Letter's front page, reflecting a call by Police Federation chairman Mark Lindsay who called it a "jaw-dropping gaffe". It's understood Mr Corbyn has written to the PSNI's chief constable to say sorry, but the Belfast Telegraph says it's only the latest in a line of "blunders from the Labour leader". If the Labour leader is feeling sheepish today, spare a thought for the chap caught taking a naked jog over Londonderry's Craigavon Bridge. The Daily Mirror reports that the man pleaded guilty at Derry Magistrates' Court on Wednesday after his Tuesday night run was caught on CCTV. A defence lawyer said he had "given no reason for the jogging naked across the Craigavon Bridge, but he is not in the habit of doing this type of thing". The man received a conditional discharge for a year. January is nearly at a close so that means it's nearly February - aka Six Nations mania time. After beating New Zealand last November, and confirming their rightful place as rugby's greatest team, Ireland are seen as the dark horses. So the mind games have started, reports the Daily Mirror. Joe Schmidt's side take on Scotland in the opening fixture on Saturday week, and Scotland coach Vern Cotter says Ireland and England will win the title. The paper reports that Schmidt is having none of it: "I'm sure VC said that. A little more expectation on my shoulders and a little off his shoulders maybe. He has got bigger shoulders than me." And finally from shoulders to Leo Santa Cruz, Carl Frampton's opponent for this weekend's highly anticipated WBA World Featherweight Championship rematch. Santa Cruz lost to Frampton last summer but, the Belfast Telegraph reports, he's more focused this time after his father's all-clear from cancer. "Frampton is going to face the real Leo Santa Cruz this time. In that first fight, I didn't come in as ready as I've been for past fights." Boxing clever or needless antagonism of The Jackal? We'll find out early on Sunday.	It was Benjamin Franklin who said we can be certain of nothing in life except death and taxes.
Russia's plan for "de-escalation" zones was backed by Iran at talks in Kazakhstan. Both countries support Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Turkey, which supports rebel groups, also agreed to act as a guarantor. But some delegates from the rebel forces angrily rejected the plan. As the three countries were invited to sign the document on Thursday in the Kazakh capital, Astana, rebel delegates angrily shouted that they did not accept it and walked out. Reporters at the talks said the rebels were unhappy about Iran's involvement in the deal as a guarantor. The US also expressed concern over Iran, saying the country had "only contributed to the violence, not stopped it". The Syrian government is not a signatory, but its state news agency said it supported the plan. The talks were meant to shore up an oft-violated ceasefire which was originally agreed in December. A partial cessation of hostilities was declared at the end of last year, but violence has continued on several fronts. Under the Russian plan, safe zones would be established in rebel-held territory in the north-western province of Idlib, in parts of Homs province in the centre, in the south, and in the opposition enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus, the AFP news agency reported. Syrian and Russian warplanes would stop bombing rebel positions while opposition groups would halt attacks inside the "de-escalation zones". The objective is to "put an immediate end to the violence" and "provide the conditions for the safe, voluntary return of refugees" in addition to the speedy provision of relief supplies and medical aid. The safe zones would remain in place for six months, the Kremlin has said. They would be surrounded by checkpoints manned by rebels and government troops, and foreign troops could also be deployed in observer roles, according to AFP. The UN's envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called the agreement a step in the right direction. Syria's envoy to the UN Bashar al-Jaafari said he hoped Russia and Iran would discuss the plan's details with the Syrian government as soon as possible. Syria's war has claimed more than 300,000 lives since it erupted in 2011.	Three countries backing different sides in Syria's war have agreed to set up "safe zones" in the country, while delegates for rebel forces stormed out in protest.
A person claiming to be in a vehicle on the A414 at North Weald, Essex, called police at 08:30 BST on Wednesday to say it had earlier been in Ashford in Kent. The lorry was found by Bedfordshire Police at Toddington Services, on the M1, in the afternoon. Six people are being held in custody. Supt Trevor Roe, from Essex Police, said it was a "positive outcome". "We've seen with human trafficking....the events could turn out to be very tragic so I think it was important we reacted fairly quickly across our neighbouring forces to try to locate the vehicle," he said.	Four suspected illegal immigrants are on the run after a lorry containing ten people was discovered by police following a "distress" call from one of the people inside.
Cheshire is home to major employers in science and manufacturing, housing developers are eager - some would say too eager - to build new homes, and it could soon have two high-speed rail stations. The presence of the Northern Powerhouse's chief architect, Chancellor George Osborne, as the MP for Tatton, means there is the will within Whitehall for Cheshire to benefit from devolution. The Powerhouse allows Cheshire companies "to be part of something far greater", according to Cygnet Group chief executive Matthew Kimpton-Smith. His Northwich firm sells specialist machinery, predominantly to China and the United States. He says the Northern Powerhouse gives his company "real power, real punch" on the world stage. But Cheshire has been beaten in the race to take on devolved powers. Officials have had to watch as devolution deals were done with the noisy neighbours in Manchester and Liverpool. They've even lost territory as the Cheshire borough of Halton decided to become part of the Liverpool city region. Over the summer, anxious to avoid being left behind, the two councils in the east and west of Cheshire, plus Warrington, hurriedly put together their own devolution bid to meet a tight government timetable. Warrington Borough Council's chief executive Steven Broomhead, who used to run the Northwest Regional Development Agency, said the bid wouldn't just "enhance and grow" the county's economy - it would allow the borough to escape the influence of its neighbours' elected mayors. But as city regions have so far been the only places to have agreed deals, there's a lack of clarity over what a Cheshire deal might look like. It seems so unclear that the leader of Warrington Borough Council, Terry O'Neill, recently said his authority wasn't sure whether devolution would be "a poisoned chalice or an opportunity". A report by the think tank IPPR North seems to acknowledge this, calling for "greater clarification of the purpose, process and timescale" of devolution deals for counties. It's also not clear whether the government will insist on a Cheshire elected mayor. Until there are firm answers to questions like those, the county's Powerhouse ambitions may just be held back.	Looking at a map, Cheshire might appear to be on the fringes of the Northern Powerhouse, but officials in the county say it's actually the Gateway to it - bringing in commuters and investment.
Ann Clwyd criticised Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, claiming Owen Roberts died "like a battery hen". Although that and 20 other allegations out of 31 were not upheld, the independent investigation did find he died of hospital-induced pneumonia. Ms Clwyd maintained she would be "vindicated". Results of the review show nine of her allegations were entirely upheld and one partially. But 17 were rejected, 11 were not upheld due to insufficient evidence and two were rejected because of insufficient information. A second independent review is now taking place to examine the findings. Among the upheld allegations in the report were responses to the following comments by Ms Clwyd: However, those allegations not accepted by the investigation included claims by Ms Clwyd: Other allegations not accepted included "almost every request I made was ignored or dismissed" and "I saw a nurse in the corridor and asked her why my husband wasn't in intensive care. She just said, 'There are lots worse than him'". Up until now, the results of the investigation - carried out a year ago - went unpublished. But parts of the report were released under a Freedom of Information request. Ms Clwyd told BBC Wales the report summary should not have been made public, especially while another investigation is under way. She disputed there was insufficient evidence for her claims, and said she had additional evidence. She said: "I think that when the other investigation is concluded then my views will be substantially vindicated." By Tomos LivingstoneBBC Wales political correspondent This case has led to a huge political row. We ended up with the extraordinary situation of a Labour MP, Ann Clwyd, being criticised by the Labour First Minister, Carwyn Jones, for failing, in his view, to provide evidence to back up her claims. At the same time, we recently had the Welsh Conservative Party conference in Llangollen and delegates there standing and applauding Ann Clwyd for the work she had done campaigning for better standards of care in the health service. There is a general election of course coming up next year - health care standards are already a central part of that campaign, not least perceived differences in standards between Wales and England. So we are going to hear a lot more about the political row this case has caused and we are going to hear a lot more about the individual case itself, I think, with a second investigation now on its way. The health board has denied breaching confidentiality and said the details released were statements already in the public domain. A health board spokesman said: "We would like to make quite clear that the health board has not released the full report and it is not our intention to breach any confidentiality. "The investigation into Ms Clywd's concerns was overseen by an expert independent panel and completed in April 2013. Since then the health board has received a number of requests under Freedom of Information legislation to release that report. As part of that standard process Ms Clwyd's permission was sought to release the full report but that was refused." The spokesman said it sought legal advice before releasing the summary. He said: "Based on that advice the health board believes it would be in breach of its statutory duty not to release the summary report." The release of the report summary follows a dispute between Ms Clwyd and the Labour Welsh government. First Minister Carwyn Jones has told Assembly Members the MP provided "unattributable" comments about the NHS that "can't be investigated". But Ms Clwyd insisted she had provided Mr Jones with a comprehensive summary of complaints raised. Ms Clwyd led a UK government-commissioned inquiry on how NHS hospitals in England handle complaints and said she also received hundreds of letters from Welsh patients outlining poor experiences they had suffered.	Some serious complaints made by a Labour MP over the hospital care given to her husband before his death have been rejected following a review.

Rita Wharton died when her car was hit after Anita Corless tried to overtake traffic near Welshpool, Powys. Corless, 58, originally from Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, admitted causing death by dangerous driving. She was given a 16-month prison sentence at Mold Crown Court. The driving instructor said she had no memory of the fatal manoeuvre on the A483 road between Welshpool and Pool Quay, last March. The court heard on Tuesday how she was in a line of traffic on a straight stretch of road when she pulled out but there was insufficient room and she caused the crash. Mrs Wharton's Ford Ka, the second in line, was struck by two vehicles. A widow, said to be the lynchpin of the family, Mrs Wharton was declared dead at the scene. "You quite inexplicably drove your vehicle into the face of on-coming traffic in an overtaking manoeuvre that was obviously dangerous," said Judge Niclas Parry. "On-coming vehicles should have been visible to a careful driver. "You are by profession a driving instructor, employed by Lancashire County Council to run speed awareness courses." Speed awareness courses are offered by councils and police forces across Britain to avoid penalties for minor speeding offences. Corless, who was living in Bentham in North Yorkshire at the time of the incident, was herself seriously injured in the crash. The judge told her it was a thoroughly-avoidable fatality which "must be marked by a custodial sentence". In addition to the 16-month jail sentence, Corless was banned from driving for two-years and eight-months, and must take an extended driving test before being allowed back on the roads. The court was told that, despite her age, Mrs Wharton still worked as the head housekeeper at a pub in Powys, and lived her life like a woman in her 50s. In family impact statements, victim she was described by her daughter Diane Dunderdale as "my best friend and my rock".	A driving instructor heading to teach a speed awareness class has been jailed for causing a five-car smash that killed an 83-year-old woman.
Official numbers showed revenues down 32.2% for the period to 16.4bn Macau patacas ($2.05bn; Â£1.36bn). Expectations were for a fall in revenues of just over 31%. Macau is the world's largest gaming centre - ahead of Las Vegas - and the only place in China where casinos are allowed. A special administrative region of China, Macau's economy relies heavily on gambling and shopping - especially by big spending tourists from the mainland. But Chinese President Xi Jinping's campaign against corruption and luxury spending, which began in December 2012, has seen officials and others from the mainland more wary of gaming and spending in the city. China's Communist Party prohibits officials from gambling, but until the 2012 crackdown, officials had reportedly visited Macau's casinos to gamble and spend. China has emphasised Macau's need to diversify its economy away from gambling. The city's build up of new resorts and hotels is expected to help drive general tourism, however, analysts have said Macau will be hard-pressed to build up non-gaming streams of revenue in the near future. Official numbers released on Monday showed the city's economy shrank by 24.2% year-on-year during three months to September, the city's Statistics and Census Service said. "Economic contraction in the third quarter was attributable to the continuous decline in exports of services, of which exports of gaming services decreased by 37.4% year-on-year and exports of other tourism services dropped by 15.3%," it added. Once a Portuguese colony, gaming has taken place in Macau for more than 300 years. For many years it was referred to as the Monte Carlo of the Orient. The city was returned to Chinese rule in 1999.	Revenue in Macau's casinos fell by more than a third in November from a year earlier as China's corruption crackdown continued to drive away some punters.
Mr Ashley failed to appear before a business select committee regarding working terms and conditions at the company's warehouse in Derbyshire. In a letter, he accuses MPs of "abusing parliamentary procedures" in order to "create a media circus at Westminster". Chris Bryant MP said the House could "force" Mr Ashley to attend a meeting. The row follows a BBC investigation into the work practises at the company's warehouse in Shirebrook. Updates on this story and more from Derbyshire The Newcastle United FC owner was given a deadline of 21 March to respond to a letter from MP Iain Wright - who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee - following his no-show. The letter said the committee reserved the right to "take the matter further" should he not attend future dates. In response, Mr Ashley said: "I was disgusted to learn that you have adopted a stance that is deliberately antagonistic. "By refusing to visit Sports Direct to see things with your own eyes, you are missing out on a genuine opportunity to gain a detailed and balanced understanding of the matters you wish to discuss. "I believe you are abusing parliamentary procedure in an attempt to create a media circus in Westminster, which is not in the best interests of any of the people who work at Sports Direct." It is thought that no one has been charged with contempt of Parliament since the 1950s. Mr Bryant said in the Commons on Thursday: "[Mr Ashley] may be the 22nd richest man in Britain, but he is running a modern day sweatshop and this House will get to the truth." The committee is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss the next steps following Mr Ashley's correspondence.	Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has accused MPs of being "deliberately antagonistic" after he was threatened with being in contempt of Parliament.
The 27-year-old woman was attacked at about 20:00 on 20 February while walking along a path between Byres Road and Glenmalloch Place in Elderslie. Police said three men seen in the area at the time may have seen the suspect or "unwittingly" witnessed something. The suspect was white, aged between 35 and 50, and with dark receding hair. He hit the woman, causing her to fall to the ground, and then raped her. Det Insp Louise Harvie said: "Extensive inquiries are continuing to trace whoever is responsible for this serious sexual assault. "There are three men that officers wish to trace as they were seen in the area near to where the incident took place, and may have seen the suspect or unwittingly witnesses something vital to this investigation. "I would urge them to come forward and speak to police." The first man was seen in Stoddard Square, Elderslie, at about 20:00 on Sunday 19 or Monday 20 February. He is described as between 30-50 years of age and wearing dark trousers and a light top. The second man was seen near the Wallace Monument in Main Road, Elderslie, at about 20:15 on 20 February. He is described as being in his 30s, 5ft 10in, of a stocky build with short, dark hair and clean shaven. He was wearing dark trousers and a dark parka-style jacket. The third man was also seen near the Wallace Monument at about 01:10 on 21 February.  He is described as between 30-40 years old, with a broad build and wearing dark jeans, a black jacket and white trainers.	Officers investigating the rape of a woman in Renfrewshire have appealed for three men to come forward, saying they could be vital witnesses.
The 29-year-old, capped 77 times by Wales, will become the first active international to play in the match since Australian Dan Vickerman in 2009. Roberts is currently studying part-time at Cambridge's Queens' College for a Masters degree in medical science. He will join new club Harlequins after the Varsity at Twickenham. "It is going to be a unique experience for me and something that will be different to any other game I've played at Twickenham - it's a different group of players, a different standard and different prize. But it is still a very, very important rugby match," said Roberts. "It won't be like playing for Wales against England in the World Cup, the Barbarians against New Zealand or in an Anglo-Welsh Cup Final for Cardiff Blues as I've done in the past. But I can't wait." Former Munster and Ireland A lock Ian Nagle will also play for Cambridge as they look to end a run of five successive Oxford victories.

Cole Doyle and his family had planned a trip to Costa Rica but the first leg of the journey was overbooked. The family travelled to two other airports and spent an extra C$1,000 (Â£590) to get a flight. The airline has now offered them compensation. It comes after video of a man being dragged from a US flight brought overbooking to public attention. Dr David Dao has said he will sue United Airlines after he lost two front teeth and his nose was broken when the airline called security officers in to help remove him from the plane. He had refused to leave when the airline asked for volunteers to make way for staff members. In response to the huge backlash the company faced on social media, United said it would allocate seats for staff at least an hour in advance, in future. It also promised it would no longer ask law enforcement officers to remove passengers. Separately in the UK, two passengers were asked to leave an Easyjet flight they had already boarded, and told the next flight to their destination was in four days. They decided not to reschedule, as they had booked non-refundable accommodation. After the United incident, the Canadian government announced it would overhaul the rules to "ensure that passengers' rights are protected". But well before that, Cole Doyle and his brother and parents were inconvenienced by an overbooking problem. In March, the Doyle family tried to check in online to their flight to Montreal but could not assign a seat to Cole. When they got to the airport at Charlottetown on Prince Edward Island, they were told there was no seat for him as the flight had been overbooked. His mother, Shanna, asked whether an adult could give up their seat for Cole but was told that even if someone did so, it would be likely to go to another passenger and could not be guaranteed for the boy. The family drove the two hours to Moncton in neighbouring New Brunswick, in the hope of getting on another flight. "I'm crying in the back seat," Cole told the Canadian broadcaster CBC afterwards."Like how do I get to where I'm going? I don't know if I'm even going to make it with my family." Once they got there, though, they found out the flight they wanted had been cancelled. "I thought it was a joke," said Cole's father, Brett. "People are fed up. You shouldn't be able to sell something twice." The family eventually made it to Montreal and caught a connecting flight to Costa Rica for their holiday, but have since complained to Air Canada and received an offer of a C$2,500 (Â£1,500) voucher, along with an apology. An airline spokeswoman told the Canadian Press news agency: "We are currently following up to understand what went wrong and have apologised to Mr Doyle and his family as well as offered a very generous compensation to the family for their inconvenience."	Canada's largest airline, Air Canada, has apologised after giving a 10-year-old boy's seat to someone else.
In Burnell's first action of the season, he beat a field of more than 80 swimmers at Emirates Palace Bay. The 23-year-old, who represented Team GB at Rio 2016, beat Dutchman Ferry Weertman in a sprint to the finish. "At the end of the day, it's about ticking that box and getting the first one under my belt since Rio," said Burnell. "I am out there to win every single race I go into, I am not out there to come second, third or fourth. "So for me it's about turning up to races in the best possible shape I can and showing people what I can do."	Britain's Jack Burnell won gold at the Abu Dhabi leg of the 10km Marathon Swimming World Cup.
The 22 humans who live on Aoshima, off Ehime prefecture, are greatly outnumbered by a population of over 120 cats. Originally brought in to deal with mice infesting fishing boats, the cats now eat scraps, crops or food given to them by tourists or local people. The big increase in visitors to the island has worried the elderly residents living there because it might disrupt their quiet lives.	Tourists from around Japan have been flocking to a tiny fishing community, to see what has been nicknamed Cat Island.
Veteran striker Peter Weatherson bagged a first-half brace, including a penalty, to put the visitors firmly in control at Links Park. Matthew Flynn and Josh Todd both struck from close range around the hour-mark. Todd added his second of late on, with Jim Chapman's side rising to fourth, one point clear of Queen's Park, while Montrose drop to ninth after Berwick Rangers and Arbroath both won.	Annan Athletic moved into the League Two play-off places, routing Montrose.
Global giants Barclays, JP Morgan and HSBC are among 17 banks named as part of the two-year investigation. Banks colluded, using online chat rooms to co-ordinate fictitious bids and offers in order to sway the market, the competition commission says. It has called for the banks to be fined 10% of in-country annual turnover. The banks are now likely to face prosecution at the country's Competition Tribunal over the alleged currency manipulation, which investigators say goes back as far as 2007. Several banks have already said they will cooperate with the authorities. Speaking in parliament earlier, South African President Jacob Zuma welcomed the competition commission's investigation, saying that the government was prepared to act against the distortion of the financial markets "to protect our country's economy". He also reiterated the government's commitment to establish a state bank, adding that new players must be allowed to enter to diversify the financial sector. Analysis: Matthew Davies, Africa Business Report editor, Johannesburg: Foreign exchange scandals have rocked the international markets over the past ten years and now it's South Africa's turn to host one. The governing ANC party says the latest developments expose an "ethical crisis in the South African banking sector". The opposition Economic Freedom Fighters is calling for the banks to have their operating licences immediately revoked. However, another opposition party, the Democratic Alliance says the timing of the case is suspicious, given that in his State of the Nation address last week, President Jacob Zuma referred to the competition authorities as one of the tools that would be used to drive radical economic transformation forward. Even if, as expected, the 17 banks come to some sort of settlement with the South African authorities, the whole saga will still be another blow to the sector's reputation. It has also given certain politicians more ammunition to bash the banks yet again - President Zuma recently accused the country's four largest banks of controlling the economy. The South African rand has nearly halved in value against the US dollar over the past five years, as the country goes through an economic crisis. Major international banks have had to pay out billions of dollars in fines since a global scandal in 2013 over the rigging of foreign exchange markets. Some South Africans on Twitter have been using the hashtag #BanksCollusion to urge national media to intensify their reporting. They argue that largely white-owned media organisations have been soft on reporting corruption in big business, whose upper echelons are still dominated by white management despite the country's majority black population. Apartheid, which legalised racial discrimination against the majority black population, ended in South Africa in 1994 with the election of the first democratic government led by Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013.	Local and international banks have been accused of rigging the price of South Africa's currency, the rand, by the country's competition watchdog.
The former business secretary said the offer to take a 25% stake in the firm's UK operations is "quite close" to what he would have offered. He said it showed a commitment to south Wales after Tata announced it would sell its loss-making UK operations. But he said it was only a first step, with the steel market "awful". "The 25% offer is quite close to what I would have done," said Sir Vince, who served in the coalition government between 2010 and 2015. "It sends the right message the government is committed to south Wales and the steel industry and it is within the rules we have to operate." However, speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales, he said there were still "a lot of hurdles to overcome". "We don't know who the buyer is and if there is a buyer, if they will succeed because the economics of the situation at the moment are pretty awful with the low world prices [for steel] and ferocious competition," he said. This makes a management buyout "risky", Sir Vince said, adding that, long-term, habits in British industry must be changed, with a proper strategy drawn up and more products used that are made in the UK. Responding to suggestions his successor as business secretary, Sajid Javid, had been slow to intervene, he said the government was "reasonably cautious" because of the "economics of the industry". He said: "They haven't done a complete U-turn, but they have acknowledged reality that government has an absolutely key role working alongside private business and I'm encouraged by that. "As a starter it is a good move and we should applaud it. Let's hope there is a good buyer and they can turn it around".	A Tata Steel management buyout is "risky" but the UK government's offer of help is a good one, Sir Vince Cable has said.
Wick Joint Campus is being constructed to replace Wick High School and Pulteneytown and South primaries. It will also have community facilities which will be available to the public. Highland Council said its contractor Hub North Scotland (Wick) Ltd had informed it of delays affecting the completion of the site. The local authority said: "Regrettably it seems unlikely that the campus will be ready to open in October, as envisaged. "Highland Council intends the best facilities possible for children and staff, and will not accept these buildings until work is completed. "The council is working with the contractor to determine what the earliest possible date is for completion of the whole Wick Joint Campus project, and will make further announcements as soon as possible."	A new £48.5m school campus in the Highlands is unlikely to open in October as planned, Highland Council has said.
Many more are feared trapped under rubble after hundreds of buildings collapsed. Thousands of people have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters and mosques. Some have been left homeless after their houses were destroyed, others have fled their homes amid fears of aftershocks and a possible tsunami. Rescue workers used diggers to remove rubble in their search efforts overnight on Wednesday. Others used their bare hands and shovels to find people. A few survivors were pulled out alive on Wednesday. More than 200 buildings were either seriously damaged or toppled in the earthquake. The Pidie Jaya region, on the north Aceh coast, was the hardest hit. The tremor hit just offshore early on Wednesday morning. Many of the homes in the area have corrugated tin roofs which collapsed. Hundreds have also been rushed to the sole functioning hospital, which has been overwhelmed by patients. Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was one of the worst hit areas by the 2004 tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake.	A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Aceh province in Indonesia on Wednesday, killing at least 97 people.
Peter Ward, 54 of Barnstaple in Devon and Richard Hiley, 30 of Tividale in the West Midlands were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday. Ward was given five years and two months, Hiley five years. The pair pleaded guilty to possession, supply and importation of Class A and Class B drugs. Peter Ward was known online as PlutoPete. His business specialised in supplying military-grade foil packaging that claimed to hide illegal materials from detection. He also provided new psychoactive substances, commonly known as legal highs. He was arrested by National Crime Agency officers in Barnstaple in October 2013 following an international operation targeting prominent vendors on dark web marketplaces like Silk Road. Officers searched Ward's rural home and found class A and B drugs and numerous computers. Analysis uncovered his close working with an ex-customer, Richard Hiley, who was commissioned by Ward to convert bitcoins into cash. In December 2013, NCA officers raided Hiley's address in the West Midlands after financial records seized from Ward identified large scale transactions between the pair. Hiley also pleaded guilty to two counts of importing a prohibited weapon after he imported five stun guns. He said they were for personal protection. NCA Branch Commander, Ian Glover, said: "Criminals and their customers like to think that dark web market places provide an anonymous haven. "The reality is that law enforcement works together internationally to identify and pursue these people." Source: US Department of Justice	A major vendor on the illegal Silk Road website and his business partner, were sentenced to five years in prison for drugs offences.
Police were called to Jackson Road in Clacton at about 21:10 BST on Tuesday. The female officer was seriously hurt and remains in hospital and a colleague who also tried to intervene received a minor leg injury, Essex Police said. A 23-year-old woman from Clacton and a man aged 21 were arrested and have been released under investigation. Police are appealing for witnesses. More news from Essex The "disturbance between a group of adults and youngsters" began in Jackson Road and moved to the corner of West Avenue and Agate Road, the force said.	A police officer has been slashed in the face with gardening shears during a large-scale disturbance in Essex.
Lewis, 48, was released from prison in 2015 after serving less than half of a 13-year sentence for drug smuggling. "I've been through the experience - a lot has happened," he told BBC Sport. "I could help young players to avoid some of the pitfalls that you may face in a professional career in modern-day sport." Lewis, who played 32 Tests for England between 1990 and 1996, added: "There are pressures of being a top sportsman, but we're in a very privileged position. After all, you're doing the thing that you love. "But there's not necessarily enough thought going into the planning because of all the money that can be around you, because of a feeling that you can be invincible." Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis was convicted in 2009 after being caught smuggling liquid cocaine into Britain from St Lucia. He has struggled to make ends meet since he left prison in June 2015, but earns some income through office work. His tour of the 18 first-class counties has been organised by the Professional Cricketers' Association and the only payment Lewis will receive is his travel expenses. ''One decision, or a couple of decisions, made over a lifetime for me shouldn't necessarily define who you are," added Lewis, who will begin his tour at his old county Leicestershire on Monday. "You look at that decision you say, 'You know what? I went the wrong way there.' "With that experience I can do this and I can do that and you keep on moving. Once you've recognised you've made the wrong choice, you keep moving." The County Championship season starts on 10 April. Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

The bridge, over the River Wharfe at Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, collapsed in December 2015, affecting 79 homes and businesses. The report, for North Yorkshire County Council, said improved defences should be a "priority". The Environment Agency said it was preparing a funding bid for improved defences. Read more about this and other stories from across Yorkshire The report said heavy rain over the Christmas period fell on ground already saturated following heavy rain throughout November and December. The level of the River Wharfe rose rapidly and overtopped the town's existing defences. It states: "An improved system of flood defences in Tadcaster is a priority for the town. "The current level of protection [for a one-in-25 year flood event] is low and whilst the rainfall preceding the flood was unusual, the risk of a repeat event remains." Don Mackenzie, executive member on North Yorkshire County Council, said: "Clearly we want to see the basic defences built up higher so that we have more than the current 25 year protection. Ideally we would like to see a 100 year protection." Nicola Eades, from Tadcaster Flood Action Group, welcomed the report. "We are working closely with the organisations [on plans for defences] but it will be about what will be acceptable to the public." She also said it would be dependent on what funding would be available nationally and regionally. The report praises the Tadcaster Flood Action Group (TFAG) for its work in improving flood awareness and resilience in the town since 2015. It concludes: "It is undoubtedly true that Tadcaster is better prepared for flooding through the actions and activities of TFAG."	Flooding which caused a road bridge to collapse, cutting a town in two, could happen again, a report has said.
The shortlist for this year's St David Awards, which will be presented on 10 March, has been announced. They acknowledge extraordinary achievements, with categories including citizenship, culture and sport. In the bravery category, Peter Fuller was nominated for stepping in to stop a machete attack in Mold in January 2015. Matthew James from Pontypridd is also nominated for shielding his partner from bullets during last summer's Tunisia terror attacks.

Miriam Briddon died after the collision involving her Fiat Punto and a Volkswagen Golf driven by Gareth Entwhistle near Ciliau Aeron. Entwhistle, 34, from the Aeron Valley, admitted causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol on 29 March, 2014. He will appear again at Swansea Crown Court at the end of July. The crash victim was a former Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi pupil, described by her family as a "creative person who would be truly missed".	A Ceredigion man has pleaded guilty to drink-driving and causing a crash which killed a 21-year-old woman.
Staffordshire Police said officers were called at 03:55 BST to the southbound carriageway, between junction 16 for Crewe/Stoke-on-Trent and 15 for Stoke-on-Trent. The man was taken to hospital where he remains in a critical condition. The southbound stretch was closed after the crash and reopened at about 10:00. Motorists were warned of delays during the morning. See more updates on this story and others from across Staffordshire and Cheshire here West Midlands Ambulance Service said the man, believed to be in his 20s, was lying on the hard shoulder when crews arrived. Spokesman Jamie Arrowsmith said: "He had suffered multiple serious injuries and was suffering from a reduced level of consciousness. "The man received specialist trauma care at the scene before being anaesthetised in order to stabilise his condition. "He was then transported to Royal Stoke University Hospital on blue lights and sirens for further emergency treatment."	A stretch of the M6 was closed after a pedestrian was hit by a lorry.
Nick Dunn, 28, from Northumberland, was one of six Britons accused of illegally possessing weapons while working on a ship providing anti-piracy protection. They were arrested in October 2013, but despite the charges being quashed, a police appeal has blocked their return. Their case was due to be heard later, but has now been adjourned to 22 April. After the announcement by India's Supreme Court, Nick Dunn's sister, Lisa, said: "This isn't the news we wanted to hear." Along with Mr Dunn, the men arrested on 12 October 2013 are: Mr Dunn, who is living in a hostel on the outskirts of Chennai, formally Madras, had said he was "anxious" ahead of the court hearing, which would have been presided over by a judge. The 28-year-old, from Ashington, said he hoped "that we get the decision we so justly deserve". Mr Dunn is staying with two Estonians who were also part of the crew of the private US-owned ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio. Andrew Linnington, of the maritime union Nautilus International, which has been lobbying the UK government on behalf of the crew members, said he feared the six men were being made examples of. He said: "The Indian authorities want to set a deterrent to operators of similar vessels to the one these six men were working on. Just about every element of this case has been disputed." A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: "We appreciate that this continues to be a very difficult time for these men and their families and we are committed to keeping them up to date on the latest developments." He said the prime minister had discussed their case with the with Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Indian High Commissioner Ranjan Mathai on 14 March. "We have lobbied regularly on the importance of ensuring that this case is resolved as quickly as possible," he said.	The family of a British man stuck in India, despite being cleared of weapons charges, has expressed disappointment over a delay in his return home.
Type 22s HMS Cumberland, HMS Campbeltown, HMS Chatham and HMS Cornwall are currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) expects to receive just under £3m from the sales agreed earlier this month. HMS Cornwall has been sold to Swansea Drydocks while the other three have been bought by Turkish firm Leyal. The two companies will recycle as many parts of the former Devonport-based ships as possible. Aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Invincible have also been sold to the Leyal yard in recent years. The four frigates were put up for sale in January with a preference for at least one of them to go to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field. An MoD spokesman said: "We believe this deal represents value for money and a number of tenders were received both nationally and internationally. "Certain aspects of the ships' equipment will be recycled for use on other vessels and we have tried to be as economical with the disposal as possible." Penny Mordaunt, Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, had hoped one of the frigates could have been sunk and turned into a diving attraction but bids in that field were rejected. The ships are expected to leave Portsmouth in the autumn.	Four decommissioned Royal Navy frigates are destined for the scrapyard, the BBC has learned.
The Lions face in-form Super Rugby side Crusaders on Saturday after narrowly beating Provincial Barbarians and losing 22-16 to Blues. Wales wing North, 24, is one of four Lions making their first appearances of the tour in Canterbury. "It's all about building for the Test series but we need to start kicking on now," North said. "After this everyone will have had some game time so everyone's foot is in the door and playing now and I think we can kick on." North scored two tries in the 2013 series which saw the Lions beat Australia 2-1 - their first Test series win in 16 years. The Northampton Saints player sat out the opening two matches along with centre Jonathan Davies, scrum-half Conor Murray and flanker Sean O'Brien. Media playback is not supported on this device North said he was carrying a "bump" when he arrived in New Zealand, but admits it was not easy watching from the sidelines. "The Lions is the pinnacle and to not feature in the first two games is annoying because, like anybody, you just want to play," added North. "But it's just part of touring isn't it? It's the bigger picture now, I knew I'd get my game time as and when and I just have to trust the medical staff and trust Gats [coach Warren Gatland] to make those calls and just be ready for it." Crusaders are the form team in Super Rugby this season, with 14 wins in as many matches and field a team including eight All Blacks against the Lions. North said the quality of the opposition has been no surprise to the tourists and believes it is better to be tested early on the tour than have the relatively easy introduction they had in Australia four years ago. "We always knew the first few games were going to be ropey and not how we want to play," said North. "And I think that was evident in 2013 as well, even though at the same stage we'd won two out of two the performances were not what we'd hoped for. "I think the way we are now is probably better. "You want to be tested in every game don't you? If you get that you become a better team as you go along." And the much-talked-about itinerary means Gatland's men have no time to rest. They face Highlanders on 13 June before the Maori All Blacks on 17 June. Those games are followed by three Tests on consecutive Saturdays against world champions New Zealand, which are North's targets. "For me and with an eye to the the Test series I have to make sure when I get my chance I play well," he added. "It's not just about the wings against us but quality wings we have in our own squad. "I have to make sure I take my chance and really kick on."	George North believes the British and Irish Lions must "kick on" after a tough start to their New Zealand tour.
The 22-year-old joins an impressive list at the Aegon Open on 4-12 June, including Caroline Wozniacki, Victoria Azarenka, and British top three Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Naomi Broady. Robson reached world number 27 in July 2013, but has struggled since returning from a serious wrist injury last year. "I am excited to be returning to Nottingham," Robson said. "I remember how great the grass courts are there. Preparing well on the grass is key ahead of Wimbledon and Nottingham is the perfect place to start. "I really enjoy this time of year, to be able to play in front of a home crowd. It is fantastic to see a strong British turnout for the event as the fans always create such a great atmosphere."	Former British number one Laura Robson will play at next month's grass-court Wimbledon warm-up event in Nottingham.
The members of the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency, conspired with criminal hackers, according to DOJ officials announcing the charges. Previously, Yahoo said "state-sponsored" hackers were behind the 2014 breach affecting 500 million accounts. The suspects are also alleged to have targeted Google accounts. Hacking was directed at Russian and US government officials, including security, diplomatic and military personnel, according to the DOJ. The indictment also alleged that 30 million Yahoo accounts were commandeered without authorisation for use in a spam campaign. "We will not allow individuals, groups, nation states, or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country," said acting attorney general Mary McCord, announcing the charges. The suspects were named in a DOJ press release as: Baratov was arrested on 14 March in Canada. One of the alleged hackers has been on of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals for more than three years, according to acting Att Gen McCord. The suspect in question, Alexsey Belan, was aided by the FSB who - according to the DOJ - provided him with "sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by US and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia". "We would hope [Russia] would respect our criminal justice system and respect these charges," said acting Att Gen McCord, acknowledging the fact that the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia. "The United Kingdom's MI5 made substantial contributions to the advancement of this investigation," added FBI executive assistant director Paul Abbate. Yahoo was criticised for the delay in informing users about the 2014 breach. The stolen data included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, but not credit card data, according to Yahoo. Last year, users were advised to change their passwords. Around eight million UK accounts were believed to have been affected - including some users of BT and Sky email services. "The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored," Yahoo said in a statement, responding to the DOJ announcement. "We are deeply grateful to the FBI for investigating these crimes and the DOJ for bringing charges against those responsible." The DOJ said that the charges have no connection to the hack on the Democratic National Convention last year.	Two Russian spies are among four individuals indicted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over a huge theft of Yahoo user accounts.
The research was carried out by scientists from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University College Dublin, the University of Edinburgh and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. They say it shows the divergence may have began 360 years ago. It also suggests Travellers are closely connected to Irish settled people. The researchers found that any genetic disparities between Travellers and settled people in the Republic are largely due to them remaining genetically isolated for several centuries and their numbers decreasing. It is thought there are about 30,000 people living in the Republic of Ireland who are members of the Travelling community, representing 0.6% of the total population. Previously it had been thought that Travellers had become displaced between 1845 and 1852 as a result of the Great Famine. "The findings confirm that the Irish Traveller population has an Irish ancestry and this comes at a time where the ethnicity of Travellers is being considered by the Irish state," the Royal College of Surgeons' Prof Gianpiero Cavalleri said. "It is important to emphasise that although Irish Travellers show clear features of a genetic isolate, they are genetically very close to settled people in Ireland. "It is also interesting to observe that the isolation of Travellers from settled people predates the Great Famine. "However it's important to emphasise that our research estimates the beginning of the social divergence of the Travelling community, rather than their origin." DNA samples from 42 Irish Travellers were compared with that of 143 European Roma, 2,232 settled Irish, 2,039 British, 5,964 European and 931 individuals from the rest of the world for the study. Several genetic dating methods were also used to estimate the period when the travelling community began to split genetically from the settled population in Ireland.	A study of Irish Traveller genetics has suggested that they split socially from the settled population much earlier than thought.
She said she was "so proud and excited" about her new role, describing it as "a dream come true". Terry, who has performed at the Globe in As You Like It, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Love's Labour's Lost, will take over from Emma Rice in April 2018. Terry won an Olivier award for her performance in Tribes at the Royal Court in 2010. She also wrote and starred in the Sky One series The Cafe, with Ralf Little. Neil Constable, chief executive of Shakespeare's Globe, said: "Audiences have loved her sparkling and intelligent performances on our stage over the years - now they will have the opportunity to see her fresh artistic vision come to life as she moves into a new phase of her impressive career." Terry most recently starred as the king in Henry V at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre, and as Grace in Katie Mitchell's production of Cleansed for the National Theatre. The actor-manager is a role as old as the theatre itself, and is a tried and tested practice at the Globe - with Mark Rylance combining the roles with considerable success during his stint as its artistic director. There is no obvious reason why an intelligent and versatile actress such as Michelle Terry, who is immersed in Shakespeare and the Globe, shouldn't make a success of it too. This is as long as she is free to pursue her creative vision without unwelcome intrusion from a board who made a complete hash of the Rice era. The news comes following the controversial announcement of Rice's departure. She is leaving after the Globe's board decided her methods were not authentic enough. Rice took charge of the London theatre in January 2016 but has come in for fierce criticism, including for her use of sound and lighting technology. Earlier this year Rice wrote an open letter to her successor, in which she claimed the board had sought to impose "a new set of rules that I did not sign up to and could not stand by". Rice is now launching a new theatre company at London's Old Vic. The Globe, which opened in 1997, is a reconstruction of a Shakespearean theatre on London's Southbank.

Margaret Stewart admitted stealing from her employer Ivanhoe Cambridge, which used to own Glasgow's St Enoch Centre. She then used her position as treasurer at the boys club to pay cheques into its account before taking the cash. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Stewart, 48, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, was also told to repay £27,000. The court previously heard that Stewart worked in the accounts department of Ivanhoe Cambridge UK, which sold the St Enoch Centre in 2013. Between May 2008 and January 2011 she had managers at the firm sign cheques that were supposed to be used to make legitimate payments. Stewart would then write over the payee name and insert the football team's name. The money would go to the club before Stewart took it for herself. She was caught after a bank spotted a problem with one of the cheques from Ivanhoe Cambridge and phoned her office. Stewart then immediately confessed to her superiors and a payment plan was put in place for her to repay the money. The court heard that although more than £5,000 was repaid, the plan was not completed and her house was put on the market. The house was rendered worthless due to Japanese Knotweed, and Stewart was later reported to police. Stewart appeared for sentencing on Thursday having earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzling the money. The court heard that Stewart's husband had been jailed in 2003 for three-and-a-half years for drug dealing and she had resorted to theft to repay the debts that he wracked up. Imposing a community payback order, Sheriff Linda Ruxton told Stewart that her embezzlement was "deliberate and systematic" but she accepted the "impact on her of her husband's criminal behaviour". The Rangers Supporters' Association Boys Club was founded in 1960 for boys between five and 17-years-old. Former players include Barry Ferguson, Lee McCulloch, Graham Dorrans and Charlie Miller.	A woman who tried to launder £55,000 of stolen cash through Rangers Supporters' Association Boys Club has been told to carry out 260 hours unpaid work.
After talks in Nairobi, President Obama and Kenyan counterpart Uhuru Kenyatta said they were "united against terrorism" and efforts to deal with it. But the two leaders differed sharply in their positions on gay rights. While Mr Obama spoke strongly against discrimination, Mr Kenyatta said Kenya did not share the same values. Earlier Mr Obama praised Africa's economic and business potential in a speech. "Africa is on the move... People are being lifted out of poverty, incomes are up (and) the middle class is growing," he told a business summit. BBC Africa Live: Obama in Kenya as it happened He also visited a memorial for those killed in the 1998 US embassy bombing. The trip, which began on Friday, is Mr Obama's first visit as president to the country where his father was born. Barack Obama said he was encouraged by statements President Kenyatta had made about the need to root out corruption. People were being "consistently sapped by corruption at a high level and at a low level" and there was a need for "visible prosecutions," Mr Obama said, to show Kenyans that action was being taken. "They don't have to be a forensic accountant to know what is going on." Police officers and civil servants had to be paid properly to help curb corruption, but sometimes it just required "breaking the habit". Unlike some other Western leaders, Mr Obama neither lectured Mr Kenyatta nor patronised him at their joint press conference. Instead, he spoke like a friend - that Kenya needed to stamp out corruption to attract investments and to make life easier for its own businessmen who have to pay bribes. And Mr Obama pointed out that the US was also once badly affected by corruption, but it had overcome the problem, giving hope to Kenyans. What Kenya needs, Mr Obama said, were "visible prosecutions".  Will Mr Kenyatta make sure that this happens or will it be business-as-usual after Mr Obama leaves? As for gay rights, Mr Kenyatta left the clear impression that Kenya will not legalise homosexual relations.  Mr Obama is likely to continue to speak in favour of gay rights, but there was no indication that the issue could cause a serious rift between the two countries. President Obama had told the BBC he would deliver a blunt message on gay rights when he travelled to Africa - and defended his stand in response to a question at the joint news conference. "If somebody is a law-abiding citizen, who is going about their business... and not harming anybody, the idea that they are going to be treated differently or abused because of who they love is wrong. Full stop," he said. But Uhuru Kenyatta said gay rights were not "foremost" in the minds of Kenyans. There were "some things that we must admit we don't share - our culture, our societies don't accept," he said. "It's very difficult for us to be able to impose on people that which they themselves do not accept." In other comments, President Obama said: Five things we learned from BBC Obama interview Obama Kenya trip more than just symbolic How US and China compete in Africa	The US president has urged Kenya to hold "visible" trials to tackle corruption, which he said could be the "biggest impediment" to further growth.
The hosts led when Ben Richards-Everton volleyed home but Jordan Hugill slotted in to equalise for the visitors. With four minutes of extra time left, Jordan Clark restored the lead but Hugill levelled again in added time. But Billy Kee struck in the third minute of stoppage time to give Stanley victory over their Lancashire rivals. Kee also scored in Accrington's 3-1 win against Colchester on the opening day of League Two. They have now knocked out higher league opposition in the EFL Cup for the second successive year after they beat Burnley last season. Accrington Stanley boss John Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire: "I'm delighted with the result as it was a difficult game. It was a full-blooded derby and just to be competing against teams like this on what we believe is a level playing field is testament to how far the club's come. "Preston are a good side and they showed that. They moved the ball really well and we knew that from when we played them in a pre-season friendly. "We were a different animal tonight. We created far more problems for them." Preston North End manager Alex Neil told BBC Radio Lancashire: "To be honest we shouldn't have been forcing for extra-time. At 1-1 we looked like we were going to go on and win the game. "When we conceded the corner I thought I've seen this a million times before. We conceded from a set piece which is really frustrating. "If you look at the game, we had numerous opportunities and chances, we didn't take them or make them count and ultimately we got punished because of that."

It investigated online agents Booking.com, Expedia and hotel group InterContinental Hotels (IHG). The probe initially suspected the deals infringed competition law as they limited price competition. But it has now allowed such deals subject to certain conditions. The OFT has enabled online agents to discount the hotel's room price, to promote more competitive pricing. Previously, the websites were unable to offer discounts. Under the conditions, the OFT said consumers must first sign up to a membership scheme with a hotel, either of the agents, or another online agent. Customers must have also previously booked one room at the full rate with the online agent or hotel, to be eligible for future discounts, said the OFT. Booking.com and Expedia are two of the UK's largest online travel agents. The OFT launched its investigation in 2010 to look at allegations that there could be agreements and concerted practices resulting in fixed or minimum resale prices. Whether or not the move will open up competition and drive down prices is subject to some debate. Gaucho Rasmussen, enforcement director at the OFT, said he had looked at the conditions "very, very carefully". He said: "We did some consumer research and a significant amount of people would shop around and use smaller websites and new starters." Mr Rasmussen said the OFT had carried out two consultations and the decision was the best outcome. He said as the market kept changing, smaller websites could innovate and find a way to keep ahead. Dorian Harris, founder of discount booking website Skoosh, said he did not think the move would open up the market and push prices down. He said: "I am baffled by the outcome." Smaller companies, such as Skoosh, could not afford to change their marketing strategy and hotel contracts to accommodate the OFT's conditions, so would struggle to offer the discounts, he said. Mr Harris says the conditions would discourage new consumers from using smaller, unknown websites rather than Booking.com or Expedia: "The OFT have not understood the market. It is a huge failure in assessment." He said consumers would not want to pay for a full-rate room, to qualify for the discount rooms, from a new website such as Skoosh. They would instead prefer to get the discount straight away from larger websites, such as Expedia, where customers would most probably have already bought a premium-rate hotel room from, to qualify. He said the conditions would reinforce Booking.com or Expedia's dominance, adding the OFT had "pandered to the interests" of the two big companies. The OFT's Mr Rasmussen acknowledged there was a chance the set-up could lead to further monopoly, but he said the OFT would be monitoring movements in the market.	The OFT has made a move to try to help people access discounts when booking online, after closing an investigation into competition practice between three companies.

The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT. Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work. People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary. However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached. James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future. He spoke to Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales' Peter Johnson about what the new role will involve.	Powys council is to take over the role of regulating Britain's estate agents from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) from 1 April.
It has been alleged that some details from the paper were shared in advance on a private social media group. The investigation concerns the CCEA A2 business studies paper which candidates sat on the afternoon of Monday 12 June. CCEA chief executive Justin Edwards confirmed they were "aware of an allegation of malpractice". The BBC understands that a small number of pupils from two Belfast grammar schools are involved. The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) is the Northern Ireland exam setting and qualifications body. When asked by the BBC if an investigation into the paper was taking place, Mr Edwards said that the CCEA investigated all allegations of malpractice. "We are aware of an allegation of malpractice in relation to the A2 business studies examination held last Monday," he said. Sanctions for exam malpractice can include a loss of marks for an exam or disqualification.	Northern Ireland's exams body, CCEA, is investigating an alleged leak of some details from a business studies A-Level paper, the BBC understands.
Bristol Sport Ltd, which owns the football club, wants to replace two stands to increase capacity. The plan is an alternative to proposals to build a new stadium at nearby Ashton Vale, which has been delayed by an application for a town green. Majority shareholder Steve Lansdown confirmed the club would begin work at a shareholder meeting on Tuesday. The work was approved by Bristol City Council in November. Mr Lansdown told the club's official website: "We'll sign the section 106 agreement any day now, and then we have six weeks to wait for the judicial review period. "We wanted to give some certainty to supporters, so if we get through to March with no judicial review, then we will be going ahead with the redevelopment plans, starting in May."	A £40m revamp of Bristol City's Ashton Gate ground will go ahead this summer, the club has announced.
Torrents of water brought down a suspended ceiling and damaged stock in the Victoria Centre store at about 22:40 BST on Tuesday. Managers had hoped for a weekend reopening but it is now closed "until further notice". Staff have been helping with the clean-up operation. Water poured through from a rooftop room, leaving the top floor under three inches of water and stock "significantly" damaged. A spokeswoman said: "Our teams are working around the clock to get the shop open as quickly as possible and we're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused to our customers."	John Lewis's Nottingham store is to remain closed longer than expected after 80,000 litres of hot water leaked from a ruptured heating pipe.

A total of 304 people, mostly school students, were killed when the ship - which was overloaded and illegally redesigned - sank off Jindo island. The government has faced a day of anger with relatives cancelling at least one memorial service in protest. Divers have recovered all but nine of the bodies. Relatives say the ship must be raised and their remains found. The government says salvaging the ship will cost $110m (Â£74m) and has previously refused to commit to doing so. But President Park Guen-hye, speaking at a port in Jindo, said she would take "the necessary steps to salvage the ship at the earliest possible date". South Korea's National Assembly adopted a resolution saying a speedy recovery of the ferry would help heal "the minds of the victims, survivors and bereaved families... as well as those of all the citizens". But relatives of the missing students had said there were not convinced that the Sewol would definitely be raised, the BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul reports. They remain wary of the plan, and called Ms Park's announcement vague and politically motivated. Steve Evans, BBC News, Seoul: Even as President Park gave the bereaved families what they had been asking for, she must have felt their wrath and their grief. Dressed in the black of mourning, she stood on a windy breakwater near where the Sewol sank and announced that the vessel would be raised - just as the families had demanded. "I have a heavy heart and my heart aches to think how painful it is," she says. But bereaved families had left the port before she arrived, a gesture the South Korean media interpreted as a protest against what the families allege is her previous inaction over both the raising of the Sewol and fulfilling the promise of an independent enquiry. Demands for answers go on How can ferry be raised? Memorial ceremonies are being held across the country on Thursday. But relatives cancelled a planned service in the city of Ansan in protest against Ms Park's absence from the event. In the morning, Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo was prevented from entering the venue by relatives of those who died. Investigators say the ferry sank after an inexperienced crew member made too fast a turn. The combination of an illegal redesign and overload meant the ship was unstable. But some relatives say they want an independent and more thorough inquiry into the disaster, which sparked countrywide debate about regulatory failings and official incompetence. Most of the crew of the Sewol survived. The captain and three senior crew members have since been given long jail terms for failing to protect passengers. Eleven other crew members were imprisoned, as was the captain of the a coast guard vessel involved in the botched rescue effort. Separate trials were held for employees of the ferry operator, Chonghaejin Marine Co. Its owner, Yoo Byung-eun, disappeared after the disaster and was eventually found dead. Bedrooms of the remembered	South Korea's president has promised to raise the Sewol ferry, as the nation marks a year since the disaster.
"Welcome to Canada - honeymoon capital of the Commonwealth," David Johnston said before crowds at Government House. Prince William, who began his address in French, Canada's official language alongside English, said he and his wife had had a "longing" to visit together. The duke and duchess earlier visited Canada's National War Memorial. The couple will be staying at Government House - also known as Rideau Hall - while in Ottawa. Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke after the governor general, saying: "Your journey across our fair Dominion marks the beginning of your journey into the hearts of Canadians. We wish you all the best on both counts. "We are both honoured and delighted that you have chosen us for your first official tour together." Prince William responded: "Merci beaucoup, Votre Excellence et Monsieur le Premier Ministre, pour votre accueil chaleureux." This was translated live on Canadian television as: "Thank you very much Your Excellency and Prime Minister for your warm welcome." The duke continued: "Catherine and I are so delighted to be here in Canada. By Peter HuntBBC royal correspondent They are the British and, indeed, the Canadian monarchy's future. The enthusiastic, large crowds were keen to catch a glimpse of their future king and queen - this in a country where, according to a recent opinion poll, almost half of its citizens think the monarchy "is a relic of a colonial past that has no place in Canada today". The dissenters weren't in evidence today. The streets were filled by the dedicated and the curious. They saw a much talked about "fresh and modern" royal couple carry out a tried and tested programme of engagements, including a speech by Prince William in English and French. He'll be partially bilingual for the next nine days as he tours a country which has had both French and British monarchs. More from Peter Hunt "Instilled in us by our parents and grandparents, who love this country, we have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time - and before we were married, we both had a longing to come here together. "The geography of Canada is unsurpassed and is famous for being matched only by the hospitality of its people." Switching to French again, Prince William joked: "It will improve as we go along." The royal couple later attended a barbecue hosted by Mr Johnston, who acts as the Queen's official representative in Canada. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth and Queen Elizabeth II, Prince William's grandmother, is its head of state. At the war memorial earlier, Prince William laid a wreath and his wife Kate placed a bouquet of flowers. They split up to greet some 3,000 well-wishers. Before their walkabout fans could be heard chanting: "We love you Kate", but there were also screams for the duke. Alexandra Anghel, 18, from Ottawa waited five hours to see the royal couple. She said the duchess seemed "down to earth". "It was a surreal moment to meet her, someone I never thought I would ever meet and there she was in front of me. William's lineage is amazing, he's literally walking history - I can't believe I saw walking history." The duke and duchess, who married in April, will visit seven Canadian cities on their nine-day visit, before heading to the US. On Friday, they will celebrate Canada's national day. The pair will also visit Quebec, Prince Edward Island, where they are to participate in a dragon boat race, and Calgary. In Calgary they will open the Calgary Stampede - an annual rodeo and festival dubbed the "greatest outdoor show on Earth". Canada has created a new royal flag for the visit, which features three maple leaves, from Canada's national tree, at its base. The flag flew from the cockpit of the jet carrying the royal couple when it touched down from the UK on Thursday afternoon local time. It will also fly from their cars and buildings they are visiting or staying in. Map of tour highlights The visit will be closely followed by the media, with nearly 1,400 journalists - including about 100 from Britain - accredited to cover the visit. The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly packed up to 40 different outfits for the tour. She left London wearing a dress by French designer Roland Mouret and a blazer by Canadian label Smythe les Vestes and changed into a navy lace dress by Erdem Moralioglu during the flight to Ottawa. Mosha Lundstrom Halbert, associate fashion news editor at Canadian fashion magazine Flare, said Kate's choice of clothing was symbolic. "It's very exciting," she said. "To me, Erdem really represents the crossover between British and Canada fashion. He's really established in the UK but Canada is where he was born and raised." BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt says Canada is a safe first visit for a royal spreading her new wings, while US residents continue to be fascinated by Britain's royalty. The cost of the visit to the Canadian government, not including security, is estimated to be 1.4 million Canadian dollars (Â£958,580). A poll commissioned by the Toronto Star newspaper found that more than half the 18 to 34 year-olds questioned about the visit were indifferent about the trip. The duke and duchess will travel to the US state of California for two days from 8 July, attending a black-tie Bafta reception and dinner in Los Angeles on 9 July. Prince William is Bafta's president.	Canada's governor general has welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Ottawa at the start of the royal couple's first official overseas tour.
The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19. The failure to find an agreement between Greece and its creditors continued to hang over shares. In economic news, the latest numbers on US consumer spending showed a monthly increase of 0.9%, the biggest gain in six years and accelerating from April's 0.1% rise. Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening labour market. Oil and gas producer Magnum Hunter Resources shares rose 6% after it said it expected to raise $600-$700m by selling its 45.5% stake in its natural gas gathering subsidiary, Eureka Hunter Holdings. Its shares had fallen some 44% this year on concerns over its liquidity. Shares in Nasdaq listed Netflix fell 2% on the news that billionaire investor Carl Icahn had sold his remaining stake in the TV and movie subscription service, in part because he is worried that financial markets are "extremely overheated".	(Close): A supreme court ruling that upheld a key part of President Obama's healthcare plan lifted shares in US health companies.
The figures come ahead of Wednesday's AGM where investors will quiz management over their plans for the Hinkley Point nuclear plant in the UK. EDF, 85% controlled by the French state, has struggled to find the cash for its 66.5% stake in the project. In April it pushed a final decision on the £18bn plant back to September. Chief financial officer Thomas Piquemal resigned in April following an internal disagreement over whether to press on with the controversial project. However, EDF has outlined plans to raise €4bn, with up to €3bn provided by the French government. Credit rating agencies are due to assess the group in the coming days and their verdict on its finances will determine how easy it will be for the group to raise cash. Meanwhile, tough market conditions mean EDF is cutting costs and planning to sell €10bn in assets by 2020, including a stake in French power-grid operator RTE. On Tuesday the new chief financial office Xavier Girre, said the management was not considering spinning off any part of the group to raise money. Its latest earnings report shows it has reduced its target for 2016 nuclear output to 408-412 terawatt-hour from 410-415. The scaling down of its output reflects continuing problems at its Paluel nuclear facility in France where a steam generator collapsed during maintenance. Sales fell 7% to €21.4bn in the first three months of the year, with sales in the UK down 9.8%. The company said its earnings forecast for 2016 remained on track.	French energy giant EDF says sales fell 7% in the first three months of the year in the face of stiff competition, a mild winter and lower energy prices.
Tshibola, 20, came through the Royals' academy system and signed his first professional contract last summer. He made his professional debut against Nottingham Forest in August. Bingham, 21, joined Mansfield from Wigan Athletic in the summer and has scored four goals in 20 games for the Stags in all competitions. Pools are awaiting clearance from the Football Association and the Football League for the duo to feature against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.	Hartlepool United have signed Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola on a one-month loan deal and Mansfield striker Rakish Bingham on a season-long loan.
The Scottish government said the review group would assess whether college and university students in Scotland receive fair and effective support. Ms Gadhia, who has been chief executive officer of Virgin Money for nine years, will also make recommendations for improvements. The group will report its findings in 12 months' time. The review group will look at whether effective support is being provided for the poorest and most vulnerable students. It will also examine the current repayment threshold and period for student loan debt. It is being carried out as part of the programme for government announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September. Minister for Further Education Shirley-Anne Somerville said: "With such strong financial experience, and already contributing to Scottish education as a member of the International Council of Education Advisers, Jayne-Anne will provide a fresh perspective to the work of the review. "I look forward to the recommendations that the review group will offer." Ms Gadhia, who last year led a UK government review into women in finance, said: "It is important to ensure the student support system is fit for purpose, fair and firmly focused on meeting the needs of all students in further and higher education, particularly the most vulnerable. "As such, I welcome the opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of the current systems of student support in Scotland." The review, which will be carried out jointly with universities and colleges, has been welcomed by Colleges Scotland. Shona Struthers, the chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: "We want a standard and fair system for student support funding that provides students with adequate financial support, as well as reasonable certainty on the support they are likely to receive for the duration of their study. "We fully support measures to improve student support funding to ensure that all students can attend college, regardless of their personal circumstances or background." The announcement was made as figures from the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS) showed the number of students being paid grants across Scotland fell by 4.8% on last year as an increasing number take out loans. However, the total cost being spent on grants increased by 3.9% - from £63.6m in 2014-2015 to £66.1m in 2015-2016, according to the SAAS report. The number of students taking out loans rose during the same period by 3.4% to 92,005 and the total authorised in loans was £486.3m, a 3.7% increase. The average loan per student in 2015/16 was £5,290, up £20 on the previous year. Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: "These are hugely worrying figures, and show that the SNP has slashed bursary support in recent years. "At a time when we should be doing all we can to close Scotland's attainment gap, the SNP has chosen to cut the money given to those who need it most. "Bursaries are designed to help students get their foot in the door but this is becoming increasingly hard, and it's those in our poorest communities who are missing out." Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: "Figures released today show that almost 20,000 fewer students are receiving grants and bursaries than at the beginning of the last parliament. "Meanwhile student debt - which the SNP came to power promising to abolish - has soared under the SNP government. "Labour supports free tuition but students need the financial support to get through university when they get there. Instead the SNP has slashed bursaries and ballooned debt."	Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia has been appointed to review the student support system in Scotland.
The station, based in Toxteth, was set up as part of a government initiative three years ago and has been supported by money from the BBC licence fee. Another operator, Made TV, provided further support, but the BBC understands the station has struggled. Bay TV's chief executive said he hoped it would be sold as a going concern. Chris Johnson added he was optimistic the channel would continue. Peter Harold, of Skelmersdale-based adminstrators Refresh Recovery, said a meeting with the station's 20 staff had been held. He said more than one buyer was interested in taking over the business, "but we have a few more hoops to jump through first". Bay TV, which was awarded a licence in February 2013, continues to broadcast and can be viewed on Freeview and Virgin. In addition to news, sport and music, the station also covers arts, culture and religion.	The owners of Bay TV, Liverpool's local television station, have insisted it will survive despite going into administration.
Club director Emilio Butragueno confirmed Fifa had asked the Spanish Federation for documents relating to transfers over the last five years. Butragueno said the club was "absolutely calm" about its behaviour. Fifa handed Barcelona a transfer ban until 2016 after they breached regulations when signing 10 players under the age of 18 in 2013. In a statement, Real Madrid said the majority of the 51 players that world football's governing body had asked for information on were exempt from regulations for various reasons. Fifa rules state that international transfers are only permitted for players who are over the age of 18 - unless the player in question meets one of three qualifying criteria. Under-18s can move to a club in a different country if: Real claim 10 of the 51 players were Spanish nationals, while 23 foreign players had already been registered with a Spanish club. On Thursday, Real completed the £2.3m signing of 16-year-old Norway midfielder Martin Odegaard from Stromgodset. Barcelona are not allowed to sign any players in 2015 after their appeal against their transfer ban was dismissed in December.	Fifa is investigating Real Madrid's youth transfer policy and has asked the club for information on 51 players.

The English League One club are looking to replace Luke Williams who left the Wiltshire outfit last week after they were relegated. Archibald has impressed The Robins owner/chairman Lee Power in guiding Thistle to a top six finish in the Premiership this season. Partick Thistle say they have yet to receive an approach. Archibald was approached by Shrewsbury in October but decided he had "unfinished business" with Thistle. The 39-year-old is the longest-serving manager in Scotland's top flight and was in the four-man shortlist for the PFA Scotland manager of the year, won by Celtic's Brendan Rodgers. Other names, who have been linked with the Swindon vacancy but appear to be out of the running, are the former Queens Park Rangers boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselabaink and Mansfield Town manager Stevie Evans.	Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald is on a shortlist of candidates for the Swindon Town vacancy.
The incident, in a village in western Bengkulu province, sparked a rare debate in Indonesia about sexual violence. The maximum penalty would have been 15 years each, but the judge said he took into account the boys' youth. The girl, Yuyun, went missing on 2 April on her way back from school. Her body was found in undergrowth two days later by villagers, bruised, beaten and with her hands tied. The case was not widely covered by Indonesian media until it was picked up by activists online several weeks later. That led to protests in the capital, Jakarta, and prompted the Minister for Child Protection Yohana Yembise to call for rapists to face the death penalty. Five men are also facing trial in connection with the case, and police say two more suspects are still on the run.	Seven boys below the age of 18 have been sentenced to 10 years in jail each in Indonesia for the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.
Two Diarmuid Murtagh goals helped Connacht lead 2-3 to 0-3 before Aidan Breen replied with an Ulster goal. Damien Comer hit a third Connacht goal as they led 3-6 to 1-10 at half-time before Ulster took control. Despite losing Chrissy McKaigue to a black card, Ulster hit 1-4 without reply, with Charlie Vernon netting. McKaigue was joined in the Ulster squad at Carrick-on-Shannon by his Slaughtneil team-mate Brendan Rogers, despite their upcoming All-Ireland club championship duties. Connacht started strongly with their scorer in chief Murtagh firing their opening goal after 7 minutes and again finding the net two minutes later. Ulster responded well with Fermanagh's Breen finding the net for his provincial for the second time in a week with a 18th-minute goal. Pete McGrath's charges cut the gap to two points twice over the next six minutes, and left the minimum between the sides for the first time, after a Tomas Corrigan score. However, Connacht were causing the Ulster defence problems, with Galway's Comer cutting in for a 28th minute goal, as the hosts led by two at the break. Ulster came fired up on the restart, and despite losing substitute McKaigue to a black card, kept motoring well. Peter Harte and Corrigan added point before Vernon cut through for a goal in a spell which saw Ulster score 1-4 without reply. Connacht could only manage two points from frees in the closing quarter, with Emyln Mulligan and Paul Conroy on target. After the game Ulster captain Eoin Donnelly accepted the cup from GAA President Aogan O Fearghail.	Ulster clinched a 32nd Interprovincial football title as they produced a strong second half to earn a 2-16 to 3-10 comeback win over holders Connacht.
John Kane filmed more than 60 women in the Central Retail Park and a nearby supermarket last July. The 67-year-old also secretly recorded children playing outside a nearby Next store. Kane was placed on the sex offenders register ahead of sentencing on 30 March at Falkirk Sheriff Court. Prosecutor Ann Orr told the court that Kane tried to flush a memory card down the toilet at a police station after being arrested for drink driving. The memory card contained 60 short videos, lasting between 50 seconds and three minutes. Mrs Orr said: "The recordings appeared to be of adult females at various shops in the Central Retail Park. "The camera operator has the camera positioned to show the females from the waist down, focusing on their bare legs and zooming in on their bottoms." The depute fiscal said the memory card also contained three slightly-longer videos showing children aged between six and 12 playing. Mrs Orr said: "One child is doing cartwheels, and the camera zooms in on the crotch area." Mrs Orr said the camera operator's distinctive cream, leather-toecapped trainers and khaki shorts were in shot in many of the videos. She said Police Scotland received an anonymous phone call from someone who expressed "concern" over Kane's behaviour. A search warrant was obtained for his home, and the khaki shorts and distinctive trainers were found in a bag in his spare bedroom. Kane told police he "had a drink in him" at the time the videos were filmed. Asked if what he had done aroused him, he said: "It did at the time, but afterwards I felt ashamed about it." Kane, of Falkirk, admitted operating a recording device to obtain footage of women and children in a public place without their knowledge and consent between 15 July and 22 July last year. Sheriff Derek Livingston deferred sentence for a risk assessment and released Kane on bail.	A pensioner used a mini camera to secretly film women's bare legs in a Falkirk shopping centre, a court was told.
A Chinook helicopter from RAF Odiham in Hampshire was sent to recover the wreckage. Five people were on the training aircraft when it was forced to land on Yr Aran in Snowdonia on 9 August. All five escaped unhurt, but black smoke could be seen billowing from the peak for miles around. Five people - four military and one civilian - were on board the Griffin helicopter from RAF Valley on Anglesey when it made what the Ministry of Defence called a  "precautionary landing". A sixth person involved in the training exercise was already on the mountain when the crew had to land. The exercise involved the helicopter picking people up and putting them back down on the peak.	Recovery of the RAF helicopter which burst into flames shortly after the crew was forced to make an emergency landing began on Monday.
They are sitting on the dusty steps of a hair salon, feet tapping to the rhythm of music. "Music is a pleasure for us," Mr Toure says. "We can now dance and do whatever we want: We can walk together with women, we can shout, we're the young people of Timbuktu, this is what we like doing." Music was banned under the strict Islamic law that militant Islamists imposed when they took over the ancient desert city last year. All traditional folklore and ceremonies that make Malian culture vibrant were declared blasphemous. Other people soon join Mr Toure's little gathering, and a man offers to make some tea. The militants banned men and women from mixing in public. Now, Karia Cisse, who is passing by with a basket full of smoked fish on her head, grabs a cup. "We can chit-chat with our brothers, our friends, and even our boyfriends," she says. "It's a real pleasure, we're so happy. I want to thank God." Residents of Timbuktu can again enjoy the simple things they were used to, before the city fell under Islamist control 10 months ago. They can also dress the way they want to. Women have swapped the full black niqab, or full-face veil, for colourful local pagnes, a piece cloth wrapped around the body to form a skirt. Most of them wear a thin scarf over their head, just as they had in the past. There is an incredible feeling that the people are slowly coming back to life here. However, many have also been quick to vent the frustration and anger built up over months, which, they say, felt like a lifetime. In pictures: Why Malians now love France Scenes of looting on Tuesday revealed the deep inter-communal grievances and raised concerns about possible reprisal attacks. Dozens of people were out in the streets breaking into shops owned by ethnic Arabs and Tuaregs, whom they accuse of having collaborated with the militant Islamists. Weapons and boxes of ammunition were pulled out of at least one shop. However, most Arabs and Tuaregs have already left Timbuktu in fear of violence. But it is also time to uncover the wounds inflicted by the militants. In the city centre, a local bank had been turned into the headquarters of the Islamic police. The symbol of the jihadis - marked with a Koran, an AK-47 rifle and a cutlass that militants had cemented into the wall - has been taken down. A tiny cash machine attached to the building around the corner was used as a cell. Why do we know Timbuktu? In pictures: Timbuktu manuscripts "They threw me in and whipped me," says Salaka Djikke, 25. Ms Djikke was arrested at around 23:00 on New Year's Eve as she went for a romantic ride on her boyfriend's motorcycle. When they arrived in front of his house, her boyfriend saw four jihadis coming at them. She did not see them and got off the bike. "He drove off and got away, but they rushed at me and whipped me." Ms Djikke was sentenced to 95 lashes. It was carried out in a public place, all for being caught with a man she was not married to. Her boyfriend managed to escape and reached the capital, Bamako. He could have been stoned to death had he been arrested. Despite the scars she bears, Ms Djikke says that she does not regret taking the risk. "If they didn't hurt you, they'd hurt your sister or your brother. They terrorised the population," she says. "Even living under Sharia, it shouldn't be a crime to fall in love with another person," she says.	Yacouba Toure and a couple of his friends have gathered around his crackling radio in Mali's historic city of Timbuktu, soon after French-led troops captured it from militant Islamists.
He said he still favoured the use of Sterling, but said the independence case needs "refurbishment". The MP believed a better case for the retention of the pound would prevent the independence case being "gazumped" by opponents in a future referendum. Had Scotland voted "Yes", the planned independence day would have been 24 March. When asked by BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell about the pro-independence camp's stance on currency, Mr Salmond said: "I think the argument you have got to put forward is one which can withstand any position adopted by your opponents. "So, you mustn't allow yourself to be gazumped by your opponents. "Now, I think sterling is the right currency for Scotland, because of a whole range of reasons that we gave during the campaign." The former SNP leader was speaking a matter of weeks after current leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced plans for a fresh campaign for independence. She told her party's spring conference in Glasgow, that she would hear "concerns" and "address questions". In September 2014, voters north of the border decided by 55% to 45% to stay part of the United Kingdom. The SNP's new strategy will begin in the summer, after May's Holyrood election and June's EU referendum. Ms Sturgeon said the party was prepared to challenge some of the answers it gave 18 months ago. Reacting to Mr Salmond's comments, Scottish Labour's Iain Gray said: "As far as I can make out he seems to be arguing again for Sterlingisation, a proposal that would have meant Scotland would have become an independent country and at that very moment given up control over its currency and much of its fiscal policy. "That didn't make sense in 2014, the majority of the Scottish public didn't think it made sense, and it still doesn't make sense now." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Mr Salmond had "a bit of a cheek" in "acknowledging 18 months after the fact that his currency case was always flawed". She said: "People in Scotland have been well served by the pound as part of the UK, particularly with all the shocks and instability we've seen over the last few years in the world economy. "If there is a united push from the SNP to get us back to yet another referendum, I'll be standing full square behind the decision that we as a country made to stay part of the UK." Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said it was time to move on from the whole matter to focus on the "big challenges". He added: "There's no doubt that currency was one of the weakest arguments during the referendum. But the SNP need to move on - we all need to move on from the last five years. It was dominated by independence. "If we keep dragging over the coals from yesterday's argument, we'll never sort out the future." Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was "welcome" and "probably almost inevitable" that the SNP would re-evaluate its position on the pound. He went on: "That idea of a currency union failed to convince us, because Scotland would have been in a situation where it didn't have the freedom to set its own economic policy. There were a great many Yes voters who were not sold on that notion of a currency union. "It's inevitable that there were many people who might ultimately have been persuaded to vote yes, who voted no, and one of the reasons was the lack of clarity on currency."	Former first minister Alex Salmond has called for a fresh look at the currency options for an independent Scotland.
This time, Charlotte in North Carolina is a focal point of unrest, after a black man was killed by officers this week. There have also been peaceful protests in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a police officer has been charged with manslaughter. This is a recurring cycle of violence in the US. According to one research group, over 100 unarmed black people were killed by the police in 2015 and a string riots have occurred following similar shootings in 2016. But what can be done to resolve this? Five US experts share their thoughts on rebuilding trust between black American communities and the police. Like any social problem, the first step is to simply acknowledge that a policing problem exists. I think one of the difficulties Americans are facing right now is that there is some disagreement as to whether there is a problem at all. One practical thing that needs to be done immediately is to push towards more community policing. It really changes the dynamic, the cultural dynamic, because officers are members of the communities they operate in. If a citizen shops at the same grocery store as his local police officer, they will recognise each other as human. I think a lot of the problems we see have to do with geography. You have to put people in the same geographical spaces, to occupy the same spaces. When you do, people see each other and interact with each other, not necessarily in the structured work environment, but in the unstructured social environment. That's why I think community policing works. Christopher Bracey is an expert on US race relations, individual rights and criminal procedure. He is professor of law at Georgetown University in Washington DC. There's always a tendency to say let's train the police and they're not going to be prejudiced and the problem will go away. Well, no. That's obviously important and needs to be done. But clearly, as we've seen in some of the shootings, even the officers have been black. I think the patterns of tension we are seeing now are rooted in long-term inequality and disadvantage. Violence has, for a long time, been concentrated in poor communities, especially segregated communities and minority communities that have been subject to disinvestment on the part of the state. So in some sense, when you look at it scientifically, it's not really a surprise when you see occurrences of conflict between these people and the police. Criminal justice, housing and education reform really need to be coupled to address this issue. That is the message I see from the data. Robert J Sampson is director of the Boston Area Research Initiative and professor of social sciences at Harvard University. Source: Mapping Police Violence/NPR Courts routinely award damages totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to citizens who have suffered injuries or rights violations from the police. Taxpayers pay most of those costs. But as the bills pile up, there is no sign that police acknowledge, analyse or learned from their costly mistakes. In other public service domains - transportation, medicine, child welfare - there are routines for studying what went wrong: warning signs that were missed, lapses in communication, procedures that can be reshaped to prevent future failure. Why not in law enforcement?  Why is there not a collaborative social autopsy of these cases? Decades of lower crime rates and the racial breach in public confidence in the police present new opportunities to fundamentally rethink the policing model and the profession. Jeffrey Fagan is an expert in police accountability and a Professor of Law at Columbia University in New York City. It will take a range of solutions to really address this issue. Policy is a huge part of it and will have a huge impact on police violence. But ultimately it will also take cultural change to address some of the beliefs and prejudices that allow these deaths to happen and allow the system to not do anything about it. We need to shift the perception in America that black people are inherently criminal or that black people are inherently deserving of a punitive approach by the state. We also need to have a broader conversation about what is reasonable force [when making arrests]. You know, in England, you have instances of people armed with knives, or in some cases armed with guns, who are not being killed by police. The police are de-escalating these situations without resulting in deadly force. That seems to be the expectation. That expectation is currently not the norm in the United States. It seems to be the norm of the culture here that if someone has a knife, a gun or even a toy gun that it is totally legitimate to kill them. I think that is something that needs to change. Sam Sinyangwe is a data scientist and activist who founded Mapping Police Violence, which compiles records of police shootings in the United States. I think the most important thing we need to do, honestly, is to fundamentally reconceptualise what we think the job [of an officer] is about. For the last three decades, we have thought about the police as an institution focused on public safety and crime reduction. But that's not all they do. They do a lot of things that are nothing to do with that actually that involve helping citizens and engaging in positive ways, We need agencies to focus on these things. If the police are still understanding their primary role as crime reduction, then we are not going to solve this problem. Tracey Meares served on President Obama's 2014 Policing Task Force.

Leng Ouch gathered evidence to highlight how land concessions (ELCs) were being abused and forcing communities from their homes. His outspoken criticism of the government led to fears for his safety, forcing Mr Ouch into hiding. In 2014, the government cancelled ELCs that covered 89,000 hectares of forest. Despite this, Mr Ouch said he felt the plight of the nation's forests was not improving. "The situation is getting worse year after year," he told BBC News. "There is no improvement, there is more destruction. There is more deforestation and more demand from overseas. "We have lost millions of hectares of land through the land concessions." It is reported that Cambodia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and just 20-30% of its original forest cover remains. One of the driving forces is the demand from nations like China for high-value hardwoods, such as Siamese rosewood that can fetch US $50,000 (Â£35,000) for a cubic metre. Another cause for the high deforestation rate is the introduction of Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) in 2001, which were designed to support economy-boosting large-scale agriculture, such as rubber and sugar plantations. However, the issuing of the ELCs has affected many communities that depended on the land for their livelihoods. Campaigners say that more than 700,000 people have been driven from their homes as a result of ELCs. Leng Ouch's work has taken him undercover and placed him in extreme danger as he attempted to gather evidence of the impact of the ELCs on forests and forest people. Posing as a labourer, he was able to shed light how the land concessions were being used to provide cover for illegal operations. In 2012, a moratorium was imposed on ELCs, but Mr Ouch argued that it did not go far enough and did not stop forests being felled and people being displaced. Mr Ouch explained why he had spent more than two decades investigating and campaigning to highlight the injustices he felt he had witnessed. "There are not many people in Cambodia that do this kind of work and I felt it was necessary for me to step in and defend and protect the forests," he observed. However, he was aware of the dangers of being an environmental campaigner in Cambodia and had often gone into hiding in order to avoid unwanted attention and threats to his life. Winning a globally prestigious environmental prize does not remove the dangers. In March, Berta Caceres - a 2015 Gold Prize winner - was killed by gunmen in Honduras. She had been a vocal campaigner against a project to build a massive dam across the Gualcarque River. He said he was excited to be one of this year's winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize - described as the Oscars of grassroots environmentalism - as it presented an opportunity to tell the wider world about the situation in Cambodia. "I hope the world will help us bring about change, and protect forests for future generations," he said. "I will use this award to protect and defend the forests, and to ask local people and the international community to protect these areas." He added that he planned to use the prize money to help finance his work. Mr Ouch and five other grassroots campaigners will receive their prize at a ceremony in San Francisco on Monday. The other winners are: Edward Loure from Tanzania: Mr Loure led a grassroots organisation that developed an approach to secure land titles to indigenous communities rather than individuals in order to protect the environment for future generations Zuzana Caputova from Slovakia: Ms Caputova, a lawyer, led a campaign that resulted in the closure of a toxic waste dump that was having an adverse impact on the area's environment and community. Luis Jorge Rivera Herrera from Puerto Rico: Mr Rivera Herrera's campaign led to the establishment a nature reserve at a location deemed to be an important nesting ground for the endangered leatherback turtle. Destiny Watford from the United States: Ms Watford mobilised support in her Baltimore community to halt plans to build what would have been the nation's largest incinerator plant less than a mile from the high school where she was a student. Maxima Acuna from Peru: Ms Acuna, a subsistence farmer, protected her right to continue living off her farmland despite a mining company's plans to develop a gold and copper mine on the site.

The star whisked through 23 songs in 90 minutes, in a blur of pyrotechnics, lasers and multiple costume changes. She donned silken butterfly wings for a piano-led version of ...Baby One More Time, and dressed as a ringmaster during a Circus-themed segment. Spears even made a passable attempt at a London accent while chatting to the audience between songs. "Do you wanna get norr-tee?" she teased, doing her best Sid James impersonation before launching into Freakshow - during which she dragged a (slightly over-enthusiastic) member of the audience around the stage on a leash. It was all great fun but, without the elaborate set pieces of her Vegas production, Spears' shortcomings were left exposed. Her vocals rarely seemed to be coming from the microphone, while her dancing lacked attitude and bite. The choreography was over-reliant on hand gestures; and Spears showed a tendency to slip in and out of time, like a clockwork doll whose mechanism had worn out. Her biggest blunder came during the song Touch of My Hand, as she leant over a dancer's arm to initiate a backflip, but teetered on her heels and aborted the move. Frustratingly, Spears showed glimpses of her former glories - pulling off a series of impressive lifts, as well as a punchy dance breakdown during Womanizer - but the routines more often felt like they were stuck in the rehearsal room. Tabloids will undoubtedly criticise the star for miming (the producers insist she sings over a pre-recorded backing track) but, at this point, expecting Spears to sing live is like turning up at Nando's and ordering truffles: The only person you're disappointing is yourself. In the end, Spears has always played second fiddle to her songs - especially in the second half of her career, following a much-documented breakdown in 2007 that means her life is still controlled by a court-approved conservatorship - and those songs provided an unshakeable foundation to her act. By now, the 34-year-old has accumulated enough hits to be able to dispense with ...Baby One More Time and Oops! ...I Did It Again at the top of her show, without worrying about the consequences. Later highlights included an energised version of Gimme More and a pounding, gothic revamp of the early single Stronger. The star only played one new song -  the ethereal, beatific Make Me - which may count as a missed opportunity to reinvigorate sales of her album, Glory, which tumbled down the charts to number 94 last Friday, after just three weeks on sale. But it was the 2004 hit Toxic that received the most enthusiastic reception from the audience, whose singing almost drowned out the loudspeakers at London's Roundhouse. Among the fans joining in with the Britney karaoke were Sam Smith, Rita Ora, Nicholas Hoult and All Saints singer Melanie Blatt; while thousands more were able to watch at home, as the gig was streamed as part of the Apple Music Festival. Spears seemed overwhelmed by the reaction, clasping her hand to her mouth and blurting out, "You guys have been amazing," as she left the stage. Fans may have a long wait before she repeats the show in the UK, however, with her Las Vegas residency already booking into 2017. The Apple Music festival continues until the end of the week, with performances from Michael Buble and Chance The Rapper.

Alongside them in the shade of a small tent adorned in the colours of the ruling party sit two men and one woman, in whose hands the future of this country are held. Front and centre is the man who has led Zimbabwe since the struggle for independence ended in 1980. President Robert Mugabe is 91 years old, has been in power for 35 years, but still oozes energy and passion addressing his supporters and his nation for more than an hour in the midday sun. He may be slower on his feet, but he's still sharp in his mind. To his left, Grace Mugabe, his second wife and the country's first lady; to his right, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who could be king. Since the beginning, Robert Mugabe has dealt ruthlessly with his political rivals and outmanoeuvred those presenting any threat to his leadership. Anyone perceived to have too much power has their wings clipped, or as happened last year, is simply blown out of the sky. Joice Mujuru was the vice-president - the one who sat next to him under the tent at the previous Heroes' Day address. She was an heir apparent who apparently became too much of a threat. Hers really was a fall from Grace as the political purge enforced by Mrs Mugabe cast the vice-president and her huge support base out of the Zanu-PF party. Now the man known as ngwenya, the crocodile, is back in the driving seat, 10 years after he suffered a similar fate. "The nickname of the crocodile is very appropriate for Mnangagwa as he has this reputation of lurking just below the surface and only striking when the moment is apposite," said Derek Matyszak, a senior researcher with the Research and Advocacy Unit in Harare. "The fact that he accepted… the vice-presidency would lead some people to think, well he thinks this is the right moment to be there." But what of Grace? Does the first lady have presidential ambitions? "Grace has been trying to increase her political capital in her own right, probably as a defence mechanism for when Mugabe does depart the scene," he said. "That, I think, has been misinterpreted to some extent to suggest that she has presidential ambition." After a period of growth during a government of national unity, Zimbabwe's economy, its currency pegged to the dollar, continues to fall as investors shy away. More than 80% of the government budget is spent on civil service salaries, and companies are laying off workers after a court ruling lifted the requirement to pay off sacked employees. President Mugabe publicly opposes the decision and used his speech to promise parliamentary action to put this right, but the party of the people knows the civil service expenditure is unsustainable and it's tempting to take advantage. In central Harare, the trading spaces are taken up with second-hand clothes and shoes. Among them are a former banker, who is just trying to make ends meet. "It keeps me going," she says. "Most industries are closing at the moment, so unemployment is a bit high, but if they open up industries, I'm sure things will improve." And a computer science student was optimistic she'd find work when she graduated. "You have to be creative enough," she said. "Like right now, selling these things - it's entrepreneurship - so for me it's cool." The government has threatened a ban on pavement thrift stores, and some traders were forced away to stalls outside town a few weeks ago. They've been labelled an eyesore, or unhygienic, but the informal economy doesn't generate tax receipts for the government, and with money short, people aren't spending in the shops. "It's rugged my friend. The economy… it's not going anywhere, it's stagnant," says a taxi tout in an American football shirt. "I'm a qualified accountant, but there's no jobs, you can't find employment anywhere, so I don't know what to do." In his speech to the nation, President Mugabe admitted: "We are still grappling with the task of transforming our economies," but he tried to reassure people things were on the up. There were certainly plenty of tourists at Victoria Falls and the Hwange National Park last week, and Zimbabwe still sits on precious metals and diamonds, but foreign investment is the key and confidence is low. The economic ideas of Emmerson Mnangagwa and his close ally, Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, are already impressing Western institutions and those too nervous to invest while the old man prevails. His ambitions for open democracy may not be as advanced, but the right-hand man may be someone the international community can do business with. But President Mugabe, leaning on his lectern as he delivers his speech, is a difficult man to read. After all these years, it's hard to see him settling on a successor and handing over power, unless he's thinking about his family and the political exposure they could face if he died in office. The opposition takes the purge of Joice Mujuru and the internal split in Zanu-PF as a sign of some hope, but it may have had the opposite effect and made a cleaner succession much easier. They are arguably even more divided and unprepared to challenge for power, after losing unfair elections and then failing to gain from a unity government. The cult of personality wins votes in Zimbabwe, which explains why Morgan Tsvangirai still leads the Movement for Democratic Change and holds hopes of one day being president. After 15 years of trying, he's still passionate in his words at least. "We are not waiting for him to die," he said. "We have always done what we believe every struggle should do - you mobilise the people, you re-energise the base. "You continue giving people the hope that a democratic alternative is a possibility." But the strength of those on the podium, alongside the huge golden statue of liberation heroes, still hold the future of this country in their hands.	The huge golden statue of three liberation soldiers - two men and a woman - form the centrepiece of Heroes' Acre, the monument to Zimbabwe's fallen.
The 43-year-old scored over 24,000 runs during 12 seasons at Hove, and helping them win three County Championship titles and four limited-overs trophies. "I am grateful for the opportunity to come back to my second home," he said. "I believe I can bring to a very talented squad some belief and options on playing certain situations in all formats. I'm hoping to try and add a winning culture." Sussex have reshuffled their coaching set-up following relegation from Division One last season and cricket manager Mark Robinson's appointment as head coach of England Women. Mark Davis was appointed head coach in November, with Keith Greenfield named director of cricket and Carl Hopkinson now academy director. Davis said he was "thrilled" to see former Zimbabwe international Goodwin, who left Sussex at the end of 2012 to join Glamorgan, back at Hove. "I am confident Murray's relentless approach to batting and his technical expertise will be of great value," Davis added. "He has a brilliant work ethic and a passion for teaching the game, which is a vital ingredient in any elite coach."	Sussex have appointed ex-player Murray Goodwin as their new batting coach.
"This is definitely not the Oscars," said 22 Jump Street star Jillian Bell on the red carpet in Los Angeles. As well as fan-voted awards like best kiss and best shirtless performance (Efron won it - again) the ceremony was also an unofficial promotional platform for this summer's blockbusters. The night's big winner was The Fault in Our Stars, which won best movie. The film's star Shailene Woodley also picked up best female performance, the Trailblazer Award and best kiss for a scene with Ansel Elgort. Woodley gave an emotional speech dedicated to John Green, the author of the book which the film is based on, saying "he gave this world a beautiful masterpiece". Other winners included Bradley Cooper, who won best male performance for his role as the late Chris Kyle in American Sniper. The 40-year-old actor said: "Chris Kyle would have turned 41 four days ago. Chris, this is for you," said Cooper. Channing Tatum took home best comedic performance for 22 Jump Street and Meryl Streep picked up best villain for her role in Into the Woods. Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lawrence, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne were also among the winners. Kevin Hart, who was the target of many size-related jokes throughout the night, brought his kids on stage to accept the comedic genius award. He said: "I do it all for them. I'm trying to leave a legacy behind." In one of the more energetic moments of the show, Robert Downey Jr brought his fellow Avengers stars to their knees while accepting the Generation Award. Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all took the stage to present their co-star with the award, which Downey called "the recognition I so desire". Clips from the upcoming Pitch Perfect sequel, Judd Apatow's latest comedy Trainwreck and Marvel's new film Ultron were shown during a look ahead to this summer's releases.

More than 1,400 works were found in his Munich apartment, including pieces by Picasso and Matisse. Many were feared lost or destroyed before tax investigators uncovered his priceless collection in 2012. Cornelius Gurlitt was the son of Adolf Hitler's art dealer. Hildebrand Gurlitt was ordered to deal in works that had been seized from Jews, or which the Nazis considered "degenerate" and had removed from German museums. Mr Gurlitt, whose death followed ill-health after heart surgery, told Der Spiegel magazine last November that he would never willingly give up the paintings. "I haven't loved anything more than my pictures in my life," he said. But he changed his position, agreeing to co-operate with the German authorities on establishing the paintings' provenance, and returning them if they were shown to be stolen. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised him for that, saying: "He will be rightly recognised and respected for taking this step." Mr Gurlitt died "in his apartment in Schwabing, in the presence of a doctor," spokesman Stephan Holzinger said in a statement. Mr Gurlitt did not live an extravagant life but would sell a painting only when he needed money. By Stephen EvansBBC Berlin correspondent The big question after the death of Cornelius Gurlitt is what becomes of the paintings he possessed in secret. Many of the works would be welcomed with open arms by the curators of any of the world's top galleries. He, through his lawyers, had agreed that any works shown to have been looted by the Nazis would be returned to their rightful present-day owners, but this might well be only a small fraction of the total, perhaps 50 works altogether out of some 1,400. The rest will now be the subject of a morass of litigation. Mr Gurlitt never married and he had no known family. One question may be if there are distant relatives, who would now stake a claim. Many people, particularly Jewish groups, may feel a just solution would be for the works to be displayed in a gallery. Lawyers might have something to say about that. What is just, and what is legally applicable, may be two different things. His collection only came to light after a routine check found he was carrying wads of cash on a train from Switzerland, triggering a tax inquiry. Investigators found more than 1,400 works in his flat in Munich in February 2012 - though they only revealed the discovery in late 2013 - and a further 60 in his house near Salzburg, Austria, earlier this year. Among them were works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Marc Chagall, Emil Nolde and Max Liebermann. The collection is estimated to be worth up to a billion euros (Â£850m; $1.35bn). Under German law, Cornelius Gurlitt was not compelled to return any paintings to their owners, as he was protected by a statute of limitations, which negates any claim for incidents that happened more than 30 years ago. Even if it was proved the works were looted by the Nazis, Mr Gurlitt could have kept them, the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz says. But his death will certainly have ramifications for the case. Mr Gurlitt's secretive nature means little is known of his private life or any possible heirs. And the Bavarian authorities' slow, bureaucratic response to the discovery thus far would suggest that a rapid resolution of outstanding claims is unlikely, our editor adds.	German art hoarder Cornelius Gurlitt has died aged 81, with no definitive answer on what will happen to his secret collection, which included many Nazi-looted pieces.
The 35-year-old, who played six Super League games for Hull KR in 2011 before moving to French rugby union side Toulon, was at Manly last season. He played 290 NRL games during his 15-year career spent with five clubs, including Canterbury, where he won the 2004 Premiership. "Willie knows the job a prop has to do," coach Laurent Frayssinous said. "He is a physical and aggressive player, both in attack and in defence and we have spoken a lot about the quality of our group and he is really excited to join the club." Frayssinous' Dragons side have lost their first two games in Super League this season, with defeats by Wigan and Hull FC. Veteran front-rower Mason scored seven tries and played 24 tests for the Kangaroos, including the famous Great Britain 2006 Tri-Series defeat in Sydney where he struck Stuart Fielden and was involved in a scuffle with tourists captain Jamie Peacock. He also played 13 games for the Blues in State of Origin, scoring once.	Catalans Dragons have signed former Australia and New South Wales prop Willie Mason on a one-year deal.
Police were alerted to the stabbing in Harehills Lane, Harehills, at about 15:40 GMT. The wounded teenager was taken to hospital for treatment, but died a short time later. A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of murder, West Yorkshire Police said. He remains in custody for questioning. Det Supt Pat Twiggs, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "This tragic incident happened in a busy area at a busy time of day with large numbers of people going about their daily business. "I am appealing directly to anyone who witnessed the incident or has information that could help our inquiries to come forward." The force is hoping to speak to anyone who saw a person running in the area or those who have mobile phone footage. The scene remains cordoned off, with police forensic examinations expected to continue over the weekend.	A 16-year-old boy has died after he was stabbed in a busy Leeds street, prompting a murder inquiry.
At the time Mr Tilli was working as an estate agent, but with the Portuguese housing market in free fall, he was earning next to nothing. And with Portugal's government needing a 78bn euro ($103bn; Â£62bn) international bailout, in exchange for putting in place a number of austerity measures, the wider Portuguese economy was mired in its worst recession for more than 40 years. With the jobs market having ground to a halt, and four children to look after, Magda and Miguel Tilli decided they had no option but to take a chance on starting their own company. Ms Tilli, 37, recalls: "We were at the beach, brainstorming about what we could do." Tapping into Mr Tilli's knowledge of the property market, they recognised that they could turn a problem - no one was buying homes anymore - into a business opportunity. And so, they decided to launch an estate agent business specialising in renting houses in Lisbon city centre. While such a focus on rental properties may be common in other countries, the great majority of Portuguese estate agents only deal with selling homes. This is because in Portugal owning your own house or apartment has always been such a matter of pride that it is the first choice of most people, even young adults. Yet suddenly the great majority of young people couldn't hope to get a mortgage. Instead, a growing number living in Lisbon started to turn to the Tillis' new property rental business - Home Lovers. To keep start-up costs down, the couple initially listed their available properties only on Facebook. Yet to build up a decent reputation, they hired professionals to take all the photos, and only accepted properties of a high standard. Ms Tilli says they picked the kind of places that appeal to young, urban professionals, such as trendy apartments. Soon they had a steady stream of customers, both people wishing to rent a property, and landlords wanting to list with them. "It became a cool thing to rent a house through us," says Ms Tilli, who previously worked as a flight attendant for TAP, the main Portuguese airline. Home Lovers has now expanded to Porto and Cascais, two other Portuguese cities, and has a team of 20 workers. It is now considering going to Madrid. Ms Tilli says: "I'm a bit scared with that, but I don't see us being able to do this in any more places here in Portugal." To understand why entrepreneurship, or setting up a business, is now so popular in Portugal, you only need a quick reminder of how bad unemployment remains in the country, even though it came out of recession in 2013. The Portuguese jobless rate rose from 7.6% in 2008 to 14.1% in June of this year. The situation is even worse for young adults, with one out of every three people aged 15 to 24 years old out of work, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Professor Paulo Soares de Pinho, who teaches at Nova School of Business and Economics in Lisbon, and runs his own investment fund, says that one of the biggest changes brought by Portugal's economic crisis was "to transform many unemployed people into wannabe entrepreneurs". Yet he cautions that while many technology-minded young people are coming up with products, not all of them are able to turn them into a viable business. "We're going through an app entrepreneurship wave. Any kid coming out of an engineering school develops an app and thinks he has a company," he says. "But there are many tech projects with no market orientation whatsoever." Carlos Silva, co-founder of the crowd funding website Seedrs, agrees that in Portugal "may start-ups are going ahead just because entrepreneurship is now a trend". Yet, he adds that there are "more and more start-ups of excellent quality." To help boost entrepreneurship, the Portuguese government has created an investment body called Portugal Ventures to invest 20m euros of public funds a year into start-up firms. Start-up incubators have also sprung up, to give new businesses an office or desk to help them get on their feet during their first months. Magda and Miguel Tilli, used one such incubator - Start-up Lisboa - during the launch of their firm. Anthony Douglas is another entrepreneur who has used Start-up Lisboa to get his business off the ground. The 33-year-old is the founder of Hole19, a golfing app, which has mapped out thousands of golf courses around the world, and allows golfers to track and store statistics about their own performances. Initially it was a paid app, and the business struggled. Mr Douglas, who has a Portuguese mother and American father, says: "We've been almost dead a few times, with zero euros in the bank. "In some months I stopped paying my own salary and had to ask relatives for money." Yet Mr Douglas has since been able to transform the business's fortunes by giving the app away for free. The aim is now to make money by enabling Hole19's users to book golf courses via the app, in exchange for paying a fee each time. Mr Douglas says Hole19 was downloaded 220,000 times in the first 90 days after going free. And recently he raised 900,000 euros from foreign investors. Joao Romao, 25, is another young Portuguese entrepreneur who has managed to turn around his business fortunes. His first start-up venture, based around the idea of a shareable gift list connected to online shops, quickly failed. Undeterred, he is now developing a business called GetSocial, which aims to help companies promote their content on social networks, and measure its impact. Recently he secured 630,000 euros of investment. Mr Romao says: "The first try was a good lesson learned. It taught me how to build a start-up. Everybody's learning."	When Portugal was hit by an economic crisis in 2011, Magda Tilli and her husband Miguel realised that if they wanted to make a decent living they would have to set up their own business.
He remains the world's richest person, despite giving away 64 million shares in Microsoft. The shares are equivalent to 5% of his total fortune, currently estimated to be $89.9bn. Since 1994 Mr Gates, 61, and his wife Melinda have given away a total of $35bn in cash and stocks to a range of charitable causes. The donation was made in June but became public on Monday following the filing of a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Gates' share in Microsoft is now just 1.3%. Prior to this, Mr Gates gave away $16bn in Microsoft shares in 1999 and $5.1bn in 2000. The majority of all previous donations have been made to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is primarily focused on reducing world poverty, combating infectious diseases and providing universal access to computers. It is not known who the recipient of this latest donation is, however when federal documents are filed, it usually means new money is being given to a foundation, the Chronicle of Philanthropy reports. In 2010, Mr and Mrs Gates and the well-known investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett created the Giving Pledge, and as of May 2017, 158 individuals or couples have agreed to contribute at least half of their wealth to charity. This latest donation is the biggest charitable gift to have been made anywhere in the world so far this year. The second largest was made by Mr Buffett, who donated almost $3.2bn to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last month. And the third biggest came from Dell Computer Corporation founder Michael Dell and his wife Susan. In May the couple gave more than $1bn to their foundation, which focuses on children's issues and community initiatives.	Bill Gates has given away $4.6bn (Â£3.6bn) to charity in his largest donation since 2000.
Many tenants and social landlords also want to see an end to the policy, according to a consultation. The Scottish government has already ended right to buy for new tenants, amid concern over a shortage of rented affordable homes. Right to buy has also been suspended by a number of local authorities. Ministers are currently considering proposals to protect and increase the supply of affordable housing. The government's consultation on the issue got 169 responses in total from registered social landlords, tenant and resident groups, councils, charities and others. Of the 161 respondents which answered the question on ending right to buy altogether, 83% said the policy - introduced in the early 80s - should go. In all, 92% of social landlords, 81% of councils and 80% of tenant and resident groups which responses said right to buy should be scrapped. The policy was introduced by the Thatcher government to make owning a home more affordable and, since its introduction, more than 500,000 homes have been sold in Scotland. But in recent years councils have been forced to suspend the policy, as their stock of social housing to rent has dwindled. The Scottish government's 2010 Housing Act brought in several changes, including ending right to buy for new council and social housing tenants, alongside a three-year £1.5bn house-building plan. Ministers said stopping all new tenants from buying their homes could see up to 18,000 properties retained over 10 years. The Scottish government said it would respond to the consultation in due course.	A majority of Scottish councils want the right to buy for council and social housing tenants scrapped, a government report has said.
The 27-year-old pleaded not guilty at Durham Crown Court to three counts of sexual activity with a child under 16 and another of grooming. The winger, who has played 12 times for England, was arrested in March. Johnson, from Castle Eden, County Durham, was released on conditional bail ahead of his trial on 24 August. The three counts of sexual activity relate to a single night in January at two locations in County Durham, while the grooming offence was said to have happened between December and February. Born in Sunderland, Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.	England and Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson has appeared in court to deny charges of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.
Hebridean Sea Salt will have its product stocked in Sainbury's 360 UK stores. The Â£180,000 deal is the Lewis-based company's first with a major supermarket. Hebridean Sea Salt makes its product by slowly evaporating water from Loch Erisort and then harvesting salt by hand. Managing director Natalie Crayton said she hoped the deal would allow the business to grow and increase production.	A Scottish sea salt business on the Western Isles has signed a deal to supply a supermarket chain.
The Charles Dickens Museum in London has been given the grant to buy the desk and chair, which has always been in private ownership. They had been passed down through the Dickens family after his death in 1870, but were auctioned for the Great Ormond Street Charitable Trust in 2004. Dickens used the desk in his final home in Gad's Hill Place in Kent. Our Mutual Friend and his unfinished novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood were also penned at the desk. The furniture would have been sold at public auction if it was not for the grant from the  National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF). Made famous in two paintings begun the year he died, the Empty Chair by Luke Fildes and Dickens' Dream by RW Buss, the desk and chair are already on display at the Charles Dickens Museum at the author's former home. Robert Moye, director of the Charles Dickens Museum, said: "We are delighted to have been able to acquire Charles Dickens' iconic writing desk and chair for permanent display in his study at 48 Doughty Street. "They hold a unique place in our literary heritage and, as we embark on our exhibition exploring The Mystery of Edwin Drood, it is timely that the desk he used when writing his final novel has been secured for the benefit of all our visitors."	The desk where Charles Dickens wrote Great Expectations is finally on public display thanks to a £780,000 grant.
The Commonwealth super-lightweight champion defends his title against South Africa's Warren Joubert at Meadowbank on 24 March. And the 26-year-old plans to then have one more fight before meeting Burns. "I feel that if I fought Ricky next week I'd win," said Taylor. "I have confidence in my ability but I want to gather experience and develop." Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Taylor remains unbeaten as a professional, having outclassed Alfonso Olvera in Las Vegas in January. "I feel as if I need a little bit more experience at the level I'm at just now, get more rounds under my belt and be involved in a few good, testing fights before I get that chance to have a world title fight," Taylor told BBC Scotland. "It's just a matter of being patient and developing as an athlete. I'd fight against any super-lightweight in the world but I don't want to rush, I want to develop and gain more experience so when that chance comes I'm ready for it. "I don't want to jump into fighting for world titles when I don't feel as if I've had enough experience. The rate I'm going at now is perfect." And while he says when the time comes he will happily fight WBA super-lightweight champion Burns anywhere, Taylor does have an ideal venue in mind. "It would sell out anywhere but the dream would be Edinburgh Castle," added Taylor. Taylor, who has been sparring with a host of top names including former welterweight world champion Shawn Porter, is keeping his sights firmly set on Joubert for now and is expecting a difficult night. "Training hasn't really stopped since Vegas so I've never been out the gym," he added. "I'm already in good shape and ready to go. "I just know about Joubert's record. He's had 35 fights, only four defeats and has avenged one of them. "From what I have seen he's a come-forward fighter, he's aggressive, so it's looking like it's going to be another step up in class and another good fight for me."	Josh Taylor wants a Scottish super-fight against Ricky Burns at Edinburgh Castle - but not quite yet.
The adult female's remains - including a head and hands found in a bag - were discovered in eight locations, Irish police have confirmed. They are investigating whether the death is linked to a personal dispute. More than 200 gardaÃ­ (police), Irish soldiers and civil defence personnel are continuing to search the area. The man arrested remains in police custody in Bray, 20km (12 miles) south of Dublin, where he can be questioned for up to 24 hours. He presented himself to GardaÃ­ in County Wexford on Tuesday night and was subsequently arrested, Irish broadcaster RTE reported. The focus of the murder investigation changed following a series of developments on Tuesday evening. The results of DNA tests from the partial torso discovered by two walkers in the undergrowth, close to Military Road, on Saturday night showed the body was that of a woman. More human remains, including a head and hands, were discovered over a 30km-area on Tuesday. Police said they had now recovered most of the remains, and that there is only one victim. Supt Pat Ward, described the unprecedented case as "troubling". "We are conscious of the fact that the body found is that of a loved one," he said. "What we have found are limbs, we've also found some significant parts of the torso and we've also found in one of the locations, in a bag, the head and the hands of the deceased," he added.	A 32-year-old man is being questioned in connection with the murder of a woman whose body was cut up and dispersed in the Wicklow Mountains.
Sabah Saleem, 11, and three-year-old Rayhan were hit by a car driven by 37-year-old Mohammed Khalil Anwar on Brudenell Road in August 2012. Leeds Crown Court heard that Anwar, of Brudenell Mount, failed to stop as he feared being attacked by local people. Anwar is due to be sentenced on 29 November. Sabah and Rayhan, who were 10 and two at the time of the incident, were knocked down by Anwar's Vauxhall Astra car on 18 August last year. They were returning from a greengrocer's shop with food for the family's Eid celebrations which were due to take place the following day. Both underwent surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. While Rayhan was discharged from hospital a few days later, Sabah remained in hospital for about six months and surgeons operated on her several times. The court was told she had been left with "significant and permanent" disabilities as a result of the crash. During his trial, Anwar told the court he was in control of his car at the time of the collision, but he had no time to react when Sabah and Rayhan ran out in front of him. The court heard Anwar was driving at nearly 35 mph along Brudenell Road when he collided with the two children, about 15 mph faster than the speed limit. Anwar admitted he did not know the speed limit was 20 mph along that stretch of road, even though he had regularly driven along there over the past 12 years. He told the court he drove off after hitting the children as he was afraid he would be attacked. Following the verdict, Sabah said she still could not remember anything about the accident. While she still found it "very difficult" to walk, she was now feeling "okay", she said. Sabah's father, Saleem Rafique, said his "very brave" daughter was still recovering. The 11-year-old continues to suffer from double vision, balance problems and memory loss, he said. "She was a really bright kid, doing really well at school and very determined to succeed. "Unfortunately, this happened and that has put her back. "She's tough, she's a real fighter but we don't know whether she will be the same as she was before. It's very hard to tell."	A driver has been convicted of a hit-and-run crash in Leeds which left a girl permanently disabled and her brother seriously injured.
The suspected bomber was reportedly blown out of the plane in the incident shortly after take-off from Mogadishu. More than 20 people have been arrested in connection with the incident, a government spokesman told BBC Somali. Most of the passengers, including the alleged bomber, were said to have been originally booked on Turkish Airlines. No group has said it carried out the bombing but al-Shabab, part of al-Qaeda, is based in Somalia. Africa Live: BBC news updates Most of the 74 passengers on board the flight to Djibouti were transferred from Turkish Airlines, according to Mohamed Ibrahim Yasin Olad, head of Daallo Airlines, which operated the Airbus 321 that was bombed. "We were informed about the change a few hours before departure time," he told the BBC. Mr Olad said he was told the Turkish Airlines flight was cancelled because of bad weather. Local media had reported that Turkish Airlines had suspended its flights from Mogadishu in December following a failed al-Shabab attack on the airport. Turkish Airlines spokesman Yahya Ustun told Reuters news agency the carrier had cancelled a flight to Mogadishu last week due to atmospheric conditions and said the company would not make any further comment. In the video, a man in an orange hi-visibility vest is shown walking with a man in a blue shirt holding what looks like a laptop. Another man in a hat approaches them and it is alleged that the laptop is handed over. Aviation expert David Learmont, however, is sceptical that the video is all that conclusive. "I don't think that anybody knows for sure if this is the transaction that was behind the bombing," he told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. The explosion on the Daallo Airlines flight happened about 15 minutes after take-off, when the plane was only at around 11,000ft (3,350m) and the cabin was not yet pressurised. It was able to make an emergency landing at Mogadishu airport. Serbian captain Vlatko Vodopivec said at the time he and others were told the explosion was caused by a bomb. Daallo Airlines flies regularly from its base in Dubai to Somalia and Djibouti. Somalia is battling militant Islamist group al-Shabab that has been carrying out deadly attacks in its quest to establish an Islamic state.	Somali authorities have released a video showing a passenger being given a laptop they say contained a bomb that blew a hole in a passenger plane.
The man, in his 20s, was the only person in the BMW convertible when the accident happened on the A323 Aldershot Road in Guildford. He was travelling east when his car left the road near the junction with Holly Lane at 23:00 BST on Monday. Police closed the road between Frog Grove Lane and Holly Lane while investigators were at the scene. Officers have appealed for witnesses.	A driver died when his sports car hit a tree on a main road in Surrey.
Alice Pyne, 17, of Ulverston, died of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2013 after publishing her wish list. Haley McTaggart, 33, admitted getting her charity Alice's Escapes to pay Â£2,000 for her to go on a trek to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. McTaggart admitted fraud and was jailed for 10 months suspended for two years. The court also heard how McTaggart sold raffle tickets for a false raffle and never handed over the money. She also told the charity that she was unable to transfer money after the trip to Tanzania. Sentencing McTaggart, Recorder John Corless said she had committed an "unpleasant and serious" offence. Alice's Escapes was founded in 2012 by Miss Payne who 16 at the time. The teenager wanted to provide holidays in Cumbria for seriously ill children and their families. The top item on her bucket list was the hope that everyone in the UK would sign up as a bone marrow donor, an aspiration which Prime Minister David Cameron praised in the House of Commons. It is estimated that about 40,000 people signed up as donors as a direct result of her appeal. Miss Pyne and her sister Milly raised more than Â£100,000.	A Whitehaven woman who defrauded a charity set up by a teenager dying of cancer who became well-known for her "bucket list" has been sentenced.
The 300-acre site, which was abandoned by UK Coal 20 years ago, will undergo remedial work before paths are built in May. Conservationists had argued the site should be left undisturbed as it was a breeding ground for rare birds. Gedling Borough Council leader John Clarke said it was too dangerous to be left alone. He said: "It's actually a dangerous site; there are bits of metal sticking out [of the ground] and holes that are not covered. "A lot of people have said just leave it, but you can't leave a site like this. Sooner or later there will be an accident." The authority has also given the go-ahead for a solar farm to be located at the former spoil tip in the middle of the park. Mark Glover, chairman of the Gedling Conservation Trust, had said building a solar farm in the middle of a country park would be an eyesore. However, Mr Clarke said the facility was small compared with the rest of the site and the energy generated would contribute to the running of the new park from the autumn.	Work has begun to transform the former Gedling Colliery site into a £1.1m country park.
Andronicos Sideras, 55, is accused of mixing horsemeat with beef before selling it on through his company Dinos & Sons. Two men who ran FlexiFoods - a meat suppliers linked to Dinos & Sons - have admitted passing horsemeat off as beef. Mr Sideras denies one count of conspiracy to defraud. The discovery of horsemeat in processed beef products sold by a number of UK supermarket chains in 2013 resulted in a series of product recalls. The plot to pass horsemeat off as beef only came to light after horse identification chips were found in the meat by inspectors. Ulrik Nielsen, 58, the owner of FlexiFoods, and his "right-hand man", Alex Beech, 44, have already admitted their involvement in the conspiracy. Mr Sideras, of Southgate, north London, told the court in that in 2012 he agreed to store horsemeat for FlexiFoods. He admits he relabelled the shipment because the packaging had been damaged during transit, but denies purchasing, selling or using the horsemeat. The trial continues.	A businessman has denied being part of a conspiracy to pass off horsemeat as beef, claiming he was only storing the product for another company.
New analysis for BBC News shows that many people relying on their savings income are worse off than ever before. Savings rates plummeted after the Bank of England slashed its base rate in the financial crisis. Since last autumn, as the economic outlook has worsened, they have fallen again. Tax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds and easy access accounts are all at or near their lowest points. In research carried out for the BBC, the rate-checking firm Savings Champion recorded 1,440 savings rate cuts last year and more than 230 so far this year. While low interest rates are welcomed by mortgage borrowers, they strike fear into those at or near retirement who had hoped that income from their nest eggs would help pay the bills. "There's no light at the end of the tunnel," says 76-year-old Mick Bridge, one of a group of ramblers from Chesterfield who all depend on savings. "Like most retired people, there was a plan and suddenly it's not like it was anymore. The pot's disappearing." Fellow walker Sharon Beresford is worried that low interest rates will leave more older people needing help to pay for care. "It's helping young people buy houses, but it's not helping me," she says, "There are a lot of us to be looked after." The fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from National Savings & Investments, Bank of Scotland, NatWest and Nationwide Building Society. The average return from the five best easy access accounts has dropped from more than 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%. Tax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. The average variable rate Isa is down to 1%, while a typical fixed-rate Isa pays 1.4%. Another Chesterfield rambler, 63-year-old Judith Knowles, started dipping into her savings when she discovered she would have to wait for her state pension because women's pension ages were being raised. Low savings rates have forced her to dip in again. "It's worrying," she says. "I've had letters saying the rates are going down even more." Some rates of return are so tiny that savers can improve their situation by switching to a better offer. First Direct pays just 0.05% to customers in its Savings Account, while Santander has an Easy Isa with an interest rate of a mere 0.1%. Anna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, traces the problem back to a decision by the previous Coalition government to supply banks with cheap money to boost their lending. "The competition between providers has been sucked out of the market," she explains, "They just don't need to raise money from savers any more, which has had a devastating impact." A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: "These have been frustrating times for savers. The Bank of England's base rate has remained at a record low for several years. "While this has been good news for borrowers, it has fostered a low-interest-rate environment which has not been easy for many savers to bear." The looming EU referendum has confused the outlook for savers, with George Osborne warning borrowers that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates and others speculating that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again. Behind the scenes, senior bankers warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the "new normal", given the precarious economic situation across the world.	Interest rates for savers have fallen to new record lows, after hundreds of cuts in recent months and more than 1,000 in the past year.
School crossing patrol personnel numbers have dropped by about 75 since 2013, leading to fears about safety. Overall, councils spent £810,000 less on the service than three years ago. Stirling Council has reduced its outlay by the highest percentage, spending 50% less than in 2013. West Dunbartonshire cut its spending on patrol services by 40%. The figures were obtained from Freedom of Information requests answered by 30 of Scotland's 32 local authorities. It showed there are now just over 2,100 school patrol officers in Scotland. Despite the widespread reductions, some local authorities actually increased their spend - including Inverclyde, where it went up by more than 90% and Dumfries and Galloway, where it increased by nearly 10%. A spokesman for Stirling Council, which had the biggest cut to school patrol services, said the decision was made three years ago following substantial cuts to its overall budget. He added: "The majority of these savings were made by removing lunch-time crossing patrols and removing any patrols which duplicated existing crossing safety measures (i.e. pelican and zebra crossings nearby). The safety of our pupils is of the utmost importance and we strive to maintain key crossing patrol services where these are required." West Dunbartonshire said that patroller sites had been reduced due to a variety of factors including the relocation of schools, lack of use of sites and alternative facilities nearby. A spokesman for the council said: "Over the last three years a number of our school crossing patrollers have retired or moved on to other roles. "On review, some of the sites have no longer met the criteria for a crossing patroller and in other cases we have installed a pedestrian crossing. "Increasing numbers of pupils remaining in school over lunchtime has also meant that there is no longer demand for cover during these times." The Scottish Parent Teacher Council emphasised the importance of school patrollers for pupil safety. Eileen Prior from the organisation said: "Parents want to make sure that when they say goodbye to their child in the morning they can be confident they are going to be able to get to school safely. "The reality on the ground is that services and supports for education services are being cut at local authority level. Lollipop people provide an important service that parents really value." Figures also show that over the period between 2013-16, the number of children killed on the roads fell, although the number seriously injured increased slightly. The highest numbers of children were injured while walking during school drop-off and pick-up times. In 2013 there were five children killed while on foot and 92 seriously injured - compared to three children killed last year and 97 seriously injured. However, according to Sustrans - which promotes safe walking and cycling networks across the UK - the number of children walking to school has fallen dramatically. In its 2015 policy studies institute report, it cited figures from 1971, which showed 86% of children travelled home from school alone. That compared with figures from 2010 that showed only 25% walked to school. In Scotland child pedestrians are two-and-a-half times more likely than adults to be injured in road traffic accidents. Although accident rates are falling, more child and adult pedestrians are injured in road traffic accidents in deprived areas compared with more affluent areas. Over the past decade, in deprived areas, three times as many child pedestrians were injured than in less deprived areas. A spokesman for Cosla, the umbrella group that represents many of Scotland's councils, said the issue of cuts to school crossing patrollers was related to the overall drop in council funding from the Scottish government. He said: "People all over Scotland are becoming more and more aware of the impact of cuts to council budgets. "Each council will do everything in their power to restrict the impact of budget cuts on families and communities, but the nature of our work means that these cuts impact on everyone eventually. "We continue to advocate for a fair settlement for local government in Scotland and look forward to negotiations with Scottish government on this matter." A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "Spending on school patrollers is a matter for individual councils but the Scottish government has treated local government very fairly despite the cuts to the Scottish budget from the UK government. "Taking into account the addition of the £250m to support the integration of health and social care, the overall reduction in 2016-17 funding equates to less than 1% of local government's total estimated expenditure in 2016-17."	Two-thirds of Scotland's councils have cut the amount of money spent on lollipop men and women in the past three years, research by BBC Scotland has found.
The officer was attacked after stopping a Peugeot van in Westmorland Avenue, Cleveleys on 2 November last year, Lancashire Constabulary said. He suffered injuries to his torso and face. William Ashton, 39, of Briarwood Drive, Blackpool, is due to appear before Blackpool Magistrates' Court. He has also been charged with two counts of possession of an offensive weapon and affray. The injured officer, 47, from the Immediate Response Team based in Fleetwood, has "recovered physically" and is expected to return to work soon, police said.	A man has been charged with attempted murder after a police officer was slashed with a knife during a routine vehicle check.
Rangers say the defender slipped over during the squad get-together the day after Saturday's 2-0 win over Burnley. The Sun claimed Caulker was injured after a fight broke out at a pub that Crystal Palace players were also at. But QPR's head of communications Ian Taylor insisted: "Steven Caulker was not involved in an altercation." Taylor added: "He suffered a cut to his head, which he received treatment for at hospital before being discharged the same evening." Taylor also explained that players had been given permission to have Sunday lunch together given QPR's next game against Everton was not until Monday, 15 December. QPR owner Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to comment on the claims. "Steven Caulker slipped over and hurt his head and is fine," wrote Fernandes. "Nothing else to report." Former Tottenham and Cardiff centre-back Caulker, who has one England cap, has made 15 appearances this season, scoring once.	QPR have denied Steven Caulker was involved in an altercation and say he was taken to hospital after cutting his head during a lunch with team-mates.
Bedene, 26, battled past Spain's Carreno Busta, ranked 23 places higher at 43rd in the world, in five sets, winning 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 4-6 5-7 6-2. It was an impressive show of resolve from the Slovenia-born player, who surrendered a two-set advantage. However, he recovered his poise, ending the match with 23 aces. Compatriot Andy Murray reached the third round with victory over Mathias Bourgue on Wednesday. "The last few months haven't been the best and I have been struggling but I'm really proud of what I have achieved so far," said Bedene. "It meant a lot to win. "I have only played one fifth set before - in Wimbledon last year, and I won it - and it wasn't easy after being two love up but it shows I am fit enough and I am really proud." Hindered by a thigh injury, Busta struggled to cover the court in the final stages, but Bedene's performance was full of grit and determination as he showed he could mix it with a European clay-court specialist. Djokovic is yet to drop a set at the tournament after easing aside Belgium's Steve Darcis 7-5 6-3 6-4 to advance. Bedene lost his only previous meeting with the Serb, succumbing in straight sets at the 2015 Australian Open. However, the Welwyn Garden City-based right-hander has risen from world number 116 to 66th in the world since then. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller "This was an excellent victory by Bedene because he was up against a fine clay-court player and because he admits his confidence is fragile after winning only two main-draw matches in five tournaments before Roland Garros. "His 23 aces were the bedrock of victory, along with his ability to draw Busta away from his comfort zone behind the baseline by using the drop shot."

Members were unable to reach a compromise after eight hours of talks. The committee had considered plans - backed by deputy Leader Tom Watson - to reinstate elections to the shadow cabinet. Since 2011, the party leader has selected his own top team. Mr Watson said the proposal could help Labour "put the band back together" for a possible early election. A proposal  to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday's leadership election result was voted down, by 16 votes to 15. Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against it, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party's conference in Liverpool. Mr Watson said afterwards that it was a "very positive meeting". He added: "We agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things I'm sure the media will be really interested in." Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should he be re-elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour's top table. Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections. The Labour leader has said there is a "thirst for democracy" in the party and he backs a "widening of the franchise". Mr Watson also called for Labour's leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one-off fee to vote. He described their participation as "unpopular" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs. In last year's contest, 84% of the 105,598 registered supporters who paid Â£3 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn. This time around, they were asked to pay Â£25 to take part. Despite the increased fee, 129,000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one-off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and his challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday. Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience. Critics have said it allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far-left groups with their own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters. Mr Watson, who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been "rushed" and "unpopular". He suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and his predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party. "We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that and we want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process," he said. Mr Watson said he did not want the changes to be seen as a threat to Mr Corbyn and suggested they would only apply after he stood down, whenever that may be. But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move would be seen as an attempt to make it much harder for a left winger like Mr Corbyn to be elected. Arriving at the NEC meeting in central London earlier, veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner accused the media of "trying to get rid of" Mr Corbyn.	Labour has failed to agree on how to form its shadow cabinet at a meeting of its national executive committee.
The site at Knottingley, West Yorkshire is to burn fuel from refuse, industrial and commercial waste including wood, said operator Multifuel Energy Ltd. The Â£300m plant is to create hundreds of jobs over a three-year build and should produce electricity for about 160,000 homes, it said. The adjoining coal-fired Ferrybridge 'C' plant is to close in March 2016, it was announced in May. The Secretary of State has granted development consent for the new plant. Construction is expected to begin in 2016 with about 35 permanent jobs once it is operational. The power station is expected to produce up to 90MWe of electricity annually by burning 675,000 tonnes of waste that could have ended up in landfill, said Multifuel Energy It is to be built next to the newly-constructed Ferrybridge Multifuel 1 that stated operations earlier this year. Multifuel Energy is a joint venture between power company SSE and and waste management company Wheelabrator Technologies.	A second multifuel power station has been approved for Ferrybridge.
More than 20 competitors are due to take part in Saturday's event in Carrbridge in the Cairngorms. Carvers from Scotland, England, Ireland as well as continental Europe, Canada and the US regularly enter the competition. They can use only chainsaws - any other carving tool is banned - to carve logs into the shapes of animals and people. Last year's winner Pete Bowsher, from Moffat, is to return to defend the title, and retain the first place winner's prize the Claymore Trophy.	About 3,000 people are expected to attend the 14th annual Carve Carrbridge chainsaw carving competition.
Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a relationship, used their positions within Greater Manchester Police to access restricted material. A court heard they targeted Hussell's ex-boyfriend, who lost his job after he was wrongfully arrested. Fendall was jailed for 19 months and Hussell was sentenced to 16 months. The pair provided false information to the charity Crimestoppers, naming Hussell's former boyfriend as being responsible for a fail-to-stop collision in which another PCSO was injured. Brett Gerrity, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: "Thomas Fendall and Jessica Hussell, who were in a personal relationship, abused their positions within the police to access restricted material on the police computer system for their own use and to settle a personal grievance. "Fendall used the police computer system to research background information on people he and Hussell knew, and shared information and documents with others. "They provided Crimestoppers with bogus information leading to an innocent man being investigated by the police for attempted murder." He continued: "They also supplied the DVLA with fictitious intelligence, which led to the same man having his driving licence revoked. "He had to prove he was medically fit to drive before his licence could be reinstated two months later." Sergeant Lee Westhead, of GMP's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "The actions of Fendall and Hussell undermine everything that is at the heart of policing in this country." Hussell, 19, from Glossop, and Fendall, 26, from Denton, each pleaded guilty to misconduct in a public office. They also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice in relation to providing false information to Crimestoppers. Fendall had pleaded guilty to another count of misconduct in a public office and four counts of computer misuse relating to the GMP intelligence system. The pair were arrested in August 2015 after an investigation by GMP's Serious Collision investigation Unit. They were suspended from GMP upon arrest.	Two police community support officers have been jailed for using force computers to try to frame an innocent man for attempted murder.
The 25-year-old, who is 6ft 9ins tall, joined the Minstermen from Tranmere Rovers on a two-year deal in May, but has only made five appearances. Mooney's first stint in professional football in England was at Wycombe and he spent time at Conference North side Oxford City before joining Tranmere. He is available for Alfreton's game against Welling United on Saturday.	Alfreton Town have signed goalkeeper Jason Mooney on loan from League Two side York for the rest of the season.
In September the 20-year-old opted to play for England over the Republic of Ireland and has been awaiting clearance from Fifa. Grealish played for the Republic at under-21s level but turned down a call-up to the senior squad for a friendly against England in June. Birmingham-born Grealish qualifies for the Republic through his grandparents. After an impressive first full year for Villa, Grealish has struggled this season, making only 17 appearances and scoring once. He has been struggling with an ankle problem and has not featured since coming on as a substitute against Manchester City in the FA Cup on 30 January.	Fifa has given Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish permission to play for England.
On Saturday, the British Medical Association (BMA) announced it would be asking members in England about whether they wanted to take action. The dispute is over a new contract due to be introduced in August 2016. Critics say it could mean 15% pay cuts with "normal hours" re-classed as being from 7am to 10pm, Monday to Saturday. It means extra payments for unsociable working will only be given outside of these times, rather than the current arrangements of 7am to 7pm, Monday to Friday. News of the health secretary's intervention came on the day that a few thousand junior doctors held a protest in central London. The day's developments did not stop a few thousand junior doctors, some in hospital scrubs, gathering to protest at Westminster. They chanted "BMA, BMA" with the new chair of the association's junior doctors committee Dr Johann Malawana describing the gathering as probably unprecedented. Later they marched with their placards up Whitehall and for a time blocked the pavement and road outside the Department of Health. There is no doubt feelings are running high over the government's planned reforms to junior doctors' contracts. Much now rests on the planned meeting between Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Dr Malawana. The government has described the current contracts as "outdated" and "unfair", pointing out they were introduced in the 1990s. Ministers drew up plans to change the contract in 2012 but talks broke down last year. The government has indicated it will impose the new contract next year in England, prompting the BMA to ask its 53,000 junior doctor members about industrial action. But Mr Hunt has now offered the BMA junior doctors' leaders the opportunity to meet this week to see if they can find a solution to the dispute - the BMA has agreed to attend. Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision. Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which negotiates contracts on behalf of the government, said he hoped the meeting would bring the two sides closer. "Our preferred position has always been to negotiate with the BMA." Dr Johann Malawana, BMA junior doctor committee chairman, said his organisation "has been clear about what it needs to hear from the government and NHS Employers to bring us back to the negotiating table". "We will be continuing with our action unless the government themselves can give us the absolute assurances we seek on behalf of the doctors we represent."	Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has offered to meet junior doctors' leaders after the decision to ballot medics on industrial action over a new contract.
BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as "a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of these High Street players. Mr Mahiroglu's family owns a music store chain in Turkey and, crucially, factories across Turkey, Romania and Vietnam, which supply about 80% of Select's clothing merchandise. Names that had been mentioned included Poundstretcher boss Aziz Tayub and Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, although Mr Ashley's proposal was reportedly rejected for being too low. One factor that has complicated matters is that BHS has been selling off much of its stock in a discount sale, reducing the value of its assets and making it more expensive for any new owner to replenish the items. If no deal can be struck, Duff & Phelps have already lined up three firms to act as liquidators. Alteri, Hilco and Gordon Brothers would then break up the business and sell it off piecemeal. The 164-store chain includes about 40 loss-making shops. Freed from the need to take them all, many other bidders might be prepared to cherry-pick parts of the once-prosperous empire.	The fate of ailing department store BHS is likely to be decided later on Thursday, with an announcement expected from administrators Duff & Phelps.
Ministry of Defence figures show there are currently 81,700 full-time servicemen and women in the Army, down from 102,260 in 2010. More reservists are being recruited but that process has been slow. Former commander Richard Kemp said it showed the plan was "incoherent" but the MoD said the Army had the "manpower we need at the moment". Col Kemp, a commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told the BBC News website: "To have already made the cuts by 2015, it shows confusion and targets that don't match up... it doesn't mean it's a good thing. "The whole plan was to cover the gaps with reservists, but if you've not achieved that then it must mean that we have got deficiencies. "Not only does that cause us concern about how we govern our people, but it is also the message we are sending to our enemies. That kind of message always shows aggression towards us." Plans to increase the number of Army reservists from 19,000 to 30,000 by 2019 have been controversial. As of April 2015, the number of trained reservists was at 21,030 - an increase of just over 1,000 since April 2012. Former chief of the defence staff General Lord Richards has referred to the plan as "a brave experiment", while John Gearson, professor of national security studies at Kings College, London said: "I think it is accepted that the recruitment programme has underperformed. "With the absence of a major conflict maybe they will come through... It is a calculated risk." According to recent statistics from the MoD, the trained strength of the UK's armed forces is at 143,200, down from 176,600 in 2010. Cuts began after the government's strategic defence and security review called for a restructure - dubbed Army 2020 - to help reduce the UK budget deficit. The Army has cut more than 20,000 jobs well ahead of the 2018 target. The other services have also already exceeded their targets for job cuts, with the RAF losing 8,500 personnel and the Royal Navy cutting more than 5,500 posts since 2010. An MoD spokesman said: "This government is committed to an army of 82,000 and the funding is in place to deliver it. "We have the manpower we need at the moment and, working with the army, we are taking clear action to keep driving recruitment upwards." Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said the shortfall in Army reservist recruitment was a "real concern". "The figures need to be looked at again within the context of Strategic Defence and Security review in the autumn. If there is shortage of capability, clearly it needs to be addressed," he said. Former Defence Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: "If they have achieved what they set out to do then that must be satisfactory. "The government had to have a strategy to deal with the economic situation. It was always going to be challenging to increase reserves at the same time. "Will it be achieved? I think the jury is still out on that." Prof Keith Hartley, defence economist from the University of York, said he believed the government targets for the Army had been realistic post the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. "It is perfectly sensible, but we must also realise that we have a lower defence capability," he said. "We can't fight in as many wars and conflicts. We must look at the alternatives like the use of air power to replace boots on the ground as well as technology like drones." In 2014, MPs on the defence select committee warned there were shortages of specialist personnel in the Army and Royal Navy that were leaving the military "vulnerable". A lack of nurses, intelligence operators and qualified engineers were among those highlighted. In response, ministers said restructuring had led to "temporary shortages" in some areas but frontline operations were being protected. Earlier this month, Chancellor George Osborne ended months of speculation when he announced the government was committed to spending 2% of national income on defence for the whole of the next decade. But Prof Malcolm Chalmers, from the defence think tank RUSI, said retaining military personnel would be tougher in the future. "Historically, military pay has risen in line with trends in the private sector, but that's not been happening since 2010 and the decision to limit pay rises to 1% each year means that this falling behind in pay levels is going to continue," he said. "The problem of the future will be less that of redundancy as whether the armed forces can recruit and retain the best people." Sir Nick Harvey, former Liberal Democrat Armed Forces minister agreed. "David Cameron has said in bold terms the Army would not go below 82,000 during his term... But I do think it will be much harder to recruit in the future. Now the economy is picking up, opportunities may be much better outside the forces. "The fact the Army may not be doing as many interesting things may also have an impact."	British army personnel has been cut back by more than 20,000 - three years ahead of target, the BBC has learned.
Twenty hostages, most of them foreign, were killed when Islamist militants stormed a cafe in the capital, Dhaka. Two police officers also died and 30 were injured. After a 12-hour siege, commandos rescued 13 people. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group said it was behind the attack but the government has denied this. Bangladesh's home minister said on Sunday that the attackers belonged to a local militant group which has been banned for more than a decade. "They are members of the Jamaeytul Mujahdeen Bangladesh (JMB)," Asaduzzaman Khan said. "They have no connections with the Islamic State." Mr Khan said the men made no demands during the attack. He said three of the gunmen were under 22 and had been missing for six months. Police chief Shahidul Hoque made some of the men's first names public: Akash, Bikash, Don, Bandhon and Ripon. Bangladesh at crossroads as violence hits Is extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Six attackers were killed in the raid on the Holey Artisan cafe in the Gulshan neighbourhood. A seventh man was arrested and is still being questioned. It is not yet clear what involvement he had in the attack. IS had earlier released photographs of the alleged attackers posing in front of a black IS flag. The men were said to belong to well-to-do local families. They studied in private schools and universities, not in Islamic seminaries or madrassas, where many Islamist militant groups are thought to draw recruits. Social media has been buzzing with former classmates who have recognised some of the attackers from their pictures, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Dhaka. Bangladesh has declared two days of national mourning. Nine Italians, seven Japanese, one US citizen and an Indian were among the dead. One Italian is unaccounted for. The JMB group has been blamed for a wave of small-scale terrorism attacks in Bangladesh over the past year, including the killings of secular bloggers, atheists and an LGBT rights campaigner. Its top two leaders were arrested and executed in 2008, after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in all the country's 64 districts. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has consistently denied that IS has made inroads in to Bangladesh. Nine Italians named by the Italian foreign ministry as: Cristian Rossi; Marco Tondat; Nadia Benedetti; Adele Puglisi; Simona Monti; Claudia Maria D'Antona; Vincenzo D'Allestro; Maria Rivoli and Claudio Cappelli Seven Japanese Five men and two women, four of whose names have been released by Japanese officials: Koyo Ogasawara, Makoto Okamura, Yuko Sakai and Rui Shimodaira Four Bangladeshis Two were named in national media as Faraaz Ayaaz Hossai, a student at Emory University in the US, and Ishrat Akhond - the other two were policemen US citizen Abinta Kabir, also a student at Emory University One Indian Tarishi Jain, 18, who was a student at the University of California, Berkeley More about the victims	Bangladeshi officials have named five of the men who on Friday carried out the country's worst terrorism attack and said they were known to police.
The 22-year-old played for Yeovil in the 2012-13 season and briefly last term, but has been studying at Rider University for the past four years. "I'm incredibly excited to be back playing for my hometown club who I have supported my whole life," she said. "To have the opportunity to play for them in the top division is amazing." Howard graduated two weeks ago with a major in history and a minor in French.	Women's Super League One side Yeovil Town Ladies have re-signed goalkeeper Beth Howard after she graduated from university in the United States.
Operators such as Uber and GrabTaxi will now have to register with the country's Land Transport Authority. Under the regulations, fees charged by the booking apps cannot exceed those of regular taxi companies. The new measures will be enforced from the second quarter of next year, the government office said on Friday. "To ensure that taxi services remain equally accessible to all members of the public, bidding and pre-trip tipping for taxi services will not be allowed," the LTA added in a statement. Wealthy city-state Singapore is among the most expensive places in the world to own a car, with many commuters relying on taxis to get around. The popularity of taxi booking services has surged in the city of nearly 5.4 million people, especially during peak business hours. Uber has expanded rapidly in Singapore offering services such as high-end UberExec and cheaper UberX cars, along with a service to book regular taxis. The company said the new rules would not affect its extra services, because it already has partnerships with licensed limousine and rental car companies. "We appreciate that the LTA has acknowledged the benefits our technology brings, and like Uber, is putting the interest and safety of consumers and drivers first," said Uber's regional general manager of Southeast Asia, Mike Brown, in a statement to Reuters. The San Francisco-based company has faced protests around the world by taxi drivers who are against its services, which allow people to become unlicensed taxi drivers by using their own cars.	Singapore plans to regulate third-party taxi booking apps such as Uber by capping fees and limiting them to use only licensed vehicles and drivers.
Thermal cameras detected higher temperatures in three adjacent stones at the bottom of the Great Pyramid. Officials said possible causes included the existence of empty areas inside the pyramid, internal air currents, or the use of different building materials. It comes as experts search for hidden chambers within the pyramids. The tombs of the pharaohs Khufu (Kheops), Khafre (Khephren) and Menkaure (Mycerinus) were built in the Fourth Dynasty, about 2613-2494BC. A team of architects and scientists from Egypt, France, Canada and Japan used infrared thermography to survey the pyramids during sunrise, as the sun heats the limestone structures from the outside, as well as at sunset when they cool down. In a statement, the Egyptian antiquities ministry said the experts had "concluded the existence of several thermal anomalies that were observed on all monuments during the heating-up or the cooling-down phases". "To explain such anomalies, a lot of hypotheses and possibilities could be drawn up: presence of voids behind the surface, internal air currents," it added. An "particularly impressive" anomaly was found at ground level on the eastern side of the Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu, the statement said. "The first row of the pyramid's stones are all uniform, then we come here and find that there's a difference in the formation," Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati said as he showed reporters the three stones showing higher temperatures. Other thermal anomalies were detected in the upper half of the Great Pyramid. The structure will be the subject of further investigation during the Operation Scan Pyramids project, which began on 25 October and is expected to last until the end of 2016.	An international team of architects and scientists have observed "thermal anomalies" in the pyramids of Giza, Egyptian antiquities officials say.
The 25-year-old man reportedly calls himself Harald Hitler. The man, sporting a side parting and a trademark moustache, had been seen having his photograph taken outside the house in Braunau am Inn in which Adolf Hitler was born. The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. "The young man knows exactly what he is doing," the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists. But as the Nazis began to lose control in 1944, it was shut.	A Hitler lookalike has been arrested in Austria on charges of glorifying the Nazi era, local officials say.
Simi's plight was described as a "bureaucratic log jam" by MP Andrew Turner at Prime Minister's Questions in September. The eight-year-old female had been in Belgium awaiting transportation after being seized in Germany on welfare grounds. A spokeswoman for the zoo said she would have a "lifelong home" there. The animal was seized two years ago and held in isolation at an animal welfare centre in Belgium. The zoo carried out negotiations with the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for a rabies waiver to allow the animal to be imported into the UK. A spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Agency had said quarantine waivers were "strictly controlled and only issued if certain criteria can be met by the premises of origin and destination". Watch Simi's journey on Inside Out on 25 January at 19:30 on BBC One in the South or on BBC iPlayer.	A former circus tiger which waited two years to be imported to the Isle of Wight Zoo has arrived on the island.
La Gommeuse achieved the top price of $67.5m (£45m) at Sotheby's, as part of their Impressionist & Modern Art sale on Thursday. And Van Gogh's atmospheric landscape, Paysage sous un ciel mouvemente, sold for $54m (£36m), helping to take the evening's total to $306.7m (£203m). Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it "a small sale that packed a real punch". He added: "Each season Picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two Blue Period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper." La Gommeuse, described as most the important blue period Picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901. The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into English as 'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs. It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work. The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Manach was apparently intended as a gift for the Catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris. The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers. At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by Asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons. The $306.7m (£202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (£182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (£244.5m). This total brings Sotheby's sales of Impressionist & Modern Art in just the past 24 hours to $575.8m (£381m), Earlier this year, Picasso's Women of Algiers became the most expensive painting to sell at auction, going for $160m (£102.6m) at Christie's in New York.	A new record for a blue period Picasso has been set at auction in New York.
The £155,000 Bike2Go project was the first of its kind in Scotland and it was hoped it could go into other areas. However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is not including the scheme in a planned regional rollout of initiatives to reduce car journeys. Since its launch in September 2010 the bikes have been hired 2,270 times - a daily average of about two rentals. The scheme was set up to encourage people to get "out of their cars and onto their bicycles". It provides bikes free of charge to subscribers at 11 locations across the town. It is based on similar schemes in Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm and one in London which clocked up one million journeys in its first 10 weeks. The Dumfries project has struggled to increase rental levels since it started. After 10 weeks they averaged about 20-a-week, with winter weather being blamed for the low uptake. The council promised a marketing campaign to encourage increased use of the bikes. A poor summer was again blamed for low uptake in 2012. Plans were then proposed to make the bikes available to all council staff when on business in Dumfries. However, some councillors questioned the value of the scheme which has 171 members on latest figures. One suggested it would have been cheaper to buy them all a bicycle and said the project was "in danger of becoming an embarrassment".	The cost of a bike hire scheme in Dumfries works out at more than £60 per rental, new figures show.
Duminda Silva was found guilty with four others of shooting dead Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and three of his supporters during local elections in Colombo in 2011. The two men were both members of the then governing party. The defendants are likely to serve long jail terms because of Sri Lanka's moratorium on executions. Their lawyers said they would appeal against the sentences. Silva sustained gunshot wounds and was flown out of the country, apparently for treatment, after the shooting. He was a close ally of the powerful Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, whose brother Mahinda was president until losing elections in 2015. Many hailed the verdict as proof that judicial independence had been restored in Sri Lanka. "This verdict was only possible because we have a new president," Hirunika Premachandra, the murdered man's daughter who is now an MP herself, told reporters. "I hope there will be justice for all the murders that happened during the previous era, including the killing of former editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, disappeared journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda and rugby player Wasim Thajudeen, so their families can get justice."	A Sri Lankan court has sentenced a former MP to death for the murder of a rival politician five years ago.
The 32-year-old former Charlton, Fulham, Chelsea and Bristol Academy player has been with Yeovil since 2015. She netted seven goals in her first term for the Lady Glovers and a further seven in 2016 as Yeovil won WSL 2. "I am so happy to be given another opportunity with Yeovil to play in WSL 1," Heatherson told the club website.	Yeovil Town Ladies forward Annie Heatherson has signed a new contract with the Women's Super League One club ahead of the 2017 WSL 1 Spring Series.
All but one Welsh council had resettled refugees from the UK government's Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme by the end of last December. Councils had been criticised for the speed that they were housing people. Oxfam Cymru welcomed the figures, with Conwy and Denbighshire the latest authorities to become involved. The charity's Matthew Hemsley said: "Wales has a proud history of welcoming those in need and it is important to see that tradition being continued." The majority of the refugees in Wales were taken in the second half of 2016 - 285. A total of 5,454 people have been resettled in the UK. The figures from the Home Office come after the Welsh Local Government Association said Syrian refugees were expected to have been housed in all council areas across Wales by the end of 2016. In August 2016, it was reported that only nine of Wales 22 councils had taken part up to the end of June. The statistics said that one authority - Pembrokeshire - was yet to house refugees from the programme at least by the period covered by the figures, which run from October 2015 to December 2016. However the council says it plans to resettle a family in the county by the beginning of April.	The number of Syrian refugees resettled in Wales has reached at least 397, according to figures from the Home Office.

Under anti-tax avoidance rules, if someone's tax arrangements are found to be "abusive" they must pay back the tax they have avoided. But shadow chancellor Ed Balls pledged a "genuine deterrent" by making them liable to pay the same amount again. A Tory spokesman said it was "feeble stuff" and Labour had no economic plan. Tax avoidance, unlike tax evasion, is not illegal. Ministers have said it involves "compliance with the letter but not the spirit of the law". In recent years it emerged that companies and individuals had been greatly reducing their liabilities by making use of legal tax shelter schemes. Meanwhile the "tax gap" - the difference between the amount of tax owed and collected - rose to Â£34bn in the year to April 2013. The government's so-called general anti-abuse rule (GAAR) came into force in July 2013, after Chancellor George Osborne described aggressive tax avoidance - as well as illegal tax evasion - as "morally repugnant". It aimed to "deter taxpayers from entering into abusive arrangements, and to deter would-be promoters from promoting such arrangements". The rule is a broad set of principles designed to prevent tax avoidance, to avoid having constantly to introduce new legislation to tackle individual loopholes. Labour has previously said it would increase transparency in the tax system and prevent dormant companies from trading without paying tax. It has pledged to use some of the money raised from a tax avoidance crackdown for its Â£2.5bn NHS funding pledge. Mr Balls said Labour had supported the introduction of the anti-abuse rule, but said it was "without teeth". He said: "Those who are caught have to repay the tax they tried to avoid, but they do not face a penalty. There is still no disincentive to try and game the system. That is why Labour will bring in a tough penalty regime... with fines of up to 100% of the value of the tax which was avoided. "For the first time this will provide a tough and genuine deterrent to those who try to abuse the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax." The shadow chancellor said aggressive tax avoiders should be treated the same as people who cheat the welfare system. He added: "Through measures such as this we can ensure that no-one pays zero tax at the top so we can get the deficit down fairly, invest in our NHS, and maintain public support for the dynamic open economy we need." The proposals were backed by leading chartered accountant and tax-reform campaigner Richard Murphy, who was a member of the panel which helped draw up the anti-abuse rules. "Without such a regime, the GAAR is a toothless tiger providing, at best, Revenue and Customs with the chance to ask those found in default to play by the rules in future," Mr Murphy, who is an adviser to the Trades Union Congress and the Unite union - Labour's largest financial backer - said. "With significant penalties attached, the GAAR becomes a more potent threat and, regrettably, in the face of ongoing tax abuse, Revenue and Customs needs as many of those as it can get." However, a Conservative spokesman said Labour leader Ed Miliband had been at the heart of former prime minister Gordon Brown's Treasury as "year after year" they broke promises to deal with tax avoidance. "If Ed thinks empty promises like this will get him into Downing Street, it's no wonder his own party are lining up to criticise his weak and ineffective leadership," the spokesman added.	Labour has said it plans to double the fines that can be levied on people who aggressively avoid tax, if it wins the next general election.
Two hundred and sixty people have already been convicted. The officer in charge of Operation Titan, Det Supt Sean Wright, appealed for anyone taking part in planned protests later this month to do so lawfully and peacefully. Operation Titan was set-up to investigate public order-related incidents since 12 July. Police released the figures at a press conference at PSNI headquarters in Belfast on Monday. ACC Will Kerr said 2013 had been a challenging year for policing. He said the last four years had seen a severe dissident republican threat, however recently there had been an upsurge in activity. In relation to the loyalist paramilitary group, the UVF, ACC Kerr said that elements of the group, particularly in east Belfast, had been involved in a range of criminal activity, however the issue of respecification was a political decision.	Police have said 560 people have been charged or reported in connection with flag protests in Northern Ireland.
Coventry University's Scarborough campus has been built on the town's former Weaponness Park and Ride site. About 200 students have begun courses at the site, though it is expected to eventually be home to more than 2,000 students. The building, which includes engineering and science labs, a mock law court and a library, is part of a £50m sports and education facility. Professor Craig Gaskell said: "Launching our new state-of-the-art building is a huge milestone for us and demonstrates our commitment to Scarborough and the Yorkshire coast area." A new University Technical College has been built nearby and Scarborough Athletic FC's new 2,000-seater stadium is also under construction on the site. Coventry University also has a campus near London's Liverpool Street Station and recently announced it will open a campus in Dagenham in September 2017.	A new £14m university campus has opened in Scarborough.
Just minutes after leaving harbour, the ferry capsized. 193 people were killed in the tragedy. Belfast man Bill McCrea was more than 1,500 miles away in Kent, when the ship began its final journey. A chaplain for the Sailors' Society, Bill was on duty at the Merchant Navy and National Sea Training College in Gravesend. Despite the distance, news of the tragedy travelled to the college fast. "Our centre had younger trainee sailors coming through, and also older seafarers who were there to update their training. "We had three men from the Herald at the centre that night who we had to try and comfort." When Bill speaks, it's with a soft, instantly recognisable Belfast accent - a voice apparently unchanged by decades spent posted across the globe. He grew up on the Donegall Road in the city and before entering the ministry, discovered an early love for the sea. "I used to go down to the Belfast docks with my brothers and sisters to see the ships," he said. "I would say to them, 'look, see that ship? Someday I'll be a captain too'". In the end, he took to the sea as a chaplain when he accepted the role with the Sailors' Society in 1969, a position he held until retirement in 2006. In that 37-year period, the Zeebrugge disaster would become "the most traumatising tragedy that ever happened in my life". The disaster marked the beginning of months of shared grief and years of recovery, as signified by the annual remembrance service that continues with this week's 30th anniversary memorial. After the incident, Bill travelled to Dover where he spent two weeks in the Sailors' Society's Seafarers' Centre, providing support to sailors and families alike. Bill often travelled to visit those grief stricken by what happened, and also conducted the funerals of four victims. "The disaster and the subsequent weeks was a shock to my system. I have dealt with loss of life with seafarers' families over the years, but it was the enormity of this situation - so many people lost their lives that night." One funeral the chaplain presided over was for a young man who he knew from the training centre - the Herald of Free Enterprise was his first posting as a sailor. "It was his first assignment and he didn't come back. I visited his family and they were devastated. "He had just finished his college course two weeks before. I knew him well." He continued: "The first month or so (after the disaster) was hard going. In their way, actually, the families were a big support to me. "It can be difficult because families always react differently to your presence. Some are happy to have you, some will swear, some will be annoyed, some will be anti-God. "In my case, most families needed help - not so much talking, just being there. "The tragedy left people on their knees. The area of Dover was devastated, but the community came together in huge support. "I think that's what helped my visits. I was able to pray with the families, and not one refused a prayer." Among the sadness and grief, there were unlikely tales of heroism too. "I visited the wife of a man who died, she felt very guilty on top of everything else. "She had talked her husband into the trip. When the boat capsized, they were trapped. It was actually incredibly hard to escape, particularly with a lifejacket, because you were trapped at the bottom of a boat that was on its side. "She was trapped there and hypothermia set in, but there was a lorry driver beside her. He kept her alive by slapping her face and nipping her, to make sure she didn't fall asleep. "It was a nightmare situation on board." He said that surviving crew members attended funerals as part of their "shared grief". A year on from the disaster, Bill led a memorial service at the request of the victims' families. This began an annual service that the Sailors' Society has continued every year since. "Each year we've held the service and families have come. About 10 years ago, the question was asked if the service should end but the families wanted it to continue. "They've never really got over it completely. "I've never really got over it myself."	On 6 March 1987, passenger ferry the Herald of Free Enterprise pulled out of its berth at the Belgium port of Zeebrugge carrying 459 passengers and 80 crew.
Previously, trainee doctors had to wait up to four years to experience the consultation room. GP Live was developed by Aberdeen University and uses streaming software to enter the consultation room. Researchers hope it will encourage more students to join general practice and help ease a recruitment crisis. The software will stream consultations just moments after they happen in an effort to give students a flavour of life as a GP. The system utilises one of the University's Digitally Enhanced Learning Spaces (DELS), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools. It was developed by Dr John McKeown, a senior clinical lecturer and GP at Cults Medical Group in Aberdeen. He said: "The biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. "We aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the GP's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action." Dr McKeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: "This means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing GPs who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. "The system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a GP. "This allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day." Dr McKeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new GPs in Scotland.	A new project has been developed to allow first-year medical student in Scotland to watch GP consultation for the first time.
Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge. Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected over charges relating to the footage sent to relatives. Mr Weatherhogg, 43, was jailed last May after being found guilty by a jury. It is understood he will now be released from prison. Sheriff George Way had remitted the case from Dundee Sheriff Court to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers. Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: "We are satisfied the concession is well made." Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration. Lady Dorrian said the appeal judges were also satisfied that misdirections given to jurors by Sheriff Way over the charges relating to the footage sent to relatives were "material and constituted a miscarriage of justice". Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet. He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted. The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.	A man jailed for six years for coercing a woman into having sex with a stranger and sending "revenge porn" to her family has had the convictions quashed.
Entries for all candidates in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are down 0.7% on last year to 5,240,796, according to official figures. By contrast, in England the overall entry for GCSEs in England increased slightly from 4,916,000 in 2015 to 4,929,000 this year. Early entries (for students in Year 10 or below) fell for the second year running in England to 300,000 - a 13% drop on 2015. This follows a 32% fall from 504,000 in 2014 to 344,000 in 2015 and reflects government moves to discourage schools from entering pupils early. But more older students were entered this year, reflecting the raising of the participation age in education to 17 in 2013 and then to 18 last year. The government is also encouraging older pupils to resit English and maths if they do not achieve good grades (A* to C) in Year 11 This year there were 355,000 GCSE entries for post-Year 11 students, up 26% on last year's figure of 282,000. By subject, Ofqual noted 2016 increases for Year 11 students in English literature, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, history, science, additional science Spanish and computing. But entries fell in English and English language, German and French. In England this year's GCSEs will be the last to be marked under the existing system, graded A* to G. Last September new "more demanding" courses were introduced in English and maths for the current Year 10 - but this change will not have any affect on this year's results as the new courses are linear and will be examined next summer at the end of two years. In England students who started GCSE courses last September in maths, English and English literature will be graded 1-9 in these subjects when they get their results in summer 2017. The new grades will come in for most other GCSEs the following year. These include biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, languages, religious education, geography, music and history, which will be taught from September 2016, with exams in 2018. A third wave of 1-9 graded GCSEs will be taught from September 2017 with exams in 2019. These include psychology, ancient history, business, information and communications technology (ICT) and media studies. Ofqual has also said that it expects broadly the same proportion of students who currently received a grade C and above under the current system to achieve a grade 4 and above under the new system. The new courses will include far less coursework, with grades in almost all subjects depending on exams. These courses are designed to be more rigorous with exams taken after two years of study rather than in modules with exams along the way. Foundation and higher-tier papers for students in different ability ranges will be phased out. A GCSE reform programme is also under way in Wales with new courses from the WJEC board taught in Welsh schools from last September in six key subjects. These are English language, Welsh language, English literature, Welsh literature, mathematics and numeracy and mathematics. The November 2017 and summer 2017 exams will reflect these new qualifications and the results will no longer be comparable with their equivalents in England, says the Welsh government. Northern Ireland is also developing new GCSE specifications for first teaching from September 2017 and will retain A*-G grades rather than adopt England's new numeric grading system. Some schools offer courses from English exam boards alongside those from the Northern Ireland board, CCEA. You may get your results by text, email or in the post, but it's still a good idea to go to your school or college on results day. By doing this, you can get help and advice from your teachers. If you live in England, yes. This summer's GCSE cohort in England (born between 1 September 1999 and 31 August 2000) is the second to have to stay in education or employment with training until 18. In Scotland, if you turn 16 between 1 March and 30 September, you can leave school after 31 May of that year. If you turn 16 between 1 October and the end of February, you can leave at the start of the Christmas holidays in that school year. In Wales, you can leave school on the last Friday in June, as long as you will be 16 by the end of that school year's summer holidays. In Northern Ireland, if you turn 16 during the school year (between 1 September and 1 July), you can leave school after 30 June. If you turn 16 between 2 July and 31 August, you cannot leave school until 30 June the following year. Try not to panic. If you don't get the grades asked for by the sixth-form or college of your choice, approach the staff there and see if they are prepared to be flexible. It's possible they will still give you a place or they might be prepared to take you on for different courses. Alternatively, approach other schools or colleges - you might find they will accept you. Resits will be complicated by the course changes, with the current set of GCSEs in English and maths being phased out. Ofqual has required the boards to offer resits in the current English, English and maths exams in November and next summer and in science subjects no later than summer 2018. For other current GCSE courses, boards will also be allowed to offer a single resit opportunity in the year following the last scheduled sitting. Students will have to resit all the exams for the qualification and there is an expectation that candidates will be at least 16. If you feel strongly that your grades are wrong and do not reflect your ability, you can ask for a re-mark of your papers. Requests for re-marking can only be done through your school or college. Make sure someone there is dealing with the matter. There is a fee for this service, which is reimbursed only if there is a grade change. The Joint Council for Qualifications has guidelines on the post-results service available to schools. You can call the national exam results helpline on 0808 100 8000 or the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900.	Pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are receiving their GCSE results - just over two weeks after teenagers in Scotland received the results of their equivalent National 4s and 5s.
A man, aged 28, and a woman, aged 35, have been arrested on suspicion of the possession of firearms over the incident at Chapel Street. The army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit was called to the scene and a cordon was put in place for a time. North Wales Police said it was "not a terrorist related incident".	A Wrexham street has reopened after police carrying out a search warrant found suspected firearms and "unstable" firework.
Violence erupted on the outskirts of Jerusalem's Old City and across the occupied West Bank after the end of Muslim Friday prayers. Two Palestinians were reported killed by troops - one an alleged assailant in the West Bank, the other in Gaza. Tension remains despite the end of a stand-off at the holy site. Palestinians returned to the hilltop site known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and Jews as the Temple Mount on Thursday after Islamic authorities lifted a two-week boycott called in protest at new Israeli security measures there. Israel removed all the security apparatus following intense pressure to defuse the crisis after days of deadly clashes. The measures, including metal detectors, security cameras and other infrastructure, were put in place after two Israeli policemen were shot dead by three Israeli Arabs who Israel said had smuggled their weapons into the site. Despite the moves, clashes broke out in and around the compound on Thursday night, leaving 136 Palestinians wounded, Palestinian medics said. There had been fears of further violence as worshippers gathered in East Jerusalem on Friday morning. Israeli police barred Palestinian men under the age of 50 from entering the Old City, site of the holy compound, limiting thousands of Palestinians to pray in the streets outside. The restriction is sometimes used during periods of tension to try to prevent violent protests inside the compound. While most of the crowds dispersed peacefully, brief clashes erupted in the Wadi Joz district, close to the Old City. By evening all restrictions were lifted and Palestinians of all ages were allowed into the mosque compound, Israeli and Palestinian sources said. Violence also broke out in the West Bank cities of Qalqilya, Nablus, Hebron, Tulkarm, Ramallah and the outskirts of Bethlehem. Troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets as hundreds of protesters threw rocks, local media said. Scores of Palestinians were injured, according to Palestinian medical sources. The Israeli military said troops shot dead a Palestinian armed with a knife as he ran towards soldiers at the Gush Etzion junction, a roundabout outside a Jewish settlement bloc, about six miles (10km) south of Bethlehem. However, the Palestinian Maan news agency quoted an unnamed eyewitness as saying the man was unarmed when he was shot from 20 metres (65ft) away. In Gaza, a 16-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops amid clashes near the border with Israel, the health ministry run by the enclave's Hamas rulers said. Since the crisis escalated following the killing of the two policemen on 14 July, at least five Palestinians have been killed in clashes and three Israeli civilians stabbed to death by a Palestinian. Differences over the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif go to the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the complex is a flashpoint for violence. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and the holiest place in Judaism. It is also the al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, according to Islamic tradition. Palestinians said Israel's new security measures upset the delicate status quo, which Israel has repeatedly pledged to maintain since occupying the area in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel said Palestinians were using the issue as a pretext to spread hostility against the Jewish state.	Israeli forces and Palestinians have clashed in East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and Gaza after weeks of friction over a Jerusalem holy site.
More than 130 owners have reported overheating problems behind the glove-box area, some of which have resulted in fires. Vauxhall is investigating the problem, but has not yet issued a full recall. The affected model is the Zafira B. It is thought that 280,000 of them are currently on the road in the UK. The alarm was raised by three different women, who say their cars burst into flames. Among them was Sue Freemantle, from Devon, who had four children in her Zafira when a fire began behind the dashboard. Claire Wheatley also from Devon, had to evacuate her car along with her husband when a similar incident occurred. They and others have posted pictures of the fires on Facebook. Vauxhall has already examined 20 such cars which have been burned out, and has summoned engineers from Germany to investigate. In a statement, it said it thought the heating and ventilation system was to blame. It said previous repairs may have been carried out improperly, or in some cases, non-genuine parts may have caused the fires. The affected models have manual air-conditioning, as pictured above. Owners who have electronic climate control have not reported any problems. The cars, all right-hand drive, were built between 2005 and 2014. Anyone who has concerns about their vehicle is being asked to contact their dealer.	Carmaker Vauxhall is trying to contact hundreds of thousands of British drivers, over worries their Zafira models could catch fire.
The main feature was a drop in bank shares. That came after the news that Deutsche Bank faces a $14bn penalty to settle an investigation by US regulators into the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. Shares in RBS fell by 4.4%, Barclays by 2.8% and Standard Chartered by 2.7%. Neil Wilson, from ETX Capital, said the Deutsche case could have serious implications for RBS which was "among a number of European institutions that could face similar claims from the US Department of Justice", he said. "RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. "Even a third of this figure could deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon," Mr Wilson added. Among the main risers in London were TUI, up nearly 4%; Shire, up 3.2%; and Burberry, up 3%. On the currency markets, the pound fell 1.2% against the dollar to $1.309 and dropped 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.1730.	(Close): London share prices fell back slightly, with the FTSE 100 index closing 20 points lower at 6,710, a fall of just 0.3%.
The 31-year-old Indomitable Lion has opted to join the 2016/17 Turkish top flight runners-up after reaching the end of his contract with city rivals Galatasaray. Chedjou, who has 50 international appearances for Cameroon and played at the 2010 and 2014 Fifa World Cups, moved to Turkey in 2013 from French club Lille. The centre-back made 119 appearances and scored 12 goals for Galatasaray during a four-year stint that saw him win the league title in 2015. He also won an unprecedented three straight Turkish FA Cup titles in 2014, 2015 and 2016 as well as three Turkish Super Cup in 2013, 2015 and 2016. Istanbul Basaksehir shocked Turkish football by finishing second behind Besiktas in the league and emerging runners-up in the Cup final last week. They will compete in the Uefa Champions League third qualifying round, whilst their more illustrious city rivals and Turkish football giants Fenerbahce and Galatasaray play in the second-tier Europa League.	Istanbul Basaksehir have announced the signing of Cameroon defender Aurelien Chedjou on a three-year deal.
The first minister is one of six UK representatives in Forbes magazine's annual list of the world's most powerful and influential women. A Scottish government spokesman said the list underlined the importance both of the first minister's office and the profile of Scotland as a nation. German Chancellor Angela Merkel topped the list for the sixth year running. Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton was placed second, with Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the US Federal Reserve, third. The Queen is 29th, while Ms Sturgeon is 50th overall. The rankings consider influence, media presence, wealth and success at implementing change. The other British women who made the list are Bank of England deputy governor Nemat Shafik at 59, Guardian editor Katharine Viner at 68, Economist editor Zanny Minton Beddoes at 78, and Eliza Manningham-Buller, chairwoman of the Wellcome Trust, at 88. German Chancellor Angela Merkel tops the list for the sixth year in a row - and the 11th time in total. As a central figure in German politics ever since reunification, Ms Merkel has led Germany since 2005 and is a leading force in the European Union. Choosing her for top spot, Forbes noted that "if there is a single leader able to defy existential economic and political challenges to the European Union, from edges and core, it has been Angela Merkel." Hillary Clinton looks set to go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the position of President of the United States in November. Mrs Clinton, who has had previous spells in the White House as first lady to husband Bill and as foreign secretary to current President Barack Obama, is bidding to become the first female President. She has also served as a senator for New York state, and was a leading lawyer, serving as the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation and the first female partner at Rose Law Firm. Janet Yellen is chair of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. Having previously chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisors under the Bill Clinton administration, Ms Yellen took over at the Fed in 2014, and managed the body through its first interest rate rise since June 2006. Forbes said she is known for "steadiness, not inscrutability", lauding her use of "plain sentences and easy logic" despite being "the world's top market-mover". Co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, alongside her former Microsoft head husband, Mrs Gates organised $4.2bn in charitable work and global development in 2015 alone. The foundation has given out $36.7bn in grant payments since it was founded in 2000, with Mrs Gates directing the organisation and in particular championing investments in women and girls around the globe. Forbes said her work had "inspired other big donors and changed the way funders think about effective philanthropy". Mary Barra was promoted from chief executive to president of General Motors in January, having guided the firm to record profits in 2015. Ms Barra has been credited with turning around the fortunes of the American car-making giant, which had to recall 30 million vehicles in 2014 due to faulty ignition switches blamed for at least 124 deaths, by fostering strong domestic sales alongside growth in China. Forbes said her latest promotion was "no surprise", with Ms Barra leading the company on a "noticeable comeback" - and earning herself a compensation package of $28.6m last year.	Nicola Sturgeon has been ranked as the second most powerful woman in the UK, behind only the Queen.
Margaret Gleeson, 70, died two days after a hernia operation at Wigan's Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in October 2015. Concluding an inquest into her death, Simon Jones ruled out neglect and said she died due to a rare complication. But he said he wanted to highlight concerns raised during the hearing. Mr Jones said he would write to both the hospital and the Department of Health about the issue of patient safety at weekends. However, Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust said it did not believe weekend staffing levels were to blame. "The trust does not believe that Mrs Gleeson's death was the result of any difference between the resources available and services provided at the weekend and those provided on weekdays," a spokesman said. "The trust already complies with national guidelines in relation to weekend working and is actively involved in an ongoing pilot scheme investigating the possible benefits which might be derived from seven day working." The trust said its own investigation had revealed shortcomings in "some aspects" of Mrs Gleeson's care, for which it offered its "sincere apologies". The inquest, sitting at Bolton Coroner's Court, heard medics believed Mrs Gleeson's operation had been a success, but it was later discovered that internal tissue had been torn during the procedure. Her condition then deteriorated. When questioned about weekend staffing during the hearing, the trust's Dr Sadasivam Loganathan agreed it was "a major concern". He said: "You don't give the same attention as the patient deserves." Mrs Gleeson's son, Peter Gleeson, said: "I think if she'd had the operation on a Monday or any other time in the week it would have possibly been a different outcome." Her daughter Julie Barnes added: "The surgeon himself said if she'd have been reviewed and it had been picked up on the Saturday, it would have been a totally different outcome." Stephen Jones, of Leigh Day solicitors, said the family were "disappointed" the coroner did not find neglect had been a factor. "Whether the different weekend working practice within the trust had any affect in Mrs Gleeson's case we don't really know," he said. "But what we can say is that sufficient concern was expressed by the clinicians at Wigan to cause patient concern."	A coroner has vowed to raise concerns about weekend staffing levels at a hospital where a grandmother died after a routine operation.
Esposito was Presley's professional assistant and a member of his inner circle, known as the "Memphis Mafia". He was one of two best men at the star's wedding to Priscilla in 1967 and a pallbearer at his funeral in 1977. Esposito's daughter Cindy Bahr said he had died of natural causes in California on 23 November after suffering from dementia. The pair met while serving in the Army in 1959. When they completed their service, Esposito became Presley's assistant, a role that saw him acting as road manager when Elvis was on tour. He was a member of the so-called Memphis Mafia with Red West and Marty Lacker, and appeared in some of Presley's films, including It Happened at the World's Fair. Esposito was one of those who found Presley's body when he died at Graceland, Memphis, and broke the news of his death to Priscilla and Presley's manager Tom Parker. He went on to work as a road manager for artists including Michael Jackson and The Bee Gees. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Negotiations over who will run the £200m Metrobus network have stalled as bus companies are reluctant to run the service on a completely commercial basis. Metrobus admits public subsidies might now have to be used to entice firms on board. The first of the new bus routes are due to be completed in the next few months. David Redgewell, from passenger group Bus Users UK, said the lack of a current operator was a worry. "We need to be realistic about what the bus industry can deliver in hard times," he said. "The buses have to make money, so there's really going to have to be realism amongst the public authorities that unless they are prepared to put public subsidy in then they [buses] need to be commercial." In March 2015, Bristol City Council was required to spend more than £1m removing protestors from Stapleton allotments, part of the new Metrobus route. Former secretary of Stapleton Allotments Association, Jane Ghosh, said she was "absolutely shocked but not the least bit surprised". "It's cost £200 million plus, it's a lot more than that because of the delays. They only have £34 million from the government, which is static and won't go up," she said. "We told them right at the beginning, this was never going to be a commercially viable project - but nobody listened to us." BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter Pete Simson Could Bristol really be left with a brand new public transport network, but no company willing to run it? The idea was always for Metrobus to be run without subsidies, using shiny new buses with clean fuel. Unfortunately, it would appear bus companies view this as simply too risky, after all, they want to make a profit. With huge swathes of Bristol's roads currently being dug up to build Metrobus, the need for a deal becomes ever more pressing. Time will tell if this is merely another teething problem, or a hugely costly mistake. Commuters are currently enduring roadworks associated with the scheme in the city centre, on the M32 and various other locations in South Gloucestershire. The scheme was devised by the West of England Partnership (WEP), an alliance between the four councils in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. It involves three routes: Ashton Vale to Temple Meads, Cribbs Causeway via Emersons Green to the city centre and the South Bristol link between the A370 Long Ashton bypass and Hengrove Park. It will provide an express bus service on 31 miles (50km) of segregated bus-ways and bus lanes. The WEP said Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset council were "actively negotiating" with bus operators and such discussions were commercially sensitive. A spokeswoman said: "We have always been clear that the aim is that the MetroBus services are run entirely on a commercial basis via a quality partnership scheme that sets minimum standards for frequencies, quality of vehicles and maximum fares, supported by a voluntary partnership agreement with one or more operator. "Of course should negotiations not be successful, we have a range of back up plans which could include formal contracts to run all or some services on a contracted basis. "This might require the use of public money following a competitive procurement process, but this would depend on the situation when negotiations conclude - which all parties agree should be in about three-four weeks' time." First Bus, Wessex and the Bath Bus Company RAPT were said to be in the running for the contract.	A "rapid transit" bus scheme due to be running in Bristol by 2017 still has no operator and may need public funds.
The man, 65, was walking in woods near the town of Buchen when he encountered the female African elephant, called Baby. The 34-year-old elephant was later captured and returned to the circus. Police are now investigating how the elephant got out of its enclosure and why it acted so aggressively. "There's evidence of third-party involvement," Heidelberg police spokeswoman Yvonne Schmierer told the AP news agency. "Either someone forgot to shut the enclosure, or the elephant was released intentionally." Local news agency Stimme reported that the elephant had previously injured at least two people - including a man who was thrown in the air and a 12-year-old boy who suffered a broken jaw when he was hit by its trunk. Stimme reported that the German branch of animal rights group Peta was urging the authorities to remove the elephant from the circus.	A man taking his regular morning stroll in south-west Germany was attacked and killed by an elephant which had escaped from a circus, police say.
The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence. It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries. Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote. A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum. Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997. There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline. In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period. Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central. However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist. At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people. The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other. Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online. But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting "a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates". With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas. The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland. Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed. "The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application," the report said. Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police. It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine. The "dispersed and unconnected" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting. It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections. Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so. But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters. "A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places," she said. "This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote."	Reports of people voting more than once in June's election are "troubling" but there is little evidence of widespread abuse, the elections watchdog has said.
The Miscarriage Association, which came up with the figure, wants people to open up about baby loss to break what it calls "the last taboo". One mother has gone a step further and filmed the aftermath of her miscarriage for a documentary, to challenge the secrecy surrounding it. Lisa Francesca Nand, from Greenwich, has suffered five miscarriages in total, including one the day before her 12-week scan. "One minute I was pregnant, we were planning the future and thinking about being a mummy and daddy. Then suddenly, in the space of a few hours, we were no longer going to be parents, it was heartbreaking," she says. The experience made her determined to share her story. One scene shows her husband David waiting outside the hospital while she has the remains of their second unborn child removed from her body. "They had sent me home to pass the sac. It took a week of walking around with a dead baby inside me for it to come out. And I bled for six weeks afterwards. No-one talks about the physical pain, so I didn't expect it. "I started filming a video diary because no-one talks about it. I want people to understand they are not alone, " adds Lisa, who has since gone on to have two healthy boys. So why are miscarriages still shrouded in mystery? Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, thinks it is because of the "rule" that women should not announce their pregnancy before their first scan. "Most miscarriages happen in the first three months. If you don't tell people you are pregnant then sadly you are not going to get the support that you need when you are grieving. It doesn't suit everyone to talk about their pregnancy before their scan, but it can help. "We don't tell people 'in case something happens', but that can reinforce the idea that you should keep it a secret if you miscarry," Ms Bender Atik said. The reason behind a miscarriage is often unclear - leaving women with no one to blame but themselves, she adds. "Most women never find out why, so they think it must be their fault, and this is very a dangerous path to go down." Family and friends might not know how to react, and can make things worse with insensitive comments, according to Ms Bender Atik. "We want people to say things like 'I am so sorry for your loss' and 'do you want to talk about it?', rather than 'don't worry, you will be pregnant again soon," she added. My own miscarriage happened earlier this year, at nine weeks in to my first pregnancy. I noticed some light bleeding and was sent to Colchester Hospital for a scan. My husband and I were overjoyed to catch the first glimpse of our tiny baby, with a strong heartbeat pulsing furiously away on the screen. Only a few friends and family members knew that I was pregnant, and we rushed round to show them the photos of our beautiful baby. But 24 hours later we were sat in the same chair, being told that our precious baby had gone. Sitting in the car park crying, we tried to make sense of what had happened. My husband told me through tears that all he had ever wanted was to be a father, and I felt like I had let him down. We had planned to tell his parents that evening over dinner, so we still made the trip up north and kept our restaurant reservation. We sat in shocked silence for most of the journey, playing songs that I have not been able to listen to since. Telling them we had miscarried felt even harder, because they had never known the joy of my pregnancy in the first place. In the following days, I began to blame myself. It must have been the heavy camera kit I had stupidly picked up at work. Or perhaps it was the rum I drank on an all-inclusive holiday before I knew I was pregnant. My husband was hugely supportive throughout, but I found myself pushing him away, telling him that he did not understand how it felt. I made him put the baby books and maternity clothes I had foolishly bought in the loft, because it was too painful to look at them. How naÃ¯ve I was to buy them, I berated myself, looking at the nursing chair in the corner that I knew I would not sit in. I talked about getting a tattoo because I felt like I had nothing to show for being pregnant, as if it had never really happened at all. One of my best friends told me she was pregnant and was due at the same time as I would have been, and I hated myself for not feeling happy for her. "I'm really lucky that I didn't need to have an operation, some people have much worse miscarriages," I kept telling friends and family, to make them feel better. But inside I felt like the unluckiest person in the world. I went straight back to work because my colleagues did not know, and on the first day I had to attend an inquest about a dead baby. But this is completely normal, I told myself. After all, no-one talks about miscarriage. Six months on, I have realised three things. Firstly that men can suffer as much as women after a miscarriage, and if anything, this experience has made our marriage stronger. Secondly and probably most importantly, that it was not my fault. And thirdly, that miscarriage is so much more common than I had realised. I slowly started telling people and was amazed by how many confided that they too had secretly suffered this fate. I posted a message on Facebook saying I was writing this article and friends I had known for years got in touch, having never before shared their stories of loss. One said she had a miscarriage at work but felt like she had to hide because she did not want to tell her boss. Not a day goes by without another of my friends thinking about her babies and what they would have become. One friend sent me a note to say she was going through her second miscarriage at this very moment. Another said she could not tell anyone because she felt ashamed, like she had failed at the one thing women should be able to do. No-one should feel like this after a miscarriage. If it feels right for you, try sharing your story - you might be surprised by the reaction. First Heartbeat was first shown on 15 October at 10pm on TLC UK - and will be repeated on 17 October at 9pm, 19 October at 9pm and 28 October at 10pm.

Anna Swabey, 25, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, was initially given three months to live in 2015 when she met Andy Bell, 26, on a dating app. The pair were due to marry on Saturday in the Yorkshire Dales, but Miss Swabey passed away earlier. She raised almost Â£80,000 for Brain Tumour Research and posted frank videos about her chemotherapy sessions. Her sister Victoria described Miss Swabey as "one of life's truly inspiring and incredible human beings." Charity spokeswoman Wendy Fulcher added that a "light had gone out." Months after her diagnosis Miss Swabey started a blog, Inside my Head, in which she openly chronicled her treatment. However, the latest blog post was from her sister Victoria, who described the moment doctors revealed the cancer had worsened and that surgeons had removed an "apple-sized" mass. "Anna's call was matter of fact and to the point. Her biopsy results showed that the tumour had now progressed to a Grade 4.  In all honesty, and in typical Anna style, she was more bothered about how we all felt than what it meant for her." Ms Fulcher described Miss Swabey as "bright, vivacious, kind, and beautiful." She added: "Anna was one of those to whom others are naturally drawn. "She had a great sense of fun and a marvellous joie de vivre. "Anna was just 23 when she was told she had a brain tumour. Understandably devastated and angry, she nevertheless held her head up high and decided she would live her life, however long it might be, to the full." In her last blog post on 8 July, Miss Swabey spoke of how unwell chemotherapy had left her, but how she had been lifted by her hen party in York. She said: "I'm getting pretty fed up of feeling poorly all the time now. But I don't think it was really helped because I had my hen party two weekends ago, which was amazing." Ms Fulcher said Miss Swabey was given hope by neurosurgeon Kevin O'Neill, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Imperial College. "She left her first consultation with him in "tears of happiness" not because he had changed her diagnosis but because they would fight "Trev", as she dubbed the growth in her brain, together," Ms Fulcher said. But after her condition worsened she and Mr Bell were forced to postpone their wedding. Ms Fulcher said brain cancer was particularly cruel because it killed more children and people under 40 than any other form of the disease, but received just 1% of national, research funding. Concluding her blog post Miss Swabey's sister said: "She [Anna] has faced her illness with positivity, dignity and absolute defiance, and we couldn't be more proud of our beautiful girl and the way she has touched so many people with her amazing attitude to life, love and the whole heap of crap she has had to contend with since the arrival of Trev!! "We have all taken our cue from Anna throughout her illness and we will continue to do so through the most heart-breaking and difficult time of our lives."	A woman who blogged about her battle with terminal brain cancer has died a day before she was due to get married.
Cardiff Bus said 90% of its 540 Unite union members backed the offer after a ballot took place. Drivers have staged a number of strikes in recent weeks, causing disruption on days the city hosted Rugby World Cup matches. The walkouts ranged from 24 to hour 48 hours but last Sunday's action was suspended due to the ballot.	Strike action by bus drivers in Cardiff has been called off after an improved pay offer was accepted.
The Office for National Statistics experts base their projections on current and future survival trends. And if their calculations are borne out, more than 95,000 of those who turn 65 this year can expect to celebrate their 100th birthday in 2047. The number of centenarians has been steadily increasing - from 600 in 1961 to nearly 13,000 in 2010. In 2012, the figure is expected to hit 14,500, and by 2035 will have breached the 100,000 mark. And more of these will be women than men. In 2012 there are 826,000 babies aged under one year. Although more are boys - 423,000 compared to 403,000 girls - the survival odds are greater for females. Women have higher life expectancies than men at every age. Of those born in 2012, 135,000 men and 156,000 women are expected to still be alive by age 100. The report -What are the Chances of Surviving to Age 100?- comes as ministers have pledged to double funding for dementia research in the UK. In the next decade, the number with the disease - mostly elderly - is expected to top one million.	A third of babies born in 2012 in the UK are expected to live to 100, according to a new report.
The game features cards with a series of quiz questions, but some of the answers given are incorrect. One answer claims the moon is 225 miles away from the earth - instead of about 238,900 miles. Manufacturers Paul Lamond Games said they "unreservedly apologise" and added replacement cards would be issued. It is understood at least six of the 50 answers in one round of the game - which costs Â£19.99 - are incorrect. One answer placed Stonehenge in Somerset instead of Wiltshire and a maths question suggested two cubed was bigger than three squared. It also said Albert Einstein died in 1949 instead of 1955 and gave the number of Coronation Street episodes to date as 8,000, when the actual figure is more than 9,000. One customer who bought the game told The Sun: "I couldn't believe it, the answers are so ridiculous... [but] the kids won't accept the game could possibly be wrong." A representative for Paul Lamond Games told the BBC: "We have been made aware of some mistakes with the answers to the questions within the first production run of this game." "These have now been corrected and we would like to unreservedly apologise for these errors. "Any affected customer can email us stating their name and full address and we will send out a replacement set of corrected cards free of charge." The company's email address is available on their official website.

Mark Mason, 48, from Rhyl, died after being stabbed at the town's Home Bargains car park on 27 October 2016. James Davies, 20, from Liverpool, denies murder and malicious wounding with intent. Anthony Baines, 30, and Mark Ennis, 30, also from Liverpool, deny the same charges. Jake Melia, 21, also from Liverpool, has admitted all charges. The trial at Mold Crown Court has heard the attack was the result of a turf war which had erupted between two rival gangs over the control of the drugs trade in the Rhyl area. On Monday, Mr Davies told the court he approached Mr Mason's car with a knife and banged its handle on the car window. He said: "I just wanted them to see it and be scared. "It was a stupid idea when I think of it but I didn't know it was going to end in the way that it did." He said he did not inflict any injuries and he did not see how Mr Mason suffered 22 stab wounds. He added he only discovered Mr Mason had been stabbed when he was told as they drove away. The case continues.	A drug dealer has admitted waving a knife around in a Denbighshire car park before a man was fatally stabbed but denied using the weapon.
The fine follows the conviction of former RBS trader, Shirlina Tsang, for fraud last year. She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades. Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were "seriously inadequate". The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were "significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls." But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. "This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones," Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement. RBS responded with a statement, reading: "We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment." The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years. In December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros (£320m) in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In the same month it was fined $100m (£60m) by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba. The bank was found to have removed location information on payments made to US financial institutions from countries such as Iran and Cuba.	Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has been fined HK$6m (£460,000) by Hong Kong regulators after it failed to detect a series of unauthorised transactions by one of its traders.
Some 1.57m sq km (600,000 sq miles) of the Southern Ocean will gain protection from commercial fishing for 35 years. Environmentalists have welcomed the move to protect what's said to be the Earth's most pristine marine ecosystem. They hope it will be the first of many such zones in international waters. At this meeting in Hobart, Australia, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) agreed unanimously to designate the Ross Sea as an MPA, after years of protracted negotiations, New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced. The Ross Sea, its shelf and slope only comprise 2% of the Southern Ocean but they are home to 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 30% of the world's Antarctic petrels and around 6% of the world's population of Antarctic minke whales. The region is important to the rest of the planet as the upwelling of nutrients from the deep waters are carried on currents around the world. The Ross Sea is also home to huge numbers of krill, a staple food for species including whales and seals. Their oil is critical for salmon farming. However there are concerns that overfishing and climate change are having significant impacts on their numbers. The proposal, introduced by New Zealand and the US, and accepted by all the other nations, will see a general protection "no-take" zone where nothing can be removed including marine life and minerals. As part of the compromise that emerged in negotiations, there will be special zones where fishing from krill and toothfish will be allowed for research purposes. "I'm absolutely overjoyed," said Lewis Pugh, the UN Patron for the Oceans, and someone who has campaigned for years in support of this new MPA. "This is the biggest protected area on the land or the sea, this is the first large scale MPA on the high seas, they are largely unprotected." The ocean advocate and swimmer drew attention to the Ross Sea with a series of swims in the icy waters - and for two years he has engaged in a series of meetings, dubbed "speedo diplomacy" with Russian officials to convince them of the value of the MPA. At the end of negotiations last year, Russia was the one country holding out against a consensus on the Ross Sea. But this year there has been what Mr Pugh describes as an "environmental glasnost". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has designated 2017 as the Year of Ecology and the country has recently expanded an MPA around Franz Josef Land in the Arctic. Sergei Ivanov, President Putin's Special Representative for Ecology, welcomed the new deal. "Russia has a proud history of exploration and science in Antarctica. In this time of political turbulence in so many parts of the world, we are pleased to be part of this collaborative international effort to safeguard the Ross Sea," he said. One of the key questions in the negotiations was how long the MPA should last. China is on the record as stating it believes that 20 years is long enough for a designation. Many conservationists say this is far too short, given the lifespan of creatures that life in the Ross Sea, such as whales. Ultimately, the parties agreed on 35 years. The designation was welcomed not just by campaigners but also by those with close links to the Ross Sea. "The Ross family are euphoric that our family legacy has been honoured in the 175th anniversary year since James first discovered the Ross Sea," said Phillipa Ross, great, great, great granddaughter to Sir James Clark Ross, after whom the Ross Sea is named. One of the other big concerns that delayed the proposal was the fact that it could set a precedent for other high seas negotiations around the world, such as in the Arctic and in attempts by the UN to develop a new marine biodiversity treaty. Lewis Pugh is very hopeful that this will be the case. And he's willing to keep swimming until it happens. "This to me represents a first step, I am heading back down to the Antarctic peninsula to carry on swimming, I want to see a series of MPAs around this continent that I feel so much about," he explained. "For me this is an issue about justice - justice between generations. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with us destroying our oceans so our children and grandchildren have absolutely nothing." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Delegates from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea in Antarctica will become the world's largest marine protected area (MPA).
Sean Mitchell, 46, inflicted four stab wounds on Stephen Dagg, 53, when he attacked him from behind at the St Mary's Vaults pub in Stamford, Lincolnshire. Lincoln Crown Court heard there was a history of hostility between the men. Mitchell, who was a publican at the nearby Melbourn pub, had previously banned Mr Dagg from his premises. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire The court heard Mr Dagg was drinking in the St Mary's Vaults pub on 12 June when Mitchell burst in to the pub and was heard to say: "Where's that queer." Witnesses then described Mitchell, a father-of-three, attacking Mr Dagg from behind and inflicting four "karate chop" type blows to his neck and shoulder area. The publican of St Mary's Vaults confirmed all of her knives were accounted for which meant Mitchell must have brought his steak knife with him. Mr Dagg was then chased three or four times around the pub and hid behind the bar before he managed to escape outside. He was later admitted to hospital in Peterborough where was he treated for four stab wounds. Mitchell, who also had a supervisory role at the St Mary's Vaults pub, later said he had no memory of the attack and simply did not know why it had happened. Mark Watson, mitigating, admitted Mitchell had brought the weapon with him, but had no recollection of what happened. He added: "He had and has no idea about the complainant's sexuality. It was simply generic abuse." Mitchell, of All Saints Street, Stamford, admitted a charge of wounding Mr Dagg with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm and having an offensive weapon.	A publican who repeatedly stabbed a man with a steak knife has been jailed for four years.
Scientists have struggled to explain the so-called pause that began in 1999, despite ever increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. The latest theory says that a naturally occurring 30-year cycle in the Atlantic Ocean is behind the slowdown. The researchers says this slow-moving current could continue to divert heat into the deep seas for another decade. However, they caution that global temperatures are likely to increase rapidly when the cycle flips to a warmer phase. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global average temperatures have increased by around 0.05C per decade in the period between 1998 and 2012. This compares with a decadal average of 0.12 between 1951 and 2012. More than a dozen theories have been put forward on the cause of this pause in temperature growth that occurred while emissions of carbon dioxide were at record highs. These ideas include the impact of pollution such as soot particles that have reflected back some of the Sun's heat into space. Increased volcanic activity since 2000 has also been blamed, as have variations in solar activity. The most recent perspectives have looked to the oceans as the locations of the missing heat. Last year a study suggested that a periodic upwelling of cooler waters in the Pacific was limiting the rise. However this latest work, published in the journal Science, shifts the focus from the Pacific to the Atlantic and Southern oceans. The team, lead by Prof Ka-Kit Tung from the University of Washington, US, says there is now evidence that a 30-year current alternately warms and cools the world by sinking large amounts of heat beneath these deep waters. They've used observations from a network of devices called Argo floats that sample the oceans down to 2,000 metres. The researchers say that there was another hiatus between 1945 and 1975 due to this current taking down the heat, that led to fears of a new ice age. From 1976 though, the cycle flipped and contributed to the warming of the world, as more heat stayed on the surface. But since the year 2000, the heat has been going deeper, and the world's overall temperatures haven't risen beyond the record set in 1998. "The floats have been very revealing to us," said Prof Tung. "I think the consensus at this point is that below 700 metres in the Atlantic and Southern oceans [they are] storing heat and not the Pacific." A key element in this new understanding is the saltiness of the water. The waters in the Atlantic current coming up from the tropics are saltier because of evaporation. This sinks more quickly and takes the heat down with it. Eventually though, the salty water melts enough ice in Arctic waters to lower the saline level, slowing down the current and keeping the heat near the surface. "Before 2006 the saltiness was increasing, this indicated that the current was speeding up," said Prof Tung. "After 2006, this saltiness is diminishing but it's still above the long-term average. Now it is slowly slowing down. "Once it gets below the long-term average, then it is the next period of rapid warming." As well as the data from the Argo floats, Prof Tung has also examined the Central England Temperature record, that dates back over 350 years. He believes that this confirms the regular 70-year cycles of warm and cold spells. This historic pattern, he says, could extend the current period of pause. "We probably may have another 10 years, maybe shorter as global warming itself is melting more ice and ice could flood the North Atlantic, but historically we are in the middle of the cycle." Several other researchers in this field acknowledge the Tung analysis is part of a growing body of evidence that suggests the Atlantic has a role in the pause. Prof Reto Knutti from the ETH Zurich has recently published a review of all the current theories on the hiatus. "I see the studies as complementary, and they both highlight that natural variability in ocean and atmosphere is important in modifying long term anthropogenic trends," he said. "A better understanding of those modes of variability is critical to understand past changes (including differences between models and observations during the hiatus period) as well as predicting the future, in particular in the near term and regionally, where variability dominates the forced changes from greenhouses gases." Other scientists say that the Atlantic hypothesis is interesting but a much longer range of observations is needed. "We really don't have a lot of data," said Dr Jonathan Robson from the University of Reading, UK. "So if there is this 60-year oscillation in the ocean, we haven't observed it all, basically we've observed the impact of it. We may have to wait 15-20 years to know what's going on." Prof Tung believes that whatever the cause and the length of the pause, we are on a "rising staircase" when it comes to global temperatures that will become apparent when the Atlantic current switches again. "At the end we will be on the rising part of the staircase, and the rate of warming there will be very fast, just as fast as the last three decades of the 20th Century, plus we are starting off at a higher plateau. The temperatures and the effects will be more severe." Follow Matt on Twitter.	The hiatus in the rise in global temperatures could last for another 10 years, according to new research.
"Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on US Soccer and her team-mates," head coach Jill Ellis said. Solo, 33, will now miss matches on 8 February against France and 13 February against England. This month, domestic violence charges against Solo were dropped. In 2012, Solo, tested positive for a banned substance a month before winning a second Olympic gold medal. She maintained she was not aware the pre-menstrual medication she had been prescribed contained a banned substance and she was cleared of any wrongdoing. The US are preparing for the Women's World Cup in Canada in June when they will aim to win their third title following victories in 1991 and 1999. The latest incident surrounding Solo concerns a training camp being held by the team in Carson, California. Solo's husband, former Seattle Seahawks NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Los Angeles in the early hours of Monday morning. Media reports claimed Solo was in the car but she was not cited in the incident by Manhattan Beach police officials. Solo tweeted: "I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team."	The United States women's team goalkeeper Hope Solo has been suspended for 30 days by US Soccer following an incident during a training camp.

The small aircraft came down in a field at Steve Powell's farm at Cwmbach, Builth Wells, Powys, just before 12:00 BST on Sunday. The men from Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, have been named locally as Scott Penlington and Nick Jefferies. Mr Powell said the aircraft appeared to have "fallen out of the sky into our field". "It is a terrible tragedy and we've never had anything like this before," he added. "The police are examining the wreckage but we don't know exactly what happened." Dyfed Powys Police said recovery work has now been completed and the emergency services left the scene on Tuesday. A spokesman for the Independent Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which is leading the investigation, said the wreckage was being recovered to its headquarters at Farnborough for a more detailed examination. He added safety recommendations may be issued to prevent similar accidents in the future, if any issues were identified. One Direction singer Harry Styles is a family friend of Mr Jefferies after he once dated his daughter Emilie, also 22. They remained friends with her father taking him up in his single-engine two-seater Cosmik plane.	The owner of a farm where a microlight crashed killing two people has said the men had "no chance" of survival.
Tettey, who scored a "toe-poke" against Manchester United last month, side-footed home to give Norwich a 1-0 win. "If I score a goal it will be talked about. Today it was nice to do a Yaya Toure," he told BBC Radio Norfolk. "I was happy, when I made contact with the ball I looked up and it was just going in, it was a great goal." Victory at Carrow Road against the Saints was Norwich's third win in their last four Premier League matches and left them 15th in the table, six points clear of the relegation zone. That followed a run of one win in 11 in all competitions - and the upturn in form has coincided with goalkeeper Declan Rudd coming into the first team for the last six matches. "For the defenders and Declan as well, he's come into the team and got two clean sheets in a row now," said Tettey. "For the whole team we are really pleased - where we are, if you're letting in goals you are going somewhere you don't want to be. "And if you win and don't let in goals you are looking forward - that's what we all want."	Norwich City midfielder Alex Tettey has likened his winner against Southampton on Saturday to those scored by Manchester City's Yaya Toure.
The starter at the Gailes course was calling Monty to arms for his second round of the day. His first went well, exceptionally well. The eight-time European number one rolling back the years to card a five-under-par 66. As the Scot limbered, former BBC commentator David Begg, who was on marshalling duty, informed me that: "Monty is putting beautifully." He added: "Ten putts on the back nine." More of the same and Monty would be a shoe-in for one last Open hurrah on his home course of Royal Troon, surely. After all, he ended his first round a shot off the lead and there are three qualifying places up for grabs. No wonder Monty is, as one mature observer informs me, "all sweetness and light". Will it last? Only one way to find out. To set out in the footsteps of Monty, or at least follow him round the course. The former Ryder Cup captain is joined in game 10 by Sam Robinson, from Market Raisen, and John Henry, from Clydebank. But, apart from a coterie of family and friends of the two younger men, the punters are here to see if Monty can do it. There must be at least 150 ready to follow the big man round. "It doesn't get much better than this," a young golf enthusiast tells me. "You can walk right behind him on the fairways, no ropes or anything like that, and the players even talk to you." That said, there's a sort of 10-yard de facto exclusion zone around Monty as he stalks the fairways with loping strides. After all, you don't want to get too close, just in case. Monty starts well, finding the green with his second shot and leaving him a 12-foot putt for birdie. It's in! Today, it seems, he has the magic touch. "He's in great form, chatting away," an elderly gent informs me before another observer, also of mature years, chips in: "No he's not." You couldn't say there's a lot of love in the air for Monty. More like deep admiration and respect for one of our greatest-ever golfers and, yes, a little fear. "Stand still please," he rebukes a couple of golf fans who stray into his eyeline as he prepares to tee off. They freeze, mildly embarrassed, until the moment passes. Alas, Monty's second round is not the same sort of birdie fest as his morning session. The putts just aren't dropping like they did before lunch, but he's fighting for every stroke. This means more to him he says than anyone else in the field - one last chance to qualify for an Open on his home course. Mind you, if he misses out here, he will still get in with a top-four finish at the Scottish Open! Monty only manages one more birdie in his second round and a couple of bogeys, both at par threes, mean he finishes on level par. However, there are flashes of brilliance, particularly at the 15th, where he overcomes a horrible lie to save par. And there is none of the "unravelling" predicted by one doom monger. By the time Monty gets to the 18th green, there are a couple of hundred spectators looking on. When he taps out for par, there is no ovation. His followers are too anxious for that. "Will five under be enough? Is the young Swede still 10 under? What about the closing pack." You see, judging by the demographic of my fellow travellers round 18 holes at Gailes, they don't want this journey to end. They've been following Monty's triumphs and travails for years and, to a degree, shared in them - haven't we all. As Monty lopes into the recorder's office, a small crowd gathers outside. Media men and onlookers. When he emerges, he signs autographs for a couple of young fans and speaks to reporters, telling them: "I hope and pray I've done enough. We'll just have to wait and see." Ending with this promise: "If I make it, I'll come back and talk to you." Indeed, he did make it, just, edging out compatriot Jack Doherty (not the television comic) by a stroke to finish third behind Oskar Arvidsson of Sweden and Scott Fernandez of Spain.	My day with Monty - and 200 other people - began with the words: "Game number 10, on the tee from Royal Troon, Colin Montgomerie."
Brentford goalkeeper Daniel Bentley saved Aluko's initial shot but the winger followed up from close range to give Fulham a deserved half-time lead. The Bees did not register a single shot on goal in the first period. Ex-Brentford keeper David Button superbly saved Josh Clarke's effort before Cairney slotted in Fulham's second on the break in stoppage time. A win for Dean Smith's Bees would have taken them into the play-off places before Saturday's Championship fixtures, but they failed to find the net for the fourth time in six league games. Instead, they were leapfrogged by a Fulham side that is only outside the top six on goal difference. Fulham, who had scored 11 times in their previous four Championship matches, should have been further ahead by the interval. Full-backs Scott Malone and Ryan Fredericks were constant attacking threats but some wayward finishing let the visitors down, while Bentley rescued Brentford with saves from Stefan Johansen and Cairney. Brentford struggled to seriously test Button too often on his return to Griffin Park following his summer move to Craven Cottage. He made an excellent one-handed stop to deny Clarke an equaliser and Fulham survived a number of scrambles from set-pieces before Cairney's calmly-taken goal sealed victory. Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London: "We didn't perform well and didn't deserve to win. We knew they would come and press us but our use of the ball was not good enough. "In the second half our midfielders had to get on the ball higher up the pitch and we were better. "While not playing at our best, we showed some spirit and stayed in the game until the 93rd minute." Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London: "I am very happy. We showed another positive step and our progress. We tried to show our identity and our style and I am very satisfied for my lads and the Fulham fans. "We didn't win in the last four games against Brentford and this is a nice present for people around us. "We are in a learning process and want to be better." Match ends, Brentford 0, Fulham 2.

Alexander Wotherspoon, 83, appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court charged with causing the death of Eilish Herron by driving without due care and attention. The 17-year-old was struck by Mr Wotherspoon's car at an Asda petrol station in Linwood in September 2014. The charge says he had failed to keep control of the car while reversing. Mr Wotherspoon, from Houston in Renfrewshire, uses a zimmer frame to help him walk. He denied starting the engine of his car and reversing while the driver's door was still open, failing to keep control of the car and, while it was reversing, causing it to hit the Renault Clio Eilish was filling up with petrol. The charge states that his actions knocked her to the ground, moved her car out of the way and caused his car to reverse over her, dragging her underneath the car, "causing her to be so severely injured that she died." The incident happened at the Asda petrol station at the Phoenix Retail Park in Linwood on 10 September 2014. Sheriff Susan Sinclair adjourned the case for a trial to take place in August and continued Wotherspoon's bail. Speaking previously, Eilish's mother Shanneal, 47, said: "Eilish was a really good girl, a normal teenager who loved her life, loved her family and loved her sport. "She was my best friend, we had such a good laugh. "I can't put into words how much she's missed in our family. We are all very close." Eilish was a keen netball player and played for Paisley Juniors as well as volunteering as a junior coach. After her death, Netball Scotland created the The Eilish Herron Young Coach of the Year Award, which will continue as a yearly recognition award for young coaches.	A pensioner has denied causing the death of a teenage girl by by reversing over her as she was filling her car up with petrol in Renfrewshire.
"The documentary for me started with the questions: 'Is this the end of film? Is digital going to replace it? What are we losing if that happens and what are we gaining?,'" says Keanu Reeves. The actor serves as producer, narrator and interviewer on Side by Side, in which he sets out to examine cinema's transition from film to digital formats. It seems a niche subject, but Reeves and director Chris Kenneally say they were conscious about making the film for a mainstream audience. "We wanted to take something that was quite specialised and share enough information so people could understand what we'd be speaking about," Reeves says. But does the average cinema-goer care or notice what format the film they're watching is in? "If you're not an aficionado, probably not, as long as it was working," admits Reeves. "If you go and expect to see a Hollywood studio movie and it looked terrible you'd go like, 'what is that?' So I think it could impact in that sense. "But a perfect film print projected is something that is remarkable and unique." Side By Side makes no assumptions that audiences will know the technical aspects of filmmaking, so spends some time explaining how cameras work, the photochemical process of developing film and how the introduction of digital cameras has led to the progression of editing and special effects. And helping to explain is a cast that reads like a Who's Who of cinema. Directors Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, David Lynch, James Cameron, Danny Boyle, George Lucas and cinematographers Wally Pfister (Inception, The Dark Knight) and Roger Deakins (Skyfall, True Grit) are all present. Female filmmakers are represented by the likes of legendary editor Anne Coates, who worked on movies like Lawrence of Arabia and The Elephant Man and Lena Dunham, one of Hollywood's hottest talents thanks to her TV show Girls. Reeves conducted a large share of the interviews himself, which not only helped the filmmakers gain such unprecedented access but also made for a series of relaxed, open conversations. "I can't say it didn't help that I've been in the industry for however many years - I was a known quantity in that sense," he says. It took around 18 months to round up and interview all the film-makers. Luckily, a large number of contributors attended an annual cinematography festival in Poland. However others weren't so easy to get. Directors such as Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino are notably absent. "There were people who weren't available or who didn't want to speak," he says. "We got turned down a few times which sucked." Although mainstream Hollywood films have been shot digitally for about the last 12 years, the first digital film to win an Oscar for best cinematography was Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. Cinematography Oscars followed for Avatar in 2010 and Hugo in 2011 - also shot digitally. Some see this as a shift in the attitude towards digital film, which had previously been considered inferior in quality. Filming on celluloid is an expensive and time consuming process. Reels of film that each contain about 10 minutes of footage are developed overnight, creating "dailies". Viewing them is the first chance a director will get to see the product of his previous day's work. It is only then they discover if they have the right shots or if they have to go back and re-shoot. The advent of video cameras showed not only that film-making could be done at a fraction of the cost, but that you could see the results immediately. It also enabled anyone to effectively become a film-maker. The invention of low price digital cameras further democratised the film-making process. However, advocates for celluloid include Inception director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister, who maintain digital images will never have the depth or clarity of film, which they insist on using. On the other side, the likes of George Lucas, James Cameron and David Lynch profess their love for digital and swear they'll never go back. Another issue addressed in the documentary is digital film archiving and preservation - where the introduction of new formats every couple of years is proving to be problematic. Indeed, Se7en director David Fincher says he has videos from the early days of his career in unplayable formats, as the hardware no longer exists. As a result, when he finishes a film, he now stores the relevant player alongside the rushes in his archive, to ensure he is able to watch them back at a later date. And even with modern technology, hard drives can fail, leading to the loss of digital content. It is something Reeves admits he had not considered. "I had no idea about the situation we're in right now where there is no standardised means of archiving digital information." "I didn't know anything about how it could all just go away - it was a bit jaw-dropping." The irony is that celluloid is the only format that has stood the test of time over the past 100 years and will continue to do so as long as there are projectors to play them on. Throughout Side by Side, Reeves maintains his impartiality but with filming complete, he is able to share his thoughts. "Going into the film I was definitely biased to 'what are we losing?'. Film was being held up as the gold standard and digital was this idea of replacing [it]," he says. "But what I've come to learn is that it's not necessarily replacing it - but that it's something else. And if it is that, then film has a better chance. "I'm still confident that it's going to hang around." Side By Side is out in cinemas from Friday, 15 February through Axiom Films.	Documentary Side by Side looks at the history of film-making and whether the advent of digital technology spells the end of celluloid.
Scott Carson was at full stretch to tip a header from Brentford's John Egan behind, while Tom Ince saw his free-kick turned over by visiting keeper Daniel Bentley. The visitors almost scored when Scott Hogan rounded Carson, but he could only find the side netting. Derby, who have just seven goals in 13 games, are three points off relegation. Johnny Russell and Ince had the Rams' best second-half chances, while Romaine Sawyers had a penalty shout waved away for Brentford. Despite the lack of goals, Steve McClaren's Derby side are now on a four-game unbeaten run, conceding just once in the process. Their lack of attacking impetus was compounded by James Wilson's knee injury in training, and they also lost Will Hughes, who limped off midway through the first half. Brentford, winless in three games, are just a point outside the top six and rarely looked in trouble against their hosts. The clean sheet was their first against Derby in 11 attempts, going back to 1953, and they have not won an away game against the Rams since 1939. Derby County manager Steve McClaren:  "The first half was too slow, no tempo and a little too safe. "But we've got to play football with these players, they are football players, we can't play long ball. "At times they are making mistakes but that will progress and will get better and I had no faults apart from in the final third where we needed that bit of magic. "A draw was probably a fair result, we huffed and puffed without blowing the house down." Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "I don't know if we deserved to win but we certainly deserved a penalty. "It was a double whammy and how it's not given I don't know. I think their bench was embarrassed it wasn't given as well. "I thought our performance was very good, very disciplined and the intensity of pressing in our half was very good. "Derby have got very good players but had very few clear-cut chances and I think our goalkeeper was rarely troubled. Match ends, Derby County 0, Brentford 0.

A boiler house was set for demolition by Coleman & Company when it collapsed at the site in February. Ken Cresswell, 57, John Shaw, 61, Michael Collings, 53, and Christopher Huxtable, 34, died in the collapse. RWE NPower said a procurement process has been under way since the demolition company's contract ended in October. Debris from the part of the building brought down in a controlled explosion in July still remains. However, all clearance work on the spot where the boiler house collapsed has been completed. RWE NPower closed the coal-fired facility at the site in March 2013 after 43 years of service, and a programme of demolition work followed. A major incident was declared on 23 February after the boiler house collapsed. The last of the bodies was not discovered until September. The cause of the collapse is being investigated jointly by police and the Health and Safety Executive. Coleman & Company had been working at the site for two years before the collapse, but lost its contract in October, which it agreed was in the "best interests of all parties".	A new contractor should be in place to clear debris at Didcot Power Station by the end of the month, the site's owner has said.
Mr Haldane, added that any rate rise would "increase unnecessarily the chances of the economy falling below critical velocity". He is considered to be the most cautious policy-maker when it comes to raising interest rates. Interest rates have been at 0.5% since 2009 and the financial crisis. The first increase is now expected in late 2016. Forecasts were put back after the Bank of England's last inflation report in which the Bank said the outlook for global growth had weakened. In a speech to trade union body the TUC, Mr Haldane also indicated that the next rate move could equally be a cut rather than a rise. "Now more than ever in the UK, policy needs to be poised to move off either foot depending on which way the data break," he said in his speech. Mr Haldane said that because wage growth could be weaker than currently expected, inflation may undershoot the Bank's November predictions, when it estimated that inflation would rise above its 2% target in two years. The Consumer Price Index currently stands at 0.1%. "Against that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made," Mr Haldane said. "Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway. That is an awkward, indeed risky, time to be contemplating take-off. "Meanwhile, inflationary trends do not at present give me sufficient confidence that inflation will be back at target, even two years hence." Mr Haldane also had strong words on the UK's increasingly expensive housing market. "The UK housing market is broken," he told the TUC meeting. "There is a chronic and accumulated imbalance between demand and supply, and it is that which is sending skyward - and has sent skyward - house prices."	The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, has warned that the UK's "economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway".
Foyle and Lagan Search and Recue are among 67 charities to benefit from the Department of Transport scheme. The grants were awarded from a funding pot of £5m being delivered across the UK over a five year period. Phillip Batt, a founding member of Lagan Search and Rescue, said the money was vital to the group's survival. The Belfast based organisation is to receive a total of £31,590. "It's a tremendous boost to organisation, this is our sixth year in operation and we now have three lifeboats and 40 plus volunteers," said Mr Batt. "We'll be using this vital money mainly for volunteer equipment, such as new life jackets and helmets. "This highlights the commitment of volunteers, we launch our lifeboat between four and seven minutes and that really is on a par with the RNLI." The organisation not only deal with local emergencies, they can also be called in to help national search efforts here and further afield. Some volunteers recently returned from the Aegean Sea where they were involved in rescuing migrants and refugees in trouble at sea. Their counterparts in Londonderry, Foyle Search and Rescue, have been handed £42,000 - the highest of any of the charities across the UK. The group have been operating in the Foyle area since 1993 and the bulk of their work involves call-outs for missing or vulnerable persons. UK Maritime Minister John Hayes said: "Every day countless volunteers in water rescue charities across our island nation carry out vital work during emergencies, not only around our coasts but also keeping our rivers, lakes and inshore waters safe. "It is imperative that we value and support their tireless efforts. I am delighted to be able to announce the latest round of funding, ensuring they have the equipment and resources they need to provide their round-the-clock lifesaving services," he added.	Two water rescue charities in Northern Ireland have received £70,000 in funding between them.
Marjory Stewart, of Bellshill, Lanarkshire, is alleged to have crashed into three other vehicles during the incident in Portsoy in July. She is accused of failing to keep her car under proper control. The case called at Banff Sheriff Court and was continued without plea until next month.	An 81-year-old woman is due in court charged with injuring four people - one seriously - while driving dangerously in an Aberdeenshire village.
Eight of the nine rate-setters on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted for no change, with one voting for a rise. The Bank rate has been at the record low of 0.5% since March 2009. A number of economists have been pushing their expectations of the first UK interest rate rise from the end of 2016 into the start of 2017. The Bank said: "All members agreed that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so only gradually and to a level lower than in recent cycles. "This guidance is an expectation, not a promise." Ian McCafferty, one of four external members of the MPC, has been voting for a rate rise for several months and had the same view at the latest meeting. The committee's minutes reveal a view that falling oil prices will mean any rise in inflation - which charts the cost of living - would be "slightly more gradual" in the near-term than forecast by the committee in November. However, it expected inflation to increase to around the 2% target "once the persistent impact of lower energy and food prices, subdued world export prices and the past appreciation of sterling had dissipated". It added that inflation was likely to be at about 0.5% for several months this year. The MPC also noted the fall in the value of the pound, which was partly attributed to actions by the European Central Bank. "Since the start of 2016, however, some market contacts had additionally cited the forthcoming UK referendum regarding EU membership as a possible explanation for the depreciation of sterling," the minutes stated. The global risks are building. Here is the MPC on the remarkable gyrations of the markets since the start of the New Year: "Recent volatility in financial markets has underlined the downside risks to global growth, primarily emanating from emerging markets." And on confidence in the economy: "Business surveys imply that the near-term outlook for aggregate [economic] activity is slightly weaker." And on the remarkable collapse of the oil price: "The 40% decline in oil prices means that the increase in inflation is now expected to be slightly more gradual in the near term." It all makes for a rather gloomy soup. And some would argue pushes any interest rate rise into the relatively far future Read more from Kamal The decision to hold the Bank rate comes shortly after weak industrial output figures were released and estimates suggested UK economic growth had slowed. Production fell 0.7% in November from October - the sharpest fall since early 2013, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, released on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicted that UK economic growth slowed to 2.2% last year from 2.9% in 2014. Meanwhile, the world economy remains in fragile condition, reflected by tumbling global markets last week after a run of poor economic data and interruptions to trading on Chinese stocks. Last week, the Chancellor George Osborne warned the UK economy was facing "a dangerous cocktail of new threats" as a result of slow global growth and a drop in oil prices, which is a potential threat to the UK economy because of North Sea oil production. The US Federal Reserve increased rates last month for the first time in nearly a decade, as the US economy expanded strongly last year. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has already said the decision to raise rates in the US was "not decisive" for UK policymakers, stressing that any such move in the UK would be made according to UK economic conditions.	UK interest rates have been left unchanged again at 0.5% by the Bank of England's rate-setters.
Chiefs, third in the Premiership, had only four players included in squads for this year's Six Nations. That compares to the seven players called up from each of leaders Wasps, second-placed Saracens and fourth-placed Bath's squads. Asked if that was a surprise, Baxter replied: "not particularly". "You've got to understand that although we've finished the end of the season very well and we had guys away on Saxons duty and other internationals, we actually didn't start this season very well," he told BBC Radio Devon. "We weren't performing either as a team or individually at the intensity that you need to to demand an international selection. "I think Luke Cowan-Dickie is getting close now, you can see the level of his performances the last month or so have been fantastic, and I think Henry [Slade] is very close. "But overall if we want to drive our players into the international setups we have to perform at a very high intensity and as individuals they have to perform at a very high intensity."	Exeter head coach Rob Baxter says his side need to perform consistently at a "high intensity" if they are to earn more international recognition.
The charity is campaigning to help protect ancient or old trees, that have grown in the UK for hundreds of years. They say that having more trees is good for our health as well as the environment. Currently around 2% of the UK is listed as ancient woodland. The UK has seen around 45 rare species of trees disappear in the last 100 years. Some people are calling for lots more homes to be built in the UK and the Woodland Trust say they are worried that building new houses would mean that old trees would be chopped down to clear space. The Government have been talking about the issue in a new White Paper, which presents ideas for changes to the law. It could mean that some trees in England would be protected like historic buildings.	The Woodland Trust have said that some trees should have the same rights as old buildings.
The call was made by Scottish Conservative Mary Scanlon and backed by SNP MSP Mike MacKenzie. The state of Holyrood's coffee was raised during questions about staff and services at the Edinburgh building. Linda Fabiani suggested the complainers could use "very good coffee bags" and "some really hot water". She was answering on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body which runs the parliament. After taking a question about food waste disposal, Ms Fabiani was informed by Ms Scanlon that she would like to "increase the amount of food disposal" in some areas, namely the coffee for committee meetings. Ms Scanlon, the MSP for the Highlands and Islands, told the chamber: "On behalf of my colleague on the audit and education committee, Colin Beattie, and colleagues across this parliament from all parties can I ask if the corporate body will ensure that new and existing MSPs get a decent cup of coffee in committee in session five [after the next Holyrood election]." Ms Scanlon was backed by Mr MacKenzie who said he "shared the concerns". He had also observed that the quality of the coffee diminished the longer it sat in their flasks. Ms Fabiani responded by saying: "I guess it is all a matter of taste I quite like the coffee that we get in committee." However, she added that it was a complaint she had heard "over the last couple of years". Ms Fabiani said the fact the coffee urns were being emptied each day suggested that most people were "quite happy" with what was being offered.	Pleas have been made by members of the Scottish Parliament for better quality coffee to be served to them during committee meetings.
Aamir Siddiqi, 17, was stabbed at his home in Roath in 2010 and two men, Jason Richards and Ben Hope, were jailed for life in 2013. Mohammed Ali Ege, originally from Cardiff, was arrested in India in 2011 accused of conspiracy to commit murder. But he escaped police custody in India last week. Mr Ege, who is also accused of passport and identity forgery, was awaiting extradition but escaped after being taken to a court hearing. Authorities confirmed he escaped from a railway station washroom in New Delhi. Det Ch Insp Ceri Hughes said Mr Siddiqi's family "remain resilient and continue to receive our full support". Mr Ege is from the Riverside area of Cardiff, but he also has connections with people in surrounding areas. DCI Hughes added: "We believe someone in this country knows something about Mohammed Ali Ege's whereabouts, and urge such people to contact us".	South Wales Police are appealing for information over the whereabouts of a man wanted in connection with the murder of a Cardiff teenager.
The man died at the scene on Cottingley Cliffe Road, Bingley, West Yorkshire, shortly after 19:34 BST on Tuesday. Police said they tried stopping the car after it was seen "acting suspiciously" but it drove off at speed hitting the cyclist a short distance away. The driver is in custody and the case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.	A cyclist has been killed after he was hit by a car as the driver tried to speed away from police.
It is in fact the Atacama desert in Chile, one of the driest places on Earth. Average rainfall here is les than 0.1mm (0.004 in) per year and there are many regions which have not seen any precipitation for decades. But while there is little rain, the clouds here do carry humidity. Coastal fog forms on Chile's shore and then moves inland in the form of cloud banks. The locals call it "camanchaca". The fog is made up of minuscule drops of water which are so light they do not fall as rain. During a particularly severe drought in 1956, scientist Carlos Espinosa Arancibia had an idea. The retired maths and physics professor from the University of Chile carried out a series of experiments in the highest hills near the city of Antofagasta. There, he came up with the idea of the fog catcher: netting with tiny openings of approximately 1mm across to capture the tiny water droplets in the fog. The droplets accumulate in the netting and form a bigger drop which eventually runs off the netting into a canal underneath. From there, it is channelled through a pipe to containers at the base of the hills, ready for use. And the research continues today. The town of Pena Blanca boasts one of the biggest study centres for the fog catchers. There are six big nets in the hills overlooking the town. Technical adviser Nicolas Schneider says that thanks to the fog catcher they have managed to combat the desertification of the region. He says that 100 hectares now are again covered in the flora once typical for the region. "We're planning to provide local families with water from the fog catcher in the near future," Mr Schneider says. At the heart of the community is a small building which also uses water from the fog catcher: the town's small artisanal brewery. Fog Catcher Brewery is small. It only produces has three vats and one cold store producing about 24,000 litres per year, but it is the pride and joy of its owner, Miguel Carcuro. "The water from the camanchaca is of excellent quality and gives our beer a special quality," he says. The project's backers say the fog catchers are cheap and sustainable. An average-sized fog catcher of 40sq m costs between $1,000 (£635) and $1,500 depending on the material used. They say its impact on the environment is minimal as the metal posts can be discreetly hidden among vegetation. As the water is transported down the hill by gravity, there is no extra cost involved for transport, they say. It is an idea which has been exported to other arid regions in Peru and Mexico. The largest expanse of fog catchers is located in Tojquia in Guatemala, where 60 fog catchers trap 4,000 litres of water a day. Prof Pilar Cereceda of the University of Chile says she hopes that within a decade Chile will have enough fog catchers to supply the whole Atacama region. "I dream of the day in which the fog catchers can compete with desalination plants, which is not environmentally friendly."	The dry, red earth could almost be mistaken for a Martian landscape.
The price of West Texas crude sank to $37.65 (Â£24.99) a barrel, a drop of 5.8%, while Brent Crude fell 5.3% to $40.73 a barrel. The slumping price comes as OPEC - a group of the largest oil producing nations- refused to cut oil production. OPEC- whose production covers about 30% of the world's oil demand - met in Vienna last week to discuss production. The group has faced growing competition from new supplies, including in the US where techniques like fracking are used to tap previously hard-to-reach oil reserves. "The decision by OPEC members to keep oil production output at record high levels has seen oil prices plummet again," said Sanjiv Shah, chief investment officer of Sun Global Investments. The group had traditionally kept a tight rein on oil production to regulate price, but announced last Friday it will continue to pump out approximately 31.5 million barrels of oil a day, going past the group's former 30 million barrel target. In 2014 Saudi Arabia led OPEC in a decision to keep output high to defend its market share.	The price of oil fell to its lowest level since 2009 as global production continues to remain high.
The prime minister said Labour had a "brass neck" to claim they were on the side of ordinary working families. Under the Â£350m Conservative plans, the amount of state-subsidised childcare for three and four year-olds would be doubled to 30 hours a week. Labour said it was "another unfunded announcement", accusing the Conservatives of "desperation". The Liberal Democrats said the plans "ignore working families with the youngest children". BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Cameron was attempting to switch the focus of the campaign to one of his party's key announcement after several days dominated by warnings about the SNP and a future Labour government. The party is likely to face questions about how it would ensure sufficient childcare places are available, she added. Currently, all three and four-year olds in England are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week for 38 weeks of the year. The Conservatives said the 30-hour offer from 2017, announced a week ago, would result in more than 600,000 extra 15-hour free childcare places every year. They said the proposal would be funded by reducing tax relief on pension contributions. Labour has pledged 25 hours of free childcare a week and the Liberal Democrats 20 hours, although both parties also plan to extend the offer to younger children. Mr Cameron said his government inherited a "shocking" situation, "where couples were spending as much on childcare as one of them took home in earnings". He added that "for many second earners, work didn't pay because the cost of childcare was so high". A Conservative government would expand on the changes made in the last Parliament, Mr Cameron said. "If you're a working parent with one child you can rest assured that by the time they're three they'll be able to go to nursery for 30 hours a week completely free," Mr Cameron said. "And we have legislated also for tax free childcare for anything outside that - so if you spend ten thousand pounds on childcare you'll get two thousand pounds back for each child." But Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Hard-working families will not be fooled by the Â£600m gap in funding for this policy, as announced last week." He said Labour had a "better plan" including a "guarantee of access" to childcare between 08:00 and 18:00 for primary age children. And Liberal Democrat equalities minister Jo Swinson said: "Tory plans for childcare ignore working families with the youngest children, which could leave some parents locked out of the labour market for years on end." She said her party would extend early-years education to all two-year-olds and ensure free childcare support kicked in as soon as paid parental leave ended for working mums and dads. "This will help with the cost of childcare and ensure working parents have a genuine choice about when to return to work," she added. The UK Independence Party says it will continue to fund the current free 15-hour a week childcare scheme and in-coming tax-free childcare scheme - although they would de-regulate childcare provision "to address the shortage places and cut the cost to both parents and the state". * Subscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.	David Cameron says he will create 600,000 extra free childcare places if he is returned to power next month.
Murray, 25, who has already secured Rio Olympic qualification, was down in 21st after the fencing round. Strong swimming and run-shoot combined events helped her climb to ninth and reach Sunday's final in Bath. She is joined by Great Britain team-mates Kate French, Freyja Prentice and Francesca Summers. Britain will claim the maximum of two Olympic berths for the women's event if any of the GB athletes - other than Murray - can finish in the top eight in Sunday's final at the University of Bath. "I sometimes struggle to find that spark and have the same adrenalin that I do in the final during qualification," said Murray, who was fourth in the women's team event alongside Mhairi Spence on Wednesday. "Hopefully I can step things up at the weekend," she added. World junior champion Summers, who won Youth Olympic silver in 2014, secured the last automatic qualification place in the first of the combined heats. "I took lots of confidence from winning world junior gold in Mexico," she told BBC Sport. "It's a big step-up in standard, but the target was to reach the final and I'm so happy I've done that." On Saturday Jamie Cooke, Tom Toolis and Joe Choong will compete in the men's final knowing a top-eight finish will attain them a Rio Olympic qualification.	Olympic silver medallist Samantha Murray recovered from a difficult start to remain on course for a first individual European pentathlon title.
The Treasury says abolishing the grants, or bursaries, will allow many more nurses to be trained. But a Royal College of Nursing survey claims two-thirds of nurses wouldn't have studied nursing without them. They say it would make an existing staff shortage even worse. Bursaries are a means-tested allowance paid to those healthcare students who qualify, to help with living expenses during their training. Plans to scrap them were outlined by Chancellor George Osborne, as part of the government's Spending Review in November 2015. At the time he said the move would free up around Â£800m a year in government spending and create up to 10,000 new training places. But since then, nurses and other health workers have been campaigning against the axing of bursaries. Student nurses are also going to have start paying tuition fees for their courses in the same way as other undergraduates - meaning they will have to take out a student loan. First year student nurse Ellie Archer has told the BBC that the bursary was vital in allowing her to pursue her dream career. She already has one sizeable student loan from another undergraduate degree and says: "I really wanted to be a nurse and I can say without a doubt that if I had had to take out a loan to study to become a nurse, I would not have done it." Ellie believes the intensity of a nursing degree means students need extra support. "Because of the amount of time spent on a placement it is very, very difficult to pick up second jobs, so there isn't really any other way of getting an income other than having the bursary in place." There is already a model of what a future without bursaries may look like at Chorley Hospital in Lancashire, which is part of the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Student nurses there, who are on a course run in conjunction with the University of Bolton, are the first in England to pay their own way and once they have successfully completed the course, they are guaranteed a job. The trust's director of nursing and midwifery Gail Naylor explains: "We had 800 applicants for 30 places, so I think what that tells us is, there really is the demand out there. "Students are looking for different ways to train and we've been really successful in that." The Lancashire course is not alone in being oversubscribed. In 2014, there were 57,000 applicants for places on nursing degree courses, but the NHS in England could fund only 20,000 places. The Royal College of Nursing says a survey of 17,000 nurses reveals that two-thirds of them would not have studied nursing if faced with the prospect of taking out a student loan. RCN chief executive Janet Davies says: "We're concerned that perhaps we won't get the same diversity of people coming into nursing that we have currently, that having to take out a loan will put people off, particularly those people who are more mature, who may have had a career previously and who are coming into nursing as a second career." However, many of those who run nursing training courses believe there is a case for change. Dame Jessica Corner, chairwoman of the Councils of Deans of Health which represents the universities that train nurses, says: "This change actually enables universities to open up training places. "At the moment they are capped, really on the basis of affordability and estimates of what the NHS might need, which have clearly been wrong over many years. "So over time we think training places will be expanded and that will be good news for the NHS with more nurses and allied health professionals graduating." There is a shortage of qualified NHS nurses right across the UK. So far these changes are only being proposed in England. But faced with similar problems, politicians in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be watching very carefully to see what impact these changes will have.	Hundreds of nurses and midwives are expected to join a demonstration in London on Saturday calling for a rethink of plans to scrap maintenance grants for students in England.
Conservative MP for St Ives, Derek Thomas, claimed diabetes is "completely avoidable through good diet and exercise" on his Facebook page. Dozens of constituents in Cornwall complained that his comments were inaccurate and "insulting". He said he was "sincerely sorry" and would raise the issue with government to prevent confusion in future. Mr Thomas' post provoked more than one hundred comments, many of which pointed out that type 1 diabetes "is genetic", and type 2 diabetes, which is often linked to obesity, is "not preventable for all". Orson Cornick commented: "Being an ignorant human being is avoidable, not type 1 diabetes!" Marianna Baxter whose daughter has type 2 diabetes said she was "very angry and hurt" at the "very offensive" remarks. Mr Thomas told the BBC he was told the information by "two medical professionals" and had simply been trying to raise awareness that many people can help themselves by improving their diet. He said: "I certainly got it wrong and I apologise for that. I certainly wasn't going out to intentionally upset a number of people that can do nothing about their ill health, so I do apologise for the way that was worded." He said he would raise the issue with the government ahead of its national diabetes strategy launch next year to make sure no discrimination took place. Mr Thomas removed the post on Saturday and replaced it with another offering a "sincere apology". Many commended him like Charlotte Clews who commented: "I stand up and applaud you. So does my type one son. It really is very heart warming to see that you have corrected a mistake and educated yourself and now others." The charity Diabetes UK declined to comment but said information on any link with diet and lifestyle was available on its website.	An MP has apologised for his "very offensive" and "damaging" comments on diabetes.
Arthur Cory, 49, said the flag had been kept in a cupboard at Penllyn Castle near Cowbridge, since he was a boy. The flag, one of only three surviving from the battle, is expected to fetch up to Â£50,000 at auction. It is said to have flown above Nelson's warship HMS Leviathan. The flag's "most probable" route to Penllyn Castle was through Mr Cory's ancestor Nicholas Cory, a rear admiral on William IV's Royal George yacht, the auction house said. Roland Elworthy, senior valuer at Holt's Auctioneers, said he had "no doubt as to the flag's provenance".	A man from the Vale of Glamorgan is selling a rare union jack flag, said to have been flown at the Battle of Trafalgar.
It follows UKIP leader Nigel Farage's comments on migrants using the NHS for HIV treatment costing Â£25,000 per year. On the Daily Politics Wales Election Debate on Thursday, Lib Dem Jane Dodds said UKIP lacked "care and compassion" on such healthcare issues. UKIP's Caroline Jones said Ms Dodds was "taking things to extremes" but claimed people were "fed up to the back teeth". Ms Jones told the programme that she understood Mr Farage's comments that the NHS was treating too many people from abroad with HIV. She said: "Is it fair when you've got a small pot of money to allow someone to come in who has never contributed to that pot, and have someone from your family or your constituency to be denied medication and treatment? "That is constantly happening." But Ms Dodds said everybody should have fair treatment, asking "Do you want border security guards on hospitals? "Do you want GPs' surgeries to have lines that say 'do not cross here unless you've paid into the system for five years'? "Where is the care and compassion here?" Plaid Cymru's Carrie Harper said debate about immigration should not be taboo as it was an issue that voters wanted to discuss. "But this type of scaremongering and the blaming immigrants for everything rhetoric is very unhelpful to the debate," she added. "The economic problems facing people in our communities have been caused by the reckless behaviour of bankers in the City, and they've been caused by the austerity agenda of the London parties." For Labour, Nick Thomas-Symonds said the NHS would not be able to function without migrant workers. "The National Health Service is the greatest achievement of any post-War government," he said. "There is no doubt at all factually that without migrant workers working in it, you wouldn't have an NHS in 2015." For the Conservatives, Emma Lane said immigration had been beneficial to the UK. "Immigration can and has benefited our country but it must be managed," she said. "We need to control immigration so the pressure doesn't continue on public services".	A Welsh Liberal Democrat election candidate has accused UKIP of wanting "border security guards" at hospitals.
Kerry Foods confirmed the redundancies, which were initially announced in February. The company said a consultation process "had failed to secure a strategy which would ensure the sustainability of production at the site". The firm said it was retaining the factory on the town's Europarc industrial estate and was looking at "future possibilities for the site". Kerry Foods said employees were given confirmation of the plant's closure on Wednesday following a 90-day consultation period. A company spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to assist employees in securing new employment."	A Grimsby frozen food factory has closed with the loss of 337 jobs.
The vehicle overturned on the road between Mecca and Medina, Mena said. There were 44 Egyptian pilgrims on board the bus when it crashed, the agency said. The incident comes just days after 16 Palestinian pilgrims from the West Bank were killed when their bus crashed in Jordan on its way to Saudi Arabia. The groups were both travelling to Mecca to perform the lesser Islamic pilgrimage, or Umrah.	Nineteen people have been killed after a bus carrying Egyptian pilgrims crashed in Saudi Arabia, Egypt's state-run Mena news agency says.
But how does today's technology compare with that from 30 years ago? We sent Ricky to the Centre for Computing History to try out some old school tech with some local kids. Take a look at how they got on. Released in 1981 the top end model of the BBC Micro had 128KB of memory, to put that into perspective you would need almost 8,000 Micro Computers, to equal the same memory as an average smartphone today! The memory was so small you couldn't even fit one photo taken from today's smartphones on there. The BBC Micro Computer was hugely popular, and was in around 80% of school classrooms in the UK at the time. However, they stopped making the it in 1994, when it couldn't compete with the more advanced models. Check out what these kids thought of it... The Apple Newton was one of the first touch screen tablet devices made by Apple, and was released in 1993. The only way you could make the touch feature work, was by using a pen called a stylus. One of its main features was it's ability to recognise handwriting, however many people said it was a bit rubbish and it got it wrong - a lot! The Newton was stopped five years later because it was very expensive, and not very popular.	Tablets, computers and phones have advanced super quickly in the last few years, and are a huge part of our daily lives.
As part of the deal, the firm was meant to have built a saw line by Friday. Despite questioning by AMs, Emyr Roberts did not give a clear answer as to whether that has happened. He said the deal - an effort to deal with diseased larch - was a success. Although he was happy with the decision, Mr Roberts admitted that its documentation was "not good", that there should have been more discussion with Welsh Government and that the executive board could have had a greater role in scrutinising the deal. A member of the committee, Lee Waters, later dubbed the answers "unconvincing". In 2014 a company was awarded a £39m deal to purchased both spruce and larch timber - the latter of which was forests where a fungus disease causing extensive damage - Phytophthora ramorum - was present. No other company was given the opportunity to bid for the contracts. As part of that deal the company was meant to have built a new saw line by 31 March 2016. That deadline was missed and extended by 12 months to March 2017. During a session of the assembly's Public Accounts Committee, Labour Llanelli AM Lee Waters asked Mr Roberts if the line had been built. "We are in on going discussions with the operator on that," said Mr Roberts. Mr Waters pressed him again, pointing out that the date of the committee's meeting was 28 March. Mr Roberts repeated the answer, adding later it was a "commercial matter". Mr Waters asked if Mr Roberts felt the firm "pulled the wool over your eyes in making you feel that the only way they were going to deal with this crisis was by investing in new expensive capital equipment". Mr Roberts replied with a denial: "No, I don't think they have pulled the wool over our eyes at all." "At the time, there was no market for larch," he said, claiming timber merchants at the time "would not touch larch, let alone diseased larch". "What the operator did and the rest of the industry did was actually build up that market." Mr Roberts said there was a "real crisis on our hands at the time" and there had been a danger the timber market would collapse. "The situation today was a lot more stable than it was in 2013-14. Our policy, our decisions on these contracts together with the overarching policy in treating larch disease has been successful," he said. "It's stopped the spread, but it's meant the timber market has been able to carry on as well." A report by auditor general Huw Vaughan Thomas released earlier in March expressed doubt over whether the decision met state aid rules and said the decision-making process was not transparent. In a qualification to the body's accounts he said he was unable to satisfy himself on whether the decision to make the deal was lawful. NRW disputed the auditor's findings on state aid and had said it strongly believed the contracts were lawful. Neither NRW or the auditors have identified the company involved. Following the meeting Mr Waters said the answers given by the chief executive "were not satisfactory" and that the evidence was "unconvincing". He said it was a "serious issue which has been badly handled". Mr Waters said it was clear from the evidence "with two days to go before the end of March the saw mill line has not been installed by this company". "I think the whole committee felt that the performance was complacent and this was a sufficiently grave situation for the auditor general to qualify the accounts, which rarely happens," he told BBC Wales. "I think the committee will be referring this to the full assembly to draw this to their attention," he said.	The chief executive of Natural Resources Wales has denied the organisation had the "wool pulled over our eyes" by a sawmill operator given a 10 year timber contract that was criticised by an audit.
Ball made just one replacement appearance after a rib injury picked up in October restricted his chances. "I'm really excited, there's been a lot of hard work gone in and some disappointments along the way" he said. The 19 stone seven Scarlets forward will partner Alun Wyn Jones at lock after Luke Charteris was ruled out. The hand injury suffered by Bath's Charteris and Bradley Davies' long-standing knee problem meant that Ball was the obvious choice to step in for the Six Nations opener against Italy in Rome on Sunday. Meanwhile, Newport Gwent Dragons forward Cory Hill sits on the bench ahead of uncapped Osprey Rory Thornton. The Wales camp are hopeful that Charteris will be available to face England six days later. Ball's only international start since the 2015 World Cup was in the friendly against England in May 2016. "In the Six Nations last year, I came in with an MCL (knee ligament injury), then in the autumn with my ribs as well, it's been a bit of a frustrating time for me and I hadn't hit the form I wanted to over the last year and a half" Ball told BBC Wales Sport. "I'm back playing a lot of rugby and I'm very excited to be playing [in Rome], there's always been a good log of second rows in the Wales set-up and it's up to me to put my stamp on the shirt." Autumn on the sidelines Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac described Ball as a "man on a mission" with some fine displays over the Christmas and New Year period. That came after an awkward experience in November, when he made a brief replacement appearance against Japan but missed out to Charteris, Jones and Hill against South Africa. "Being [in the Wales camp] and watching the boys playing and not being involved is heartbreaking," he said. "You always want to be here and involved in some way, sometimes it even drives you a bit more seeing boys coming in and doing well." New freedom for Italy Ball, who wins his 22nd cap in Rome, says Italy could be free to play more open rugby, conditions permitting, under new coach Conor O'Shea. "Conor O'Shea has brought something a bit different, he's freshened things up and they'll be a revived team," he added. "He was saying they've got the freedom to go out there and play, and teams like that are always dangerous." Ball and Jones will be up against Treviso's Marco Fuser and his Scottish-born partner George Biagi, now with Zebre.	Wales lock Jake Ball says he wants to put his stamp on a second-row shirt after the "heartbreak" of the 2016 autumn series.
The 21-year-old, who has been playing for Icelandic side IBV this summer, has signed a one-year deal. "I'm looking forward to a new chapter in my career. "It was disappointing that I didn't play more Premier League football, but sometimes you have to take a step back to go forward again," the right-back told the League One club's website. "I know a couple of the other lads and I've had a good spell in Iceland so I feel fit and raring to go." James is a terrific defender but he loves to get forward and fits the template of player I want in our squad Hurst, who has represented England at Under-16, Under-17, Under-19 and Under-20 level, spent time on loan at Birmingham and Shrewsbury last season. He began his career at Portsmouth, but failed to make a senior appearance at Fratton Park and moved to West Brom in 2010 following a previous loan spell with IBV. He was restricted to three appearances in all competitions for the Baggies and had five separate loan spells away from the Hawthorns during his time with the Premier League side. Crawley manager Richie Barker said he was delighted to secure Hurst's signature. "Right-back was a key position for us when it came to adding to the squad," Barker said. "He's a terrific defender but he loves to get forward and fits the template of player I want in our squad - someone who is young, athletic with a willingness to learn and improve and [has] a terrific attitude."	Crawley Town have completed the signing of former West Brom defender James Hurst on a free transfer.
The 53-year-old has come under scrutiny since information on Sir Bradley Wiggins' authorised use of banned drugs to treat a medical condition was released by hackers. And further questions about Team Sky's doping controls led MPs to claim its reputation was "in tatters". "It shouldn't even need saying, but we all back Dave B 100%!", Thomas tweeted. "I've known him a long time and I wouldn't want anyone else leading Team Sky," the 30-year-old said. Peter Kennaugh agreed with Thomas, adding: "I think all the riders on Team Sky would join me in saying they are completely behind Dave Brailsford." "He's the leader of our super Team Sky," added Elia Viviani. Michal Kwiatkowski, Owain Doull and Luke Rowe also tweeted their support for Brailsford. It follows reports that some riders have lost confidence in Brailsford and considered asking him to resign. Brailsford has denied any wrongdoing, saying TUEs "do not cross the line" over performance-enhancing drugs. Last week a Parliamentary select committee heard evidence about the former Team Sky doctor who received a 'mystery package' for Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011, Richard Freeman. Team Sky responded saying that they were a clean team who abide by the rules. "We are proud of our stance against doping. We believe our approach to anti-doping is rigorous and comprehensive," they said in a statement. BBC sports editor Dan Roan With the future of Sir Dave Brailsford - and perhaps even Team Sky - uncertain after months of damaging revelations, this is an attempted fight-back, with several riders closing ranks around their under-fire boss at the request of management. However, it has not escaped attention that the team's leading man, Chris Froome, is yet to make clear his support, instead tweeting about a meal he enjoyed in South Africa. And if that is an act of defiance, it could place even more pressure on Brailsford as he tries to cling to his job. Media playback is not supported on this device Freeman, meanwhile, has also received the support of a former colleague. Dave Readle, who was a sports psychologist at the governing body's high performance programme from 2008 to 2014, and worked closely with Freeman, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the doctor "has been thrown under the bus". MPs at last week's select committee hearing were told how Freeman had failed to keep medical records of treatments for riders - a possible breach of General Medical Council rules, according to the UK Anti-Doping Agency - and ordered large quantities of the corticosteroid triamcinolone, that may have outstripped clinical need. Freeman administered Wiggins' TUEs, and took delivery of the mystery medical package in France 2011. It has also been reported that fellow doctors at Team Sky blocked him applying for a fourth TUE for Wiggins, and that he was in charge of medical supplies when testosterone patches were delivered to British Cycling in 2011, apparently in error. He has denied any wrongdoing, and is thought to be preparing written submissions to Ukad's questions. Freeman withdrew from giving evidence to the select committee on the eve of the hearing last week due to ill health. But Readle said: "Richard has been hung out to dry. He is a loyal friend, a man of honesty, integrity and loyalty, and this is a tough time for him. All this negative publicity, he's in a state of shock. "The fact that no one's come out to support him, after all the help he's given riders, it stinks. "I spent a lot of time with him and everything he did was above board, there was no cutting corners." When asked why Freeman may have failed to keep medical records, Readle said that the intensity of the workload while treating large numbers of athletes and other staff may have meant that the doctor's administration sometimes slipped. "You get bombarded with stuff in elite sport, he wouldn't have done it deliberately. Richard had lots of athletes to treat," he said.	Team Sky riders are "100%" behind team principal Sir Dave Brailsford, according to Geraint Thomas.
The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman was not in the House of Commons to hear Prime Minister David Cameron make his argument for air strikes. The Scottish Conservatives, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Lib Dems were all critical. The SNP defended MP and MSP Mr Salmond saying he was on constituency business. A spokesman stated that Mr Salmond attended a "full briefing" on Wednesday from the security services and the joint chiefs about the Syria situation and there was "nothing in the PM's statement which was of surprise or new". He added that SNP leader in Westminster, Angus Robertson, had responded as planned to Mr Cameron's address. And when the issue is fully debated in the Commons, Mr Salmond would make his contribution as his party's foreign affairs spokesman. After attending First Minister's Questions at Holyrood, the former SNP leader visited the Scottish National Portrait Gallery where he unveiled the painting, by artist Gerard M Burns. Later Mr Salmond is due to host a Scottish Parliamentary reception for veterans, serving armed forces personnel, and local community representatives. He will also brief MSPs on the SNP position on Syria. However, the long-arranged portrait unveiling was criticised by Ms Davidson who said: "There is nothing more serious than the potential deployment of our service personnel abroad. "Alex Salmond has form in unveiling vanity projects to himself but he needs to remember he's paid - twice over - to be a parliamentarian, not an art critic." Mr Rennie added: "Nothing gets in the way of Alex Salmond's ego including debating war and peace in our country and the Middle East. "His absence from the Commons at this critical moment means we will be more sceptical about his motivations the next time he expresses outrage on the matter." A spokesman for Scottish Labour said: "If Alex Salmond was chocolate he would eat himself. On the day that he had a job to do in parliament over Syria it's ridiculous that the SNP's foreign affairs spokesperson was in Edinburgh to look at a picture of himself."	Former first minister Alex Salmond has been criticised for unveiling his new portrait in Edinburgh on the day MPs discussed military action in Syria.
The Germany midfielder ran onto a lofted pass from Lucas and, with his back to goal, hooked a volley into the top corner. With Jurgen Klopp's side sitting in third, it could prove to be a valuable goal as they push for Champions League football - but was it the goal of the season? Media playback is not supported on this device "We scored a fantastic goal," Klopp said. "Actually, I would love to see it again - everybody is speaking about it. "I only saw it once but it looked already pretty nice. I turned a little early and didn't see it hit the back of the net. "He is a good boy, a good player and he deserves it," added the German manager. Liverpool have not been strangers to special goals this season - with midfielders Jordan Henderson, Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum all winning Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition. With 11 goals in 100 career league starts, Can is not the most frequent goalscorer, and the player admitted himself that his strike at Vicarage Road was his best to date. "I have never scored a goal like that - maybe when I was younger. That is the best goal I've ever scored," Can said. "I saw the space and I ran behind and my first thought was that I wanted to head it, then I didn't think too much." Team-mate Adam Lallana, who made his return from injury as an early substitute, said that Liverpool players will be allowing Can to try more acrobatic efforts in training. "He does like to try speculative efforts, and we will not have a pop now after he produced that," said the England midfielder. "It was a 'worldy' goal, worthy of winning any game. "Credit to him, he was brave enough to try it and it flew into the top corner." The goal of the season will be chosen at the end of the campaign. Tottenham's Dele Alli won the award last season for his strike at Crystal Palace, and the last Liverpool man to win the honour was none other than Steven Gerrard for his brilliant winner in the 2006 FA Cup final.	It was only his seventh Premier League goal since arriving from Germany three years ago, but Emre Can's sensational overhead kick was enough for Liverpool to beat Watford on Monday night.
The Norwich City skipper - along with his team-mates - has remained in Malta for a training camp following Sunday's disappointing 1-0 loss to Italy. And with the Scots having failed to reach this summer's tournament, it will be the players' last game of a long season. However, it is a very different story for the French who face Gordon Strachan's side in their final warm-up match before they open the tournament against Romania in Paris on 10 June. And Martin acknowledges they need to improve if they are to avoid back-to-back friendly defeats after struggling to impose themselves on the Italians. "I think we're disappointed that we didn't show how good we can be, but it's the end of a long season, you have to take that into account," he told BBC Scotland. "We need to be braver on the ball and show a bit more quality and I think in the second half we did that. We're pleased with how we dug in and showed a lot of team spirit. "Now we're looking forward to another game against extremely tough opposition. "Hopefully on Saturday we will be able to put on a bit of a better show with the ball and keep that spirit and doggedness without it." Martin agreed with Strachan that Sunday's defeat will prove valuable if Scotland again need to counter the 3-5-2 tactics deployed by Italy coach Antonio Conte. The 30-year-old - who could earn his 25th cap in Metz - also believes taking on opponents of the standard of the Italians and French will benefit the younger players in the squad in particular. "I think we learned how to play against a difficult system that we're going to come up against in the World Cup qualifying campaign," he said. "The manager and players have taken quite a bit out of that, but we also learned to be a top team, the kind of risks you have to take. "We played against a top team on Sunday and I think the young lads, even those who didn't play, will look at those players as something to aspire to, because we have some really good young ones in this squad. "They have a chance to hit those heights if they want to, if they really want it. It'll show them how hard they'll have to work, it gives them someone to emulate and look up to. "We need to make sure we can compete with these nations and qualify for a tournament." Although accepting that the French will likely represent a superior challenge, Martin wants the squad to embrace it and use the occasion as inspiration for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. "It'll be a step-up in terms of intensity and tempo I think," Martin said. "They're obviously the home nation, they've sold it out already and it'll be a taste of what the atmosphere is going to be like at the Euros. "We'll need to be at it from the start, it's as simple as that and we know that. "They've probably got a little bit more flair in attack but probably not as good defensively as the Italians so it's a different test for us. We'll go there and we'll have a go."	Scotland defender Russell Martin wants the team be brave when they travel to Metz on Saturday to face Euro 2016 hosts France.
The family of Valentina Milluzzo said the doctor treating her refused to abort the foetuses because he was a "conscientious objector" to abortion. The hospital involved has categorically rejected the family's claims. The woman's burial has been postponed while further investigations are carried out. Milluzzo was admitted to Cannizzaro hospital in the Sicilian city of Catania on 29 September after suffering complications and going into premature labour in her 19th week of pregnancy. She had had fertility treatment at another health centre. She was in a stable condition in hospital for more than a fortnight but on 15 October her blood pressure and temperature dropped and her condition worsened. According to the family's lawyer, one of the foetuses was suffering breathing problems. The lawyer alleges that the gynaecologist refused to abort the foetuses in order to save the mother and said: "As long as it's alive, I will not intervene." No action was taken while the troubled foetus was still alive and hours later both had died, the lawyer said. Overnight, the mother's condition deteriorated and she contracted an infection. On 16 October she was transferred to intensive care, where she died. Angelo Pellicano, the head of the Cannizzaro hospital, said the lawyer was wrong. "There was no conscientious objection on behalf of the doctor that intervened in this case because there was no voluntary termination of the pregnancy, but (the miscarriage) was forced by the grave circumstances," he told the Ansa news agency. "I rule out that a doctor could have told the family what they say he told them." Sources told Ansa that the doctor had not been registered as a "conscientious objector". Catania's prosecutor has halted Milluzzo's burial while a post mortem examination is carried out. There are unconfirmed reports that some of the hospital's medical staff may be investigated. A senior doctor at the hospital, Paolo Scollo, told the Corriere website that all the doctors in his department were "objectors", and external doctors were called in when necessary. "However, in this case we're talking about a spontaneous miscarriage, no external help was needed. So we do not think the doctor was negligent," he said. It emerged earlier this year that the proportion of Italian gynaecologists refusing to carry out abortions in 2013 was 70%, according to Italian government figures. Italy is a predominantly Catholic country. But in southern Italy the proportion was even higher and in Sicily it was 87.6%. Abortion has been legal in Italy since 1978, provided it is during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After 12 weeks it is allowed only if the life of the mother is at risk or there is a problem with a foetus. If there is a chance the foetus can survive outside the womb, termination is lawful only if pregnancy or delivery is a serious risk to the woman's health.

Allen has a year left on his current contract and was named in Uefa's official Euro 2016 team of the tournament as Wales reached their first semi-final at a major competition. Having started only eight Premier League games last season, the 26-year-old has yet to discuss a new deal. "We will find a solution but it's not done," Klopp told BBC Radio 5 live. "Obviously Joe Allen is a good player. We never doubted this. He played a good European Championship, like the whole Welsh team. "We have to make decisions, we have to find solutions. We have to talk to the player, ask the player and think about our situation. That's how it works." Allen joined Liverpool from Swansea City for £15m in 2012. The Reds rejected an enquiry from the Welsh club about re-signing their former player on loan in January, and it is understood the Swans are still interested in Allen.	Manager Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool are eager to resolve the future of Wales midfielder Joe Allen.
A truck is said to have exploded as it was off-loading butane cooking gas in the town of Nnewi in Anambra State. Reports of casualties vary from 35 to more than 100 people killed, including factory workers and neighbours. Local police have confirmed the incident but have yet to provide further details. A huge fire reportedly followed the blast. The dead and injured are being taken to the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital in Nnewi. A witness told the Vanguard newspaper that the blast was triggered when a truck began discharging cooking gas without waiting for the mandatory cooling time. People who had come to fill up their gas cylinders were caught up in the explosion as well as passersby, the newspaper reported. Witnesses say the explosion caused a huge fire that firefighters and residents took several hours to put out.	Scores of people are reported killed in an explosion at an industrial gas plant in southern Nigeria.
The former Nova Centre in Prestatyn will be given a new gym, cafe and pool-side changing rooms as part of the Â£4.2m revamp. Three promenade-side retail units and a soft play facility will also be built. The centre shut last February after the trust running it had its funding pulled by Denbighshire council. The work, starting on Monday, is expected to be finished by July.	A multi-million pound refurbishment of a Denbighshire leisure centre which was closed because of council cutbacks is due to start.
The main parties failed to break the political deadlock after December's inconclusive elections. The conservative Popular Party (PP) is favourite to win, but only narrowly. In December the PSOE was runner-up to the PP. There is speculation that the PSOE and Podemos could form a ruling coalition after the 26 June vote. The December election was a watershed for Spain, because the PP and the PSOE had previously alternated in power since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s. Podemos (meaning "We Can") is now campaigning as Unidos Podemos, allied with the United Left party under communist leader Alberto Garzon. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has offered to form a left-wing coalition government with the PSOE after the election. "We need to agree with them [the PSOE] so that we can have a progressive government," he said. Breaking new ground, Podemos has presented its manifesto as an Ikea-style catalogue, with party members posing in different parts of an ideal house. Podemos and the other leftists argue that the PP, under acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, is discredited because of austerity and the chronic unemployment that has plagued Spain since the 2008 financial crisis. The PP, however, points to Spain's improved economic performance as proof that its policies worked. Judging by the current polls, Spain's result could mirror what happened in Greece, where the new left-wing Syriza party wooed voters away from the traditional Pasok socialists. The fourth significant national party, according to the polls, is Ciudadanos (Citizens), a centre-right, pro-business party. Ciudadanos hopes to occupy "a centre space in Spanish politics, with 3.5 million votes, which did not exist before in this country", its leader Albert Rivera said. The party leaders will try to outdo each other in a high-profile TV debate on Monday, which could have an impact on millions of undecided voters. Spain's Efe news agency reports that in this campaign the parties will hold fewer mass rallies - which are expensive - and focus instead on door-to-door leafleting and maximising their TV exposure. They will also do less plastering of candidates' faces on public transport and in the streets, partly because of widespread voter discontent with politicians, Efe reports.	Campaigning has started 16 days ahead of a fresh general election in Spain, with left-wing Podemos edging ahead of the Socialists (PSOE) in opinion polls.
Lance Corporal Trimaan "Harry" Dhillon stalked Alice Ruggles before fatally attacking her last October. Her parents Sue Hills and Clive Ruggles described the moment two Northumbria Police officers knocked on their door. Prof Ruggles said: "And then they said to us Alice has been killed. And we looked at each other and said 'It's Harry'. We knew, we knew even then." The trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard Dhillon had become obsessed with the 24-year-old and had stalked her. Dr Hills told of her guilt about trying to reassure her daughter on the phone two days before. She said: "And I sort of reassured her that was ok, the police knew what was going on and that it would be all right and if she just ignored him he would ignore her. "And I only put the phone down for 10 minutes and Emma (daughter) rang and said 'You cannot tell that to her, he's going to kill her. You have got to do something'. "And I thought she was over-reacting so I just said 'don't be silly'. "And so of course as soon as I saw the police I knew that's that what it was. "And I felt such a sense of guilt for having first of all told Alice not to worry and secondly told Emma not to be silly when actually if I hadn't said that Alice might still be alive." Prof Ruggles said he didn't think any of them, including his daughter, realised how serious the situation was despite the signs. Her parents have set up the Alice Ruggles Trust and they said they were hoping to use that and their daughter's "vibrant personality" to make other people aware of the dangers of stalking. They said they wanted her to be remembered for that and as "smiling and laughing and making some sort of cheeky comment." Dhillon, 26, denied murder but was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years.	The parents of a woman murdered by her ex-boyfriend have said they knew immediately he was responsible.
Local authorities can apply for funds to support weekly collections, as well as for initiatives offering residents reward vouchers for recycling rubbish. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who announced the scheme last autumn, calls weekly bin collections a "basic right". But Labour's Hilary Benn says the funding would be better spent on children's centres and elderly care. Mr Pickles scrapped guidance telling councils to introduce fortnightly collections in a bid to reverse a trend developed under Labour. He will say later that rubbish collections are the "most visible service" paid for through council tax. "Labour's barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik's cube," he will say. "The public are fed up of all the bin dos and bin don'ts. They just want a simple service." The government scheme will make funding available for facilities with technology that sorts waste after it has been picked up, preventing families having to sort rubbish into as many as nine containers. More than half the councils in England collect refuse once a fortnight, although many pick up recycling or food waste on a weekly basis. However, BBC local government correspondent Mike Sergeant said there was no compulsion to bid for a share of the cash. "Having invested heavily in alternate weekly systems, some may be rather reluctant to go back," he said. Mr Benn, the shadow communities secretary, said local people were best-placed to decide how rubbish was collected and should not be dictated to by government. "At a time of deep cuts, when local councils are having to make very difficult decisions, the quarter of a billion pounds Eric Pickles has found for this could be much better spent on preventing SureStart centres from closing or providing extra care for our elderly people," he added. A survey by the Press Association news agency last year found many councils were sticking with fortnightly black bin collections, claiming that a return to weekly rounds would cost millions and undermine recycling efforts. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government says 67% of people surveyed agreed the government should mandate weekly collections. Ministers say more than 70 councils have signalled interest in applying for funding. Bids which support a comprehensive weekly collection of rubbish, combined with a weekly recycling collection of materials such as glass, paper and plastics, will be prioritised. The scheme will support initiatives which reward households for recycling, with points that convert into money off at retailers, such as Windsor and Maidenhead's RecycleBank and Birmingham's Nectar programmes. And it will back mechanical biological treatment plants, already used in Bournemouth, which take all rubbish in just one bin and sort out the materials for recycling, landfill and composting. Councils have until mid-March to bid for funding, which will be available from April.	A £250m government scheme encouraging councils to keep or bring back weekly bin collections is opening for bids.
President Barack Obama said it was a "step towards a more normal and productive relationship". But he may face a battle in Congress where some Republicans are opposed to his dealings with the communist island. The new ambassador, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, had been working at the new US embassy in Havana, which opened in July last year. President Obama said there was "no better-qualified public servant". President Obama and Cuba's President Raul Castro have begun to reignite the diplomatic relations that were broken off in 1961 after the Caribbean island's communist revolution. What next for Washington and Havana? What is behind the US-Cuba thaw? In pictures: US-Cuban relations Restrictions on flights have been lifted but the US embargo on Cuba remains in place. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is Cuban-American, has previously said the improved relations will go "a long way in providing the economic lift that the Castro regime needs to become permanent fixtures in Cuba for generations to come''.	The US has appointed its first ambassador to Cuba in 55 years as relations between the countries thaw.
Victoria Street in Victoria flooded at about 18:00 BST on Saturday and the water gushed into several businesses including the Curzon Cinema, which had to be evacuated. Fire crews then helped some people in the venue cross the flooded pavement. Thames Water said a large pipe burst damaging the road but no customers were without water on Sunday. A spokesman for the company said: "Our team is on site arranging emergency repairs. "We apologise for any inconvenience caused and we will fix the pipe as soon as possible." The road remained closed between Palace Street and Buckingham Gate on Sunday morning and several buses in the busy area were on diversion. On its website Curzon Cinemas Victoria said: "Due to a burst water main, Curzon Victoria has had to close tonight (Saturday 6th June). "We apologise for any inconvenience caused."	Cinema-goers were carried to safety by firefighters after they became stranded when a water main burst in London.
The announcement comes days after Russia and Turkey negotiated a ceasefire in Syria which is largely holding, according to the UN. Russia has carried out air strikes on anti-government rebels since 2015. Moscow's involvement is credited with turning the war in favour of its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russian intervention - five key points How bombing campaign paid off for Putin Russia used Syria as live-fire training - US general "In accordance with the decision of the supreme commander of the Russian armed forces Vladimir Putin, the Russian defence ministry is beginning the reduction of the armed deployment to Syria," Gen Valery Gerasimov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. Tasks set for the carrier group, led by the Admiral Kuznetsov vessel, had been completed, the commander of the Russian force in Syria Col-Gen Andrei Kartapolov was quoted as saying. Col-Gen Kartapolov said Russia still had sufficient air defence capabilities in its S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems deployed in Syria, AFP news agency reported. The force reduction follows an order from President Putin on 29 December, days after Syrian government troops finally ousted rebels from the key battleground city of Aleppo in their biggest victory since the uprising against President Assad began in 2011. Russia, along with Turkey and Iran, is now pushing for peace talks to be held later this month in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana. Russia first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015, saying they were targeting the fighters of so-called Islamic State. Last March, Russia announced it was withdrawing forces but continued air strikes. This is not Russia's first "withdrawal" from Syria. In March 2016 President Putin announced the start of a pull-out. Some warplanes were flown out. But Russia's military role continued and its air power remained decisive. Russia has aircraft, air defences and artillery deployed in Syria, along with many advisers working with Syrian government forces. But we have never been able to ascertain the exact scale of the Russian forces involved. The initial phase of the Russian "draw-down" involves the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and its naval group, which has hardly played a major role in the fighting. Russia's stated intention is to build up its bases in Syria for the long-term, but Mr Putin may be signalling that in Moscow's view, with the fall of Aleppo and the entrenchment of the Assad regime, one important phase of the fighting is over.	Russia is starting to withdraw forces from Syria and its aircraft carrier group will be the first to leave, the Russian armed forces chief says.
Katie Locke, 23, was found dead at Theobolds Park Hotel in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire. She had been strangled. Carl Langdell admitted the charge of murder when he appeared at St Albans Crown Court via a video link from Bedford Prison. A psychiatric report is to be prepared on Langdell who was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 18 April. Ann Evans, for the prosecution, said: "What needs to be established are the circumstances of Katie's death. There was a no comment interview with the police." Benjamin Aina QC, defending, said Langdell admitted deliberately and intentionally killing Katie in a hotel room. He said his client had been seeking psychiatric help after being convicted of making threats to kill in Bristol. Miss Locke's family were in court for the hearing. In a statement released by police at the time of her death, they said: "As a family we are distraught, in shock and totally devastated. There was not a bad bone in Katie's body. "Katie worked hard and loved her job as a teacher. In what little spare time she had she enjoyed sports. "We now feel like our future has been stolen from us."	A 26-year-old lawyer has pleaded guilty to murdering a young teacher whose body was found at a hotel on Christmas Eve.
He has named several players with problems in his preliminary 24-man squad, including Charles Kaboré, Préjuce Nakoulma, Jonathan Pitroipa and Bertrand Traoré. "I am confident they can recover in time," Duarte insisted. The squad is due to begin a training camp on 27 December. Bakary Koné is another player from the 2013 squad that finished as runners-up in South Africa who has an injury concern. Injury has ruled out Aziz Kabore, who plays for Valenciennes in France, while there is a first call-up for Blati Toure. The 22-year-old was born in Ivory Coast, played as a junior in Spain but is now at Omonia Nicosia of Cyprus. "Blati Touré is a player I adore. I've watched him since he was at Evian TG I France but I was told he was Ivorian, but he called me to assure me he is 100 percent Burkinabe," Duarte explained. "He hasn't yet trained with us but he is player with the quality to make a positive addition." Also included are the uncapped Morocco-based Ernest Aboubacar Congo, called up last month for the first time for last month's World Cup qualifier against the Cape Verde Islands, and Issoumaila Lingane of Hapoel Ashkelon in Israel. Besides Aziz Kabore, the most significant absence is first choice goalkeeper Daouda Diakite, who was seriously injured three months ago playing for AS Vita Club in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Stallions will leave Ouagadougou on 27 December to train in Marrakech where they play a Morocco B team on 4 January and Mali a few days later. Burkina Faso meet Cameroon in Libreville in their first Group A game on the opening day of the Nations Cup finals on 14 January. Squad: Goalkeepers: Germain Sanou (Beauvais, France), Hervé Koffi (ASEC Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire), Aboubacar Sawadogo (RC Kadiogo) Defenders: Ernest Aboubacar Congo (IZK Khemisset, Morocco), Yacouba Coulibaly (RC Kadiogo), Youssoufou Dayo (RCB Berkane, Morocco), Bakary Koné (Malaga, Spain), Patrick Malo (Smouha, Egypt), Issouf Paro (Santos, South Africa), Steeve Yago (Toulouse, France) Midfielders: Cyrille Bayala (Sheriff Tiraspol, Moldova), Adama Guira (Racing Lens, France), Charles Kaboré (FC Krasnodar, Russia), Prejuce Nakoulma (Kayserispor, Turkey), Jonathan Pitroipa (Al Nasr, United Arab Emirates), Bakary Sare (Moreirense, Portugal), Blati Toure (Omonia Nicosia, Cyprus), Abdou Razack Traore (Karabukspor, Turkey), Alain Traore (Kayserispor, Turkey), Jonathan Zongo (Almeria, Spain) Forwards: Aristide Bance (Asec Mimosas, Ivory Coast), Banou Diawara (Smouha, Egypt), Issoumaila Lingane (Hapoel Ashkelon, Israel), Bertrand Traore (Ajax Amsterdam, Netherlands).	Burkina Faso coach Paulo Duarte says he has is not concerned over a number of injuries to key players going into next month's African Nations Cup finals.
The Marchwood Park and Cracknore Hard industrial estates, covering 113.73 acres, were acquired by Associated British Ports (ABP) for an undisclosed amount. Port director Nick Ridehalgh said the estates would provide "strategic long term value" for the company. Local councillor David Harrison called for a "statement of intent" from ABP. The estates are located on the western side of Southampton water, opposite the cruise terminal and Southampton Docks, and are six miles (9.5km) from the M271 motorway. The sites had been owned by Oceanic Estates for the last 15 years and and are among the largest self-contained industrial and warehouse holdings in the South East with occupiers including Ocado and Royal Mail, according to property consultants Lambert Smith Hampton. Mr Harrison, who represents Totton South and Marchwood, said: "In the longer term, local people in Marchwood and Totton South will be particularly concerned about any change to future usage of the site. For example, any increases in traffic and more pressure on our overburdened local roads will be completely unacceptable". Mr Ridehalgh said: "Our intention is to continue to develop the estates to increase the income... and directly contribute to the economic success of the Port of Southampton and the wider region."	The company which manages Southampton port has bought industrial estates close to its western side.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent "excessive" journeys. The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed. Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs. "Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem," she said. "Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too." Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey. The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that: The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work. The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures. Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August. Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine. "It makes life difficult but it's become the norm," said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol. Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip. "I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route," he said. Mr Seymour, 43, said the Â£5,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating. "I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter," he said. The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains. "It can be a daily nightmare," he said. "I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day." Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains. Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London. He says spending his "14th winter" on the bicycle is worth it to save "several thousands of pounds a year" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership. "I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling," he said. Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme. "But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme," he said. Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London. In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital. Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be "excessive", and instead travelled to London a few times a month. "Sadly I'm no longer commuting and living back in London," he said.	Spending two hours commuting each day is a reality for many UK workers, says data that suggests Britons are willing to travel further and longer.
It is the first time an unsigned artist has won the honour - which has previously gone to Adele and Sam Smith. "I can't believe this is happening," said the 23-year-old, from south London. "It's all just so ridiculous!" Four of the top five Sound of 2017 acts are black British women, reflecting a rise of female talent in grime and R&B. Ray said she wanted her music to "empower women to live life as they want". "There are so many societal pressures on women, on how we should behave, and they're all based on male privilege." The Sound of 2017 list was chosen by a panel of 170 DJs, critics and festival bookers. Among them was Jamal Edwards, whose SB:TV YouTube channel has helped launch the careers of Dizzee Rascal, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran. He said he was "blown away" when he saw Ray BLK perform at one of his club nights last year. "She is the whole package," he said. "I know she's going to have an amazing year." "Some artists have that magic about them," said Radio 1's Huw Stephens. "She has a real, raw talent that cuts through so strongly. She is the real deal." Born in Nigeria and raised in London, Ray released her first recordings while studying for an English degree. She worked in an advertising agency to sustain her career in its early days. Combining her love of hip-hop and R&B, she delivers streetwise, literate lyrics with a velvety soul voice. Her standout track, My Hood, is a bittersweet love letter to her home town, Catford. "The south east is one of the roughest places in London but it rears the strongest people, and that's what makes us special," she said. The singer has avoided signing a record deal in order to retain the rights to her music, which she releases on her own label. Like an increasing number of artists, from Paul McCartney to the Pet Shop Boys, she works with a company called Kobalt Music Services - who provide "back-room" support like publishing and distribution, without tying musicians to restrictive contracts. "I feel as though I need to have my autonomy for now," Ray told the BBC. "There've been so many artists in 2016 that came out, who did so independently and experienced a lot of success. I think there's a new wave of people doing that. The industry is changing." The winning soul singer, whose real name is Rita Ekwere, beat blues singer Rag N Bone Man to top the Sound of 2017 list, while third place went to pop star-in-waiting Raye. Ray said: "I'm particularly proud to be a part of this year's list as it's full of so much talent, some of whom are independent artists like myself which I really hope inspires the next generation." The Sound of... list launched in 2003 and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, including 50 Cent, Haim, Frank Ocean, Ellie Goulding and Florence + The Machine. According to the rules, acts on the longlist should not be well known - so talent show contestants and members of famous bands launching a solo career are excluded. Artists must not have had a UK top 20 single or album before 30 October 2016 - although guest vocalists remain eligible. Last year's victor was Jack Garratt, whose debut album Phase entered the charts at number three. He praised the "very diverse" range of acts on 2017 longlist, which also included agitprop rock band Cabbage and folk-pop ingenue Maggie Rogers. "This list shows it is possible to have a great ear for melody and not just write the same four chords in different keys. "2017 is going to be such an incredible year for art, especially given how terrible 2016 was for politics. "We've all got a lot to write about and I think we're going to write some incredible stuff."

Soul singer Ray BLK has topped the BBC's Sound Of 2017 list, which aims to predict the most exciting new music for the year ahead.
In the Victorian fairground where the grotesque mixed with the gaudy, where the sound of the barrel organ mixed with the whooshes and bangs of the various rides, there would be the stand where you would be able to lace up a pair of boxing gloves and take on the gnarled and grizzled man mountain who would be waiting for you in the ring. And the crowd would "ooh" and "aah" as the prizefighter set about you, raining blows down above and below the belt. And so it was in the beautiful Simi Hills in California last night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library that the Republican candidates took it in turn to try to give Donald Trump a bloody nose, a cracked rib, a thick lip and black eye. Ideally all four at once. First up, flexing his muscles, and jabbing hard, was Senator Rand Paul on whether Trump had the character to have his hand on the nuclear trigger. "I'm very concerned about him - having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his - his visceral response to attack people on their appearance - short, tall, fat, ugly - my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that?" Good shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - "I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there," said Trump. Cue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. "Mr Trump. We don't need an apprentice in the White House." But with a squint of those blue eyes, Trump shot back "in Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2bn right now. I would do so much better than that." Jake Tapper, the excellent CNN host, didn't quite say "roll up, roll up who else wants to take their chances against my boy?" But he didn't need to. They were lining up. Hold on a minute. What's this? My, my, a lady is getting into the ring. Surely she wouldn't be able to draw blood where everyone else had failed. Well she did. The former Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina had been roundly insulted by Trump when he questioned her suitability because of her appearance. He told Rolling Stone  - "Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" She was stoic and measured: "I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said." And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. "I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman." Her face was acid. She did not flinch. It was a gotcha moment. And "low energy" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate. Trump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited. There was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate. But if you're in a fairground - well you want all the fun of the fair. And once again Donald Trump provided it.  He is still the focal point. But he saw tonight that his opponents are prepared to fight back. And so the circus moves on. So roll up next time to see whether the polls change, whether all those candidates can stay the course. Thrills and spills await us.	The BBC's Jon Sopel sees presidential hopeful Donald Trump roll with the punches in the second Republican debate in California - until a new competitor entered the ring.
The study, published in Nature, has been described as a "milestone" moment that could help unlock new ways of treating and preventing the disease. The largest study of its kind unpicked practically all the errors that cause healthy breast tissue to go rogue. Cancer Research UK said the findings were an important stepping-stone to new drugs for treating cancer. To understand the causes of the disease, scientists have to understand what goes wrong in our DNA that makes healthy tissue turn cancerous. The international team looked at all 3 billion letters of people's genetic code - their entire blueprint of life - in 560 breast cancers. They uncovered 93 sets of instructions, or genes, that if mutated, can cause tumours. Some have been discovered before, but scientists expect this to be the definitive list, barring a few rare mutations. Prof Sir Mike Stratton, the director of the Sanger Institute in Cambridge which led the study, said it was a "milestone" in cancer research. He told the BBC: "There are about 20,000 genes in the human genome.  It turns out, now we have this complete view of breast cancer - there are 93 of those [genes] that if mutated will convert a normal breast cell into a breast cancer cell. That is an important piece of information. "We hand that list over to the universities, the pharmaceuticals, the biotech companies to start developing new drugs because those mutated genes and their proteins are targets for new therapeutics. "There are now many drugs that have been developed over the last 15 years against such targets which we know work." Targeted drugs such as Herceptin are already being used by patients with specific mutations. Prof Stratton expects new drugs will still take at least a decade to reach patients and warns: "Cancers are devious beasts and they work out ways of developing resistance to new therapeutics so overall I'm optimistic, but it's a tempered optimism." There is also bad news in the data - 60% of the mutations driving cancer are found in just 10 genes. At the other end of the spectrum, there are mutations so rare they are in just a tiny fraction of cancers meaning it is unlikely there will be any financial incentive to develop therapies. But why do those genes mutate in the first place? Mutations leave unique scars - known as mutational signatures - on our DNA and that allowed the team to identify 12 types of damage that cause mutations in the breast. Some are related to family risk, but most are still unexplained. One class of mutation seems to stem from the body attacking viruses by mutating their genetic code, but also suffering collateral damage in the process. Whether any of these processes can be altered is still unknown in this nascent field, but researchers hope the findings could eventually lead to ways of reducing the risk of cancers. Dr Serena Nik-Zainal, another researcher at the Sanger Institute, added: "In the future, we'd like to be able to profile individual cancer genomes so that we can identify the treatment most likely to be successful for a woman or man diagnosed with breast cancer. "It is a step closer to personalised health care for cancer." Dr Emma Smith, from Cancer Research UK, said: "This study brings us closer to getting a complete picture of the genetic changes at the heart of breast cancer and throws up intriguing clues about the key biological processes that go wrong in cells and drive the disease. "Understanding these underlying processes has already led to more effective treatments for patients, so genetic studies on this scale could be an important stepping stone towards developing new drugs and boosting the number of people who survive cancer."

John Guidetti drove home the free-kick that followed Pascali's professional foul on Stefan Scepovic. Kilmarnock keeper Conor Brennan limited the damage with a string of saves for the Ayrshire side. But he could not prevent Scepovic knocking in a second after the break. Media playback is not supported on this device Pascali's dismissal changed the nature of the match. Before his red card on 34 minutes for pulling Scepovic back as he bore down on goal, the teams had been evenly matched. Both sides had shown flashes of skill - a Guidetti flick here, an Alexei Eremenko dummy there - but the goalkeepers had been under-employed. Tope Obadeyi advanced from midfield to offer some threat to Craig Gordon's goal on occasion but was stymied by the alertness of the Scotland keeper or the positioning of Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer in the home defence. Van Dijk headed a corner a fraction wide and Celtic captain Scott Brown broke off from his midfield tussles with Jamie Hamill and Sammy Clingan to fire a few shots at Brennan's goal but they were bravely blocked by defenders. And Mubarak Wakaso thumped a header straight into Brennan's arms from the corner of the six-yard box. Gordon's only real save of the first half was to parry a 25-yard pile-driver by Eremenko. Pascali, who had been the key figure in organising the Killie defence, was lucky when referee Willie Collum awarded him rather than Guidetti a free-kick after making a mess of ushering the ball out for a goal kick with the Swede snapping at his heels. But the Italian offered little complaint when Collum flashed him a straight red for his panicked challenge on Scepovic. Killie boss Allan Johnston immediately withdrew Eremenko and sent on Lee Ashcroft to partner Mark Connolly in defence but within seconds Guidetti had stroked his free-kick past the despairing Brennan. Celtic had Killie on the back foot and the visitors had a close shave when Connolly headed an effort off the line and Brennan saved well from a Stefan Johansen crack from 18 yards. As the Rugby Park men struggled to play in Celtic's half, so the chances came for the hosts. Brennan palmed away an angled shot by Scepovic, relied on his post to keep out a Guidetti effort from 12 yards and was well placed, again, to block the centre-forward's effort 10 seconds later. But the Serbia international would get the last laugh over Brennan, who was in for the injured Craig Samson. Moments after side-footing horribly wide from 18 yards as Wakaso found space on the left, Scepovic was rewarded for his persistence when he met the winger's cross to hit the ball across Brennan and into the net. Celtic manager Ronny Deila replaced the scorer with Leigh Griffiths and sent on Charlie Mulgrew for Johansen - but the match was over as a meaningful contest and Celtic were able to follow up Thursday's Europa League win over Astra by moving up to fourth in the Scottish Premiership, overtaking Kilmarnock in the process.

The pair have signed two-year deals with Carlton Fairweather's WSL 1 side. Staniforth, 23, made her Lady Black Cats debut aged 16 and helped the club to the FA Womens' Premier League North title and 2009 Womens' FA Cup final. Canada international Sjoman, 28, has played in America, Germany and England prior to her last move to Glasgow. "They are two players with fantastic experience at the very top level of the game and will bring so much to our squad in terms of competition and quality," Fairweather told the club website.	Sunderland Ladies have re-signed midfielder Lucy Staniforth from Liverpool and added defender Kylla Sjoman from Scottish side Celtic.
With delicious timing, Patrick Buisson - the man credited with inspiring his former boss's rightward shift on issues like national identity - has released a book of recollections concerning the seven years he served as his top aide. To no-one's surprise, given the way the pair parted company after Mr Sarkozy lost the presidency in 2012, it drips with the satisfaction of a finally requited revenge. I have known some acts of treachery in my time... but rarely like this" In one passage, Mr Buisson claims that Nicolas Sarkozy deliberately allowed rioters from the suburbs to rampage in central Paris, the better to show off his capacity to restore order. It was in 2006, when Mr Sarkozy was at the interior ministry and his rival, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, was pushing through a labour reform hotly contested by French youth. Mr Buisson quotes Mr Sarkozy as recalling: "We took the decision to allow gangs of blacks and Arabs to attack the young whites on the Invalides, and at the same time tipped off the photographers at Paris Match that there was likely to be serious trouble. "We were petrified that someone might end up getting seriously hurt, but in the end it was worth it." At the demonstration that followed, police intervened early and Mr Sarkozy was on hand for the television cameras, "proving how much he was in control of the situation compared with the prime minister", writes Mr Buisson. The former adviser is scathing about Mr Sarkozy's "narcissistic" personality, and says his public courtship and marriage to "trophy woman" Carla Bruni was an excruciating embarrassment. "Probably he thought deep down that the happy news of his love life would be a useful antidote to the prevailing gloom. Instead [the reaction] could be summed up in three words: immature, undignified, infantile." He is also unsparing of Carla Bruni herself, who he says "did deep harm to [the Sarkozy] presidency". "The head of state... was in reality a fragile seducer subjugated by his conquests, a fake tough guy submerged in a permanent state of emotional dependency." In politics, Mr Buisson says Nicolas Sarkozy was always words rather than action, that he lacked guiding principles and was more interested in the short-term buzz of media approval. "The public man... was always constrained by the private man, by his passions, his confusions, his weakness for whatever was in vogue." The book reveals that the aspiring president was in contact with far-right National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen between the two rounds of the 2007 election, which he won, in the hope of winning FN votes for round two. And in 2005 Mr Buisson quotes him as saying: "The values of the far right are the values of all the French. It's just the way the FN puts them that is shocking. The French do not like over-spicy food." Now fully engaged in November's primary to choose the centre-right's presidential candidate, Nicolas Sarkozy has dismissed Mr Buisson's book as unworthy of notice. The two men fell out after the former president's 2012 election defeat by Francois Hollande. Two years later it was revealed that throughout the Sarkozy presidency Mr Buisson had been secretly recording conversations and meetings at the Elysee. Speaking on television at the time, Mr Sarkozy said: "I have known some acts of treachery in my time, but rarely like this!" Mr Buisson was convicted of invasion of privacy and ordered to pay â‚¬20,000 (Â£17,000; $22,000) in damages to Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni.  According to the former adviser, only Carla Bruni ever cashed her cheque.	The poisonous memoirs of a right-wing adviser at the Elysee Palace are proving deeply embarrassing for ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, just as he gathers strength for a planned presidential comeback.
Kelly Pearce, 36, was found with fatal throat wounds in a flat belonging to witness Joseph Withers on Canvey Island, Essex, on 19 November. Accused Anthony Ayres, 49, of Fairlop Avenue in Canvey, denies murdering her. At Chelmsford Crown Court his defence claimed Mr Withers killed her and then blamed Mr Ayres who arrived later. Ms Pearce had been stabbed 40 times in the face and neck and bludgeoned to death with a weapon "consistent" with a hammer in a "frenzied attack", the court heard. More on this and other news from Essex She sustained fatal neck wounds and skull and brain damage, and died later in hospital. The court was told she had been attacked in the bathroom of a flat in Fairlop Avenue in Canvey, belonging to Mr Withers. On the day of the killing, Mr Withers, who described himself in police interviews as a paranoid schizophrenic, said he was briefly locked out of his flat, while Ms Pearce and Mr Ayres were inside. When he got back in he claimed to have seen Mr Ayres swinging a hammer. "I saw him hitting her with the hammer or something. I just saw him hitting like that," he told the court. Defence lawyer Oliver Saxby, QC, said: "It sounds like you weren't sure. Why did you say 'or something'?" "That's best description I could give," Mr Withers replied. He claimed he had then run from the flat to call the police. However, Mr Saxby said: "I'm suggesting that either you lost it with her, or that there was somebody else in there who was responsible for what happened." "It was Tony," Mr Withers replied. He had said early in the cross-examination: "You're trying to say I attacked Kelly. I would never attack anybody. I'm scared of Kelly." The trial continues.	A prosecution witness in the trial of a man accused of the "frenzied" murder of a woman, has been accused of carrying out the killing himself.
The neighbours entered the burning property in Milford Drive, on Sunday afternoon in an attempt to rescue two cats, police said. The occupants were not home at the time. The women had inhaled smoke and were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. The cats were unharmed. Fire destroyed the front door and caused heavy smoke damage to the house. Dorset Police said it believed the fire had been started deliberately through the cat flap in the front door of the property at about 15:00 BST. Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with CCTV to get in touch. Det Con Luke Davis said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw suspicious activity near to the property during that afternoon, particularly anyone seen in the garden or the front drive of the property just before 3pm, to please contact me. "If you have any information about the cause or motive of the fire, please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."	Two women have been rescued following a suspected arson attack on a house in Bournemouth.
Dr Barry Morgan, who has been at the head of the Church in Wales for nearly 14 years, is set to retire on 31 January - his 70th birthday. During that time he has supported numerous causes, including gay marriage and more powers for the Welsh Assembly. But he said he still believes the law introducing presumed consent for organ donation was the "wrong way". Under the law, adults are regarded as having consented to organ donation unless they have opted out. "I think what I did object to was people thinking that I was against organ donation," he said. "I wasn't against organ donation at all, I was just against the method by which they were going about it. "And I still feel that to be honest because it's much better if people voluntarily say 'we want to give organs'. That's what a gift actually means." He has also backed women clergy during his leadership and carried out the consecration of the Church in Wales' first female bishop on Saturday. "I think that was pretty important as a matter of justice, as a matter of equality and as a matter of doing what was right," he said. "That's been pretty important and I never expected a woman bishop to be elected in my time." On gay marriage, Dr Morgan has previously called for the church's view on same-sex marriage to change with popular opinion. "I haven't done that on my own. I've done that with the full support of the present bench of bishops and also with the support of the governing body," he said. "That's quite something, I think, in a church that hasn't always been known for its liberalism." He admitted attendances at church had not done "terribly well" but said he has seen church communities become "more engaged" with society than ever before. "Were it not for church people, lots of organisations would not be in existence. I'm thinking of food banks and dementia groups." His successor will be chosen in the summer. "I take the view that once you're gone, you're gone... you've had your period in office," he added. "I just want to leave the field clear. I don't want to make another public statement about issues again because that would be unfair on whoever succeeds me and I hope I can keep to that."	The Archbishop of Wales has reflected on his time at the helm of the church ahead of his retirement.
The message from David Cameron was clear - there needs to be "a big cultural change" towards sport in schools with a return to the "competitive ethos" in school sports. The prime minister said the problem was not money and suggested some teachers were not "playing their part" but what do those in grassroots sport believe are the key ingredients for success? Graeme Maw, director of sport at Millfield School, in Somerset, says every pupil at the school does a minimum of three hours of scheduled sport per week. However, many pupils at the private school, which has nine former and current pupils competing at the London Games - more than any other school - do up to 22 hours of training. There are also more than 30 different sports on offer. Mr Maw says the word "opportunity" is key. "Sport and physical activity are the heartbeat of our community," says Mr Maw. The Youth Sport Trust (YST) says it is important schools engage everyone, for example by involving young people in the selection and planning of sport and activities. Schools also need to broaden the range of lunchtime and after-hours clubs to increase opportunities for young people to take part, it says. It is an ethos Mr Maw agrees with. "Dance might not be an Olympic sport but it's something that young girls really enjoy - it's about finding and discovering individual talent in a child," he adds. Mr Cameron spoke on Wednesday of "some teachers not wanting to join in and play their part" when it came to school sports. But Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says his comments were "ill informed, unfair and fail to recognise the huge contribution that many teachers make to sports in schools". "Many teachers, not just PE staff, willingly give up their time to motivate and coach young people in a wide range of sports," he says. The YST says there must be teachers and coaches on the ground ready to support young people who show an interest in sport at primary and secondary level. Mr Cameron has said the government is investing Â£1bn in school sports over the next four years, but "the problem isn't money". David Mansfield, headteacher at Coopers' Company and Coborn School, in Essex, says investment is key. The state school was named the most sports-minded school in Europe in 2005 and Mr Mansfield says it is one of few that competes with public schools in national sport. Mr Mansfield says the school's success is down to putting extra money into sports, for example, the school employs a professional hockey coach. He describes funding as "the bottom line" and says there is a "straight-line correlation between outcomes and incomes". "If schools are not on the front foot to identify talent then we're going to see a real fall away from the fantastic job that has been done (in the past)," he says. Mr Trobe is critical of the removal of funding for the Schools Sports Partnership (SSP), a network of sports colleges in England - including the Coopers' school - that put specialist PE teachers to work with primary school pupils, linked schools with local sports clubs, brought high quality coaches into schools and promoted competitive matches. Experts say it is too early to say how this will affect school sport participation. But Mr Trobe says: "If the prime minister is serious about wanting to enhance sport in schools the funding will need to be put in place to support those very willing teachers and coaches to deliver a lasting sporting legacy." The Fields in Trust (FIT), a UK charity that protects recreational spaces, says funding is essential - but it is important not to forget about the fields themselves. "It is important to look beyond the funding when considering sporting legacy for a golden future," said Alison Moore-Gwyn, chief executive. "David Cameron has initiated this process but it is vital that other elements which nurture sporting ability are not overlooked. A fundamental one is the provision of space for people to discover and hone their talent." The charity's Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge focuses on this, says Ms Moore-Gwyn. The scheme works with landowners to protect their outdoor recreational spaces, aiming for 2,012 of them by the end of this year. The YTS says school and council facilities should also be opened up after hours. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Education Secretary Michael Gove has approved the sale of more than 20 school sports fields in the past two years. But FIT said more concerning was the situation for academies and new free schools, which are exempt from government regulations that govern mainstream schools' freedom to sell off their playing fields. There could be an unknown number of other sports pitches that have been lost, it said. "This could have serious implications for our sporting legacy," a spokeswoman said. The prime minister has called for a return to the "competitive ethos" and "getting rid of the idea all must win prizes and you can't have competitive sports days". But British Olympic Association chairman Colin Moynihan says many children do not want to play competitive sport, nor should they have to. "The key thing is to make sure that where they do want to there's the facility and the opportunity for them to do so and that's our emphasis and has been our emphasis throughout," he says. The YST adds that the first experience young people have of sport needs to be as positive as possible to encourage them to go further. This week a survey of 2,000 people by Freeview found that seven out of 10 thought Team GB athletes had replaced music stars and footballers as role models. During the Games so far many stars have served to inspire young athletes. Alan Davis, head coach at the Maindy Flyers club in Cardiff, where gold medal-winning cyclist Geraint Thomas trained until he was 16, said Thomas was "the perfect role model". "He's humble and takes his success and occasional setbacks equally well. What better example to give nine-year-old kids," he said. While Jessica Ennis's former PE teacher has said she is inspiring a new generation of athletes. Chris Eccles, who taught Miss Ennis at King Ecgbert School, Sheffield, said: "They are inspired by her because they can see someone from their own town being so successful." They have been on show throughout the Games, none more so than Chad Le Clos's father Bert who paid tribute to his "beautiful boy" after winning a swimming gold, but parents are often key to many Olympic successes. John Steele, chief executive officer at the YST, says: "For every gold medal and Olympic athlete we have had the pleasure to watch performing at the Games, there is a teacher, coach or parent that inspired them to start the journey to be their personal best." The YST says parents should encourage their children to lead active lifestyles and get them involved in sport, but parents themselves also need to be encouraged into volunteering roles in sports clubs and school sports activity. Mr Maw says it is important to find ways to celebrate sport and make it fun. Last year 2,000 of Millfield's pupils and 450 members of staff ran a total of 2,755 miles, raising Â£21,000 for Sport Relief. He says it is about "everybody having fun in the name of sport".	With Team GB celebrating their most successful Olympics for 100 years, a debate is growing about how best to build on the legacy and inspire the next generation into sport.
The money for Kingston Maurward College, near Dorchester, will go towards a £3.24m project that includes a new animal sciences building. Weymouth College has also been awarded £0.5m towards its £1.5m project to refurbish two buildings. The grants form part of a £214m investment in 47 colleges in England. Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said of the Enhanced Renewal Grant that it was to "ensure" investment in "first rate facilities". Kingston Maurward principal Clare Davison said she was "thrilled" with the grant. She said the animal science building would include aquatic, reptile and mammal rooms, a laboratory and six teaching classrooms. She added: "This building will help ensure that we continue to deliver high quality teaching and learning to give young people the appropriate skills required to gain employment in animal science-related fields." Construction is planned to start this summer and is expected to be completed by mid-summer 2014. The grants go alongside plans for the government's new skills strategy to "support the majority of good and outstanding colleges" while intervening if colleges are failing.	A further education college in Dorset has received more than £2.88m in government funding to renovate buildings on campus.
Rafael Esquivel admitted receiving bribes in connection with the sale of marketing rights to tournaments. He was among seven officials arrested at a luxury hotel in Switzerland last year. More than 40 individuals and entities have been charged under the probe. Fifa corruption crisis: Key questions answered Who are the indicted Fifa officials? Mr Esquivel - a former president of the Venezuelan Football Federation - was extradited to the US in March and had been due to stand trial with six other defendants next year. He pleaded guilty at the federal court in Brooklyn to racketeering conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud conspiracy and three counts of money laundering conspiracy. He also agreed to hand over more than $16m (Â£13m). The charges related to bribery schemes to market South American club tournament the Copa Libertadores as well as the Copa America, which features national teams. Mr Esquivel faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each charge. So far 19 people and two companies have pleaded guilty in connection with the US investigation.	A Venezuelan football official has pleaded guilty to corruption charges in the US as part of the investigation into the sport's world governing body Fifa.
They were denied a win as Andre Ayew's deflected free-kick cancelled out Kelechi Iheanacho's close-range opener. The draw leaves them three points ahead of Manchester United, whose final game, against Bournemouth, was abandoned. City's vastly superior goal difference means United would need a 19-0 win over the Cherries to take fourth place. Listen to BBC Radio 5 live commentary of the goals In many ways, Manchester City's display at the Liberty Stadium was a fitting way to end an underwhelming season that began with such promise before limping to a satisfactory but below-par conclusion. Iheanacho - the on-field embodiment of a potentially exciting future - again demonstrated his sharpness in front of goal to poke home the opening goal after a Sergio Aguero shot had been saved in the fifth minute. It was the 19-year-old's 14th goal of the season and his eighth from his first 12 shots on target in the Premier League. But he and his side failed to build on it, missing numerous chances to put the game to bed, with the young forward and his usually lethal Argentine partner Aguero particularly wasteful. It left them vulnerable to a Swansea equaliser - which came courtesy of a 25-yard Ayew free-kick that deflected in off Fernando's head - and a potentially devastating second in a tense second half for the away side. In securing a top-four finish, Pellegrini has achieved the very minimum required of him before handing over to Pep Guardiola this summer, but it does not mask the failings of the Chilean's final campaign. Despite winning the League Cup for a second time in three years and going further in the Champions League than ever before, City's expensively assembled squad have underachieved in the league. Their haul of 66 points is their lowest in the top-flight since the 2008-09 season - the first under Sheikh Mansour's ownership. Pellegrini leaves the Etihad with a league title to his name, the best win percentage of any Premier League manager barring Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho and as the only City boss to have never finished below United. But after starting so strongly, his reign has limped to its conclusion with a squad in need of an overhaul. Media playback is not supported on this device In their previous two matches, Swansea had ended the top-four hopes of both Liverpool and West Ham. Despite resting goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, captain Ashley Williams and top scorer Gylfi Sigurdsson and being without Ki Sung-yueng because of his military service in South Korea, boss Francesco Guidolin came close to making it a hat-trick. Since the Italian joined the club in January, the Swans have improved significantly, losing only five of his 16 matches in charge. And they once again demonstrated their newly acquired stubbornness to extend their unbeaten home run to five games, during which they have conceded just twice. Having tied Guidolin down to a two-year deal this week, the Swans will be optimistic of building on this next season and avoiding the kind of poor form that prompted his arrival. Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin: "I am happy because the moment was not simple in January [when he took over]. Now we have a comfortable position in the table. I am happy. I am proud. My players deserve this position because we have a good team." "It was a good performance, a good result, against in my opinion he best team in the Premier League in terms of quality, a lot of big, big players. And the game was good, we played well. "I am happy, now. Only this for us and our players. This is a good memory." Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini to BBC Sport: "I wanted to win the Premier League this season, but the atmosphere from February when the club announced the new manager was maybe not the best atmosphere. Media playback is not supported on this device "We lost two important games at home when we were three points behind the leaders. "The only option we had today was that we needed to get the point to get Champions League for next year." Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart, speaking to BBC Sport: "It is not what we set out to do at the start of the season but we will have to take it (fourth place). "It was strange day, getting the job done, barring a  mathematical freak, we have Champions League football next season. "At the start of the season, well into this season  we were well in the title race, but we let ourselves down, we will take positives of a trophy and semi-final of the Champions League, which was history for our club and we have Champions League next year and we have to take that. "I have enjoyed our time under Manuel, it was important we finished off a good three years working with him." Match ends, Swansea City 1, Manchester City 1.

I cannot see these women but I hear them fighting to reach the mobile phone that belongs to the inmate that I am on the phone with. Thangavelu Sarojini, a young Tamil woman, says she was tortured by her employer. "I still have wounds and scars in my hands, neck, legs. They beat me, pinched me and burnt me," she says from the Olaya detention camp where hundreds of migrant women from south and southeast Asia are held. Their crime, they say, was running away from employers to escape physical, sexual or psychological abuse. They are all now classified as illegal immigrants under Saudi law. "I was not paid for one-and-a-half years, they tried to kill me, then I fled to the embassy," Sarojini tells me. Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan women arrive in the Middle East every year and they are a major foreign revenue earner for the island.  But many claim to be ill-treated, tortured, or not paid for the work. In one notorious case in August 2010, 24 nails were removed from the body of LP Ariyawathie, a 49-year-old Sri Lankan domestic worker in Saudi.  Saudi authorities have pledged to investigate her case but there has been no reported progress in the investigation. But it is not only physical abuse that forced these hapless women to flee their employers. Kusuma Nandani, a mother-of-two who has not returned to Sri Lanka since 1993, says she was not paid by her employer for at least 15 years. She says that she suffered stress and depression because her employers did not allow her to keep in touch with her husband, son and daughter in Sri Lanka. As Kusuma Nandani cannot read or write, she was was only able to write a few letters - and then only with the help of other Sri Lankans. One day, she was told by the employer that she would not be paid anymore after she forgot to hand over pocket money to the children before dropping them off at school. From then, she says she was imprisoned by her employers for more than a decade. Rescued by the Sri Lankan embassy officials in Riyadh in 2009 after a tip-off, she has been a detainee at the camp since then. Her daughter says she is puzzled as to why the Sri Lankan embassy authorities have not been able to send her mother home even though Kusuma was granted an exit visa some time ago. WG Mala Mangalika is another maid who fled alleged ill-treatment. She says she was told to work without pay for more than a year because her employer paid a Sri Lankan agency nearly 7,000 riyal ($1,866). Now she is facing a lawsuit filed by the employer. "The employer says he has paid to the agency for four years so he would not allow me to go back," says Mala Mangalika. Detention centre inmates say that although Sri Lankan officials helped when they first arrived at the embassy, they are concerned about the delay in sending them back home. Apart from those in the camp, hundreds more abused maids are currently staying in an embassy hostel. Their plight is worsened because they become illegal immigrants as soon as they leave their employers, the legal "sponsor" for their work permits. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has long been campaigning for more protection for domestic workers in the Middle East and has called for migrant domestic workers to be included into local labour laws so that they are better protected. "My legs are still swollen and blackened after I fell from upstairs," Mala Senananayake weeps as she grabs the phone from others in the queue in Olaya camp, in Saudi Arabia. "I have no one in Sri Lanka. My parents are gone, my husband is trying to divorce me, I have only daughter who doesn't know who to approach to get help." "Please sir, please help me to go back to Sri Lanka," she repeatedly begs me. The labour officer at the Sri Lankan embassy in Riyadh told the BBC that the files of the detainees at Olaya camp have been transferred to the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) in Colombo. But SLFEB head Kingsley Ranawaka did not answer repeated telephone calls to get a response. In an open letter to the governments of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, HRW urged them to  "ensure a timely and comprehensive response" to alleged abuse and implement "systemic reforms to prevent such abuses in future". It has urged Saudi Arabia to "prosecute alleged perpetrators, allow victims to return to their home countries before the trial and seek both criminal penalties and financial compensation". It also wants the cancellation of the Kafala system that requires the consent of the employer to repatriate migrant workers. The BBC has had no response from the media office of the embassy of Saudi Arabia in London.	"Please, sir... help us to go back to Sri Lanka," one woman after another cries and pleads over the phone from a detention centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Pupils aged 11 will be expected to know their tables up to 12x12, and will be tested using an "on-screen check". The checks will be piloted to about 3,000 pupils in 80 primary schools this summer, before being rolled out across the country in 2017. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said maths was a non-negotiable aspect of a good education. The "on-screen check" examination will involve children completing multiplication challenges against the clock, which will be scored instantly. The Department for Education says it is the first use of on-screen technology in National Curriculum tests. Ms Morgan has also said teachers will be judged by the results of the tests: "Since 2010, we've seen record numbers of 11 year olds start secondary school with a good grasp of the three Rs. But some continue to struggle. "That is why, as part of our commitment to extend opportunity and deliver educational excellence everywhere we are introducing a new check to ensure that all pupils know their times tables by age 11. "They will help teachers recognise those pupils at risk of falling behind and allow us to target those areas where children aren't being given a fair shot to succeed." In 2015, 80% of Year 6 pupils achieved Level 4 in maths, reading and writing, up from 78% last year. But Labour says standards are being threatened by a shortage of teachers, and in the past some teaching unions have warned additional tests can place unwelcome pressure on teachers and pupils.	Every pupil in England will be tested on their times tables before leaving primary school, under government plans.
Media playback is not supported on this device Three people who know Armstrong well gave their thoughts. The wife of former professional road cyclist Frankie Andreu, she claimed, long before his public confession, that Armstrong took banned substances and bullied team-mates. "When the going gets tough, he turns on the charm. He thinks if he can show he's a changed man it might benefit him. The problem with that is that he has no credibility. His actions speak louder than his words." Andreu believes there should be no way back into cycling for Armstrong. "He should forget it. He's not going back into sport. He should go and enjoy something else, enjoy his family. Everyone deserves a second chance, but how many does he want? What is he? A cat." The Sunday Times journalist first raised questions about Armstrong in 1999. He wrote LA Confidential, a book containing evidence that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. "When I see an interview like he's just done with Dan Roan, I just feel this guy hasn't changed one iota. When he's saying everyone was doing it (doping), he's being so unfair to the people who rode the 1999 Tour de France and tours over the following years clean - and plenty did." Walsh believes Armstrong is struggling with being out of the limelight. "This is a guy who would get called up by he president of the United States and asked to go on a mountain bike ride, this is a guy who had direct access to people like Bill Clinton and John Kerry... Bono was a big mate of his. Now, no-one really wants to be associated with him - and that's tough if you were once in the place that Lance Armstrong was in." A former French road cyclist, his career effectively ended when he spoke out against doping in the 1990s. "The fact that he says that he doesn't regret it and that if he went back to the same time, he'd do it again... I think that shows an honesty." Bassons, who clashed with Armstrong after making his doping claims, also thinks the American has changed - or been changed. "When I saw him last year, it wasn't the Armstrong that I knew in the '90s any more. Back then, he was strong, he was hard, he would stare you in the eyes, he was brutal, he was strong and he would never make a mistake. But when I saw him last year, he was alone, he was badly dressed, he avoided eye contact, he didn't seem happy."	In an interview with BBC Sports editor Dan Roan, shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong said he should be forgiven for doping and lying - but also admitted he would probably cheat again.
Police said the rockets had landed in open areas, without causing damage or injury. The Israeli military said they were fired from Sinai in Egypt. Warning sirens went off just before the rockets hit. The city's airport has been closed and security tightened. Eilat, a popular tourist destination on the Red Sea, has previously been hit by rockets fired by militants in neighbouring Egypt and Jordan. The Egyptian military said it was investigating the incident. Hours after the attack, a small militant Salafi group, the Mujahedeen Shura Council, said it had fired two Grad rockets at "occupied Eilat", in a statement carried on jihadist websites. About 50,000 people live in Eilat, and tens of thousands of holidaymakers visit every year. The Israeli military said an Iron Dome anti-rocket battery - designed to intercept short-range missiles - which was positioned near Eilat earlier this month was not deployed in the latest attack. There were several rocket attacks on the city last year, though no injuries were caused. Most of the rockets were fired from Sinai, which has become increasingly lawless since the revolution which toppled former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Islamic militant groups have grown in strength there and have used it as a base from which to target Israel across the lengthy shared border.	At least two rockets have hit the southern Israeli city of Eilat.
Shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz joked that cries of "Don't panic! Don't panic!" were being heard around 10 Downing Street as the government tries to organise its policies on Brexit. Commons Leader David Lidington speculated that his Labour opposition "don't like it up 'em'". Mr Perry, who also created sitcom Hi-de-Hi, died on Sunday aged 93. During the business statement, Ms Vaz said she grew up watching Dad's Army, adding: "It struck me that you could hear those catchphrases ringing around Number 10, so we hear the cry of 'Don't panic! Don't panic!' "Or as the Prime Minister slaps down her recalcitrant and wayward colleagues you can hear her muttering 'stupid boys'. "When you ask their position on Brexit, the infamous 'don't tell 'em Pike!'." Mr Perry worked with the late producer David Croft and the pair were also responsible for It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi and You Rang M'Lord? Commons Leader David Lidington also paid tribute to Mr Perry, who often wrote the theme tunes to his shows. He said: "I thought it was a wonderful gesture when outside Buckingham Palace earlier this week the military band in the changing of the guards ceremony played the theme tune to Dad's Army as a tribute. "But I do think when I look across at the Opposition, in particular when I look at their faces during Prime Minister's Questions, the phrase that comes into my mind is 'they don't like it up 'em'." The SNP's Commons leader Pete Wishart also chipped in, saying: "I would hate to say that we are all doomed but perhaps we are under this particular Government." TV references also came up in the Commons on Wednesday at Prime Minister's Questions when Jeremy Corbyn likened Theresa May's plan for the UK leaving the UK as one of Baldrick's "cunning plans" from the Blackadder series.	MPs have paid tribute to Dad's Army creator Jimmy Perry, using his show's famous catchphrases in the Commons.
Japan's shares rose despite a central bank survey showing firms expect inflation to rise 1.4% a year from now, casting doubts on the bank's pledge to hit 2% this fiscal year. The Nikkei 225 ended up 1.5% at 19,312.79, leading the region's gains. That is its biggest daily percentage gain since 12 February. Investors are also awaiting key jobs figures from the US on Friday. Concerns over the health of the world's largest economy were raised after data on Wednesday showed the pace of US manufacturing growth in March eased to its slowest in nearly two years. The dollar remained under pressure, buying 119.62 yen. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.4% higher at 3,825.78, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended up 0.8% at 25,275.64. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 closed up 0.7% at 5,898.6 as bank stocks were boosted on growing expectations of an interest rate cut by the central bank next week. A private survey also showed that inflation rose from a five-year trough in March as petrol prices rebounded. The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute's monthly measure of consumer prices rose 0.4% in March, from February when it had been unchanged. The annual pace was up to 1.5%, from 1.3%, but stayed well below the central bank's target band of 2% to 3%. The Australian market will be closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday. South Korean shares closed flat after data showed the country's seasonally-adjusted current account surplus in February at a record high for the second consecutive month. Exports in February rose by 2% from January while imports fell 0.4%. The benchmark Kospi index was at 2,029.07.	Asian shares rose on Thursday despite investors being cautious ahead of a Good Friday public holiday in some major markets.
Officers had spent the day in Dumbarton Road in Brixton, having been alerted at 06:20 GMT to a man "in possession of what looked like a firearm". Residents from two blocks of flats were evacuated but have since been allowed home. The man, in his 40s, was arrested on suspicion of having an imitation gun at about 17:15 GMT, police said.	A man has been arrested following an 11-hour stand-off with armed police in south London.
French striker Moussa Dembele, 20, has made an instant impact this season with 12 goals for the Scottish champions. But the latest Dembele - no relation - came on for the final nine minutes of Celtic Under-20s' win against Hearts. He replaced Jack Aitchison, 16, who became Celtic's youngest-ever player in the final game of last season. Aitchison scored with his first touch after coming on as a substitute aged 16 years and 71 days in their 7-0 rout of Motherwell in May. But Ivorian Dembele could challenge that record after appearing for the club's reserve team, which is seven years above his age group. Dembele went viral with a series of tricks playing for Celtic's U13s at the St Kevin's Boys Academy Cup tournament in Dublin this summer. Celtic's website said Dembele "didn't look out of place" after being given his chance on Monday at Greenock Morton's Cappielow ground, with six of their usual squad away on Scotland U19s duty. The 15-year-old Kieran McGrath also played. Celtic's head of youth, Chris McCart, added: "We were all delighted to see Karamoko make his debut for the development squad against Hearts in what proved to be an entertaining game. "The fact that he was playing against other players seven years his senior gives an indication of the quality this young boy possesses and it was also fitting that he came on for Jack Aitchison, the club's youngest-ever goalscorer. "What we need to remember, though, is that Karamoko is just 13 years old. He was given a chance to play last night on merit, as was Kieran, but it is very important that we continue their development at a measured pace. "Karamoko is still a young boy and has a lot of growing to do, both physically and mentally. "The coaches at our under-13 and 14 levels have been fantastic in nurturing his potential, but it is crucial that we do not push him too far, too soon. "He has a lot of hard work ahead of him to make it to the top and we won't rush that, but we also know Karamoko, and the other talented young players we have here, is at the perfect place to continue his progress and we look forward to seeing what the future holds for this young player."	Celtic fans may soon have a new Dembele to savour after 13-year-old Karamoko Dembele made his debut for the club's development team on Monday.
James Vaughan claimed a 16th-minute opener for the Shakers before strike partner Tom Pope doubled their lead on 40 minutes. Stuart Beavon pulled one back for rock-bottom Coventry with a 65th-minute header but despite some late pressure, the Sky Blues could not avoid a seventh defeat from nine in the league. Bury, meanwhile, are now four points above the bottom four after taking 13 points from 15, with three straight wins since Lee Clark took charge. Coventry keeper Lee Burge had to deny Paul Caddis and Vaughan before the latter showed neat footwork to beat two defenders and sidefoot into the bottom corner. The visitors replied with Charles Vernam and Callum Reilly going close, before Pope latched onto a Callum Styles through-ball to slot home and double the home side's lead. Burge made a point-blank save from Pope just after the break, but Reilly and Vernam both fired wide before Beavon gave the visitors a lifeline, scoring from a left-wing cross by half-time substitute Ryan Haynes. Burge then kept out a Taylor Moore header but Bury keeper Joe Murphy pulled off two fine saves to deny Kevin Foley and Reilly an equaliser. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Phil Smith, chief executive of IT company Cisco, likened the situation to not having access to water or a road and said businesses would not be able to survive without it. He said a fast internet connection was vital to a country like Wales with a "complex landscape". The Welsh government insisted Wales was leading the way with broadband. Ministers and BT are currently delivering the scheme Superfast Cymru, which will give people access to fibre broadband. Earlier this year a Superfast Cymru spokesman said more than 80% of properties in Wales had access to the superfast broadband. But, speaking to BBC Wales at technology conference Digital 2016 in Newport, Mr Smith said: "I'm very surprised that broadband hasn't got to the level of penetration it should. "To be honest it's like saying you don't have a road now, or you don't have water. "Companies, countries and individuals can't survive without broadband, it's not some optional nice thing to have, this is the way business is done. "A country like Wales, it's got a wide population and complex landscape, it needs people to be on video, to engage anywhere in the world at any time. "I think it's really important that the government and industry push hard to get broadband to the highest level everywhere." A Welsh Government spokesman said an Ofcom report in August showed Wales was leading the way among the UK's devolved nations with the availability of superfast broadband. "The Superfast Cymru programme has already made superfast broadband speeds in excess of 24Mbps available to more than 581,000 Welsh homes and businesses, including in some very rural areas, and more premises will have access as the rollout continues," he added. "We are committed to making Wales a truly digital nation and continue to support businesses to take advantage of broadband technology which will help them to grow, to boost Wales' economic prosperity and create jobs."	A high profile figure in the world of technology has criticised poor broadband in parts of Wales.
Toulon's Halfpenny, 26, ruptured anterior cruciate knee ligaments during Wales' 23-19 win over Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. Scrum-half Rhys Webb, also 26, suffered an ankle injury in the match, but there is no news yet on the extent of the damage. Halfpenny's likely replacement at full-back, Liam Williams, has not played since having foot surgery in June. The other two full-backs in Wales' 31-man squad - Bristol's Matthew Morgan and Dragons' Hallam Amos - have six caps between them. Halfpenny has scored 508 points in 62 appearances for Wales. The Welsh Rugby Union has not said who will replace Halfpenny. Wales start their World Cup campaign against Uruguay in Cardiff on 20 September, before playing co-hosts England, Fiji and Australia their remaining Pool A matches. Former Wales Shane Williams has questioned coach Warren Gatland's decision to select Halfpenny against Italy. Halfpenny started the game with strapping on his right leg, suggesting he was already carrying an injury. Record Wales try-scorer Williams said the victory over Italy was "just horrendous for Wales". "Webb has been the form player for Wales and to lose Halfpenny as well, it's just a massive blow," he said. "You kind of thought 'do we need Halfpenny on the field? Let's wrap him up in cotton wool and roll him out when we really need him'. "Wales is in mourning already. Especially with Halfpenny, he was strapped up on his leg anyway."

The money is owed by absent parents who have been referred to the Child Support Agency. Accounts prepared for Parliament by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) class £2.9bn of the £3.9bn in maintenance arrears as "uncollectable". Ministers said the focus was on debts for children still being brought up, but old debts would not be "forgotten". The Child Support Agency (CSA) was set up 21 years ago with the aim of ensuring that if a relationship broke down, a parent could not just walk off and leave an ex to pay the costs of bringing up their children. The CSA's role was to calculate maintenance - and ensure that non-resident parents paid up. But it has been dogged with problems. Computer systems did not work properly. Mistakes were made with assessments and absent parents were not tracked down. In 2012, a new child maintenance system was introduced in an effort to draw a line under the CSA's difficulties. The Child Maintenance Service, as the new system is called, does not consider recovering the historic debts on the CSA's books as a priority. Around 1.3 million single parents are owed money the CSA ruled they were entitled to - and some have been waiting years. One single parent, Marianne Miles from London, said she badly needed the money the CSA ordered her ex-partner to pay towards their son. But after nearly seven years of waiting for payment, she has all but given up. "I am not hopeful of seeing any of that money to be perfectly honest," she said. "They [the CSA] haven't made much effort to get anything - even £30 a week - so I have practically written off all of it." In 2008, Marianne Miles, from London, was made redundant from her job as a publicist. Raising her teenage son alone became a severe financial struggle. She turned to the CSA, which ordered her ex-partner to contribute. To this day, she still has not received the money owed, which has built up to a total of £12,000. "I try not to get angry about it, but it's not fair," she said. "If he owed the government council tax money, or for a parking ticket, they would pursue it and make sure it was paid. But when it's paying maintenance towards your own child, it is not deemed as important." Her son is now 20 and has left home, but Marianne is still responsible for him financially. "Just because he didn't have it before doesn't mean he doesn't need it now," she said. "It would make a huge difference. "He's a student so it could go towards his books and his food, that I have to support, and he's learning how to drive. I'm the only person around to help him." Janet Allbeson, from the single-parent charity Gingerbread, believes the government should be recovering unpaid maintenance, even in cases that have been going on for years. She said: "If they do manage to get the money, even if it is years late, it can really make a difference to a child's life. "It allows, for instance, to help with the cost of going to college, perhaps paying off a student loan, or helping a child learn to drive. "Children in some ways get more expensive as they get older and that money can make a real difference to a child's future." The government said it was prioritising cases where a child was still being brought up. Steve Webb, the minister with responsibility for child maintenance, said: "We are quite clear that just because money has been owed for a long time it does not mean it should be forgotten about. It should be paid. "Of course everything cannot be a priority. We have been quite transparent… and we have made it clear that where there is a child still at school or being brought up - that is the first priority. "But we are not writing off or ignoring old debt." But figures in DWP accounts published in December raise questions about how much of the arrears backlog is likely to be recovered. The £2.9bn listed as "uncollectable" relates to cases where either no payment has been received from the absent parent in the previous six months, or no arrears schedule has been put in place. The DWP said the definition of "uncollectable" in the accounts did not give a true picture of the level of debt that is beyond its enforcement powers - and in fact only £244m was permanently "uncollectable". This report will be broadcast on Sunday, 25 January 2015 at 11:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live. You can listen to other editions of 5 live Investigates on the BBC iPlayer.

Billions of pounds owed in child maintenance may never be recovered, government accounts show.
Crickhowell High School approached Powys council offering to manage the town's library to benefit pupils and the community. It would mean the service can meet its local savings target. The library would stay in its Silver Street location, and the council said the handover would be seamless with no disruption to the public.	A Powys high school has offered to take over a town library to secure its future.
It follows the first formal talks since Carwyn Jones and Leanne Wood were tied 29-29 in a Senedd vote on Wednesday. The aim was to form a minority Labour administration rather than a coalition, a joint statement on Friday said. "We are confident that we can find a way forward that will result in the successful nomination of a First Minister next week," it said. "We will continue to work over the weekend, and look to resume formal talks on Monday." The Conservatives and UKIP, had joined Plaid Cymru in backing Ms Wood in the vote for first minister, with Labour and the sole Liberal Democrat, Kirsty Williams, backing Mr Jones. Jane Hutt represented Labour and Simon Thomas Plaid Cymru in Friday's talks, which took place at Welsh Government offices in Cardiff Bay, with neither party leader attending. Labour fell short of a majority at the 5 May election and needs opposition support to govern. Plaid Cymru AMs insist they did not do a deal with other parties before the tied vote on Wednesday. Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies told BBC Radio Wales on Friday there had been three sets of "substantial" talks involving two AMs from his party and two AMs from Plaid. But he later released a statement suggesting the Tories would drop their backing for Ms Wood if a deal with Plaid was not forthcoming. "We have an historic opportunity to break the mould in Wales... but this will only be possible with clear enthusiasm from others," he said. "Should such ambition not be shown... Welsh Conservatives will not be minded to repeat our action from Wednesday's vote." UKIP assembly group leader Neil Hamilton said the average Plaid voter did not back the party to see it "effectively" go into coalition with Labour. "We are all in favour of talks, but minority parties should stick together against Labour arrogance," he said. On Thursday, some UKIP AMs suggested they could switch their votes if parts of their manifesto were made law, although Mr Gething said for Labour: "That is not something we would consider." Meanwhile, Labour and the Lib Dems confirmed talks were continuing between their parties. BBC Wales understands Mr Jones has discussed appointing Ms Williams as a cabinet minister, but neither party would confirm any details of the talks. Even with Ms Williams on board, Labour would still need an arrangement with another party to secure Mr Jones's re-election as first minister. At the assembly election Labour won 29 seats, Plaid Cymru 12, the Conservatives 11, UKIP seven and the Liberal Democrats one. AMs have until 1 June to nominate a first minister or face another election. Former first minister Rhodri Morgan has suggested Welsh Labour could learn lessons from the SNP in the way the two parties reacted to last week's elections. Nicola Sturgeon's SNP was two seats short of a majority in the Scottish Parliament, with Welsh Labour winning 29 of the 60 seats in the Senedd. Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru's O'r Bae programme Mr Morgan said: "Nicola Sturgeon was saying this is the third victory in a row that we've had in Scotland. "So you create a psychology, so that everyone expects that you will master, you will govern, and that nobody can ask a question about what the way forward is. "Now Labour was saying, no, don't rejoice, don't claim that we've won, because we haven't. "Technically Nicola Sturgeon hadn't either, but she had created the psychology of expectation."	Labour and Plaid Cymru say they are "confident" of breaking the deadlock over the election of a first minister.
They join rugby star Mike Tindall, who's married to the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Tindall. The first series - in which stars compete in winter sports - saw injuries. Two finalists, Sir Steve Redgrave and comic Marcus Brigstocke, retired hurt. Sally Bercow, married to MP John Bercow, has been on Celebrity Big Brother, as well as appearing in a Channel 5 series with Paddy Doherty. Ola Jordan partnered TV wildlife expert Steve Backshall in the latest series of Strictly, but was voted off the show in November. Also in the line-up are Jackass star Steve-O, ex-JLS star JB Gill, Sir Paul McCartney's ex-wife Heather Mills and choreographer and ex-Dancing On Ice judge Louie Spence. Former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! contestants Phil Tufnell, Ashley Roberts, Joey Essex and Stacey Solomon will all be on the show. Completing the line-up are Paralympian Jon-Allan Butterworth, socialite Lady Victoria Hervey, heptathlete Louise Hazel and Made In Chelsea star Louise Thompson. Steve-O and Lady Victoria Hervey both appeared on ITV reality show Love Island in 2006. The 16 contestants have already begun training for events including bobsleigh, slalom and ski cross. The fastest racers in a skeleton bobsleigh will directly qualifying for the final stages, while others will have to perform a live ski jump to progress. Those who jump the shortest distances will be put on a subs' bench to replace any casualties. Last year's winner, Joe McElderry, was drafted in after too many competitors were injured. Socialite Henry Conway broke a bone in his hand and Melinda Messenger withdrew with concussion suffered on the bobsleigh track. Past British Winter Olympic stars Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards, Graham Bell, Amy Williams and Jenny Jones will be among the experts on hand for the show, which will be shown on TV early next year.

The BBC, in collaboration with tech company This Place, has developed a way people can select programmes using a cheap, brainwave-reading headset. The headset works with an experimental version of the BBC's iPlayer on-demand platform. Users can turn on and operate the app by concentrating or relaxing their minds. "It's an internal prototype designed to give our programme makers, technologists and other users an idea of how this technology might be used in future," said Cyrus Saihan, head of business development for the BBC's Digital division. In the first trial, 10 BBC staff tried out the app and were able to launch iPlayer and start viewing a programme via the headset, he said. "It was much easier for some than it was for others, but they all managed to get it to work," said Mr Saihan. This type of technology could be used to help people with a broad range of disabilities who cannot use traditional TV remote controls very easily, Mr Saihan believes. Manipulating electronic devices using brainwaves is becoming more widespread. For example, in February technology firm Tekever demonstrated how a drone could be remotely controlled using brainpower alone. The pilot controlled the aircraft wearing a skullcap embedded with electronic sensors that could read his brain activity. You can watch a video about the iPlayer mind control project here.	If you think controlling your TV with your mind is the stuff of science fiction, think again.
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has pledged â‚¬50m (Â£42m) in funds for rebuilding. At least 268 people are now known to have died and 400 were injured. Teams have continued to search the rubble of toppled buildings for a second night. However, hundreds of aftershocks have hampered the efforts of the 5,000 rescuers. Another magnitude-4.7 tremor struck early on Friday. In addition to the funds, Mr Renzi cancelled taxes for residents and announced a new initiative, "Italian Homes", to tackle criticism over shoddy construction. But he also said that it was "absurd" to think that Italy could build completely quake-proof buildings. It follows criticism in the Italian press over building standards in high-risk areas. Some of the buildings that collapsed had recently been renovated. Historic towns do not have to conform to anti-quake building regulations, which are also often not applied when new buildings are put up. The 6.2-magnitude quake hit in the early hours of Wednesday, 100km (65 miles) north-east of Rome in mountainous central Italy. The worst affected towns - Amatrice, Arquata, Accumoli and Pescara del Tronto - are usually sparsely populated but have been swelled by tourists visiting for summer, making estimates for the precise number missing difficult. More than 200 people died in Amatrice alone. At least three Britons died in the quake, a local official in Amatrice told the BBC. The Romanian government said 11 of its citizens were missing. Bodies are still being found in the town, including one discovered in the rubble of the Hotel Roma in the city late on Thursday. An official with the fire department, Lorenzo Botti, admitted they were facing a race against time. "The chances of finding people alive in these conditions, in this type of setting, well, it's challenging," he said. But other rescuers said there was still hope, noting that one survivor was pulled from ruins in L'Aquila in 2009 three days after an earthquake that killed more than 300 people. Search teams have asked locals to disable their wi-fi passwords to help rescue workers communicate more effectively. Police have also arrested a man for attempting to break into and loot an empty home in the town, Ansa reported.	Italy has declared a state of emergency in the regions worst hit by Wednesday's earthquake as hopes of finding more survivors fade.
The end-of-season event gets under way on Sunday, with more than 250,000 spectators expected across eight days. Security is under review but the same measures are in place as last year, when the venue was on high alert. Jamie Murray opens play at the O2 Arena alongside doubles partner John Peers at 12:00 GMT on Sunday. "It's obviously a terrible thing that's happened," said Murray. "It's affected so many people and I guess there are a lot of shockwaves around the world that something like that can happen." At least 128 people were killed in attacks carried out by eight gunmen and suicide bombers in the French capital. Mahut, 33, and Herbert, 24, are making their debuts at the season finale for the best eight teams in the world. They will play Croatia's Ivan Dodig and Brazilian Marcelo Melo in their opening match at 18:00 on Monday, and hope to reflect events in their home country. "We are discussing with the ATP to do something, at least to wear something on the shirt," said Mahut, who lives in Paris. "We didn't talk with the other players but I'm sure they will do something. That is the only thing we can do and have a thought for the families, and let the politicians do what they have to do." The ATP confirmed "enhanced security" is in place and preparations continue as normal, reminding spectators that bag searches will be in place and no food or drink can be taken into the O2 Arena. The French pair watched events unfold on television in London and Herbert said they were "still in shock" on Saturday. "Right now are thoughts are with the victims, the families and the guys fighting to get peace and Paris secure again," he said. Having confirmed that his friends and family - who live in Strasbourg - were safe, he added: "I'm one of the lucky people, but it doesn't matter because I feel really, really touched by what is happening  right now in France. "When it happens in your country I think the feeling is even worse. I mean, I'm scared right now. "Yesterday we were quite happy, it's the first time for us here working in a kind of euphoria, and then you get a message, a call, and from one second to the other you're scared, you feel bad about what happened in France. "Right now it's tough to realise because I think we're still in shock and afraid of what's happening." While the pair still plan to play in London, Mahut said "tennis comes second now" after confirming his friends and family were also safe. He said: "Of course we were scared but I think that's what they want. "It's not easy to talk about what happened right now. I just talked to the family and friends - I had some friends who were having dinner in the Bataclan area last night. "At this moment we should be having fun playing the World Tour finals but today it's really complicated for us." The World Tour Finals is the season finale for both singles and doubles, with world number one Novak Djokovic taking on Japan's Kei Nishikori at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, followed by Roger Federer against Tomas Berdych at 20:00.	French duo Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert plan to pay tribute to victims of the Paris attacks during the ATP World Tour Finals in London.
The Carneddau Landscape Partnership has been awarded £198,700 Heritage Lottery funding to help it manage the natural and cultural heritage of the area. It claims the mountains' archaeology, ecology, peatland and Bronze Age cairns are among the things "under threat". Funding has also been set aside to improve the heritage of Holy Island, off Anglesey. The initial funding approval for the Carneddau Landscape Partnership means the seven-year project can now seek the full £1.9m grant. The project, led by Snowdonia National Park Authority, will cover 81 sq miles (210 sq km) which features Carnedd Llywelyn as its highest peak. Jonathan Cawley, the national park authority's director of planning and land management, said: "We are truly excited about working on such an important project which will be of enormous benefit to the local communities and to the natural and cultural heritage of the mountains." Of the funding set aside to improve Holy Island, Anglesey council has been awarded £117,200 to develop plans on behalf of the Tir a Mor Landscape Partnership. The plans will be presented to the Heritage Lottery Fund at a later date to seek final approval for the full £1.2m grant. They include projects which celebrate Holy Island's culture and landscape, involving people who live and work there. Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, said: "Heritage Lottery Fund money works hard to ensure all of our important heritage is looked after. "But it's not all about grand old buildings, castles and museums. There is natural heritage all around us, especially here in Wales, which is vital to our economy, our livelihoods and our wellbeing."	Plans aimed at preserving the heritage of mountains in Snowdonia deemed "at risk" have taken a step forward.
The Queen's Park Rangers player made his NI debut in March and scored in his second game against Slovenia. Washington, a postman just four years ago, followed that up with another goal against Belarus on Saturday. "The last few months have been a crazy time and I don't think it has sunk in yet. I know I have been fortunate," said the 24-year-old. "Football can be about being in the right place at the right time, and I have been lucky. "Maybe in a couple of years I will look back and realise how mad it has all been." Washington  combined representing non-League St Ives between 2010 and 2012 with a job delivering mail. Having averaged more than a goal-a-game in his 50 appearances for a club in the ninth tier, he then got his break with Newport who paid £5,000 for him. The Welsh club were promoted to the Football League in his first season, although Washington barely featured. He then moved to Peterborough in 2014 and by mid-January of this year, when QPR took him from London Road, Washington had scored 15 goals and aroused the interest of Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill. Washington had only been to the country once before his international bow against Wales in March but he qualified through the grandparent rule. "It was nice to be accepted so quickly and so readily with Northern Ireland," he added. "Life doesn't get much better. I'm proud of my achievements and just have to try to enjoy it."	Northern Ireland striker Conor Washington counts himself a lucky man as he prepares to head to Euro 2016.
The 48-year-old former Arsenal goalkeeper played for the Royals for four years. He was appointed youth academy director in 2000 and has been director of football since 2003. A West Brom statement said: "He played a key role in the Championship club twice winning promotion to the Premier League in 2006 and 2012."	West Brom have appointed Nicky Hammond as technical director, ending his 20-year association with Reading.

Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of heavy construction equipment. The firm has operations in Larne, Newtownabbey and west Belfast. Caterpillar's Northern Ireland business employs 1,800 people and mainly makes diesel generators. The firm has been hit by a global downturn in mining and oil exploration which has reduced demand for its products. It is understood that the company may announce cuts across its global operations beyond Northern Ireland. It has already axed thousands of jobs worldwide since last year as part of a major restructuring programme. Since 2011 it has shed more than 1,000 posts in Northern Ireland and moved some work to factories in China. It is understood night-shifts have been cancelled, with staff told to expect official news on Thursday. Caterpillar refused to comment on any jobs announcement yesterday. But a spokesman added:  "Caterpillar is committed to communicating regularly and directly with our employees about the business environment and any resulting changes". Sinn FÃ©in MP for West Belfast Paul Maskey said yesterday: "Uncertainty over the future of Caterpillar's operations in the north will be no doubt distressing for workers and their families." "It is vitally important that management keep all employees up to date with the latest information as soon as possible," he added. The American company bought FG Wilson in 1999. There have been significant manufacturing job losses in Northern Ireland over the past year, including Michelin, JTI Gallahers and Bombardier.	Workers in Northern Ireland factories operated by US firm Caterpillar will be given details of job cuts later.
The move would also ease the "growing burden" on politicians in Cardiff Bay as more power is devolved, the group's Wales director Martin Warren said. Peers serving in the UK cabinet have set the precedent, he added. Parties in the assembly have questioned the idea on the grounds of democracy and accountability. The accountants' organisation said scrutiny of Welsh legislation was suffering due to "significant workloads for politicians shifting from Westminster to Cardiff Bay". If it proved difficult to increase the number of AMs from the present 60, a bigger role could be given to the 40 MPs from Wales as their role in Parliament diminished, Mr Warren said. He suggested letting the first minister appoint MPs to the Welsh cabinet, or inviting MPs to serve on assembly committees, in both cases reducing the demands on the time of politicians in Cardiff Bay. Another idea put forward was the creation of a non-political body of professionals who could advise on and scrutinise policy. "Wales is a small country with limited resources and making best use of those resources within a democratic framework to achieve for Wales must surely be an objective that crosses all political borders," said Mr Warren. Dr Rebecca Rumbul, politics lecturer at the Centre for Lifelong Learning at Cardiff University, said involving MPs in assembly business might be "confusing" to voters. Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black was also doubtful, claiming MPs "won't be able to do either job properly". Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "After 17 years of the same old, tired ideas in a Labour-run Wales, our country needs a change. "May's election is the chance to choose the Welsh Conservatives and secure new ministers, fresh ideas and a brighter future." For Plaid Cymru, former presiding officer Lord Elis-Thomas said it was "a completely anti-democratic idea". "The notion that people could come down to Cardiff, turn up and be ministers without having been elected takes us back to a pre-democratic period, and certainly before the assembly was in existence," he told BBC Radio Cymru. "If anyone is suggesting something like this, we'd need to have a referendum immediately." A Welsh government spokesman said: "Ministers are selected from the membership of the democratically elected National Assembly and we see no need to change this."	MPs could serve as Welsh government ministers in a bid to widen the talent pool, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales says.
Mark Turner, 55, tried to use an EpiPen to counter the severe allergic reaction but spilled the contents, a hearing at Exeter's County Hall was told. His wife then successfully used another pen to administer an injection, but he died from the reaction to the sting at his home on Dartmoor, Devon. A coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death. More on this story plus more Devon and Cornwall news Mr Turner kept three hives near his home as a hobby and to make honey. He had previously been diagnosed with an allergy to bee stings, but tests had found the severity of his condition was on the "lower end". His wife Ali said on the day of his death in November 2015 the father of three ran into the house and then collapsed on the floor gasping for breath. He got out of the protective suit and grabbed the EpiPen but it misfired and the contents ended up on the floor. Mrs Turner then got a second pen and injected his leg. She said: "He was still conscious but delirious. He was grey and pale and his breath was shallow. He was not responding." He died about 20 minutes later despite the efforts of paramedics. A post-mortem examination concluded Mr Turner died from the anaphylactic allergic reaction caused by the sting to his neck. His wife said he had gone to see his GP in May 2015 and was given antihistamines and Epinephrine injections after suffering a reaction. Mrs Turner said her husband was "fit and healthy" and said had he known there was a risk of dying "he would have given up the bees". Assistant coroner Luisa Nicholson said both EpiPens had been tested and did not have any defects.	An amateur beekeeper died after he was stung on the neck inside his protective suit, an inquest has heard.
The 32-year-old was making his debut at the TT after recovering from a serious accident at last year's North West 200. The organisers of the event passed on "their deepest sympathy to Franck's family and friends". Petricola died at Sulby Crossroads, becoming the 141st fatality at the races since they began in 1907. Organisers added that the coroner of inquests had been informed and an investigation was under way. Clerk of the course Gary Thompson said: "Franck showed incredible character to battle back from the serious injuries he suffered at the North West 200 last year when many a lesser man would have given up. "It showed his determination to compete on the mountain course." "The road racing community has lost a remarkable man and I extend my deepest sympathy to his family and friends." Two riders were killed during last year's festival. Petricola suffered multiple fractures and a head injury after crashing in practice at the North West 200 in Northern Ireland in 2014 and was in a coma for several days. He was flown home after the meeting but made a full recovery and raced at the event just last month. Speaking about his 2014 crash earlier this year, he said: "I don't remember why I crashed but I accept it. I am a big boy. "When you ride in a road race you know it is possible to have a hard crash like this. It is not a problem." Practice week continues on Thursday night, with the first race of this year's event held on Saturday.	French rider Franck Petricola has died following an accident during a qualifying session on Wednesday at the Isle of Man TT Races.
But once the votes are counted, what can residents expect to pay in council tax? Below are the figures for a Band D property for every council area in Wales for the current financial year of 2017/18, how much that has gone up by for the current year, and what the average property in the area actually pays. They are grouped here by police force region - council tax includes the police precept which is added to the overall bill paid by homes. Local government is not fully funded by council tax. Much of the funding for councils comes in the form of grants from the Welsh Government, which in turn gets its funding from the UK government in London. In 2017/18 a total of £4.1bn is being divided among Wales' 22 councils. The lions share of council cash goes on schools - with social services following behind, as shown in the graph above. Residents pay council tax based on which band their property is in, based on its worth. Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities. It is used to charge tax to a property that, in Wales, was worth between £91,001 to £123,000 on April 2003 values. Council tax gets lower the cheaper a property is, and higher the more expensive a property is. Council tax figures source: Welsh Government	Voters will go to the polls on Thursday to determine who will represent them on local councils.
Jamie Toland told police he woke up to find the animal gnawing at the tag around his ankle at his home in Slemish Way, Lisburn, County Antrim. But the High Court in Belfast was told there were "no signs" of teeth marks. Bail was refused after the judge said the explanations tested "the court's ability to accept what he says". Remanding the 23-year-old in custody, the judge said other outcome would "defy all the rules of logic and sense". Mr Toland had been fitted with the electronic monitoring tag last month, after he was granted bail in connection to a burglary that took place in February. He allegedly stole Â£1,550 in cash and a pellet gun during the break-in at a property in Lisburn. The accused now faces a new charge of criminal damage for allegedly removing the monitoring device. The tag is connected to a tamper alarm, and the security firm which manages the tagging system alerted police that the alarm had been trigged on 28 October. Mr Toland was then arrested at his home. A prosecution barrister to the High Court: "It subsequently became clear that the electronic tag had been removed from the applicant's ankle. The court that heard Mr Toland told police his dog chewed at his ankle tag in an attempt to get the accused to go for a morning walk. The prosecution barrister told the judge: "The tag was examined and there were no signs of any teeth marks around it." He added that it would take up to 40 kilos in weight to break the device. A box installed in Mr Toland's house as part of the monitoring system had been shifted, but the accused claimed it had been moved so he could do some cleaning. A defence lawyer told the court he accepted he faced "an uphill struggle" to secure bail for his client again. "His account of this is that he takes the dog for a walk every morning, but he slept in and the dog was gnawing at the thing on his leg," the lawyer added. "He said when he got up he tried to get the dog off and the item fell off his leg." The court heard Mr Toland has been battling alcohol addiction and had suffered two serious assaults earlier this year. He sustained a fractured jaw and a brain injury in one incident. The second attack involved being hit on the skull with a bottle. Remanding the accused into custody, the judge said: "This is an application where I would have to defy all the rules of logic and sense to do other than refuse him bail."	A burglary suspect has claimed that his pet dog chewed off the electronic tag he had been wearing as part of his bail conditions, a court has been told.
Ronald Chigunwe worked for Wessex Heartbeat, which supports the cardiac centre at Southampton General Hospital. The 40-year-old, of Breadels Field, Basingstoke, pleaded guilty to four offences of fraud and money laundering. However, he denied four other charges of money laundering. The Crown Prosecution Service will now decide whether he should face trial. A decision is due within the next 14 days. The fraud was uncovered when a new chief executive took over at the charity and became suspicious after asking Chigunwe for financial information. The chief executive's wife - an accounts expert - was asked to look at the records and discovered the fraud.	A former financial controller has admitted stealing more than £440,000 from a hospital charity.
Officials say 80 asylum applications will be accepted each day, and a maximum of 3,200 people will be allowed to travel through Austria. The measures will be introduced on Friday. The country has become a major transit route for migrants seeking to claim asylum in Germany. Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said Austria had no choice but to act, as there was no European solution yet in place for the current migrant crisis. "It is a matter of common sense to secure our borders as long as there is no European solution. I see it as our responsibility, to maintain security, order and the quality of life in Austria for our citizens," she said. "We cannot cope with the number of asylum applications that we had last year. That is why we impose limits on the stream of refugees. Another step is the introduction of daily quotas." Schengen: EU free movement deal explained Austria's Plan B to cap influx of refugees Migrant crisis in depth Austria took in about 90,000 asylum seekers in 2015, about 1% of its population, and officials expect to cut this number sharply this year, to about 37,500. Observers say the influx has contributed to the rising popularity of the far right in Austria, sparking tensions in the governing coalition. Neighbouring Slovenia and other countries in the Balkans - the main route for migrants bound for northern Europe - have also indicated that they will impose tougher measures against migrants. Some EU states have already re-imposed border controls on a temporary basis. The migrant flux is expected to intensify in coming months as weather conditions improve. The crisis will be high on the EU's agenda at a Brussels summit on Thursday, and countries are expected to debate the future of the Schengen Agreement that creates a 26-nation passport-free zone. Following the Austrian announcement, the Slovenian government said it had asked its parliament to approve the deployment of soldiers to its borders to help control the migrant flow.	Austria will impose a daily quota on asylum claims and limit the flux of migrants travelling through the country.
Finn, 27, played in the first Test at Lord's but was dropped for Old Trafford where England won to level the series. However, a calf injury to all-rounder Ben Stokes has led to Finn being recalled over seamer Jake Ball. "Physically he's sorted out and his pace is back up, which is when Steven Finn's at his best," captain Alastair Cook told BBC Radio 5 live. "We're backing a guy who hasn't had the best summer but a couple of things have changed over the last few weeks." Finn, who is averaging almost 40 with the ball in first-class cricket this summer, took his best figures of 6-79 against Australia when England last played a Test at Edgbaston. However, he struggled in his last five-day outing at Lord's, where he failed to take a wicket. "We're giving him another go and I think sometimes, with selection going that way, people aren't always looking over their shoulder all the time," Cook continued. "Our seam bowling department is looking strong." Media playback is not supported on this device Stokes, 25, has made just two Test appearances this summer and has had three injuries in the past nine months that have kept him on the sidelines. He made 38 runs and picked up two wickets at Old Trafford before being forced off the field with a calf problem. "Stokes is that cricketer who plays on the edge, he drags a lot of people with him and that character will be missed," Cook said. "You want people to get on the front foot and Ben throughout his career has been able to do that. It's more than just his runs and wickets that we're missing." Joe Root's scores of 254 and 71 not out in the second Test, along with Cook's first-innings century, masked some middle order worries for England. James Vince, batting at four, has fallen to several loose shots while Gary Ballance has made a combined total of 72 runs in three innings in this series. "It's a situation we've found ourselves in over the past couple of years. We don't have that strength in depth at the moment in batting," Cook added. "That's one of the tough things about playing international cricket - you come in and straight away you're under scrutiny, unless you get a score straight away. "It is a very different game to playing county cricket so guys take time." Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq refused to name his squad for Wednesday's Test, instead preferring to keep the opposition guessing. Misbah was the only Pakistan player to make a half-century in either innings at Old Trafford and the bowlers struggled on a hard pitch. "I don't want to let the other team know," he said. "We know, our team knows and that's the most important thing for us. "If you look at the previous Test match, we let them score too heavily and once the opposition score 600 runs, it's difficult to come back into the game." Pat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live "Alastair Cook admits it was a very difficult call to go for Steven Finn rather than Jake Ball, but Finn's gradual improvement in form recently, after making some technical adjustments and his brilliant bowling against Australia last year, tipped the balance. "The unsettled weather forecast for the rest of the week counted against Adil Rashid. He only has one available Test left - next week at The Oval - to show what he can do at the highest level before major challenges on the sub-continent this winter." by Emma Boorman, BBC Weather Wednesday: Should be dry for the vast majority of the day with some sunny spells, only the very outside chance of a shower. Windy. Thursday: Sunshine and showers; more of a chance of the showers coming through on Thursday. Again though, with a brisk wind they shouldn't last too long. Friday: Another fine day with plenty of long sunny spells and much less of a breeze. Still the risk of a shower, though I suspect they will stay to the east. Saturday: There is some uncertainty as we move into the weekend with a fairly deep area of low pressure developing to the north of the UK. But for Edgbaston I think Saturday should be mostly dry and after a sunny start it will turn cloudier through the day. The chance of any rain will increase later in the day as the cloud thickens from the west. Sunday: Again there is high uncertainty here. But at this stage Sunday looks dry and bright with some sunny spells.	Fast bowler Steven Finn will return to the England side for the third Test against Pakistan at Edgbaston.
That was certainly the case when I met up with my friend Kerrie the other week and asked why she smelled of bliss on toast. "Midnight Fantasy by Britney Spears," she replied. Now, I obviously appreciate Britney as pop royalty, but I was surprised such an arresting scent would have a celebrity's name attached to it. Not long ago, fragrances were associated with well-established, fashionable names such as Ralph Lauren or couture brands like Chanel. But the number of celebrity perfumes on the market has rocketed in the last decade. Why? Jennifer Lopez. "Glow changed everything," says Chandler Burr, the former scent critic for the New York Times and author of several books on the subject. He credits Lopez's first fragrance, which was released in 2002, with triggering a deluge of deodorants. "Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive," he says. Lopez had sparked what Jezebel brilliantly described as the "scentocalpyse". Suddenly, everyone and their goldfish had a scent of their own. And they sold by the truckload. "Brands can see a huge surge in sales and awareness when a celebrity face resonates with their audience," says Gill Smith, managing director of The Perfume Shop. She cites Beyonce and Ariana Grande's ranges as some of the store's most popular products. So, what is the appeal of celebrity fragrances? "Identification and intimacy," says Burr. "Scent is an affordable unit of a star. Assuming the celebrity has actually been involved in its creation, a scent constitutes identification with that star viscerally and intimately. It is, in a small way, meeting them." Perfumes ideally have to match the celebrity's image while also appealing to their core audience (which explains why pop stars with younger fanbases have fragrances with sugary sweet smells). Smith says: "We all still aspire to be more like our idols and connecting through a fragrance is one way of doing that. "Britney Spears has stood the test of time. Diehard fans who wore Britney Fantasy over 12 years ago are still coming to us to try her new fragrances." This is probably a good moment for me to make a confession. And, before I start, it's not something I'm proud of, ok? It was August 2014. I'd been to Spain on holiday and was in the duty free section of Barcelona Airport. Early, bored and trying to get rid of the last of my euros, I was spraying various aftershaves up and down my arm when one caught my nose. I looked at the bottle and was surprised to see it was something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. So I bought it, and was duly mocked by my friends for having spent money on something called The Secret by Antonio Banderas. But it did make me realise that, if something smells good, it will sell regardless. For celebrities who don't want to release a fragrance under their own name, the mere act of endorsing an existing brand can have a huge impact. "Johnny Depp as the face of Dior Sauvage has helped to drive awareness for that fragrance," Smith says. "Eighteen months after launch it's still one of our top 10 sales every day. "Other examples include Gigi Hadid with Tommy Girl; Jared Leto with Gucci; and Estee Lauder Modern Muse with Kendall Jenner." She adds: "More recently the announcement of Guerlain working with Angelina Jolie has given a more traditional fragrance house a celebrity boost." The stigma around celebrity fragrances may have faded over the last few years - but now the sales are fading as well. It's a decline that started several years ago in the US. "We saw it in 2008 right after the crash, and it's now a given in the US industry that the celebrity market has collapsed - or at least hugely shrunk," Burr explains. "Rihanna and a few others have scents that are doing well, but it's nothing like before." Consumers in the UK appear to be turning their noses up at them too. Figures released by market research group National Purchase Diary (NPD) show sales of celebrity fragrances declined by £12m in the UK last year - a drop of 22%. But the fragrance market as a whole actually grew by 1.4% - so it's not that people stopped buying perfume, just that they're less drawn to celebrities. Just look at the sales of couture brands like Prada, Chanel and Dior, which collectively saw a 6% increase last year. "The decline in celebrity perfumes is something we noticed in the past two years - it's not something we see normally," says Teresa Fisher, senior account manager in UK Beauty at NPD. That drop, she points out, could partly be down to fewer launches. "The market was very healthy a few years ago because there were a lot of celebrity fragrances around," Fisher says. "We saw One Direction and James Bond scents generate market growth, but now we aren't seeing as many celebrity launches." There might be fewer celebrities cologne-ising the shelves (sorry), but Smith says the market is still strong. "It's definitely not the end of celebrity fragrance, we do still believe there is a place in the market for them," she says. "Customers still want celebrity perfumes as long as it is the right celebrity, and the right scent." The right scent, of course, is the crucial part. When he was the NYT's scent critic, Burr famously awarded Britney's Midnight Fantasy four stars, implying there should be no snobbery about celebrities if the smell itself is good. He cites Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely as one of the best of the celebrity fragrances he came across and is now even developing his own, called You or Someone Like You. Fisher says: "I think overall what we're seeing is the polarisation of the fragrance market. "At one end, consumers look for value for money, they go for promotions and maybe celebrity fragrances. But at the other, consumers are becoming more selective. "Rather than buying 10 times a year maybe they buy five times a year. They're spending the same amount of money but going towards a more niche or premium offering." The fragrance industry was worth £1.25bn in the UK last year, and shows no signs of slowing any time soon. But if the current sales trends continue, there could well be far fewer famous faces plastered across perfumes in the future.

The aerodrome's owners had claimed that "permanent unrestricted planning permission" was granted in 1951. However, this was rejected by Waverley Borough Council in July 2011 and the planning inspector in April 2012. A judge at the High Court said the 1951 permission did not grant permission for unrestricted flying. Lord Justice Sullivan said the permission for "flight testing" did not amount to consent for unrestricted flying of aircraft. He said the certificate sought by the owners was pursued on the alleged basis that there was no material difference, in land use terms, between unrestricted numbers of passenger or cargo flights, and flight testing. He said: "The use of land as a bus station is not the same thing as use of land for the testing of buses." He added: "There can be no doubt that, properly construed, the 1951 planning permission does not permit the airfield to be used for unrestricted aviation activities." Dunsfold Park was constructed during World War Two by the Canadian Army. It is now used by about 100 commercial operators and most famously as the venue for the filming of Top Gear. The owners have the right to appeal the latest decision to the Supreme Court.	The owners of Dunsfold Park aerodrome, which is home to the BBC's Top Gear, have lost their latest fight for unrestricted flying.
Two sections of the A3055 Undercliff Drive suffered landslips in February 2014, creating a three-mile detour between Niton and St Lawrence. Some residents, frustrated with delays, resurfaced the road themselves in October 2014, but the council shut it again for safety reasons. The authority says the new route will only be open for local access. The landslide, which happened during work to repair the road, caused eight homes to be evacuated. The council said the collapse was caused by unusually heavy rain in an area of "known land instability" where there had been numerous landslips in the past. The authority's planning committee has approved a new route, slightly inland, providing full access for local residents' vehicles, walkers, cyclists and horse riders, but closed to through traffic. The work will be carried out by the authority's contractor Island Roads under an existing Private Finance Initiative (PFI) deal. The company said the work would last eight weeks. Resident Tim Wright said the solution was a "temporary scheme" which failed to address drainage problems. The council said "retaining the existing drainage arrangements for the highway would not increase the potential for ground movement to occur". Planning chairman Bob Blezzard said he hoped in the future there would be another application for the road to be "fully reinstated".	A main road on the Isle of Wight is to be repaired more than two years after it collapsed due to heavy rain.
The track's release date was brought forward by five weeks after a cover version by X Factor's Fleur East topped the iTunes chart last week. Ronson thanked "boy wonder" Bruno Mars, who features on the track, "without whom there would be no jam". Ed Sheeran, who scores a 10th week at the top of the album charts, fell to number two in the singles chart, while Band Aid 30 climbed to number three. The physical release of Do They Know It's Christmas? saw the charity track climb nine places, but it was kept off the top spot by Ronson and the ubiquitous Sheeran. East, who is the favourite to win this year's X Factor, performed the Ronson track during the show's semi-final on Saturday 6 December. Her mentor Cowell, who chose the track after Ronson and Mars pulled out of performing the song themselves on the talent show, called it "one of the top three performances" in X Factor history. East later apologised to Ronson, calling it "an amazing song". "I don't think anyone expected my performance to be as popular as it was," she added. Speaking to the Official Charts company, Ronson refrained from mentioning East, but thanked "everyone who bought, downloaded or DJ'd Uptown Funk this past week." "It's pretty much the coolest thing ever," he added. Featuring  Mars on lead vocals, Uptown Funk is the first single from British producer Ronson's fourth album, Uptown Special. Inspired by the feel-good funk of the 70s and 80s, it was already available in several countries around the world. Two Ronson tracks - Stop Me and Valerie, a collaboration with Amy Winehouse - reached number two in previous years.	Mark Ronson has clinched his first UK number one with Uptown Funk.
The A&E unit at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital could be downgraded, leaving the Royal Shrewsbury as the only hospital in the county to offer emergency and critical care. Women and children's services would also be moved to Shrewsbury, despite a Â£28m centre opening in Telford in 2014. The proposals have been made by the NHS 'Future Fit' board. More updates on this and other stories in Shropshire Urgent care centres would be based at both sites, which Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said would attend to the majority of patients who are currently seen at A&E. These "preferred options" will be considered by Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Shropshire CCG, who will formally decide if a public consultation can begin. The board is also recommending three other options be put forward for public consultation. No formal decisions will be made until at least Summer 2017, Telford and Wrekin CCG said. The NHS Future Fit programme was launched in 2014 to review the health system across Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and mid-Wales and is set to finish in spring 2017. Princess Royal Hospital in Telford: Royal Shrewsbury Hospital: There has been criticism of the plans to move women's and children's services from Telford. Shaun Davies, leader of Telford & Wrekin Council, described the announcement as "a total farce that is being railroaded through" and said he opposed the idea of downgrading Telford's A&E department. "If there is to be only one, then it makes sense from a financial and clinical perspective to locate it at Princess Royal Hospital; in the area where there is a growing population."	Shropshire could have one emergency and trauma department under recommendations being put forward by NHS bosses.
At present, those under 18 can be sentenced to a maximum of three years in a reform facility. The move to change the law gathered momentum after the youngest convict in the notorious 2012 Delhi gang rape was recently released from detention. The parents of the victim were among those campaigning to change the law. On Tuesday, the Juvenile Justice Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha - the upper house of the parliament. The bill was approved by the Lok Sabha - the lower house - in May. It will now have to be signed by the president to become law - which, correspondents say, is a mere formality. The new law will not apply to the youngest 2012 rapist, but it will be used in future cases involving juvenile offenders above 16 years. Authorities say the number of juvenile crimes have been increasing - last year, 38,565 cases were registered, including many cases of rapes, murders and acid attacks. The supporters of the new law say tougher punishment will act as a deterrent. However, critics say that India is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which mandates that all children under the age of 18 be treated equally, and say the new law will violate the convention. Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, died after being brutally raped by five men and one minor on a moving bus in 2012. The attack sparked a huge public outcry in India and forced the authorities to introduce tough new laws to deal with crimes against women. Her mother Asha Devi said she was "satisfied" at the bill's passing. "But I am sad that my daughter did not get justice," she added. Four adult convicts in the case are appealing against death sentences. A fifth died in prison. But the youngest of her attackers, who was 17 at the time of the crime, was sentenced to three years and released recently. During his trial in a juvenile court, there were calls to try him as an adult and protests were held over the weekend against his release. Since his release, the rapist has been housed with a charity because of fears over his safety. On Monday, India's Supreme Court dismissed an appeal to stop his release, saying it "shared" the concern of most citizens but its hands were "tied" by the law.	The Indian parliament has passed a bill which allows juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age to be tried as adults for serious crimes like rape or murder.
The order was issued by Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery after he witnessed the surrender of Nazi forces in northern Europe on 4 May. The mimeographed document is one of the earliest written records of the German surrender. The words in purple ink on it read: "All offensive ops will cease fire from receipt this signal." It adds: "Orders will be given to all troops to cease fire 0800 hrs tomorrow Saturday 5 May." Richard Davie, of auctioneers  Nottingham's International Autograph Auctions, said the note was an "historically important document". German forces in Italy had already surrendered on 2 May, but those in north-west Germany, Denmark and Holland surrendered to Field Marshal Montgomery, who was commanding all the British and Canadian armies in Europe, inside a tent at his headquarters, at Luneburg Heath on 4 May 1945. The final document of unconditional surrender was signed at US General Dwight Eisenhower's headquarters in Reims on 7 May. An official statement declaring the war in Europe over was made the following day.	A rare document ordering Allied forces to cease fire following the surrender of Nazi Germany has sold for £1,000.
The Oscar-winning John Ford film has been conserved in the US National Film Registry for its "cultural, historical, or aesthetic" significance. But brawling and boozing feature prominently in the 1952 film, which was shot in County Mayo and County Galway. An official warned "the theme is not likely to be well received here". Although counsellor Joseph Brennan said the film's colour was "beautiful" and its scenery "delightful", he raised fears it would provoke protests from Irish-Americans. His concerns were addressed to the Irish government's Department of External Affairs in a letter dated 17 April 1952, The Irish Times reports. He asked for a swift reply as he wanted to gauge the reaction to the film in Ireland, but no response was received until June. Another missive from the embassy official in July added: "If it were to be taken completely at its face value it would be accepted as a rollicking farce and no harm done. "But I fear it will be regarded by the Irish-American element here as purporting to portray actual life in Ireland. "We may then have protests." Mr Brennan's concerns are outlined in the latest volume of documents on Irish Foreign Policy 1951-1957 which are due to be published later this week. The Quiet Man, which starred John Wayne as boxer Sean Thornton and Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, won Oscars for Best Director and Best Cinematography. When it was added to the film registry in 2013, O'Hara described it as "the first great movie about Ireland" and said it had endured as it was "a simple and timeless story about people in love".	The Irish embassy in Washington feared protests by Irish Americans against the romantic comedy The Quiet Man, newly released documents reveal.
Bempton Cliffs at Flamborough Head has the UK's largest mainland seabird colony, according to the RSPB. It said the new facilities would bring more visitors and improve their access to the thousands of nesting birds. Keith Clarkson, site manager, said: "It's absolutely fantastic. It's been 10 years in the making." The centre, which attracts about 76,000 people a year, has been closed since September for redevelopment. It now has a bigger reception, a sheltered place for education and space for community groups and family activities. The footpaths have been made more accessible and extra spaces provided in the car park. Its reopening coincides with the BBC's Springwatch programme, which is based at the nature reserve for its Easter show. Springwatch will be on BBC Two at 21:00 BST.	A visitor centre at an internationally important nature reserve in East Yorkshire has reopened after a £1.3m upgrade.
Many of the country's 32 local authorities had voiced concerns about a 2% fall in their income. Mr Swinney told the local government and regeneration committee he did not underestimate the "on-going challenges". However, he believed councils had been given a "very credible settlement". I think some of the talk has been frankly over the top about the impact of the settlement for local government. The minister said that in 2016/17, local authority spending would be cut by £350m, which equates to a 2% reduction. Mr Swinney insisted that headline figure was not the full story. He explained to MSPs: "When we take into account that £250m is going to be spent through the integrated joint boards to support expenditure on services which local authorities are key participants, and given the guidance that I have issued to local authorities as to what they can expect that fund to support, that result is a net reduction in the local authority budget of about £100m, out of £16bn, which equates to less than 1%." For the last seven years local authorities have carried out a deal with the Scottish government whereby council tax bills have remained frozen. However, this year Moray Council considered a move to increase council tax bills by 18% to ease the cuts burden. It decided not to go ahead with the plan because it would have resulted in the Scottish government withholding £1.1m to offset the freeze. Council leader Stewart Cree said: "We simply cannot proceed with the proposal as the extra penalties it would now attract would have a devastating effect on the services people in Moray tell us they want protected. "So to make ends meet this year the administration have decided to defer certain works and spending, and to draw the remaining shortfall from reserves." Responding to a question about Moray Council's proposal to drop the tax freeze, Mr Swinney said: "I think some of the talk we have heard has been frankly over the top about the impact of the settlement on local government. "I don't underestimate the on-going challenges in delivering public services within a constrained financial environment." He added: "In all, I think the settlement offered to local government is a very credible settlement, it certainly doesn't merit the type of description it has had from certain voices within local authorities and it most definitely does not merit an 18% increase in the council tax." Separately, Scotland's first minister has called on councils to "do the right thing" and accept the funding deal being offered by the Scottish government. Nicola Sturgeon insisted local authorities were being given a "good deal" as part of the budget, with a package containing resources that will help them pay the living wage to care workers. She made the plea as the 9 February deadline loomed for local authorities to sign up to the financial package.	Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney has said talk about reduced council budgets impacting on local services was "frankly over the top".
The Ibrox club ripped up its contract with Mr Ashley after it was alleged Rangers only received about 7p in every Â£1 spent on club products. Mr Ashley claimed the deal, struck with former Rangers chief executive Charles Green, was wrongly terminated. He took his case to the High Court in London where it has been agreed his litigation can continue. Deputy High Court judge Richard Millett issued a written ruling after hearing competing arguments. The judge gave no date for the next hearing. In May, Rangers' directors said they were going to rip up contracts held with a merchandise company, Rangers Retail, which they ran with a Sports Direct firm. Rangers chairman Dave King, who took control nearly two years ago, and other directors were unhappy with the arrangement. William McCormick QC, who led the Rangers legal team, told Judge Millett supporters were also upset. He said fans became angry after learning the club only got about 7p of every Â£1 spent and had staged a merchandise boycott. Mr McCormick said fans thought Mr Ashley, who owns Newcastle United FC, pocketed too much of their money. He said there was a widespread view that no "self-respecting" Rangers supporter wore a replica shirt.	Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has won the latest round of a legal fight with Rangers over a merchandise deal.
As the lawsuits represent around 25 million US Uber customers, this amounts to an individual payout of just over a dollar each. The proceedings claimed that the lift-hailing app was charging a "safe ride fee" but not carrying out adequate background checks on its drivers. Uber said it would rename the charge a "booking fee". It also pledged to change the wording of its advertising to avoid safety-related language. The settlement requires court approval and applies to journeys booked in the US between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2016. "We are glad to put these cases behind us and we will continue to invest in new technology and great customer services so that we can help improve safety in the cities we serve," the firm said in a statement. Uber track its drivers' cars via GPS and shares a photo of the driver with customers before they get in the car. "No means of transportation can ever be 100% safe. Accidents and incidents do happen," it added. "That's why it's important to ensure that the language we use to describe safety at Uber is clear and precise."	Uber has offered £20m ($28.5m) to settle two US lawsuits which argued that its safety claims were misleading.
Swansea West MP Geraint Davies said it was vital for a "greener future", and accused ministers of "back-pedalling" on their commitment to the lagoon. The company behind the scheme warned in October that building work was being delayed by a year to 2017. Tidal Lagoon Power said it was still negotiating with ministers over an agreed price for the energy generated. Press reports on Thursday said the company had cut workforce numbers at its base in Gloucestershire. Swansea council said it would exert all the pressure it could to make sure the project stays on track. Council leader, Rob Stewart, said he had written to the prime minister to request a "positive and speedy decision". Labour MP Mr Davies said: "The chancellor specifically mentioned and supported the lagoon in his pre-election budget, and the prime minister came to Swansea during the election campaign on the pretext of supporting the lagoon. "Now we face this back-pedalling from the government as we fast approach the Paris COP (Conference of Parties) climate change conference where all governments must show willing to engineer a sustainable future. "It is important that the government gives its full backing to the Swansea tidal lagoon, as the first step for lagoons around Britain and a major export opportunity to help play our part to deliver lower emissions. "Having said he's for it a year ago, if the chancellor pulls the plug on it, it'll be a disgrace." Tidal Lagoon Power said in a statement: "Our short-term priority is the construction of the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the progression of plans at Cardiff and Newport to harness the country's best tidal range resource in the Severn Estuary. "Our team needs to align with these objectives and regretfully that involves some redundancies. "Our vision is to provide 8% of the UK's electricity from six tidal lagoons and we have grown quickly so as to take forward these plans. "However, our first project is now scheduled to start on site one year later than planned and that inevitably impacts the development of the fleet." A spokesman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said negotiations on the tidal lagoon were ongoing.	An MP has urged the UK government not to "pull the plug" on plans for a £1bn tidal power project in Swansea.
In a study on mice, Hsp90 inhibitors were found to strip cancer cells of defences against hormone treatments. This makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug-resistant cancers, the research team said. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK. About one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It mainly affects men over the age of 50. The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments, which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens. But some prostate cancers don't work that way. Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment. This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive, difficult-to-treat cancers. The latest research, published in the journal Cancer Research, found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors. Professor Paul Workman, study author and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said it was an exciting discovery. "We call Hsp90 inhibitors 'network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once, across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway. "These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein, and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance." Prof Workman said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive, drug-resistant prostate cancer. Prof Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: "These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options."	A new type of drug could benefit men with aggressive prostate cancer that is no longer responding to treatment, researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research have said.
In the app, the cartoon characters feature with the real world in the background. The developers claim it is the first time in the UK that "augmented reality" has been used in this way. They and Conwy council hope it will bring tourists to the town where the inspiration for Alice went on holiday. The original launch of the app in August was delayed after key figures for tourists to follow were altered. Virtual characters failed to recognise sculptures in the town after Conwy council painted them. Next year marks 150 years since Alice in Wonderland was first published. Simon Burrows, co-director of Alice in Wonderland Limited which has co-ordinated the project, said: "People who use the app can look at Llandudno landmarks on screen, while characters from the Alice books tell the story behind them. "It's also possible to take a picture of yourself or your friends standing next to the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat or Alice herself." The Alice in Wonderland story, and its sequel Through the Looking Glass, were written by Lewis Carroll (whose real name was Charles Dodgson). He composed the original story to entertain a young girl called Alice Liddell, with whose family he was friends. Alice Liddell's family lived in Oxford but had a house in Llandudno and spent many of their holidays there. Company director Barry Mortlock said: "I've lived in Llandudno for 36 years now, and it worried me that the town wasn't doing enough in recent years to celebrate its links with the real life Alice. "The app is now ready for next year's important anniversary. "It has the potential to attract more visitors from overseas, where there's a huge interest in the Alice in Wonderland stories." Graham Rees, Conwy council's cabinet member for tourism, said: "This will be a huge asset to Llandudno and really enhance what we can offer to visitors."	Characters from the Alice in Wonderland books will guide visitors on a tour of Llandudno in a new app which shows the town's links with the stories.
We asked some of those taking part in the Online Influence Conference 2015  for their thoughts on what's going on - and what's next. You can follow too on Twitter at #Oi15 @OiConf John Watton, EMEA marketing director at Adobe Marketing Cloud who is returning to his home city for the conference; Amanda Neylon, head of digital at Macmillan Cancer Support, whose career has included Vauxhall Motors and the Met Police; Dr Jonathan Deacon, reader in marketing and entrepreneurship at University of South Wales, with a background in business, and Andrew Grill, global partner social business at IBM and previously CEO of Kred. Marketing on social media - is it about big bucks or can even the smallest business do it well? John Watton, EMEA marketing director at Adobe Marketing Cloud, @jwatton: "What I love right now is that the old barriers to marketing - money and technology - no longer exist. Marketing is accessible to everyone and it has become more about a company's willingness to do these things and their understanding how it can help to meet your business goals. Saying that, if you are able to invest in social media marketing you will be able to go far beyond just the likes and follows, and tie every piece of data to your bottom line." Amanda Neylon, head of digital at Macmillan Cancer Support, @amandaneylon: "I believe with the right insight driving the decisions anyone can do great social media marketing on any budget. Many of our social media marketing successes have been around amplifying amazing user-generated content rather than creating specific assets, because that is where the powerful stories are. For example, promoting  tips from The Source - our site designed to help us reach friends, colleagues, neighbours who may want to help someone with cancer but don't necessarily know what to do or say - has been a powerful way to reach new audiences." Dr Jonathan Deacon, reader in marketing and entrepreneurship at University of South Wales, @UniSouthWales: "No, like a lot of things in life the more cash you throw at something does not mean that it will get better. Social media is about three key things in my mind. Who you want to talk with, what you want to say and what you want them to do once you have said it. "Firstly, do you know your audience? Not just bland agglomerations of 'people' but an in-depth understanding of the individuals that make up an audience. What type of content do they read/share and why? How is it written? "Secondly, what do you want to say to this audience? What are you trying to achieve? Writing content is critical. Will the content that you share have meaning to the audience you want to communicate with and will they respond? "And thirdly, do you want someone to share your content, act upon it or perhaps just be amused by it? "If you take a closer look at these three things you will probably see that small firms are just as able as large firms to achieve a meaningful outcome with social media. I always think that small firms are better able as they have an intimate knowledge of the audience - they may even be part of the audience themselves." Andrew Grill, global partner social business at IBM, @AndrewGrill: "Just as 12 years or so ago when the internet first appeared, smaller companies that took advantage of this new tool could appear much larger than existing companies. "With social media, even the smallest company can have a global presence. I've seen companies of all sizes become successful with social media because they take the time to understand the language of social and engage authentically with their customers and fans. "My tip is don't treat social as a marketing channel, treat it as a conversation you would have with someone at the conference. You need to have something of value to exchange with your audience and not just interrupt a conversation. "I often challenge conference participants to go up to two other people at a networking break and see how long it takes to be invited into the conversation. If by listening closely you see where what you might say will add real value to the conversation, you will be welcomed in. If you just want to sell something you will be waved away. This is the same with social." People are already saying, 'ads are spoiling my social media experience' - are there lessons for brands/businesses to learn? JW: "A big learning for brands is that just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Even with all this new technology, not a lot has really changed and the basic principles of marketing remain - understand your customers, what they want and when they want it. Online marketing is all about the right time, right place and right message. If it doesn't deliver on this, it could have a negative impact on your brand." AM: "I think relevance is the key here. We as brands have access to so much data about our customers these days and it's important we use that when making marketing decisions. Personalised ads then have the capacity to become more useful additions to our customers' experience rather than intrusive." JD: "Yes, if the audience is dissatisfied with the content then you should listen and do something else. Social media is just that, social and therefore conversational, informal and individualistic. Advertising belongs in the age of mass market and mass communication - in the past." AG: "As I will explain during my Oi keynote [speech], social media is just like real life. My fear is that many companies see social as just 'another channel' and they try and push products on to people without understanding that they are interrupting existing conversations. We may never get away from 'ads' of some form. However, with social now being such a powerful tool, companies cannot simply reformat a marketing message for a social network. The lessons to learn are that companies that choose to engage with consumers and fans rather than advertise to them will be more successful in the longer term in my opinion." What's the best example of a good campaign on social media you've seen recently? JW: "Each year Adobe runs a digital marketing summit in the US and here in EMEA. While we work really hard to put together a great physical event, we make sure the experience starts long before and after the summit has taken place through our social channels. It's a great example of how a traditional marketing channel has been given a new lease of life through digital technology." JD: "For the very best execution of how to use social media take a look at Hiut Denim. They understand their audience, what they are trying to say and what they want people to do." AG: "Too many to choose from - but those that work across multiple platforms with a credible call to action get my attention." What's your favourite social media and how often do you use it? JW: "Twitter is the first thing I fire up when I get up in the morning. I probably use it every hour for news and sharing content I find interesting with my network." AM: "I still use Twitter a lot, mostly listening to keep up on what's new in digital (and the world) but I do try and tweet something useful at least once a day." JD: "LinkedIn - every day." AG: "Twitter! I wouldn't be at the Oi conference without Twitter - famously my "one tweet" in January 2011 lead me to working for IBM. I tweet whenever I have some downtime, in between meetings or walking home." When you eat, is your phone/tablet switched off? JW: "When I'm on my own, no. When I'm with my family, yes. It's a rule to never bring our phones to the table." AM: "Nope I tend to be always connected - though I don't take photos of my food." JD: "Mine is, but my wife keeps hers on, although she only answers once we have eaten." AG: "#SocialNeverSleeps" What's the last non-work related app you downloaded? JW: "This was the new Apple watch game 'Rules!' I'm expecting my new wearable to arrive anytime soon." AM: "My Apple watch has just been delivered so I'm spending quite a bit of time right now playing with all the apps I can have on it." JD: "A tilt-shift photo app which makes everything in your photos look miniature - very clever." AG: "WhatsApp - I'm one of the 700 million people sending 30 billion WhatsApps each day." What's the next big thing? JW: "One of the problems with social has long been proving its ROI (return on investment). We are now starting to think of social as a data-driven science, which is a great first step in helping to prove its value and starting to have meaningful conversations with other data-driven marketing teams." AM: "Data! I'm genuinely excited about data, or rather ways of using it. I think that we need to really develop the ways that we use all the data available to us to personalise customer experience across digital channels. Whether that's gathered from our social activity or newer areas like ibeacons or wearables, we can gather so much valuable data to make online experiences more impactful. Making connections between our online social interactions and all the offline data we're gathering about our lives will enable truly personalised, useful and interesting digital experiences." JD: "I see a lot of developments around 'EdTech' and I'm pretty sure that some of that will be successful when taken to market. I also think that the very smart and probably small firms will begin to better integrate social media with personalised communication. I can foresee firms mixing high-end social media with low-end hard copy, with great effect. For example, Twitter feeds backed up with occasional and highly personalised written letters, cards and the like - authoritative and authentic." AG: "Corporate Social Networks - we've only just scratched the surface of how companies can collaborate using social techniques and allow employees to be more productive, and more satisfied at work because they can share in the corporate wisdom of hundreds and even thousands of colleagues around the world. While this will be huge, it requires a massive cultural change, and will become the #NewWayToWork. This is something that clients are keeping me and my team at IBM very busy."	It's the "social" social media event of the year in Wales - hundreds of people involved in digital marketing are in Cardiff to hear insights from the likes of Google, Twitter, YouTube, and IBM.
Tumours in the ovaries are hard to detect in the earliest stages meaning it can be too late to treat them effectively by the time they are found. A trial of 4,051 women, reported in the journal Cancer, showed the method could identify those needing treatment. But a huge study taking place in the UK will give a final verdict on the test when it is completed in 2015. There is a survival rate of up to 90% when ovarian cancer is caught early, compared with less than 30% if it is discovered in the later stages. Unlike other cancers, the symptoms, such as pelvic and abdominal pain or persistent bloating, are often put down to other common ailments and the tumour can be missed. There is no mass screening programme to detect the cancer either. Scientists already know that levels of a protein in the blood, called CA125, are often higher with ovarian cancer. However, it is too unreliable on its own. It misses some patients and tells others they have the cancer when they are actually healthy. Researchers are now testing the idea of using the blood test to sort patients in risk groups based on levels of CA125. Instead of going straight for surgery, low-risk patients are tested again in a year, medium-risk ones after three months and high-risk patients have an ultrasound scan to hunt for tumours. The US study, at the University of Texas, followed post-menopausal women for 11 years on average. Ten women had surgery based on their ultrasound scan and all the cancers detected were at an early stage. Researcher Dr Karen Lu told the BBC: "Clinical practice definitely should not change from our study, but it gives us an insight - we didn't get a lot of false positives." She said the UK study of 50,000 people would give definitive results: "There are two big questions - do we see cancers at an earlier stage and do we decrease the number of deaths." Dr Sarah Blagden, from the Ovarian Cancer Action research centre, said: "Relative to the trial under way in the in the UK , this is a small study, but it does show that effective ovarian screening is possible. "In 2015 the results of the UKCTOCs study will become available and the results are eagerly anticipated, more so now that this American study has produced such encouraging results." Annwen Jones, the chief executive at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: "The results of this study are without doubt very positive, and we should take hope from that. "Early detection of ovarian cancer will be the key to transforming survival rates.  However, this study is very small, and there is no guarantee that the results will be replicated on a larger scale."	A new way of screening for ovarian cancer is showing "potential", according to researchers in the US.
It's clearly not the results. Beat Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday and they will have matched New Zealand's all-time tier one record for consecutive victories. It's not the way they finish games; under coach Eddie Jones, they have scored a cumulative 102 more points in the final quarter of matches than their opponents. It's what's been happening at the other end of the games that is raising eyebrows among critics and hopes among their opponents. Scoreless at home against Italy after 20 minutes, struggling to kick from hand, giving away set-piece penalties; 9-3 down to France, with a man in the sin bin; 10-0 down to Australia last autumn after 17 minutes, their opponents with 97% of the territory and 87% of the possession. It goes further back. Down against South Africa earlier in the autumn, six penalties conceded in the first 21 minutes. Two tries conceded in the first 20 minutes in the third of the summer Tests against the Wallabies, 10-0 down after 15 minutes of the first. You might say it doesn't matter. All those games were won. Against Wales in Cardiff England led 8-3 after the first quarter, with 74% of the possession. How could anyone complain when England have won their past 10 Six Nations matches, and are about to take on a team who haven't won in south-west London in 34 years? Jones, all those years of international coaching with four different nations whirring away in his brain, thinks otherwise. Part of that is about standards. This is a team he wants to win the next World Cup in 2019. Give the All Blacks a head-start and you are unlikely to catch them. Part of it is much more short-term: Scotland's revival in Vern Cotter's last year in charge is genuine. They are outsiders once again this weekend, but seldom in those 34 barren years have they travelled in such form. "Mate, if I knew I'd fix it," Jones said when asked this week if he had worked out what was going wrong in those opening exchanges. "And I haven't been able to fix it, so I don't know." "It's something we have been mentioning over the last few weeks," winger Jack Nowell told BBC Sport. "We've got ourselves out of jail a few times now - it is about a fast start, and putting our game on them first." Media playback is not supported on this device England's replacements - the finishers, as Jones likes to call them - have done that jail-breaking to perfection. According to Opta, the men off the bench have created more tries than those of any other nation (three scored, two assisted), made more carries, conceded the fewest turnovers and shipped only one penalty (Scotland's replacements have conceded six, France's seven). It's a wonderful asset for the coach to have. With a bench on Saturday that includes both Vunipola brothers, Jamie George, the returning Anthony Watson and the thundering Ben Te'o, it could be decisive once again this week. It does not mean the starters cannot be expected to match those same standards. Dig a hole often enough, and one day you might not be able to climb out of it. "It becomes a case of, are you riding your luck?" says Paul Grayson, the former England fly-half who is part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team at Twickenham this weekend. "The Italy game was as bad an opening quarter as we've seen from an England team under Jones - and that was nothing to do with 'ruckgate' (when Italy's tactic of not committing to rucks befuddled England). They were just nowhere near it mentally. "Maybe that's a timely wake-up call, because when winning becomes supposedly routine, even if you get away with a couple, you've still got to find a way to motivate yourself. If England are not quite there mentally, they look ordinary, and at some point soon they will lose." "England need to start fast," former British and Irish Lions winger Ugo Monye told 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast this week. "They need to get the crowd on their side - three points, six, nine, score a try, shut out Scotland, and put a seed of doubt into their minds. "Scotland come down here with their fanfare and the bagpipes and their confidence, and everyone is aware of their threat, and if it's a close game you might just have the Twickenham crowd turning on their players a little bit." Jones has been in ornery form this week, irascible in his media conferences, hard-nosed with his players on the Pennyhill Park training pitches. "We're preparing to start well," he said irritably when announcing his selection. "We're not preparing not to start well. "It's an 80-minute game. We've got to be ahead at the 80-minute mark, and that's what we're aiming to be against Scotland. "It's like starting a 100m race. You can be ahead at the 10m mark, but you've got to be ahead at the 100m mark." Jones, a self-confessed cricket nut, might enjoy another analogy: a pair of opening batsmen playing and missing on the first morning of a Test match, the opposition fast bowler fired up and the new ball seaming and bouncing past the outside edge. What does it matter if they are 80-3 at lunch if by the close they have put on 300 for the loss of only one more wicket? "Ian McGeechan, when he was coaching Northampton and telling us how he wanted us to play, brought up the example of Wigan's very successful rugby league team," remembers Grayson. "Every team that played Wigan wanted to beat them. They would be totally up for it, and they would go toe-to-toe with them. They got to half-time, and it would be 10-8, or 6-6, or they would only be four points down. "Then they would get into the second half, and as that effort left them tired and weakened, they would roll over and Wigan would score 40 points. "I used to think, what does a game look like after 20 minutes? If I can get some points on the board, great; if they've thrown a few shots and we've had to defend for a while and they haven't got much out of it, no problem, we'll see you in the last 10 minutes of the first half and the last 15 minutes of the contest. "The opposition are always going to be at their most obstinate and most up for it in that period. Yet, barring the Wales game, England haven't had too much flow in attack in the early part of their games. It's always difficult, but if you're the best side in the world, you do it. The All Blacks always manage to come out of the blocks." Such has been the impact of England's replacements that the impression is that Jones has enviable strength in depth. He does - at prop and hooker, at scrum-half, on the wings. With first-choice lock George Kruis out injured and his preferred partner Maro Itoje shifted to six, stand-in second rows Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes have arguably been England's most effective players. But it is not true throughout the team. England's Test cricket team often find themselves early wickets down because they have struggled to replace Andrew Strauss alongside Alastair Cook. They can struggle on turning pitches because no-one who has come into the team has been able to match the impact of world-class spinner Graeme Swann. "Nathan Hughes looks like the Billy Vunipola of three years ago," says Grayson. "Likely to last 50 minutes or do 30 minutes off the bench, do two or three good things but also disappear for a while. "And that makes a massive difference. Take Lawrence Dallaglio out of England's World Cup-winning team and put in another number eight, and what do they look like? They're just not quite as big or powerful or dominant or vocal. "When Dallaglio wasn't playing, England weren't quite the same. And I think that Vunipola is at that point. He's an 80-minute player heading to world class. And they just haven't got that otherwise. "Billy has been out and with Chris Robshaw being out, that's two-thirds of your first-choice back row. That's a huge loss to England, because they don't have that many great back-row players."	It might sound a curiously mealy-mouthed thing to say about a team that have won their past 17 matches and sit atop the Six Nations table with consecutive Grand Slams a genuine possibility, but England's rugby team might have a problem.
Saints - the last visiting team to win at Ibrox 13 months ago - took the lead early on when Blair Alston curled in a fantastic strike. Joe Garner headed Rangers level from a corner before the break. The visitors had several chances in the second half with Alston firing against the post while Garner had a header saved for the hosts. With Aberdeen defeated at Hamilton Academical on Tuesday and Hearts beaten at Kilmarnock, Saints could have gone second with victory but instead they go level on points with the second-placed Dons, albeit having played a game more. Rangers, having taken 16 points from a possible 30 since being promoted, stay fifth edging to within a point of Hearts. The Ibrox side have won only two of their home league games this season, having also dropped points to Hamilton and Ross County. Mark Warburton's side had improved defensively in recent weeks with clean sheets in league wins over Partick Thistle and Inverness. However, with Wes Foderingham resuming goalkeeping duties from Matt Gilks - Rangers' best player in the 1-0 Scottish League Cup semi-final defeat by Celtic - the Ibrox side found themselves a goal down early on to Saints as Alston picked his spot after robbing Lee Hodson for his first Saints goal. Tommy Wright engineered an away win over Rangers in last season's League Cup when the hosts - then in the Championship - bringing an end to a 11-game winning sequence. And the Northern Irishman's team had several opportunities to go back in front early in the second half with Brian Easton, Liam Craig, Danny Swanson and Chris Kane all going close before Alston fired against a post. Garner had netted just once since his summer move from Preston North End but the striker broke his Ibrox duck with a headed finish off Harry Forrester's corner, having gone close from a similar situation moments before. And Garner threatened to nod Rangers ahead on 74 minutes but could not beat Zander Clark, who made good first-half saves to deny Jason Holt and Josh Windass. Warburton sought fresh impetus in attack with the introduction of Martyn Waghorn, Kenny Miller and Barrie McKay off the bench but St Johnstone held firm with David Wotherspoon clearing a Miller effort off the line. Rangers' Mark Warburton: "It was a decent first half but we didn't continue that and we gave the ball away cheaply. "We weren't brave getting out, despite the possession stats we didn't play the way we wanted to. "It's a demanding crowd because they're used to success. The players have to recognise it's an expectant crowd - and quite rightly. We have to respect that and learn from that." St Johnstone's Tommy Wright: "It's never easy coming here. We're happy to take a point but we could have taken all three as we had a few good chances in the second half. "We knew we'd stay above Rangers with a positive result. We're content with the return but there are no prizes given out so we're not going to get carried away with it." Match ends, Rangers 1, St. Johnstone 1. Second Half ends, Rangers 1, St. Johnstone 1.

20 November 2015 Last updated at 14:22 GMT A special vote was launched on the CBBC website to see if kids think it's better to help bullies or punish them. More than 2, 400 children voted and 47% thought that bullies should be punished for their actions, with 53% saying bullies should be helped. We spoke to Alex Holmes, who is an anti bullying specialist, to get his advice for anyone who is being bullied.	As part of national Anti-Bullying week Newsround has been asking kids about the best way to stop it.
NHS Highland required an additional £2.5m to help it break even in 2013-14. In a new report, the public audit committee has heavily criticised the health board's financial management. NHS Highland said it had acted to address the concerns, and that it wanted to ensure both its finances and governance met "the highest standards." The public audit committee gathered evidence from the health board's bosses, who answered MSPs' questions at two public meetings. In the report, the committee said NHS Highland and its largest hospital - Raigmore in Inverness - continually overspent. MSPs questioned how well informed board members were of the financial situation. Committee convener Paul Martin said: "The fact that, for example, Raigmore Hospital continued to overspend year-on-year, despite £5m extra funding in 2012-13, suggests to us a culture of complacency about budgetary oversight at the hospital and at the NHS Highland board. "The slow progress in addressing the causes of the overspending at Raigmore was exacerbated by the practice of creating compensatory underspends elsewhere in NHS Highland in order to break even. "What was clear to the committee was that without brokerage there could have been serious repercussions for patients." NHS Highland has previously said the deal agreed to secure the additional £2.5m was the first time it had taken such action in 15 years. It said it could have been forced to cancel operations and cut services if the Scottish government had not given it the funds. NHS Highland chairman Garry Coutts said: "We welcomed the opportunity to give evidence to the committee and we believe we have fully co-operated. "We have already acted to address the concerns the committee has raised, both in its latest report and previously, and we are determined to ensure that our financial management and our governance practices are of the highest standards."	"Poor leadership and complacency" led to NHS Highland having to ask for extra funding from the Scottish government, MSPs have said.
Firefighters tackled the blaze, which started just before 21:00 on Monday in Carron Valley. The home owners and their dog escaped from the building after being alerted by a smoke alarm. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the blaze, although it is not believed to be suspicious. Station manager Dave Wishart said: "Firefighters were deployed in strategic positions surrounding the building with high-pressure jets and worked through the night to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. "Unfortunately the intensity of the fire meant the house was completely destroyed." "The home owners became aware of the fire quickly and had a working smoke alarm. "This helped them to get themselves and their dog out safely."	A house in Denny has been destroyed after a fire broke out in its roof space.
Perry Beeches III is one of a chain of six free schools. Mr Cameron described the schools as "a real success story". But the Ofsted report said too many students were underachieving and described teaching as "inadequate". Perry Beeches chief executive Liam Nolan said he "fundamentally disagreed" with the inspectors. The school's headteacher, Darren Foreman, its senior leadership team and chair of governors have resigned, Mr Nolan said. Mr Nolan has taken on the role of interim head teacher, together with Jackie Powell. The report said: "Teaching is inadequate. Too much is dull and fails to engage students who became bored and start to fidget." It also accused the school's leadership of having an, "unrealistic and inaccurate" view of the school and added students' behaviour required improvement. Mr Nolan said: "This judgement makes me question Ofsted's credibility." However he said he intended to work with Ofsted to make the school outstanding. He described the report as an, "unfortunate blip". He said: "Within six months you will see us back on the top." The Perry Beeches schools are funded by central government but not run by local authorities. Two of the other schools in the chain have been rated "outstanding" by Ofsted. Perry Beeches III was opened by the Prime Minister in September 2013. At the time, he said the majority of free schools were, "a real success story we should build on as a country". A Department for Education spokesman said: "Liam Nolan and the Perry Beeches free schools are transforming the life chances of children in Birmingham, in some of the most deprived communities of the country. "The performance of Perry Beeches I and II has set the bar for schools across the rest of the country. "Swift action has already been taken to change the leadership of Perry Beeches III and to turn around the performance of the school."	A £7m Birmingham free school opened by Prime Minister David Cameron is to go into special measures following a highly critical Ofsted report.
After managing to drive down the rate of deforestation for four consecutive years up to 2012, recent figures suggest the forest is being destroyed at a faster pace again. Some of the areas most severely affected are indigenous reserves in the Amazon region. The BBC's Sarah Robbins spoke to a selection of people there about their concerns and the problems they face. Amadeus Cinta Larga is a 25-year-old Cinta Larga tribe member who studies sustainability at the Flower of the Forest village. "We feel like we've been forgotten. The area covered by the reserve is so big that it is tough for us to police it all ourselves. "That's why there are still such problems with illegal logging in the reserve. "And we can't risk our own lives, we have families, too." Siderlei Mason is the director of SM Timber Sawmill, the largest producer of tropical timber in Latin America. "We work with proper certification but the outside world perceives this sector to be one that works mainly illegally. "The forest is rich and beautiful, it benefits people here, and it is beneficial to the world. But I think it should be exploited legally. "We in the logging sector can exploit it in a low-impact way. This is done in various places around the world. "If the government were to give out more concessions in public forests and indigenous areas, it could create a way for people to value the forest more." Lauriano Umbelino Martins is the representative in Matto Grosso state of Funai, the government body responsible for policies relating to Brazil's indigenous peoples. "We don't have enough people working in this area because of budget cuts. "I'm in charge of 11 villages but I can't monitor them all. "There's a lot of wood theft, because of the high value of the wood in the indigenous areas. "And even though the indigenous people know it is wrong, sometimes they help the loggers - because of their poverty. "They need food, they need clothes or medicine, or they want a motorcycle. "But things are getting better, with the help of Ibama [the state-funded institute responsible for environmental protection] and the National Guard and their patrols."	Brazil has been battling deforestation and illegal logging for years.
A long clearance from debutant goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell eluded home defender Shaun Brisley and allowed Marriott to lob keeper Alex Cisak. Brisley was later stretchered off and hospitalised with a head injury after receiving lengthy treatment when injured colliding with Mitchell. Dan Potts went close to making it 2-0 after the break, but curled wide. Leyton Orient manager Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "The most disappointing thing for me is that we conceded a very sloppy goal. "I must admit I was quite disappointed with the referee today but I don't want to go on about that because I'll end up getting in trouble. "I thought today we were very good, we dominated the game and didn't really give them any chances. I don't think they offered a lot going forward but they defended fantastically well." Luton boss Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio: Media playback is not supported on this device "I'm massively proud in terms of what they gave me today, their endeavour, how they went about their work. "They gave me absolutely everything today and that is all you can ask. "There was one bit of quality in the game, Jack produced it and it won the game. "I'm really proud of the players, I'm getting to know what they will produce. There is an equilibrium to their performances and I like that, I can work with that. It's a platform."	Jack Marriott scored the only goal of the game at Leyton Orient to extend Luton's winning run to four games.
Mail Online, which published her claim, also paid Â£150,000 in libel damages to the Mahmood family. Hopkins wrongly said the family had links to al-Qaeda in two articles published in December 2015. Her apology has been shared more than 3,500 times on Twitter, including by the Mahmood family's MP, Stella Creasy. But the family told the BBC's Asian Network they wanted a personal apology by phone from Hopkins herself, adding: "She owes that to us." The family of 11 had planned to holiday to Disneyland on 15 December 2015 but were stopped by US authorities at Gatwick Airport. Hopkins's article from 23 December said "you can't blame America for not letting this lot travel to Disneyland - I wouldn't either". Mail Online has now removed the story from its website, which claimed Mohammed Tariq Mahmood and his brother, Mohammed Zahid Mahmood, were extremists and published an apology. At the time, Mohammad Tariq Mahmood said he was given no reason why US officials had refused to allow the family on board. But Hopkins, who gained fame as a candidate in The Apprentice BBC TV series in 2007, claimed that his reason for visiting the US to go to Disneyland was a lie. Stella Creasy MP, who represents the family's Walthamstow constituency, accused Hopkins of "tucking away" her apology, which she published on Twitter at 02:00 GMT. "Do feel this late night tucked away one should be given more prominence," she said on Twitter. Ms Creasy had called on the former Prime Minister, David Cameron, to challenge the US for stopping the Mahmoods from boarding their flight to Los Angeles. Tariq Mahmood told the BBC it was "a great relief" to have the record set straight, but said he feared there would "always be feelings towards us" from "those who hate Muslims". "Once you drill a hole in the wall, you can fill it but the mark will always be there," he added. Hopkins, who joined the Mail Online in November last year, is known for airing controversial views, having compared migrants to "cockroaches" while a writer at the Sun. Before she wrote about the Mahmoods, president-elect Donald Trump had already praised Hopkins for "powerful writing on the UK's Muslim problems". Hopkins replied on Twitter, saying "you have support in the UK". In a second article published on 29 December, which included pictures of the Mahmood family home, Hopkins added that Hamza Mahmood, Mohammed's son, was publishing "extremist material" on a Facebook page. Hamza Mahmood said he did not create the Facebook page, which was linked to him because of an error with his email address. "We are happy to make clear that there is no suggestion that either Hamza nor Taeeba or Hafsa Mahmood (Hamza's mother and sister) have any links to extremism," Mail Online said in a statement issued on Monday. It added: "We and Katie Hopkins apologise to the Mahmood family for the distress and embarrassment caused and have agreed to pay them substantial damages and their legal costs." Tariq and Zahid Mahmood said: "Even to this day the US authorities have not explained the reason why we were not permitted to travel. We assume it was an error or even a case of mistaken identity. "However, matters are not helped when such sensationalist and, frankly, Islamophobic articles such as this are published, and which caused us all a great deal of distress and anxiety. "We are very pleased that the record has been set straight."	Columnist Katie Hopkins has apologised to a Muslim family she accused of being extremists after they were refused entry to the US for a Disneyland trip.
The Lib Dem site was called "May & Co" - the same name as a Chelsea estate agent established in 1920. The firm's boss, John Yianni, said he started getting abusive and "weird" phone calls when the campaign appeared on Twitter. The Lib Dems said it was "an innocent mistake" and the site had been changed. A party spokesman blamed an "over-enthusiastic volunteer" who had released an early version of the campaign which had not been checked. He said the party had apologised to Mr Yianni. The Lib Dem site is now called "Theresa May and Co" - but Mr Yianni said it was still close to the name of his company and he was concerned it was affecting his business. "The damage has been done and it's probably going to get worse. You don't want to be politically biased in your business. "People were saying: 'What are you doing getting into bed with them?'" He said he had contacted Sir Vince Cable and the Lib Dem headquarters to ask for the campaign to be dropped. "I was a Vince Cable supporter. I told him that," said Mr Yianni, who said he would not now be voting for the former business secretary. He added: "This company has been going since the 20s. They should have just checked before they unleashed it. "They have changed it into something slightly different thinking it's going to be OK but it's still the same." Lib Dem candidate Sir Ed Davey earlier staged a protest against Conservative social care reforms, which the party has dubbed the "dementia tax," with "Theresa May & Co" placards. Plans to make people receiving care at home liable for the full costs if they are worth at least Â£100,000 have proved controversial since they were announced in the Conservative manifesto. Theresa May later said proposed changes to social care funding in England would include an "absolute limit" on the money people will have to pay. She has repeatedly stressed that people will not have to sell their homes while they are alive to fund care. Speaking at the protest, Sir Ed said there are other ways of funding social care than "setting up May & Co estate agents to come after your home".	A London estate agent has complained to the Liberal Democrats after they used the name of his company in a spoof website attacking Theresa May.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son is the first member of the UK Royal family to have his first birthday marked by a new coin. The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July. The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne. It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014. Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: "We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. "The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies... "Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the £5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations." The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost £80 each from the Royal Mint. The heraldic royal arms incorporates the four quarterings of the royal arms, each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek, a sprig of shamrock and a crown. It was originally created for the Queen and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New York in 1960. George's birth and his christening were also marked with commemorative coins.	A commemorative £5 coin is being produced to honour the first birthday of Prince George of Cambridge.
It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to Â£3.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: "Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. "The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. "Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business." The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not "lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating "perverse incentives". Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a "Fair Pay Charter" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.	Britain's largest companies will have to reveal the pay gap between their CEOs and average workers, under new government proposals.
In an interview with Fox News, he said: "There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?" Mr Trump said he respected President Putin and would prefer to "get along with him". He said he wanted help from Russia in the fight against "Islamic terrorism". Excerpts of the interview with Bill O'Reilly, carried out at Mr Trump's Florida home, have been released ahead of the full interview being broadcast by Fox ahead of Sunday evening's Super Bowl, and on the two following nights. Asked whether he respected Mr Putin, the US president replied: "I do respect him... well I respect a lot of people. That doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him." He added: "I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against Isis [so-called Islamic State], which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world - that's a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea." The two men spoke on the phone last Saturday and have agreed to stay in "regular personal contact" but no date has been set for a meeting. Mr Trump was also asked whether it was responsible to make claims about issues without citing facts to back them up, such as his contention that millions of people voted illegally during the US presidential election that he won - but with almost three million fewer votes than his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. He replied: "Many people have come out and said I'm right, you know that. "When you see illegals, people that are not citizens and they are on the registration rolls... you have illegals, you have dead people... it's really a bad situation."	US President Donald Trump has defended Vladimir Putin when questioned over allegations of murders carried out by the Russian state.
Pernod Ricard, which is based in France, is the second biggest distiller of Scotch after Diageo. Its brands include Chivas, The Glenlivet and Ballentine's. However, the distiller reported that Jameson's, the biggest-selling Irish whiskey, continued to be the star performer among its premium brands. American sales of the Cork-distilled whiskey were up more than 10%. In its update for investors, the drinks company reported total sales rose 3% in the first three months of 2017, and the detail gave some pointers to the market for whisky and other drinks around the world. Pernod Ricard reported the Chinese market "remains challenging for Scotch", while there were more positive sales figures for Martell brandy. Imported spirits have been held back in China by official disapproval of conspicuous business hospitality and gifts. Bar and restaurant sales were reported to remain in decline. The company said Korean sales continue a "strong decline" across its brands. It also reported on the disruptive effect in India of the government removing large amounts of the nation's paper money from circulation, and a new law that will forbid the sale of alcohol close to highways. In Latin America, which has been a strong growth area for Scotch exports, Brazilian sales were weaker due to prolonged recession. But sales across the Pernod Ricard brands were strongly up in other countries, led by Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Cuba. The UK market was described as resilient and "dynamic", because its products were being imported ahead of price increases in March, linked to the weakening of sterling. Among the stronger performers were Absolut vodka and Jameson's. With its full year results for 2015-16, Pernod Ricard reported Jameson's global sales were up 12% by volume and 16% by value. In Scotch whisky, Ballentine's rose 5% by volume over the year, while Chivas was down 5% and Glenlivet single malt by 2%. Another French company with a stake in Scotch whisky, Remy-Martin, this week reported that its sales of "Progressive Hebridean" spirits, including Bruichladdich and The Botanist gin, rose by more than 10% in the year to March.	One of the biggest Scotch whisky distillers has seen faster growth in sales of its Irish whiskey brand, according to new figures.
Brunon Kwiecien, 48, was convicted of planning a terrorist attack, illegal weapons possession and inciting two students to carry out an attack. He suggested he had been manipulated by Polish intelligence agents. Kwiecien was said to be fascinated with Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik. Right-wing extremist Breivik killed 77 people in a bombing and shooting rampage in Norway in July 2011. Kwiecien, a former professor at Krakow's University of Agriculture, was arrested in 2012. Investigators believe he wanted to target parliament with four tonnes of explosives while then-President Bronislaw Komorowski and former Prime Minister Donald Tusk were due to attend, the trial heard. "If Brunon Kwiecien hadn't been stopped, we would be talking amid the ruins of the state today," said judge Aleksandra Almert, according to the AFP agency. While admitting he planned to carry out the attack, he also said he was subject to "provocation" by the intelligence services. Kwiecien is the first Pole to be accused of terrorism, Polish media reported. He has no known links to established extremist groups.	A Polish university lecturer has been sentenced to 13 years in jail for plotting to ram a car packed with explosives into parliament.
Teresa Dennett, 58, needed surgery after a stroke and the coroner concluded "it is likely she would have survived" if the operation went ahead. Nottingham University Hospitals said its intensive care unit was full and suggested she should go to Sheffield. But NHS England said a lack of beds was not a reason for refusing admission. Live updates and more from Nottinghamshire. The death was highlighted by Heidi Connor, assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire, who has written what is known as a Regulation 28 report, which sets out aims to prevent future deaths. She has sent the report to the chief executives of NHS England and two of the hospital trusts involved, following the inquest in Nottingham that ended on 6 January. She wrote: "In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. "Crucially, it was clear there was no written protocol in place to set out a clear pathway for referral for emergency neurosurgery." Meanwhile, the Royal College of Surgeons said it was "saddened" by the death and has called for NHS England to review bed capacity in the face of cuts. In response to the Regulation 28 report Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's National Medical Director, has written to medical directors reminding them of national guidelines. He referred to the Society of British Neurological Surgeons care quality statement (2015), which states: "The lack of critical care beds must not be a reason for refusing admission for patients requiring urgent surgery." However in evidence, the inquest heard adopting the society's statement was voluntary, many of the neurosurgeons involved in the case had not heard of this statement before, and some described it as "aspirational". NHS England must formally respond to the coroner by 30 June. The coroner sent her report to the chief executives of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH) and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH), which must respond by 31 March. NUH said: "We extend our condolences to Mrs Dennett's family and apologise that we were unable to transfer her to our specialist unit immediately to consider surgery. "We are working with partner hospitals to ensure more effective emergency care and transfers to specialist units in this diagnosis." STH said: "If Nottingham had confirmed with us that they could not undertake the surgery, as per the clinical guidelines, we would have operated on Mrs Dennett in Sheffield regardless of bed availability. "We will be discussing with Nottingham and King's Mill Hospitals the lessons which need to be learned in respect of the use of the clinical guidelines, so that the chances of this happening again are limited." King's Mill Hospital is run by Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, whose medical director Dr Andy Haynes said: "The coroner rightly praised our medical registrar for doing all he could to facilitate a very difficult situation." The inquest heard about a proposed new way of working whereby a patient who needs life-saving surgery would be transported immediately to their local unit. This may mean a critical care bed would have to be found for the patient after the operation, even if that requires extensive "bed-juggling", as the coroner termed it. In extreme cases, post-operative treatment could be provided elsewhere.	A woman died after a hospital did not accept her for neurosurgery citing an intensive care bed shortage, an inquest heard.
The Microscope and its Revelations, by Dr William B Carpenter, was borrowed by former pupil Professor Arthur Boycott, who attended Hereford Cathedral School between 1886 and 1894. It was discovered by his granddaughter Alice Gillett. The school has promised to waive any fines - which based on the rate at Hereford Library of 17p a day, would have amounted to a staggering Â£7,446. See more stories from Herefordshire and Worcestershire here Mrs Gillett discovered the book while she was sorting through a collection of 6,000 books following the death of her husband earlier this year. On discovering the HCS library stamp inside the book, Mrs Gillett, who lives near Taunton, decided to return it. "I can't imagine how the school has managed without it," she said. The book would have been of good use to young Boycott as he eventually graduated with first class honours in Natural Science and became a distinguished naturalist and pathologist.	An overdue school library book has finally been returned - 120 years late.
The two nations meet in a 2018 World Cup qualifier on Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Day, when the United Kingdom remembers those who have lost their lives in war. But Fifa, who are in charge of world football, say they do not allow any nations to have any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts. They had turned down a request to allow England and Scotland's players to wear armbands with poppies on. The FAs have now said that they will let their players wear the armbands anyway and will accept any punishment. Poppies are worn by millions as a symbol to remember those who have lost their lives in war or been injured. British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has said Fifa's refusal of players being allowed to wear poppies is "outrageous". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, she said: "Our football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security - I think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so." The Football Association of Wales has also written to Fifa requesting permission to wear poppies on armbands during their game against Serbia in Cardiff on 12 November but has not yet said if it will ignore the ban.	The Football Associations of England and Scotland say they will ignore a ban on players wearing poppies in their upcoming match on 11 November.
The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. "Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was "taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria". He said there was now "more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region. Turkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this.	Nine British nationals have been detained in Turkey after allegedly trying to enter Syria illegally.
The attacks, occurring from 2011 to 2013, are believed to have been co-ordinated from Iranian companies. The US Department of Justice revealed an indictment against the seven, believed to be working for their government in Iran. The indictment calls them "experienced computer hackers" and officials said the attacks were a "wake-up call". It is the first time the US is charging people associated with a national government with hacking into US infrastructure for major industries like finance and water. The attacks "threatened our economic well-being and our ability to compete fairly in the global marketplace - both of which are directly linked to our national security," said US Attorney General Loretta Lynch. "And we believe that they were conducted with the sole purpose of undermining the targeted companies and damaging the online operation of America's free market." Mrs Lynch said the attacks cost the victims tens of millions of dollars. Ahmad Fathi, Hamid Firoozi, Amin Shokohi, Sadegh Ahmadzadegan, Omid Ghaffarinia, Sina Keissar and Nader Seidi are identified in the indictment as the alleged attackers. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit and aid and abet computer hacking. It is almost certain that Iran will not send the accused to the US, and they have not been arrested. The indictment is still important, said FBI director James Comey. "The world is small, and our memories are long," he said. "We never say never. People often like to travel for vacation or education, and we want them looking over their shoulder."	The US has charged seven Iranians for allegedly hacking nearly 50 financial companies and a New York dam.
The move, if enacted, would make them the first UK banks to introduce negative interest rates, in effect, charging to deposit money. "Global interest rates remain at very low levels... this could result in us charging interest on credit balances," it wrote in a letter to customers. Personal customers are not affected. However, charities and community groups are counted as business clients and so would be affected by the changes, the banks said. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns NatWest, told the BBC the letter was sent to just under 1.3 million of the combined business and commercial customers of the two banks. "We will consider any necessary action in the event of the Bank of England base rate falling below zero, but will do our utmost to protect our customers from any impacts," they said. Jack: The weird world of negative interest rates The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 170,000 members, called on other banks to update customers of any changes to their Business Current Account (BCA) "during this uncertain economic period". Mike Cherry, National Chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), said the warning from Natwest and RBS "will be deeply concerning to small firms". The FSB also urged the Bank of England to consider the impact on smaller firms of cutting interest rates. Mike Amey, a managing director at investment firm Pimco, said the two banks were "giving themselves wiggle room in the very unlikely event" that the Bank turns the official interest rate negative. "The Bank of England sets the interest rate next week, so the fact they put this out this week... is possibly a bit of a reminder to the Bank of England there are negative consequences," he told the BBC. UK interest rates have been unchanged since the Bank of England cut them to a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. The Bank kept them on hold earlier this month, despite speculation it would cut rates further. But Bank governor Mark Carney has said it is likely "some monetary policy easing" will be required to boost the UK economy in response to the Brexit vote. However, he has said he does not favour rates falling any lower than 0.25%. Nevertheless, some economists believe that rates could still be cut to zero or lower later this year. When the rate goes below zero, the normal relationship between banks and customers is reversed. Instead of the lender getting paid interest by the bank for allowing it to use their money, the lender has to pay the bank for holding their money. The underlying idea is much the same as cutting interest rates in more normal times. The aim is to encourage more borrowing and spending by firms and less saving. In 2014, the European Central Bank was the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates, with the aim of encouraging banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money.	NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) have warned businesses they may have to charge them to accept deposits due to low interest rates.
The emergency services were called to Glenapp Road in the Pollokshields area of the city at about 11:50. Two people were taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. They are thought to have been suffering from smoke inhalation. Other residents from the flats received medical assessments at the scene.	A fire in a block of tenement flats in Glasgow has left two people requiring hospital treatment.
In the US it took $204.6m (£132m) according to early estimates, making it the second biggest opening weekend ever just behind 2012's Marvel's The Avengers with $207.4m (£133.8m). What is the secret to the film's success? Although he spent many years in supporting roles and is best known for his comic role in cult US sitcom Parks and Recreation, Pratt has become one of Hollywood's most bankable stars in the past year. He starred in two of 2014's top five grossing films at the US box office - The Lego Movie and Guardians of the Galaxy. An endearing mixture of charm, vulnerability and humour means he can humanise even the most effects-laden summer blockbusters - something he proved in Marvel's Guardians, where his co-stars were a talking raccoon and a giant animated tree. Against expectations, the film took $774m (£499m) at the global box office - making it the third highest-grossing film in 2014. The actor didn't exactly get hit with the ugly stick, either. There is a strict quota on the number of foreign films which can be screened in China - currently set at 34 movies a year. But the country's film market is the world's second largest after the US so getting your film on the list can boost box office takings considerably. Most Hollywood blockbusters do not open in China the same time as the US but unusually, Jurassic World opened in both territories the same weekend. The film opened in 66 foreign markets in total, earning $307.2m (£198m). China accounted for $100.8m (£65m) - almost 20% of its total haul. When Jurassic Park was released Imax screens were scarce, reserved usually for short films, documentaries and theme park novelties. With some 800 Imax screens around the world now, the prospect of seeing dinosaurs even larger than life-size has proved to be a compelling draw. With the added ability to see a T-Rex in 3D, it seems audiences have been happy to pay premium prices for extra spectacle - bumping up box office returns in the process. According to box office analysts Rentrak, nearly 50% of Jurassic World's US box office came from 3D screenings. Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park holds a special place in the memories of many cinema fans. It set a new standard for CGI, and became a touchstone of 1990s cinema, capturing a generation's imagination. "I was 12 when Jurassic Park came out and it just blew me away," Jurassic World actress Dallas Bryce Howard told the BBC. "I remember watching it and thinking, 'I'm seeing real dinosaurs right now'. It felt so real." "I was 13 years old and I felt the same," her co-star Chris Pratt added. "I had complete Jurassic-mania and saw it twice in one weekend." After two sequels which failed to match the success of the original at both the box office and with critcs, fans hoped the new film would bring back the magic, thrills and horror of Spielberg's classic - and many dragged their children with them.	Jurassic World has become the first film to take more than $500m (£322m) at the global box office on its opening weekend.

The League One club have also signed Norwich City midfielder Ebou Adams on loan until January. Adams, 21, signed from non-league Dartford in February 2016, will be making his second loan move from Carrow Road, having had a brief three-game stint with Braintree last season. Jules, 20, did not play a first-team game for the Royals. But he did make 10 Scottish Premiership appearances for Motherwell during a loan spell last season, and he was a member of the Scotland Under-20 squad that finished third at the recent Toulon tournament. Shrewsbury have now made five summer signings, having previously brought in strikers Lenell John-Lewis and Arthur Gnahoua and midfielder Jon Nolan.

The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun. The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta). The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country. This marks the sixth arrest in the crime. Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced. "All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun," a police officer told the BBC. Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train. In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case. During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself.	Police investigating the rape of an elderly nun in the Indian state of West Bengal say they have arrested a key suspect in the crime.
In an election pledge, Labour said giving working parents 30 hours free childcare a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra £84m annually. Economist Gillian Paull told BBC Wales the "upper limit" could reach £200m if "nearly all" parents took up the offer. The Welsh Government said it was currently analysing the likely costs. The promise to provide 30 hours free childcare a week was one of Labour's key election pledges and is now part of its five-year programme for government. The childcare will be made available to working parents of three- and four-year-olds for 48 weeks of the year. In a report for the Welsh Government in February, Ms Paull, of Frontier Economics, produced various cost estimates for the policy. It said the cost would be £84m a year if the childcare was offered to working parents and if 87% of them took up the offer at a cost of £5 per hour. However, Ms Paull warned that she thought the policy was unlikely to encourage many non-working parents to take up jobs. The Welsh Government insists the policy will remove one of the "major barriers to employment". Ms Paull said if the policy proved to be successful in enabling large numbers of parents take up jobs, its annual cost would increase considerably. "The cost estimate [in the report] is based on a very small response in working behaviour," she told the Sunday Politics Wales programme. "If there is a bigger response, the cost could be considerably higher. "A reasonable upper limit would be around £200m, based on an extreme response of nearly all parents becoming eligible by working." David Dallimore, a social policy researcher at Bangor University, warned that money would also have to be spent expanding the availability of childcare in Wales, which he claimed was already "patchy". "It's very dependent on where you live," he said. "Wales has a measurably lower rate of childcare than other nations in the UK. "In Wales it's about 30 childcare places for every 100 children - it's about 40 in England and it's nearly 50 in Scotland." He added: "I think there's a lot of concern within the sector that there isn't enough provision to be able to deliver this [policy] in the current form we have." Indicating the end of the Communities First anti-poverty programme on Tuesday, Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant cited the childcare policy as a way of helping parents find work. "Across government we are ensuring prosperity for all," he said. "The creation of a generous childcare offer for working parents will help to remove one of the major barriers to employment." A Welsh Government spokeswoman said:  "We know there are issues with capacity and cost in some parts of Wales and we are working with the childcare sector to address this. "We are also currently undertaking complex modelling of costs. "We have a cost range, and the purpose of our modelling and analysis is to look at key factors such as the number of eligible children, take-up rates, number of hours utilised and hourly cost, all of which impact on the overall cost estimates." Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales on Sunday 16 October at 1100 BST	Welsh Labour's promise to increase free childcare could cost considerably more than it has predicted, the author of a report on the matter has said.
One woman was injured on Wednesday's incident, which led to dozens of nudist sunbathers fleeing Carataggio beach near Porto-Vecchio. Witnesses said the man had threatened the group if they did not get dressed. When they refused, he allegedly pulled out a rifle and started firing. The injured woman, reportedly in her thirties, was hit in the thigh as she ran away. The suspect - whose identity has not been revealed - owns a beachside cafe, police said on Friday. One man had been questioned in connection with the shooting but had since been released. Despite being famous among nudists, the beach is not an official naturist site and locals have complained about their presence there.	A shootout on a beach popular among naturists on the French island of Corsica was caused by a local businessman who disagreed with their presence there, police say.
They were on board an anti-piracy vessel, the Seaman Guard Ohio, which was detained in October, 2013. They face charges including straying into Indian waters and carrying weapons without permission. Another British man, Paul Towers from Yorkshire, remains in jail along with the ship's Ukrainian captain. News of the men's release was confirmed by an international maritime lawyer who is close to the case. He said: "Yes, they are out. Checking in to hotel and looking forward to a beer." The five men freed on bail were: Billy Irving, 33, of Oban in Argyll, John Armstrong, of Wigton, in Cumbria, Nick Dunn, 28, of Ashington in Northumberland, Ray Tindall, 38, of Chester, and Nicholas Simpson, originally of Cottingham in East Yorkshire. All of them must remain in India. Their employer AdvanFort, a maritime security patrol specialist, has always insisted the men were working to provide protection to other ships from pirate attacks. Nick Dunn's sister Lisa has commented on social media: "After 169 horrific days that Nick Dunn has spent in prison and another five being detained on the ship, I'm over the moon to say that the first hurdle is now cleared ... he's out!"	Five British men who were being held on arms charges have been freed on bail from an Indian jail, according to a lawyer close to the case.
Community union said 250 jobs are to go, mainly at Llanwern, which employs 1,500 workers. Tata said it needed to "reduce costs and focus on manufacturing higher-value products". The Welsh government said it would look at how it could help Tata, calling the news "extremely disappointing". A spokesman added: "We have repeatedly lobbied the UK government for urgent action to address issues such as high energy costs that are disadvantaging the steel industry across the UK against our overseas competitors." Tata would not confirm the exact number of job losses but said they were mainly agency and contract workers. The GMB union called it "more bad news for the steel industry" while Unite said job losses were "very disappointing". This is the third time in six years that parts of the Llanwern steel processing plant have been mothballed because of market conditions. On the previous occasions, work was stopped for between nine and 10 months. Community union, which has the most members at Llanwern, acknowledged Tata was under "huge pressure to reduce costs" but said laying off employees was "extremely regretful". The job losses will involve fixed-term contract and agency workers although the union said these included people who had been working at the plant for a number of years. Sue Lewis, regional organiser, said: "We saw these mainly younger employees as the future of Llanwern and the steel industry in Newport so we're devastated at these job losses. "We also have to remember that for every worker employed at Tata, three jobs outside also depend on those workers, so it's the ripple effect throughout the community." It comes a year after the company announced 400 jobs were to go at its steelmaking plant in Port Talbot, Neath Port Talbot. Tata has confirmed some of its coil processing facilities, including the hot strip mill, will "come out of production" but added that they would be retained so they can be "restarted in more favourable market conditions". The company also said employees at Llanwern would be redeployed within the business. Tata currently employs 6,950 workers at five plants in Wales. Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent Steelmaking is a tough business.  It faces two main issues. Firstly, domestically there is the cost of producing steel in the UK which is driven in no small part by energy costs, which are higher than other parts of Europe. We also need to look at the price of steel from around the world. We've seen with the Chinese economy slowing down that more steel is available from China as it's not needed as much there. That steel is making its way here and being bought because it is cheaper, although not the same quality. This is having an impact not just on steel manufacturers in the UK but across Europe. Tata has made a huge amount of investment including a new blast furnace in Port Talbot which makes it cheaper to produce steel. A lot of the staff - as opposed to the fixed term workers - from Llanwern have been moving there. Processing work will remain at Llanwern. WHAT HAPPENS AT LLANWERN? Hot strip mill - this reheats semi-finished slabs of steel to near melting point and then rolls them thinner and longer and then they are sold as coils. This is being mothballed. Pickle line - this removes oxide scale which forms when the steel is rolled. It is also rinsed and dried before finishing. One of Llanwern's two lines will close. Cold strip mill - this process compresses and squeezes steel at room temperature, reducing its thickness and improving its surface and strength. This is being mothballed. Galvanising line - a coating of zinc is applied for steel for the car market and products ranging from washing machines to DVD players. Llanwern invested Â£3.6m on its Zodiac line a couple of years ago. This is staying open. UK Business Minister Anna Soubry MP said: "There is no doubt that the steel industry is facing very challenging market conditions, with global overcapacity, steep falls in prices and currency devaluations. "However the government continues to work closely with the sector to provide help where we can." Welsh Conservatives have labelled reports of huge job losses at Tata's site in Llanwern "shocking" and "devastating". Newport East assembly member John Griffiths said he hoped the announcement was a temporary measure. "We want investment from Tata and a long-term view on expansion and growth here," he said. "I'm hoping it is indeed mothballed rather than removed all together."	Tata Steel is to mothball part of its plant in Newport for the third time in six years with the loss of hundreds of jobs.
The council's cabinet had recommended changing Brecon High School to an English-medium school from 1 September. But 32 members of full council opposed the plans, with eight in favour. The vote was taken as an indication of the full council's views but it was not a final decision. That rests with the cabinet which meets on 14 March. A council report said low pupil numbers and the "need to ensure robust linguistic progression and appropriate curriculum choice for Welsh-medium pupils" were the reasons for the recommendation. The council plans to centralise Welsh-medium education for mid and south Powys in Builth Wells High School, which is a 40 mile round trip. A consultation has been carried out on the plans, with staff, parents and pupils raising a number of concerns. Among them were pupils missing out on extra-curricular activities, such as after school clubs and music lessons, due to having to travel to Builth Wells for Welsh-medium education.	A majority of councillors voted in favour of retaining a Welsh-medium stream at a Powys school on Tuesday.
The Australian was poised to take the lead from eventual winner Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes only for a slow pit stop because his tyres were not ready to delay him. The problem followed a mistake costing him a win in Spain two weeks ago. "I got called in and the tyres weren't ready. I didn't make the call," Ricciardo said. "The guys were running around like ducks, I don't like being up here and being miserable because I got a podium in F1 and it should be a good day but when it happens two races in a row it is hard to take." He had earlier told the team over the radio on the slowing-down lap: "Nothing you could say would make that any better. Save it." Watch: Allan McNish explains Red Bull's "colossal mess-up" Ricciardo pitted a lap after Hamilton finally made a stop to switch from his 'extreme' wet tyres, which he had used from the start of the race, and had built enough of a margin on that tour to reclaim the lead. But the delay at the stop meant Hamilton blasted past as he rejoined the track. He added: "I felt it should have been me. If Barcelona wasn't clear, this one was crystal clear. I took Barcelona on the chin and this one I don't know if I can handle it as good as I did. "This is such a prestigious race. I may win it in the future but this one I will never get back so it hurts a lot more than any other." As for any explanation from the team, he said: "Right now I don't want to hear it. I just want to get out of here. It will be talked about but now is not the time to do it." Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko said: "We presented it to Mercedes. Unfortunately, a lot of misunderstanding and not the right communication. "We will investigate and find out [what happened], but it was a human mistake. "We will check it, make an investigation, and then we can tell you more. I feel really sorry [for Ricciardo], all we can do is apologise to him." Race result Monaco Grand Prix coverage details	Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said he felt "screwed" by the pit-stop error that cost him victory in Monaco.
Mr Abbott told Australian media that the only way to prevent people dying at sea was to "stop the boats". Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere. On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as "brutal". In an editorial, the newspaper said the "ruthlessly effective" policy was "inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war". It said it would be "unconscionable" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested. Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was "very sad". "If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats," he told ABC Radio. "Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats." On Thursday, Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State (IS), from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing, was worse than the Nazis. "The Nazis did terrible evil, but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it," he told Sydney Radio 2GB. But IS militants, he said, "boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing". The Executive Council of Australian Jewry Robert Goot said the comment was "injudicious and unfortunate", saying there was "a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy". "The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder," he told Australian media. Mr Abbott later said he stood by his comments, but that he was not in the "business of ranking evil".	Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe is proof of the need for tough asylum policies.
Sir Timothy O'Shea said plans to elect the chair of universities' governing bodies were "inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging". The proposal is made in the Scottish government's Higher Education Governance Bill. The Scottish government said it would continue to listen to all views. The bill aims to improve the way universities - which are fiercely protective of their independence from the state - are governed. Although universities get a large chunk of their income from the Scottish government, unlike schools and colleges they are not part of the public sector or directly accountable to politicians. The proposal which has caused the most controversy is for directly elected chairs for university courts - students and staff would be able to take part in the vote. But this is seen by some as a threat to the role of the rector at the ancient universities. The role of the rector is sometimes seen as purely symbolic and ceremonial. However, supporters argue the best rectors can be powerful ambassadors for their universities and champions of the students' interests. Prof Sir Timothy said amendments to the bill could prove damaging to his university. He said the amendments would allow for two elected positions playing a chairing role in the university - a rector and a senior lay member. This would suggest changing what he described as the "the long-established and well-understood role of our rector - without any prior consultation or discussion." He also argued the senior lay member would appear to have significantly weaker powers than their counterparts at other universities - without any prior consultation. Sir Timothy said: "The amendments are inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging for one of Scotland's major universities. "There has been no consultation or discussion with us, or the wider sector on the implications, which require careful consultation and scrutiny otherwise there is a real risk of perverse and possibly unintended consequences." He argued it could even significantly impede the university's ability to contribute to the economic and social good of the country. He urged Holyrood's education committee to ask the government to withdraw these amendments until they have consulted with those affected on the implications of their proposals. However, Sir Timothy also welcomed amendments to the bill, including one which removed some additional ministerial powers that he argued threatened the university's institutional autonomy. A Scottish government spokesperson said: "The Higher Education Governance Bill aims to ensure that the entire campus community has a say on how our higher education institutions are governed. "We have worked closely with the sector over the course of the bill's development and will continue to listen to the views of all interested parties and consider all constructive suggestions as the bill continues to be considered by parliament. "The detail of how a rector and new elected senior lay member would work together would remain, as now, a matter for each autonomous institution to address. The bill does not change that." The Scottish government said any expansion in the role of the rector in a higher education institution beyond the current role set out in statute would be a matter for each institution. "We think that the post of senior lay member should be an elected one," the spokesperson said. "This role is pivotal in the leadership of all Scottish institutions, and all staff and students should have their say in appointing the best candidate for the role. "The model for appointment of the senior lay member proposed by the Scottish Government has been discussed with stakeholders."	Plans for changes in the way universities are governed are facing a fresh attack from the principal of Edinburgh University.
The fire raged across the city from 2 to 5 September 1666, destroying more than 13,000 houses and 87 churches. The stamps are designed by comic book artist John Higgins, who has used a graphic novel style of illustration. They feature scenes from the start, spread and aftermath of the Great Fire, using a street map design. Higgins has contributed to titles such as Judge Dredd and 2000 AD. Philip Parker, from Royal Mail, said: "Despite the terrible devastation caused by the Great Fire, it provided the opportunity for the regeneration of large swathes of the city and shaped the London we know today. "It was the catalyst of the building of iconic landmarks such as St Paul's Cathedral and dozens of parish churches. "It is fitting that we mark the anniversary of the fire with an innovative set of stamps that re-imagine the events."	The 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London is being commemorated with a set of six new stamps.
The 36-year-old former assistant coach at St Mirren and Cowdenbeath has helped Michael O'Neill steer his fifth seeds to a place in the finals in France. "It makes me proud, but I'm also disappointed Scotland didn't qualify," Macphee told BBC Scotland. "We're the first team from pot five to win a group." Macphee had an unremarkable playing career, with spells at East Fife, Forfar Athletic and Queen's Park before he embarked on a footballing scholarship in the United States. His playing career took him to Romania with Braila and Japan with Kariya before turning to management and leading Cupar Hearts to the Scottish Amateur Cup final in 2007. Macphee then worked with Danny Lennon at Cowdenbeath and St Mirren, where he helped the club win the League Cup. "That season, we made a strong start to the league then beating Celtic in the cup semi-final at Hampden was fantastic and going on to lift the Cup against Hearts," he said. Northern Ireland manager O'Neill was impressed by Macphee's performance analysis work in Paisley and soon brought him into the international set-up. "Unless you're a Barcelona, a Real Madrid, or a Manchester United, where you can quite simply have your own playing identity because you know your players are better than the opponent, there is an element there you can disregard the opponent," he said. Media playback is not supported on this device "I know from conversations with Jonny Evans, Alex Ferguson - apart from the Champions League - didn't pay any attention to the opponent. "He filled the players with belief that 'Manchester United play this way and we are better'. At the biggest clubs in the world, you can play this way. "St Mirren are clearly not one of them and Michael learned from speaking to players and other managers about my work." While Scotland will be watching from home next summer, Northern Ireland won their group ahead of Romania, Hungary, Greece, Finland and the Faroe Islands despite a limited group of players to pick from. Among their squad are players from the likes of Fleetwood Town and Doncaster Rovers, while seven players are currently playing in Scottish football. "I don't think it's necessarily a surprise that Michael O'Neill has managed to turn Northern Ireland around," said Macphee, who also scouted for Mexico at last year's World Cup in Brazil. "I think a lot of people don't know what he achieved with Shamrock Rovers. "He managed to win the league twice there, but the most remarkable achievement there for Michael - he took them into the Europa League. "He did that with players on 42-week contracts. That's basically part-time footballers he's taken into the group stage. "I know from discussing with him the budget was only about £450,000, which to give you idea of scale is half that of any Scottish top-flight club." Macphee, who runs sport tours and football academy businesses, added: "It's not a case of managing expectations. "We've already achieved something which people will see as remarkable. "The team spirit in the group of players is unbelievable. "The humility from the top players like Jonny Evans and Steven Davis, just because of the gulf in what the players earn, everybody's equal and we will keep that unity between staff and players."	Austin Macphee could be the only Scotsman at Euro 2016 after being part of the coaching set-up at Northern Ireland.
In a statement, the US said it was an "extra-judicial release" of detainees that would be "a major step backwards". The detainees are part of a group of 88 prisoners previously held by the US but handed to Afghan control in 2013. The US insists they are "dangerous individuals" but Afghanistan says there is not enough evidence against them. Earlier this month, the Afghan government announced it would release 72 out of the 88 prisoners, prompting almost instant condemnation from the US  which said there was "strong evidence" linking the 72 to "terror-related crimes". Hundreds of prisoners at Bagram jail have been freed since the Afghan government took over the running of the prison in March last year. But it is the fate of these 88 detainees which has proved so controversial. Of the 72 prisoners it plans to free, the Afghan government says there is no evidence against 45, while the evidence against 27 others is not enough to put them on trial. But the US has said any releases would constitute a breach of a memorandum of understanding agreed between the two sides at the time the US handed over control of Bagram jail, where these prisoners were held. "The ARB [Afghan Review Board] is releasing back to society dangerous insurgents who have Afghan blood on their hands," Monday's statement from the US military said, on learning that a release order had been granted for 37 of these men. It went on to say that among the 37 are 17 who are linked to bomb attacks and others who had knowledge of or were directly involved in attacks which wounded or killed Afghan and coalition soldiers. The two countries have been at loggerheads over President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign a security deal with Washington that would set the final framework for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. According to the UN Security Council's mandate, the US-led international military force in Afghanistan is scheduled to hand over all security duties to Afghan forces before its full withdrawal by the end of 2014. But if a "Security and Defence Co-operation Agreement" is signed between the two countries, about 10,000 US troops could stay in Afghanistan for another 10 years.	The US military has condemned an order  by the Afghan government to release 37 prisoners deemed by the Americans to pose a threat to security.
Researchers looked at three areas of England, 20 years apart, and found new rates of dementia were lower than past trends would suggest. They say improvements in men's health is the most likely explanation. But charities warn against complacency, with more than 200,000 dementia cases diagnosed each year in the UK. Researchers, funded by the Medical Research Council and dementia charities, interviewed about 7,500 people aged 65 and over living in Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Newcastle in the early 1990s. The whole process, which included detailed questionnaires about cognition and lifestyle, was repeated in the same way two decades later. They found rates of new cases of dementia had been fairly steady in women over this time, but had fallen in men. Extrapolating their findings to apply to the rest of the UK, they say there would be 40,000 fewer cases of the disease than estimates put forward two decades ago would suggest. Scientists admit they are unsure exactly what lies behind this trend but say it could be that men have become better at looking after themselves. For example, better heart and brain health - with fewer men smoking, less salt used in food, and a greater emphasis on exercise and blood pressure medication may have helped, they say. They acknowledge it is hard to decipher why the same trends are not apparent in women, but speculate men may be catching up on health gains that women already experience. Despite this, they warn that other factors - such as rising levels of obesity and diabetes - may reverse this trend in years to come. Prof Carol Brayne, at the University of Cambridge, and part of the research team, said: "I'm pretty optimistic that it's stabilising, but if we don't further improve health, then we would expect the numbers to go up with further ageing of the population, so it's a sort of cautious optimism." Scientists say the most important finding is that a rise in dementia is not inevitable and can be fought. And they call for a better balance of funds so more money is put into prevention in mid-life. Meanwhile, Dr James Pickett, head of research at the charity Alzheimer's Society, said the research was encouraging. But he added: "People are living for longer, and with other risk factors such as diabetes and obesity on the rise, there will still be over 200,000 new cases of dementia each year. "That's still an enormous number of people who require better information and health and social care support." Other experts point out the way dementia is diagnosed has changed over time and initiatives focusing on spotting the signs of dementia earlier may offset any reductions seen.	The predicted explosion of dementia cases may be less severe than previously thought, a study in Nature Communications suggests.
Scores more are still missing in Teluk Wondama district after flash floods and landslides that were triggered when a river burst its banks. Hundreds of people have been injured and more than 5,000 are being housed in tents set up in emergency camps. The National Search and Rescue Agency and military have sent reinforcements to help deal with the disaster. The sudden flooding on Monday caught residents by surprise, officials said, contributing to the high death toll. The local airport has now reopened and roads have been largely cleared of debris, which is helping to speed up aid deliveries to the area, reports say. Navy warships had previously been used to carry tents, medical supplies and food to the disaster zone. Thousands of buildings, roads and bridges in five villages have been damaged or destroyed. The head of the the provincial relief agency, Dortheis Sawaki, said 104 bodies had been recovered, but many more people were missing and the death toll was expected to rise. "It's a tragedy. The smell of rotting corpses is everywhere. Power is down. There's no clean water," she was quoted by AP as saying. Many parts of the country had been badly hit by heavy rains, winds and high waves this year, meteorologists said.	More than 100 people are now known to have died in flooding in the eastern Indonesian province of West Papua.
Leading man Leonardo DiCaprio won best actor in a drama, while Alejandro G Inarritu won for its direction. Ridley Scott hit The Martian was named best comedy or musical film, winning a further Globe for star Matt Damon. Room star Brie Larson was named best actress in a drama, while Jennifer Lawrence won best comedy actress. British winners included Kate Winslet, picking up the best supporting actress award for her role in Steve Jobs, as the Apple guru's assistant; singer Sam Smith, for his Bond track Writing's On The Wall, and the BBC's adaptation of Wolf Hall was named best mini-series. But hopefuls Eddie Redmayne, Dame Helen Mirren, Dame Maggie Smith and Idris Elba missed out. Mark Rylance, who - like Elba - was nominated in both the TV and film categories, was tipped to win the best supporting actor Globe for his role in Bridge of Spies, but lost out to Sylvester Stallone for his comeback performance as Rocky Balboa in Creed. "I was here in 1977 and I was hit by tumbleweed - and the view is so beautiful now," said Stallone, who received a standing ovation. Steve Jobs picked up the award for Aaron Sorkin's screenplay - making the biopic the only other multiple film winner of the night. There were no awards for Todd Haynes's critically acclaimed love story Carol, nor for the much admired Spotlight. There was also nothing for George Miller or his Mad Max reboot Fury Road, nor did The Big Short or The Danish Girl make good on any of their nominations. As widely predicted, Pixar's Inside Out won best animated film and veteran Italian composer Ennio Morricone won his third Golden Globe for Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. In the television categories, the streaming services' original dramas Mr Robot and Mozart in the Jungle won awards. Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal was named best actor in a comedy or musical TV series for his role as brash conductor Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle, and Christian Slater won the best supporting actor in a series for Mr Robot - shutting out British star Damian Lewis (Wolf Hall) and Alan Cumming (The Good Wife). Having missed out on an Emmy in September, Empire star Taraji P Henson was named best actress in a TV drama series and Mad Men's Jon Hamm picked up his second best actor Golden Globe for Mad Men - eight years after winning his first at the start of the series. But, in an otherwise disparate night, the evening belonged to Alejandro G Inarritu's survivalist tale The Revenant - and the combined power of Inarritu's direction and DiCaprio's visceral performance. The victory comes just a year after Inarritu lost the best director prize to Richard Linklater, when Inarritu's Birdman faced off with Linklater's Boyhood - though Inarritu went on to win the Oscar. It must also put DiCaprio centre stage for the Oscar that has eluded him throughout his career. "This has been the most difficult journey I have embarked upon," said Inarritu, receiving his award. "But we all, in this room, know pain is temporary - but a film is forever. So who cares?"	The Revenant has triumphed at this year's Golden Globes, winning the night's most coveted prize for best dramatic film.
Shepherd Murombedzi caught the hosts cold to play in Harry White and the former Barnsley forward made no mistake to fire Solihull in front after nine minutes. White could have made it comfortable for Solihull just before the break, but he was unable to hit the target after George Carline's neat flick put him through. Bromley were left frustrated as Brandon Hanlan and Mark Goldberg squandered decent chances. And Solihull were left clinging on when debutant Daniel Udoh picked up two yellow cards to be sent off with five minutes remaining - just eight minutes after coming off the bench. Report supplied by the Press Association Match ends, Bromley 0, Solihull Moors 1. Second Half ends, Bromley 0, Solihull Moors 1. Joe Anderson (Bromley) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.

The study examined footage of the footballer before and after 2007, the year the Beckhams moved to Los Angeles. David dropped his H sounds at the start of words far less often than before the move to the US, the study found. And in a separate video study of wife Victoria, the ex-Spice Girl was found to be "definitely getting posher". A university spokesman said the research was part of a study into "how changing circumstances affect the way we pronounce words". Researchers contrasted the way Beckhams spoke before and after their move to the US, when David signed for Los Angeles Galaxy. Charles Boorman and Alix Roberts looked at changes in David's speech, while Naomi Proszynska and James Pickett investigated how Victoria spoke. The research revealed that David dropped the H in words such as "him" and "has" 80% of the time before the move to the US, but only 20% of the time afterwards. Mr Boorman said it was "clear that Becks, once a broader Cockney, nowadays speaks with more of a standard English accent". "In fact, he's even hyper-correcting himself, because he puts Hs into words when it's not really required - in America, they use the H sound more, which explains how he acquired it. "But my guess is that his dropping of those Cockney vowels was linked to his ambassadorial role for the Olympics and his subsequent high social status." Victoria - dubbed Posh Spice during her days with the Spice Girls - was found to correctly pronounce Ls in words such as "all" 25% of the time in 1997, with the figure rising to 46% in 2012. "All" can be pronounced "awe" by "working-class people in the south-east of England", the researchers said. Source: University of Manchester Ms Proszynska said: "In 1997, her speech resembled what we associate with the classic Essex girl but, by 2012, her speech no longer so strongly represented her Essex roots. "We think this may be connected with the fact that she's forged a different career as a widely respected fashion designer." Linguistics lecturer Dr Laurel MacKenzie said pronunciation was not "static" in adults. "The general assumption is that once we pass puberty our way of speaking is fixed," she said. "But recent research has revealed the extent to which we can be chameleons in the way we speak, even into adulthood. "Factors such as social mobility and geographical location can have an impact on the way adults pronounce words."	David Beckham has changed his speech over the past decade to "sound less working class", University of Manchester academics have concluded.
Of these 216 planets, 10 of them could potentially be home to some sort of life, because they are 'Earth-like'. This means they have 'rocky' characteristics, and they are located in the 'Goldilocks Zone' of their solar system. If a planet is in a 'Goldilocks Zone' it is not too hot or too cold, which means water can be in its liquid form there. The Kepler Telescope has made some amazing discoveries since it was launched in 2009, but here are the top five findings... In 2014 the telescope made a huge discovery by finding a planet nicknamed: 'Earth 2.0'. The planet called, Kepler-452b has been dubbed as 'Earth 2.0', because it shares many characteristics with our Earth, even though it is 1,400 light years away from us. The first potentially habitable planet the telescope found was Kepler-22b, way back in 2011. Scientists agreed the planet was could be liveable because it was the perfect distance from its sun. In April 2017 the telescope found a super-Earth. This is a planet called LHS 1140b. It is a good candidate for life and orbits a red dwarf star 40 light years away. However, scientists think the planet might have had an ocean made entirely out of magma! - which released steam into the atmosphere. In February 2017, Kepler discovered seven new Earth-sized exoplanets. Exoplanets are planets that orbit a different star to our Sun - in a different solar system to the one we are in. In 2011 Nasa discovered the first planet to orbit two suns! It is called Kepler-16b, and is roughly 200 light years away from Earth. Some scientists have compared it to Luke Skywalker's home planet Tatooine, from the Star Wars movies, which also had two suns.	Nasa's Kepler telescope has recently found 216 new planets, meaning it has now discovered more than 4000 potential new worlds!
Carmarthenshire council funded chief executive Mark James in his case over remarks made on Jacqui Thompson's blog. Mr James said in 2012 he would not keep any damages he won. Mrs Thompson, of Llanwrda, must pay Mr James damages of £25,000 in instalments but Mr James's lawyers would not say if this had been or would be given to the council. As well as the damages, Mrs Thompson must also pay about £5,000 in interest and nearly £15,000 in costs for March's enforcement hearing - all the money is due by 2032. BBC Wales understands the legal fees paid by the council on Mr James's behalf were in excess of £35,000. The authority's pledge to cover these fees was found to be unlawful by the Wales Audit Office. Mr James said in 2012 he was not motivated by money and vowed any damages he won would "be paid over to the authority". When asked if this was still the case, his solicitors, Acuity Legal, said Mr James "did not intend to give any further statements or any interviews on this subject". At a hearing at Carmarthen County Court on 23 March to determine a possession order on Mrs Thompson's house, Mark Spackman, on behalf of Mr James, said this was his intention "on a voluntary basis" but was "irrelevant" to the hearing. Judge John Parsons said: "Mr Spackman has told us he's entitled to change his mind... and it appears he has." The council is not seeking to recoup the money it paid for Mr James's legal fees but is pursuing £190,393 owed by Mrs Thompson. A High Court ruling said the blogger's "unlawful campaign of harassment and defamation" against Mr James meant she was "the author of her own misfortune". Mrs Thompson said it would be "completely unacceptable" if Mr James had changed his mind and chosen to keep the money A council spokesman said: "The council's position on this matter is well documented and subject of public record. There is nothing further to add."	A council boss has refused to say if he will honour a vow to repay compensation won in a libel case to the authority.
As part of a three-year package, London and Manchester will also host legs of the World Grand Prix series in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Steve Flynn, director of GB Taekwondo, said the events would give the sport "a chance to drive real growth". The GB Taekwondo team includes two-time Olympic champion Jade Jones. Rio silver medallist Lutalo Muhammad, bronze medallist Bianca Walkden and Mahama Cho, who finished fourth, are also in the Manchester-based squad. The bid team - which beat competition from American city Houston - is also discussing the possibility of hosting the World Para Taekwondo Championships alongside the Grand Prix event at the Copper Box Arena in London next year.	Manchester will host the 2019 World Taekwondo Championships - after a record-breaking medal haul for Britain at this summer's Olympic Games in Rio.
Commons Leader Chris Grayling said the change, also applying in some cases to Welsh MPs, would bring "real fairness to our constitutional arrangements". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon called the plan "staggering in the extent... of its hypocrisy and incoherence". Labour said it was an "outrage" that ministers wanted to rush into making "profound constitutional change". Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said the plans risked creating two classes of MPs and accused the Conservatives of a "cynical" attempt to "manufacture itself a very much larger" majority in the Commons. Under the proposals, all MPs would continue to vote on all key stages of legislation. But English MPs - and in some cases English and Welsh MPs - will have a veto in Westminster when debating matters that have been devolved to the devolved administrations. MPs will debate the changes on 15 July, Mr Grayling said, and the system will be changed using the rules - known as standing orders - that dictate how Parliament conducts its business. With more powers set to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament after September's independence referendum, Tory MPs have said it is not right that MPs representing Scottish constituencies can continue to determine laws affecting England only. Mr Grayling told MPs that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were getting a "stronger voice" and that it was "only fair" to do the same for England. The Speaker will be asked to certify which bills or parts of bills relate to England or England and Wales only, he said. There will be no changes in the House of Lords, Mr Grayling said. But where Lords amendments are certified as England or England and Wales only, a "double majority" system applies, meaning it will need a majority of both the whole House of Commons and MPs representing English or English and Welsh constituencies. Tablet computers will be used to count MPs' votes as they walk through the voting lobbies so officials can instantly register whether they have used their veto in votes where the "double majority" rule applies. To jeers from opposition benches, Mr Grayling said "Today we are answering the West Lothian Question", a reference to the constitutional anomaly that lets Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MP at Westminster vote on measures that only apply in England. English votes: What's going on? The SNP's Pete Wishart described the English votes policy as a "cobbled together unworkable mess", and said it was "totally unacceptable". He said this policy showed that the Tories were doing their best to ensure Scotland would become an independent country. His party leader Nicola Sturgeon said: "The Tories have produced a constitutional shambles - staggering in the extent of its hypocrisy and incoherence. "Under these plans - which are all about cutting Scottish MPs out of votes which impact on Scotland and our budget - the Tories are proposing an 'English veto' and 'double majority'. "I have been very clear that, at least in part, the level of support for independence will be determined by what the Tory government at Westminster does, as well as what the SNP Government does. And there is no question that the great disrespect shown to Scotland in these proposals is likely to have more people asking whether Westminster is capable of representing Scotland's interests at all." Labour's Sir Gerald Kaufman, the father of the house, said the title of the motion, English votes for English laws, "sounds racist". He added: "This government is undermining the whole basis of British democracy, right through from when the Magna Carta was signed."	The government will give MPs from English constituencies a new "veto" over laws affecting England only.
Syed Ali attacked the teenager in Sunderland's Mowbray Park on 8 December last year. Ali, from the city's Barnes area, was found guilty after a trial at Newcastle Crown Court. Det Insp Phil Bond said Ali had "preyed on his victim, befriending her and quickly gaining her trust before subjecting her to a horrific attack". He said: "I hope the victim and her family can now move on from what has been an incredibly distressing time and can come to terms with what has happened and rebuild their lives. "Although we know this sentence will in no way help erase what has happened, we hope there is some comfort in knowing Ali is now in prison."	A 47-year-old man who raped a 16-year-old girl in a Wearside park has been jailed for eight years.
The Republican nominee denied ever sexually assaulting women, but turned his fire on ex-President Bill Clinton in a bitter US presidential debate. "There's never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women," he said. Hillary Clinton refused to address his comments about her husband. Mr Trump's attack on the Clintons came after moderator Anderson Cooper asked him about a 2005 video released on Friday that revealed Mr Trump bragging about groping women. The 70-year-old billionaire dismissed the remarks as "just words" and "locker room talk". When pressed on whether he had engaged in sexual misconduct, he denied doing so and instead focused on Mr Clinton's previous indiscretions. No criminal charges have been brought against Mr Clinton in any allegations of sexual assault. Mrs Clinton said the explosive video, which has sparked an exodus of Republicans denying support to their presidential nominee, "represents exactly who he is". "With prior Republican nominees, I disagreed with them," she added, "but I never questioned their fitness to serve. When the two took to the stage in St Louis for their second of three debates, they did not shake hands, striking a bitter tone that would continue throughout. Mr Trump said if he won, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton and she would be in prison over her private email arrangements. "Everything he just said is absolutely false but I'm not surprised," she responded. "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country." "Because you'd be in jail," he interrupted. Mr Trump also said his Democratic rival "has tremendous hate in her heart" while criticising her for referring to his supporters as "deplorables". Mrs Clinton said she apologised for the comment, adding: "My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him, about the hateful and divisive campaign he has run." The two also sparred on the conflict in Syria, Russian aggression, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his plan for the "extreme vetting" of immigrants arriving from countries with links to terrorism. The evening concluded when an audience member asked the candidates to say one positive thing about each other. Mrs Clinton said his children were a great reflection of him while Mr Trump called his opponent "a fighter" who never gives up. An hour before the debate began, Mr Trump appeared at a news conference with women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. He joined three women who allege the former president sexually assaulted them and called the women "very courageous". The Republican was under immense pressure after making obscene comments about women in the video. At least 33 senior Republicans - including senators, members of Congress, and state governors - have withdrawn their support since the video surfaced on Friday. Donald Trump entered this debate threatening to unload every bit of malicious allegations and rumours on Hillary Clinton. And he did. Accusations of Bill Clinton's sexual impropriety? Check. Her work as a public defender representing a rapist? Yup. He even tied it up in a bow by remarking that his Democratic opponent should be in jail. Mrs Clinton said she would take the high road, but she did get in her shots as well, saying the illicit video of Mr Trump's lewd comments showed who he really is. And then, after that nuclear exchange, the debate chugged along - with Mr Trump often gaining the upper hand. If his weakness is policy knowledge, there were few opportunities where his shortcoming were exposed. Instead, there was plenty of time for Mrs Clinton to offer a yet another muddled answer on her email server and essentially confirm that the Wikileaks hacked speech excerpts are accurate. Mr Trump offered word salads in answers about healthcare reform and Syria policy. If anything, from there the debate was a draw. With Mrs Clinton ahead right now, a draw will probably suit her just fine. But it wasn't the knock-out blow her supporters probably hoped for. Who won the debate? Mrs Clinton also defended controversial remarks she made in a private speech that was made public in leaked emails on Saturday. The transcript had revealed she said a politician has a public and private position, but at the debate she said she had watched a film about Abraham Lincoln and was referring only to what he had done. Clinton's Wall Street speeches leaked Mr Trump appeared with Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who settled a sexual harassment suit against Mr Clinton for $850,000 in 1999 with no admission of guilt. Juanita Broaddrick, who claimed Mr Clinton raped her in a hotel room in 1978, also appeared with Mr Trump. Mr Clinton has denied the claim through his lawyer and no charges have ever been brought against him. The third woman was Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide who said Mr Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, but had previously said it never happened. Mr Clinton has also denied this claim. Katty Kay: Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who spoke, encountered Mrs Clinton in a criminal case when she was 12 years old. Early in Mrs Clinton's legal career, she was appointed to defend Ms Shelton's rapist, despite objections, and had his sentence reduced to a lesser charge. Years later, an audio tape emerged of Mrs Clinton speaking with a reporter, in which she can be heard laughing about the case. During one instance, she laughed after explaining that her client had passed a lie detector test, which convinced her to never trust them again. How does the US election work?

The abuse took place while the boys were living at Belmont House, in Baker Street, Stockport, Greater Manchester, in about 1989 and 1990. The home, which was also known as Belmont Assessment Centre, has closed. Police have made "extensive" inquiries and are now appealing for anyone who worked or lived at the home during that period to contact them. Det Con Karen Wileman said: "People who were previously residents or members of staff at the home may have moved to different areas of the country, or even abroad. "We are keen to speak to anyone who was involved with the home around the time the abuse took place."	An appeal has been launched after two boys were sexually abused at a former care home.
Lufthansa lost an appeal to a Frankfurt labour court, but is making a further legal challenge that could go late into Tuesday evening. The pilots' strike, called over a pay dispute, will affect around 100,000 passengers, Lufthansa said. The industrial action is part of a long-running pay dispute at Lufthansa. The pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) has organised 14 strikes since April 2014. Short and medium-haul flights from Germany will be affected from 00:01 to 23:59 local time (23:01-22:59 GMT). Flights by Lufthansa's other airlines including Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Air Dolomiti and Brussels Airlines are not affected by the strike, the airline said. Pay talks between the Vereinigung union and the German airline broke down earlier this month, and Lufthansa said the union had "consistently rejected the offer" of mediation. The union is calling for a 3.7% pay rise for 5,400 pilots dating back to 2012. Lufthansa, which is facing increasing competition from budget rivals, offered a 2.5% increase over the six years until 2019. Meanwhile, a separate dispute with cabin crew at Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary, Eurowings, led it to cancel more than 60 flights on Tuesday.	German airline Lufthansa is making an eleventh-hour court appeal to halt a planned pilots' strike that will cancel 900 flights on Wednesday.
After the start of day three had been delayed until 17:15 BST, Wakely (112) and Keogh (105 not out) combined to move the hosts from 60-3 to 214-3. The pair's 171-run stand put Northants in command, allowing them to declare on 289-7 with 16 overs left in the day. The visitors reached 44-0, 349 behind. Paul Horton (20 not out) and Arun Harinath (20 not out) survived a testing final hour to leave Northants needing 10 wickets - and Leicestershire 350 runs - for victory on the final day.	Alex Wakely and Rob Keogh both scored centuries as Northants continued to assert their authority over Leicestershire, before setting them a victory target of 394 at Northampton.
The Argentina forward, 28, is serving a three-match ban for his violent conduct in City's 3-1 win against West Ham. Aguero has scored three goals in three Premier League matches this season, but Mourinho says his absence makes Pep Guardiola's side "unpredictable". "He doesn't play and they have amazing options," said Mourinho. "It is more difficult. When Sergio Aguero is available he plays, we know their formation." Mourinho suggested any one of Kelechi Iheanacho, Raheem Sterling or David Silva could start as a "false nine" in the derby at Old Trafford. "We have to reduce the unpredictability," added the Portuguese. Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.	Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho says it will be "more difficult" facing a Manchester City side that does not include Sergio Aguero on Saturday.
Footage emerged online of people appearing to sing the anti-Irish "Famine Song" at the weekend, while a band played along. The council said the right of the Orange Order to march was not "absolute". And it warned future parades could face greater restrictions or prohibition. Police are investigating the footage of the song, which is sung to the tune of the Beach Boys' Sloop John B has previously been ruled to be racist by a Scottish court. A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: "The European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. "However, these rights are not absolute. They must be balanced by the responsibility to ensure the rights of others are not infringed." He added that the council would have a full debrief with police and the parade organisers, and would take into account any issues of public disorder, anti-social behaviour or damage to property resulting from the procession. And the spokesman said the council would also "take into consideration any evidenced issues and, if a future procession notification is received from the organiser, the likelihood of any restriction or prohibition may be greater." The main County Grand Orange Order parade from George Square to Glasgow Green on Saturday saw 4,500 people in 63 bands take part and another 4,000 people spectating. It was in celebration of Prince William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Eight arrests were made for minor disorder and alcohol-related offences. Robert McLean, executive officer for the Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland, said: "At the end of the day, members of the public will sing songs to tunes. "I have been quite clear - if police investigate we will assist with their inquiries. We look forward to the debrief and looking at any incidents that occurred." But David Scott, campaign director for anti-sectarian group Nil by Mouth, said: "If the Orange Order are a religious and cultural organisation, what would be the relevance of a Beach Boys song? "We know that tune also has another certain set of lyrics. The organisers should be speaking to band members and saying what is acceptable." Ch Supt Brian McInulty of Police Scotland said the force operated a "zero-tolerance policy" when it comes to any form of sectarian abuse, and would fully investigate any incidents brought to their attention.	Glasgow City Council will consider banning future Orange Order marches after footage showed members of the public chanting a sectarian song.
July's anniversary of the Battle of the Somme is being marked at Powis Castle, near Welshpool, with the basement now turned into a replica trench. It will aim to  give a flavour of a frontline soldier's life. Central will be the story of Percy, the fourth Earl of Powis' son, who died in the battle. An exhibition, which includes battlefield objects, old newsreel and food packaging, runs until September.	The turmoil and tragedy of life in the World War One trenches will be replicated at a mid Wales castle as part of centenary events.
The images of Europe taken from the International Space Station (ISS) have notched up tens of thousands of reactions on Facebook. Belgium can be seen glowing more brightly than its neighbours. The country's dense road network enjoys near-total streetlight coverage, with lights kept on throughout the night. It uses about 2.2 million bulbs to illuminate Belgium's roads - with 186 bulbs per square mile, the New York Times reports. The 39-year-old French astronaut posted an image on Twitter showing the Aurora Borealis - also known as the Northern Lights - visible towards the north of the globe, and also noted that Belgium "stands out as usual". In another, on his Facebook page, he said London, Paris and Brussels "form a very European triangle". The photos are taken from the "cupola" - a module of the ISS built by the European Space Agency. In his blog, Mr Pesquet says he likes to look out on the Earth while working out on an exercise machine positioned there. "There are not a lot of gyms with such a view!" he writes. He describes in detail life on board the space station, explaining - among other things - that tortillas are better than bread in space, as they don't leave crumbs to plague the astronauts in their weightless environment. Most social media responses to the images marvelled at the beauty of the Earth viewed at night from some 400km (248 miles) above. But some complained about the wasted power and light pollution: "We can see very well the glitz and wasted electricity! Awful for lovers of the sky!" wrote Christian Cellier on Facebook. And one user, Michel-L Saucy said, was more concerned about extra-terrestrial visitors: "Hope that the aliens are not too attracted to light... We cannot accommodate them all once!"	Belgium's penchant for extravagant motorway lighting is suddenly in the spotlight thanks to pictures posted by French astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
The star is up for the main prize, album of the year, for her ambitious visual album, Lemonade, which tackles themes of race and female identity. Her single Formation is also up for song and record of the year. In all three categories, she is up against Adele - who previously won the ceremony's top three prizes in 2012. Beyonce now has 62 Grammy nominations across her work as a solo artist and as part of Destiny's Child, making her the fourth most-nominated artist ever. She has won 20 trophies altogether, although she has yet to clinch the album of the year prize, having been beaten to the title by Beck in 2015 - much to the disgust of Kanye West, who stormed the stage in protest. West receives eight nominations this year for his album The Life Of Pablo - all in the rap categories. Drake and Rihanna also have eight nominations, including three for their hit collaboration, Work. Making Grammy history is Chicago-born musician Chance The Rapper, whose album Coloring Book is the first streaming-only record to be recognised by the Recording Academy. He achieves seven nominations, including best new artist, without ever releasing a physical album or digital download. Beyonce and Adele go head to head with Justin Bieber, Drake and country star Sturgill Simpson in the best album category. If Adele wins, she will become only the second woman to receive the best album prize twice, after Taylor Swift. Notably absent from the shortlist is David Bowie, who was tipped to win for his critically-acclaimed Blackstar album. The record does make an appearance in the best alternative album category, as does Radiohead's A Moon Shaped Pool. Coldplay have also fared badly, receiving just one nomination - best music video - despite selling millions of copies of their latest album, A Head Full Of Dreams. Prince receives a posthumous nomination for his final album, Hit N Run Phase Two, in the best engineered, non-classical category, where Blackstar also makes the shortlist.

Gray opened the scoring in the 52nd minute with a fine solo goal before Slimani doubled the lead shortly after. The Algerian scored his second four minutes later as he bundled home Gray's cross from close range. Caolan Lavery's fortuitous late strike cut the deficit but Musa fired home in stoppage time. The first half was largely uneventful as both sides made eight changes from the weekend's league matches. Gray's goal was the first moment of quality in the match as he collected the ball 30-yards from goal on the left wing, drove in field and beat three defenders before slotting through Blades' goalkeeper Jake Eastwood's legs. Slimani then scored a four-minute brace which looked to have settled the tie as the striker - signed for £29m in 2016 - showed excellent movement and composure. But, Lavery pulled a goal back in the 83rd minute as his miscued cross beat Ben Hamer at the near post before the Blades pushed further with 19-year-old Foxes debutant Josh Knight making a fine block to deny Billy Sharp. The Leicester defence continued to hold strong and in the 93rd minute Musa powered through the United defence and drove home to confirm the result. Match ends, Sheffield United 1, Leicester City 4.

Matthew Williams was found attacking Cerys Yemm, 22, at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed on 6 November 2014. He was Tasered four times by police and arrested but later died. The Newport hearing was told he had previously made death and violence threats to his ex-girlfriend, probation service staff and a police officer. PC Jake Silver, who deals with prolific offenders through Gwent Police's Integrated Offender Management section, said Williams' former partner received seven letters from him while he was locked up. They contained threats of violence to her as well as threats towards a serving Detective Constable and the officer's wife and his children. In the letters, Williams described sending a car "up in smoke" and described one person as a "dead man walking". He described intending to serve his entire sentence - to negate the need to be on licence when released - so he could go "under the radar" when he was let out. PC Silver said he believed Williams was "very capable of carrying out the threats" but said the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was not enough evidence to peruse the matter as Williams' ex girlfriend was not willing to be a witness. PC Silver agreed there was a "lack of urgency" surrounding the letters because of an assumption Williams would remain in prison due to a pending court case, which later collapsed. The inquest continues.	A man who killed woman at a hostel had sent letters threatening to kill others while in prison, an inquest has heard.
Sredojevic, who on Sunday lead the Cranes to their first Africa Cup of Nations finals since 1978, complained on social media about not being paid. Fufa admits it owes the coach and says paying him is a priority. The association added it is meeting with the coach to resolve the issues. Fufa also explained that much of its recent income had been used to ensure the "the success of the team" in their final must-win Nations Cup qualifier against Comoros. The statement continued: "Fufa is committed to ensuring all his salary arrears are cleared and we are confident this will be handled." The coach has also said that he is prepared to take the matter to football's world governing body Fifa if necessary.	The Federation of Uganda Football Associations (Fufa) has said that it is working on clearing the salary arrears owed to the national team coach Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic.
It is hearing loss - a condition that can still have profound consequences, experts say. "Hearing loss is considered an invisible epidemic because people don't see it or know that someone suffers from it," says De Wet Swanepoel, professor of audiology at South Africa's Pretoria University. "Not even parents may realise their child has hearing loss before critical developmental periods have lapsed." Delays in diagnosis can affect the educational attainment and life chances of children in particular. One in 10 children globally have "educationally significant" hearing loss, says Prof Swanepoel. The problem is that there aren't enough trained audiologists able to go out to sometimes very remote, rural areas to diagnose the condition. This is where the smartphone is making a big difference. An app called HearScreen, the result of a research project led by Prof Swanepoel and Dr Herman Myburgh at Pretoria University, can detect hearing loss with just a low-cost smartphone and a pair of headphones. Complete with real-time background noise monitoring, the app turns a mobile phone's microphone into a calibrated sound level meter. You put the headphones on, and the tester, sitting behind you, uses the phone to send audio beeps at different volumes to your ears. If you can hear them you raise your hand and the tester records your responses. It's all very simple - the app can screen two ears in less than 60 seconds and its makers claim that the system is six times cheaper than traditional testing equipment. The data captured is stored to the cloud where specialists can access and analyse it remotely. The "clinically validated" app can be operated effectively by non-specialists, the company says, making it ideally suited for use in remote locations. "More than 80% of the app's usage is in underserved and rural areas," says Prof Swanepoel, "providing many populations with access to hearing testing for the first time." If a test diagnoses hearing loss, the app can refer the patient by text to the closest healthcare facility for follow-up services. Shannon Kruyt, an audiologist at HearInAfrica, which provides hearing care in schools in a number of African countries, knows all about this "invisible epidemic". She says: "[HearScreen] is improving my work because the screening of hearing can now be done at a community-based level, without audiologists needing to go out into the field. "The biggest challenge we are facing is the disparity between the shortage of audiologists and prevalence of hearing loss in Africa. HearScreen has been a massive game changer." The app has also won the approval of partners such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and USAID. But how much should we trust such diagnostic apps, however well-intended? Dr Shelly Chadha, technical officer for deafness and hearing at the WHO, says: "Mobile apps can serve a very useful role in raising awareness about hearing and making hearing care more accessible. "But if a mobile app for hearing assessment is not accurate this can give incorrect information to the user, which can be harmful." HearScreen maintains that its app conforms to ISO calibration standards and compares favourably to traditional audiometry equipment. But the WHO is concerned that other diagnostic apps may not have been systematically evaluated or clinically proven to work effectively and safely. There are 259,000 health apps available to consumers globally, according to a recent study by the health research group Research2Guidance, measuring everything from heart health to female fertility, asthma to diabetes. IBM and its Watson supercomputer are getting better at identifying skin cancer from photos taken by a smartphone equipped with a special camera, but even it admits that "work is still in its early stages". And while the potential benefits of the smartphone "pocket doctor" are indisputable - remote monitoring by doctors being a major one - there is also the danger of mis-diagnosis and incorrect self-treatment if the apps are not proven. This is why regulatory approval and an evidence-based approach is so important. For example, US-based eye testing app mVT Service has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and wears this endorsement like a badge of honour. The app is prescribed to patients via their doctors and enables patients to monitor their eyesight from the comfort of their own homes. "Our goal is to reduce vision blindness by actively monitoring the patient's home vision test results and alerting the patient's licensed eye-care doctor of any significant vision function change," says myVisionTrack chief marketing officer George Mavro. Currently launching with a select group of specialists and 98% effective at detecting changes in vision, mVT Service uses a smartphone app and eye patch to test patients. All users have to do is look at a choice of shapes and select the one that looks different. Results are then shared with their doctor via the cloud. "The goal of the service is to reduce vision blindness by actively monitoring the patient's home vision test results and alerting the patient's prescriber to any significant vision function change," Mr Mavro says. Obviously, the earlier we can detect potential problems the better. Organisations such as the WHO are working hard on assessing the quality of individual apps, and giving their blessing to the relevant ones. For the good of healthcare worldwide, sorting the good from the bad will be key if mHealth is to fulfil its promise.

Visitors are expected to flock to The Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh (RBGE) at the peak of the plant's pungency over the next three days. The giant Amorphophallus Titanum has a strong smell of rotting flesh. Horticulturist Sadie Barber says she was ''thrilled to finally see and smell" the plant after "12 years of careful cultivation''. The plant, which has the heaviest corm ever recorded (153.9kgs) has produced seven leaves in the 12 years that it has been at the garden, so horticulturists are "delighted to finally" have a flower. Ms Barber, who was gifted the corm in 2003 by Hortus Botanicus in Leiden, Netherlands, said: "We are thrilled to finally see, and smell, this incredible curiosity of the plant world after 12 years of careful cultivation by the Horticulture team at RBGE. "The spadix has so far reached an impressive height of 255cm and may even grow a few centimetres more in the next days. "It really is one of the most extraordinary flowering plants we have ever seen, and great to think that something that grows naturally so far away can be enjoyed by visitors to the Garden here in Edinburgh.''	One of the world's largest and smelliest flowers has blossomed for the first time in Scotland.
Gian-Franco Kasper, a Swiss ski official, made the comparison during an IOC board meeting in Pyeongchang. The board is debating whether to suspend the entire Russian team from the Games following a doping scandal. "I apologise unreservedly for any offence I have caused. I am truly sorry," Franco Kasper said. The International Ski Federation President was discussing a proposed blanket ban on Russian athletes when he made the Holocaust comment, referring to the World War II genocide that saw six million Jews killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. He reportedly said: "I'm just against bans or sanctioning of innocent people. Like Mr Hitler did - all Jews were to be killed, independently of what they did or did not do." When challenged by reporters at the time, Franco Kasper responded: "Why not? Of course it's more extreme. But just the fact that the place you come from makes you guilty, I'm not OK for this, really not." Russia did not receive a blanket ban from the IOC from the 2016 Olympics in Rio, opting to leave the decision to individual sports' governing bodies. A report in December 2016 claimed Russian medallists from summer and winter Olympics had benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015.	An International Olympic Committee (IOC) board member has apologised for comparing calls to ban Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics to the Holocaust.
L/Cpl Craig Roberts and two others died on an SAS selection exercise in 2013. The government said allowing court action would not help training safety. But Kelvin and Margaret Roberts said they believed the army would be more responsible if they were legally accountable. In March, the Ministry of Defence was reprimanded over failures which led to the deaths of L/Cpl Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, Cpl James Dunsby from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, and L/Cpl Edward Maher, of Winchester, Hampshire. At their inquest last year a coroner ruled neglect contributed to their deaths. The Health and Safety Executive issued a censure, which is the highest action it can take, as the MoD cannot be prosecuted. It has since apologised for the failings. But, responding to the Commons Defence Select Committee report 'Beyond Endurance?' which was published after the deaths of the SAS candidate reservists, the UK Government ruled out amending the 2007 Corporate Manslaughter Act. Mr and Mrs Roberts said: "We are extremely disappointed that the government has decided not to accept the recommendation of the... committee to remove the immunity from prosecution from the MoD when served with a crown censure. "The government states that they fail to see how losing the immunity would make improvements to the safety of military training, however, we believe that if the MoD are legally accountable for their actions then they will be more responsible and diligent in their training methods. "We have done our best to have the immunity removed and bereaved families in the past have also tried, so we are pleased that the Defence Committee intend to pursue their interest in this matter with the MoD." The three men were on a selection march in Powys on one of the hottest days of 2013 when they fell ill. All three were on course to complete it within the allocated time but were found in three separate locations at different times. An inquest found they died after suffering the effects of hyperthermia - or overheating. Coroner Louise Hunt, who ruled the men died as a result of neglect, warned there was a risk of future deaths on SAS selection marches unless action was taken. The HSE investigation into the men's deaths found the MoD failed to plan, assess, and manage the risks associated with heat illness during the training. In its response to the 'Beyond Endurance?' report, the UK government said existing arrangements in respect of military training fatalities worked effectively as a means of ensuring lessons were learnt and mistakes were not repeated. It said: "The MoD invariably implements any corrective measures identified by the HSE and treats crown censure as a matter of the utmost seriousness. "It is not therefore clear how the proposed amendments to the act, which would only take effect once the MoD has been subject to a crown censure, would result in any tangible improvement to the safety of military training. "These safeguards (to learn lessons, implement corrective measures identified by the HSE and the seriousness with which we treat crown censure), together with the ability to bring civil claims for negligence against the MoD, where a breach of a duty of care occurs within the UK or abroad, provide a strong system both for discouraging failure by the MoD and for learning lessons where things go wrong." It added the MoD would be the focus of any civil claim whether the breach was at the highest levels of the MoD or at the immediate level at which training was carried out and it would be "extremely difficult, perhaps impossible to apply the concept of manslaughter to the role of the senior management of the MoD in permitting and setting parameters for training which is essential and which is by its nature hazardous".	The parents of one of three soldiers who died on the Brecon Beacons have said they are "extremely disappointed" the government will not allow the Ministry of Defence to be prosecuted.
The call handling and IT system is more than Â£40m over budget and was initially due to be ready for October 2013. An earlier attempt to introduce the system had to be abandoned. The programme will now be phased in for some services from this summer with a national roll-out by the end of 2017. Earlier this year, the planned June launch was pushed back to the "summer of 2016" after an issue that caused computer screens to appear blank. It followed an earlier incident in which the system crashed and staff had to resort to pen and paper to deal with patient calls. The new technology is meant to make NHS 24 more efficient but is expected to cost Â£117m, more than 50% higher than the original estimate. NHS 24 said the new telephone system would be in place this year for services including Breathing Space, NHS Living Life, the musculoskeletal helpline, death certification, blood transfusion and Fit For Work. It will then be introduced in one health board area to ensure it is working effectively before the national roll-out. NHS 24 chief executive Angiolina Foster said: "We expect to have a functioning technology system tested and available later in the summer. "However, we have recognised that ensuring our staff and operational environment are also fully ready to accept the technology is absolutely essential to making sure we can make a smooth transition to the new system." Ms Foster said: "We recognise that the past 18 months have been challenging for the organisation and know that the professionalism and dedication of our people has enabled us to give high-quality care to patients during this time." Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "While any delays to implementation are disappointing, patient safety must always come first. This is why NHS 24 has taken the decision to phase the roll-out of its Future Programme. "This decision follows a comprehensive review of the new system which concluded that a phased roll-out later this summer, working towards full implementation across all health boards by the end of 2017, would be both safe for patients and deliverable by the organisation."	A crisis-hit computer project for the NHS 24 telephone helpline will not be fully rolled out across Scotland until the end of next year - four years later than originally planned.
The school has stopped the game, also known as "tag" or "you're it", to allow the children "some time to settle down a bit", according to the headmaster. The ban is the latest in a line of stories from around England of educational establishments outlawing everyday activities, many of which are remembered fondly from people's own school days. BBC News looks back at other forbidden school pursuits that have made headlines: We start off with a perhaps unsurprising measure many schools enforce. British Bulldog involves charging towards fellow pupils, a drop of the shoulder to fool the 'bulldogs' and a rapid dash to the safety of the other side of the yard. These figures are a little old (like the above image), but over a quarter of 653 school staff surveyed by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in 2011 said it had been banned from their school. One secondary school teacher said it was "because of the number of broken bones it generates!" Schools in Wiltshire, Cumbria and Clackmannanshire introduced a ban on conkers over fears the horse chestnuts could trigger anaphylactic reactions. The Anaphylaxis Campaign said a "common sense approach" would be better, where conkers are put in a safe place after battle and all involved give their hands a good wash. Some schools took to allowing their children to take part in conker fights provided they were wearing protective goggles. A Carlisle headteacher said it was a "sensible" step to shield children's eyes from pieces of flying horse chestnut. In January, birthday cakes were banned at a Blackpool primary school as teachers "do not have time" to check ingredients for pupils with allergies. Parents of children at Norbreck Primary Academy were told cakes taken into school would be "sent home uneaten". The headteacher wrote: "I hate to be a killjoy... there are many reasons for this, some of them serious." Pupils in Birmingham had to leave school after teachers said they were wearing the wrong kind of shoes. Baverstock Academy, in Druids Heath, sent out letters informing families of new rules making plain black shoes compulsory. One parent reported the "ridiculous" decision led to "chaotic" scenes, with about 300 children being sent home. The school later relaxed the rule slightly, according to parents. It wasn't the pupils but their parents who were making a scene at a primary school in Darlington. Grown-ups on the school run were asked by the headteacher of Skerne Park Academy to wash in the morning and to not drop their kids off while wearing pyjamas. The final straw came when parents were turning up to parents' evenings and even the Christmas show in their PJs, the head said. A West Yorkshire head teacher banned books containing stories about pigs from key stage one classrooms in case they offended Muslim children. The literature was removed from classes for under-sevens at Park Road Junior Infant and Nursery School in Batley. Head Barbara Harris said the books would remain in the school library for children to read, but added: "We try to be sensitive to the fact that for Muslims talk of pigs is offensive." Pupils in South Gloucestershire were banned from wearing tinsel to a non-uniform day because teachers say it could cause litter and be dangerous. Staff at Chipping Sodbury school said the festive decoration could cause injury if pupils tried to strangle each other. Children were sent home with a letter citing "health and safety reasons" for the ban. The local council said the day was "far from being against the spirit of Christmas" and was in aid of the charity Crisis.	A primary school in Leeds has introduced a temporary ban on children playing "tig" during break times after "clothes were torn" and pupils were left "upset".
Lisanne Beck, 47, allegedly performed a sex act on Simon Murphy, 48, during a Paloma Faith set in September. The Old Bailey heard the couple were filmed conducting the alleged behaviour, but the jury failed to reach a verdict and were discharged. The pair, from Swansea, denied outraging public decency. Judge Peter Rook QC has given the prosecution until Thursday to decide whether to pursue a retrial. He said: "Whatever the Crown says, it will have been a chastening experience over the last few days, I'm sure everyone will agree with that." During the hearing prosecutor Tom Cleeve told jurors while "there are some amusing aspects to it... it was not funny at the time" and a 16-year-old girl had to be shielded from what was going on. He said the two defendants were of "previously good character, but in that afternoon I'm afraid they blotted their copybook". During the hearing Ms Beck said the film showed she was trying to wake her boyfriend up, while Mr Murphy's legal team said he was completely unaware of what his girlfriend was doing.	A couple accused of carrying out a sex act at a BBC Radio 2 concert in Hyde Park must wait to hear if they face a retrial after the jury was discharged.

Mr Wragg, 82, said the song was about to be released when the Falklands conflict broke out and it was thought to be "inappropriate at a time of war". The recording features players including Gordon Banks, Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Alan Ball singing along with former England manager Sir Alf Ramsey.

Democrats Mark Warner and Joe Manchin, who have "A" ratings from the National Rifle Association (NRA), now say action is needed after the massacre. President Obama has held a meeting with three of his cabinet to discuss how the law might change. Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both aged six, were buried on Monday. They were among 20 children and six adults killed at Sandy Hook school in Connecticut. Other victims' funerals will be held throughout the week, and the town has already begun removing Christmas decorations in mourning. Two adults who were injured in the attack survived are recovering in hospital and would be crucial witnesses as police continue their investigation, it was confirmed on Monday. Lt Paul Vance said they were recovering and would be interviewed at an appropriate time. Children who witnessed the attack would also be interviewed - in the presence of parents and professionals - Lt Vance added. The Sandy Hook gunman was named as Adam Lanza, who took his own life at the end of a killing spree that began with him shooting dead his own mother. Despite a long history of pro-gun views, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin told US network MSNBC on Monday that it was time to "move beyond rhetoric" on gun control. Mr Manchin, a gun owner and frequent hunter, said: "I don't know anyone in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle." "It's common sense. It's time to move beyond rhetoric. We need to sit down and have a common sense discussion and move in a reasonable way." Virginia Senator Mark Warner, another Democrat who has backed gun owner's rights, told reporters outside the Virginia capitol that the "status quo isn't acceptable". He later called for "rational gun control" in an interview with a local news broadcaster. Mr Warner said he had been approached repeatedly over the weekend as people began to seek answers and solutions. On Sunday President Barack Obama told residents at a vigil in Newtown the US must do more to protect its children. Rate per 100,000 people Source: FBI Uniform Crime Reports In statistics: Guns in the US Viewpoints: Should gun laws change? Mark Mardell: Twenty Christmas trees "We can't tolerate this any more," Mr Obama said. "These tragedies must end and to end them we must change." On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said tighter gun control laws are part of the answer to violence in the US, but stressed that the president did not have a specific policy to announce. "It's a complex problem that will require a complex solution," Mr Carney said. "No single piece of legislation, no single action will fully address the problem." He added that the president supports reinstating an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, a long-time advocate for gun regulations, said on Sunday she would introduce assault weapons ban legislation in the beginning of the next congressional session. And New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a vocal backer of stricter regulation, called on Mr Obama and Congress to pass several gun regulation proposals, including requiring a criminal background check for all gun sales, making gun trafficking a felony and a ban on assault weapons. Newtown's ordeal entered a new phase on Monday as Jack Pinto was buried in the Newtown Village Cemetery and Noah Pozner was buried at the B'Nai Israel Cemetery in the nearby town of Monroe. By Jonny DymondWashington correspondent The family of James Mattioli, six, also held a wake on Monday. Noah Pozner, the youngest victim, was described by his family as inquisitive and mature for his age. "It is unspeakably tragic that none of us can bring Noah back," his uncle Alexis Haller said, according to remarks sent to the Associated Press. "We would go to the ends of the earth to do so, but none of us can. What we can do is carry Noah within us, always." His twin sister, Arielle, who was assigned to a different classroom, survived. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and Lt Gov Nancy Wyman were both at the funeral, presided over by a rabbi. In front of the funeral home, well-wishers placed two teddy bears, a bouquet of white flowers and a single red rose at the base of an old maple tree. Later, hymns played at the funeral of Jack Pinto, described as a sports lover and a huge fan of New York Giants football player Victor Cruz - who wore the boy's name inscribed on his boots during Sunday's game. At his funeral on Monday, many young children wore Newtown school football shirts. One mourner, Gwendolyn Glover, told the Associated Press the funeral aimed to reassure others that they were now safe. "The message was: You're secure now. The worst is over," she said. The six-year-old was one of the youngest members of the Newtown youth wrestling association, and dozens of boys in gray Newtown wrestling shirts were at the funeral, as was his coach. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy has declared a moment of silence for the entire state on Friday morning at 09:00 local time, a week after the shooting. He asked houses of worship with bells to ring them 26 times - one for each victim at the school. Mr Malloy has also signed an executive order making an unused school in neighbouring town immediately available for Sandy Hook's students - with classes reported to be pencilled in for Wednesday. It could be months before the school building is available for use again because it remains an active crime scene.	Two pro-gun US senators have called for changes to firearm laws, as the first victims of the 26 victims of Newtown school shootings were buried.
The labour peer, who died in December, was accused of sex offences against children - which his family deny. The hearings, part of the Goddard Inquiry into child sexual abuse, were due to start in September but have been put back because of other inquiries. Leicestershire Police and the IPCC are investigating people allegedly linked to the case. The Goddard Inquiry, chaired by Dame Lowell Goddard, set to be the biggest public inquiry in British history, held a preliminary hearing earlier for its investigation into the former Leicester MP, one of 13 cases it has announced so far. On Monday, the IPCC announced 11 people are to be investigated over their handling of allegations against the peer. Announcing the delay Ben Emmerson QC, counsel to the inquiry, said there are "good reasons to reconsider on timing and structure of the hearings." He said the Leicestershire force and the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission) will soon interview complainants and witnesses who are also scheduled to give evidence. Postponement was "only responsible" in the circumstances, meaning the public hearings will now commence on 7 March 2017 and conclude by the end of May. Mr Emmerson revealed 33 alleged victims of Lord Janner have now been granted core participant status in the inquiry, meaning they have the right to make statements, see documents and seek permission to ask questions. Seven organisations and institutions, including the Labour Party, have previously been given the same status, which has also been granted to two individual police officers, including current Derbyshire chief constable Mick Creedon, who investigated Lord Janner for the Leicestershire force in the early 1990s. The inquiry has not received an application for core participant status from Lord Janner's family, but Mr Emmerson said there was "ongoing correspondence with their legal representatives". There have been suggestions from the family, Mr Emmerson said, that it would be "unfair" for the inquiry to make findings of fact because Lord Janner is unable to defend himself and alleged victims will not be subject to cross-examination. He said that in some cases it will be necessary to make findings of fact but only if it was fair to do based on the evidence. On the issue of cross-examination, Mr Emmerson said the inquiry is an inquisitorial process rather an adversarial one, but that he, as counsel, could still nevertheless explore the credibility of witnesses. In a statement, the peer's lawyer said: "Lord Janner was an honourable man, entirely innocent and never convicted of any crime." The hearing, at the Royal Courts of Justice, was also told the Goddard Inquiry as a whole has so far received disclosure of 35,000 documents and is receiving up to 100 communications from the public each week.	Public hearings into allegations of abuse relating to Lord Janner have been delayed by six months.
The small objects were hidden by artist Luke Jerram for his installation Treasure City, with clues hidden in paintings at the 20-21 Arts Centre. The first one, a replica Viking brooch, was found in a wall in Kingsway Gardens, Scunthorpe, by Rachel Welch. Ms Welch, of Grimsby, said she looked around town on the off-chance she could find one without cracking the codes. The object was found hours after the treasure hunt began on Saturday. She said: "We had a look at them, but we didn't really spend much time with them because we are no good at codes. "We thought we'd go out and have a look round and see if we are able to find one and we did." Bristol-based artist Mr Jerram said a Scoutmaster had cracked the code in the corresponding painting moments before, and arrived at the park to see it had already been claimed. This particular artwork used semaphore to spell out the clue "in the gardens seven metres from the flag is the Kingsway xx(rest)." The gold was hidden in a dry stone wall near a flag, given to the gardens as an environmental award. Each of the objects is worth more than £1,000 and Ms Welch said she was going to sell it to pay for a holiday. The second object, a small 18 carat gold lamb, was found in a bandstand in Brigg on Sunday night by a teacher from Beverley. She solved one of the painting's codes to lead her to a place which was "an octagonal place to listen". Mr Jerram said the woman searched Scunthorpe for somewhere that fit that description and settled on the bandstand but when she got to the one in Scunthorpe there was nothing there. It was that night that she realised there was one in nearby Brigg and went down there with her husband at midnight to claim the gold. The third piece, a model of a Tudor fisherwoman, was found on Monday but the exact details of where are not yet known.	Three of five gold artworks hidden in Lincolnshire as part of a treasure hunt have been found - the first by chance.
Firefighters were called to a home in Marlborough Road just after 22:00 GMT on Saturday after a fire developed in the first floor and roof. A man was removed from the home by firefighters, but later died in hospital. The cause of the fire is being investigated by Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Thames Valley Police.	A man has been killed in a fire in Oxford.
New rules come in on 1 January, which will reduce compensation to £75,000 per person, per institution. Previously the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protected savings of up to £85,000 per account. Joint accounts will see protection cut from £170,000 to £150,000. The maximum compensation across the European Union is set at €100,000, and the British level was reduced as a result of the pound gaining strength against the euro. The precise rate was set on 3 July 2015. At the time, one senior Tory MP described the change as "defective". Although 95% of savers will still be protected, as many as 2.5 million people may not be, according to the FSCS. It is advising savers who have more than £75,000 in one account, or in one institution, to move their money if necessary. The situation is further complicated by the fact that some registered banks and building societies operate under more than one brand. So it you had £75,000 savings with HSBC, for example, any additional savings in First Direct would not be protected, as both banks have a joint licence. Savers using Bank of Scotland and Halifax are in the same position. But Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest - although they are sister banks - are both registered separately. So savers could safely have up to £75,000 in accounts with both banks. "While this should be quite simple to navigate, it's made complicated by the fact that FSCS cover is shared between banks that operate under the same licence," said Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publishes a full list of registered banks, and which brands come under the same umbrella. Under the new rules, savers who have up to £1m in their accounts temporarily - as a result of selling a house, or being made redundant, for example - are also protected. To receive compensation, they cannot have had that cash in their accounts for more than six months. A further warning comes in relation to some foreign banks which trade in the UK, but are registered within the eurozone, such as Germany's Fidor Bank, or Sweden's Handelsbanken. Handelsbanken confirmed that the level of compensation would depend on the exchange rate at the time. So depending on how much €100,000 is worth in pounds, savers may get more or less than £75,000 protection. At the time of writing, that amount is worth less than £74,000. "With an increasing number of European banks now offering competitive rates, customers need to be aware that not all savings accounts offered in the UK are covered by the UK compensation scheme," said Rachel Thrussell, savings insight manager at Moneyfacts.co.uk.	Millions of savers are being reminded that they may need to move some of their cash, to guarantee it will be fully protected in the event of their bank going bust.
The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. "I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football," Rae told BBC Scotland. "I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. "Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things." Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. "The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline," added Rae. "The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell]." "He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged." The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. "The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in," he said. "The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure." The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace. As a youngster Clark was an exciting talent with the club he loved, Newcastle United. He represented England at schoolboy and at under-21 level. He enjoyed a very successful career - twice finishing as a Premier League runner-up with the Magpies and also played in the top flight with Fulham. Lee McCulloch and Peter Leven are staying on as Killie coaches and Rae thinks Clark will rely heavily on his new Scottish lieutenants. "These boys know the personnel and also the division," explained Rae. "The one thing about Lee is he is a motivator. He gets his teams at it. I have played against his Huddersfield - excellent back in the day. He will bring a lot to the table."	Lee Clark is a name well known to fans in England but the new Kilmarnock boss is less familiar in Scotland.
The 16-time TT winner, who came off his Tyco BMW at the 27th Milestone, was reported to be conscious before being flown to hospital by helicopter. Hutchinson, 37, was battling for the lead when the race was red-flagged because of the incident. He won the Superbike and Superstock races earlier in the week. He has now been transferred to Liverpool for further treatment. The race was re-started and was won by Michael Dunlop. The Bingley rider, who suffered a fractured femur, is the third most successful rider in the history of the event. He endured more than 30 operations on his left leg after an accident in 2010 and after a five-year absence from the top step returned to win eight TTs in the last three years. Hutchinson is the only man to win five TTs in a week, a feat he achieved seven years ago, and followed that up with trebles at the 2015 and 2016 meetings.	Ian Hutchinson has been taken to hospital with a broken leg after crashing on the second lap of Friday's Senior TT on the Isle of Man.
Zipping up a thick jacket and pulling on a pair of gloves, Mohammed is ready for a hard day's graft. He is one of a number of refugees and asylum seekers living in Belfast who spend their spare time doing voluntary conservation and preservation work in the Mourne mountains in County Down. In Algeria, his home country, he was a police officer, but "problems with my government and a terrorist group" forced him to flee. He has been in Northern Ireland for 18 months now - it is his "new home". These mountains are where Mohammed and others displaced from their homelands come regularly to find peace. They are working with the Mourne Heritage Trust, which looks after this area of outstanding natural beauty, to rebuild dry-stone walls and repair mountain paths. The walls are one of the most unmistakable features of the Mournes, with hundreds of miles stretching over mountain peaks, dividing land and providing shelter for livestock and other wildlife. The skills to build them - patience, an eye for a good stone, and a strong back, among other things - have been passed down through generations. And now these refugees are learning them, too. For Mohammed, this is his first time working on the walls: "I think it's very good experience for me." With about 100 Syrian refugees expected to arrive in Northern Ireland before Christmas, the volunteer scheme could soon play a bigger role in offering a tranquil retreat to more people who have left conflict-hit countries. Mediation Northern Ireland is one of the charities helping refugees and asylum seekers to settle into their new lives. Mary McAnulty from the organisation says it works closely with the Mourne Heritage Trust. The intention has been to help the refugees to make new friends, improve their language skills and explore part the country they now call home. "Lots of people suffer from anxieties, so having a day out of Belfast is great," Mary says. "If your world is very small, just the area you live in, then these can be your hills. "I love to see people becoming proud of it and feeling that they have a sense of place." Amar, who has moved to Belfast with his family from Sudan, says getting outside the city "is good for me". And for Elizabeth, who is Colombian, the fresh countryside air is "good for my mind". But it is not just a one-way thing. Large areas of walls have become damaged due to erosion and increasing visitor numbers, and the Mourne Heritage Trust relies on volunteers to do the repair work. Ranger John McEvoy says the trust is indebted to the refugees. "They're willing to get the sleeves rolled up, get stuck into it," he explains. "As the day goes on, you'll see them lifting the stone, doing exactly as we're doing." And Dean Fitzpatrick, a Mourne man who comes from a family of stoneworkers, says you do not have to be born and bred in the shadow of the mountains to chip in. "There are boys here who aren't stonemasons at all, from all different parts of the world," he says. "They're doing as good as anybody and they've only been here an hour or two." As Mohammed removes his gloves and wipes his brow after the work is done, his smile is wide. "Here it's very quiet - everything is perfect for me here."	"I'm here to help my new friends to build a big wall, like the Chinese wall."
Saturday's anti-fascist march in Brighton was held on the same day that a Great Skinhead Reunion also took place on the seafront. The protest was initially organised to oppose an anti-immigration march that failed to materialise. Police arrested 14 anti-fascists after an attack on three bald men. Ch Supt Nev Kemp said some anti-fascists were "intent on violence". He said the planned anti-immigration protest did not take place because protesters went to an event in Bristol instead. "My understanding is that most of the protesters that said they might be coming to Brighton actually went up to Bristol, so they didn't appear," he said. But he said the anti-fascist counter-protest did go ahead and he added: "There were a significant number who took part who were intent on violence and criminality." The 14 anti-fascist campaigners - arrested on suspicion of violent disorder - were held after masked protesters were seen attacking three bald men, he said. Sussex Police said 10 men and four women - most from Brighton, but two of no fixed address - had been bailed to dates in July pending further inquiries. Mr Kemp said: "There were a number of people in the protest who showed they were actually - ironically, bearing in mind the protest is about tolerance - some of the most intolerant people you could come across. "They were determined to cause damage and attack anybody really, any man with a bald head who looked like he might be from the right-wing." Siriol Hugh-Jones, who took part in the protest, said: "Where I was there was very little sign of violence." She added: "It was much more a carnival atmosphere. "We were trying to be nice and fluffy and show how tolerant Brighton and Hove is and what a liberal society it is and celebrating that." She said she marched behind some of the masked men but didn't know who they were.	A police chief has accused anti-fascist protesters of turning up at a demo prepared to attack "any bald men who looked right-wing".
Matthew Gillard, of Connsbrook Avenue in east Belfast, pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping and false imprisonment. The defendant, 25, also denied charges of common assault, assaulting a police officer and driving dangerously. The charges relate to incidents in east Belfast and Comber on Saturday 4 April. Newtownards Magistrates Court heard that the defendant and the woman were in his car in east Belfast when he began questioning her about who she was seeing. A detective giving evidence in court said the woman tried to get out of the Seat Toledo car but the defendant allegedly drove off at speed, through a red light on Bloomfield Avenue. When the car stopped on the Belfast Road in Comber, the woman escaped along a lane but was carried back to the car by the defendant, the court heard. An off-duty police sergeant saw this and went to help the woman. When the sergeant tried to intervene, the defendant allegedly drove his car at the officer, forcing him to get out of the way. The sergeant was able to pull the keys from the ignition through the car's open window, but the defendant wrenched them from his grasp. He then drove to the Grand Parade area of east Belfast where the woman was released. He is also alleged to have sent the woman a message threatening that if she went to police about the incident he would "ruin her life in every possible way". The court heard that the defendant handed himself over to police on Wednesday, despite being aware since Saturday that he was wanted by the PSNI. But during police interviews he refused to answer questions put to him. An application for bail was made but this was refused. Mr Gillard will appear again in court on 1 May.	A man accused of kidnapping his partner allegedly drove at a police officer who tried to save her, a court has heard.
The 30-year-old was previously with Wigry Suwalki, who are 14th in Poland's second tier. County manager Jim McIntyre said: "He has 35 international caps for Lithuania under his belt, bringing a wealth of experience to the squad." Sernas started his career with Dainava Alytus in his homeland and has also played in Russia, Turkey and Australia. After leaving Dainava, he had spells with Vttra, Spartak Nalchik, Widzew Lodz, Zaglebie Lubin and Gaziantepspor, who sent him on loan to A-League outfit Perth Glory last year. County have already signed former Celtic defender Marcus Fraser,striker Craig Curran, previously of Nuneaton Town, and defender Cameron Burgess on loan from Fulham during January. The Dingwall side are bottom of the Scottish Premiership, four points behind 11th-placed St Mirren but with two games in hand.	Lithuania midfielder Darvydas Sernas has become Ross County's fourth signing of the January transfer window.
Media playback is not supported on this device In charge of world football's governing body since 1998, Blatter, 79, said last year he was standing down amid a growing corruption crisis. Five candidates want to replace him. They are Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, Gianni Infantino, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, Tokyo Sexwale and Jerome Champagne. The election process is expected to begin at 12:00 GMT, but several rounds of voting may be required before a winner is known. Media playback is not supported on this device Each candidate has 15 minutes to address the congress before voting starts at approximately 12:00 GMT. There are 209 Fifa nations but Kuwait and Indonesia are currently barred from taking part, so that makes 207 eligible voters. To become president after the first round of voting, a candidate needs to secure two-thirds of the available votes. If no candidate achieves that mark, then a simple majority is required in the second round. If there is still no winner, then a third round will take place, minus the candidate with the fewest votes in round two. Fifa says a winner must be declared on Friday because an ice hockey rink is due to be installed at the Hallenstadion venue at midnight. So determined is Fifa to get this election done that it has spent £500,000 converting its headquarters into a back-up venue. Media playback is not supported on this device Given everything that has happened to Fifa, this is seen as a pivotal moment for an organisation which has been heavily criticised for its lack of transparency and for failing to clamp down on corruption within it. A new leader, together with a raft of reform measures, is seen as a chance to start afresh. Acting president Issa Hayatou said Friday can "signal a new dawn", adding: "This is our opportunity to show we are united in building a stronger Fifa." Media playback is not supported on this device There have been widespread allegations of corruption, the arrest of leading officials, the banning of its president and the sight of big-name sponsors deserting the organisation. Numerous Fifa officials have been indicted in the United States, while Swiss authorities are also investigating the organisation. Blatter has also been banned from all football activity for six years after being found guilty of breaching Fifa's ethics rules over a $2m (£1.3m) "disloyal payment" to the head of European football's governing body Uefa, Michel Platini, who had been favourite to succeed the Swiss. Former France captain Platini was also suspended. Both men deny any wrongdoing and are appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Furthermore, Jerome Valcke, Fifa's secretary general and formerly Blatter's right-hand man, was banned for 12 years following allegations - which he denies - of misconduct while in office. Media playback is not supported on this device Fifa's leader is the figurehead for world football, often seen in public alongside presidents, prime ministers and royalty. There have been eight of them so far, presiding over the organisation's executive committee, which is where the real decision-making power lies. Fifa organises World Cups and other international tournaments, distributes broadcasting rights and should both protect and develop the world's most popular sport. The president also "legally represents" the organisation, "maintains relations between Fifa and the confederations, members, political bodies and international organisations", and "implements the decisions passed by the congress and the executive committee". There are five candidates, from Africa, Europe and the Middle East: Prince Ali bin al-Hussein Jerome Champagne Gianni Infantino Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa Tokyo Sexwale Read more: the five candidates profiled Media playback is not supported on this device Prince Ali: "I'm a candidate beholden to no one. I wouldn't apply political pressure or coercion. I'm the only candidate from a national association." Infantino: "I'm not a politician, I'm football person and I'm a worker. If we stop doing politics and start doing football, the world will admire us." Sheikh Salman: "My past and my track record speaks for itself. We want someone who is responsible and can deliver the promises he says." Champagne: "I want a Fifa that serves football, that serves you. The Fifa I dream of is one which correct the inequalities." Sexwale: "I'm here, despite any obstacle. My life experience as a fighter, someone who dies wearing his boots... I have come this far." Prince Ali wants to quadruple the amount Fifa's member associations receive - believing it will increase their sustainability - but wants the money properly accounted for. Infantino would expand the World Cup to 40 teams to ensure more smaller nations can participate. He also wants to hugely expand Fifa's development plan by investing £860m of its revenues and giving £3.6m to each member association. Sheikh Salman's big idea is to split Fifa in two with a business side handling commercial issues and the football side organising World Cups and developing the game. He believes this would stop executives making self-interested decisions. Champagne's most recent manifesto, Hope For Football, emphasised "rebalancing" the inequality in football and "reconciling" the game's "protagonists". He wants to modernise - by introducing technology to help referees, having women in key Fifa roles and run Fifa like a public sector organisation. Sexwale has focused on his background in administration in the election run-up. His manifesto headline was the idea to put sponsors on national teams shirts to help raise money for the football associations. Sheikh Salman is the front runner because he has the backing of his own Asian confederation, as well as Africa. The continents do not vote as a block and the ballot is held in secret. But such political backing from two of the biggest confederations should not be underestimated and may not be hard to deny. Infantino, who is effectively in charge of European football following the suspension of Uefa president Platini. The 45-year-old has, according to his camp, made gains in recent weeks and they believe he is the man to beat. On Thursday, Infantino told BBC Sport he was expecting 105 out of 207 votes in the first round - the same as Salman predicts for himself. Uefa's general secretary has strong support in Europe and South America, as well as significant backing in the potentially crucial Caribbean and his camp also thinks he will get half the votes in Africa. If those predictions prove true, he will win. Prince Ali lost out to Blatter in last year's election and looks like missing out again after failing to make gains after Platini was banned. However, if he does drop out and asks his supporters to back a rival candidate he could still be an important influence in deciding the eventual winner. As for Champagne and Sexwale, who is a former political prisoner on South Africa's Robben Island, they are the rank outsiders. Media playback is not supported on this device The delegates are also being asked to agree to reforms designed to end the problems that have led to Fifa's crisis in recent months and restore the organisation's reputation. Specifically, Fifa wants members to agree to term limits for top officials along with disclosure of their salaries. Another proposal is to disband Fifa's executive committee and replace it with a 36-member Fifa council, which will include a minimum of six women. Greg Dyke, who will cast a vote as chairman of the Football Association, says the reforms are "more important" than the new leader as it will provide an "opportunity for Fifa to start again". BBC sports editor Dan Roan in Zurich: "Few fans or players would recognise these individuals, let alone know about their policies or have trust in their leadership. "The selection of Sepp Blatter's successor should be the moment the governing body finally consigns the tainted tenure of their former president to history, and symbolically moves on from the stranglehold he held over the organisation for so long. "Except to many, it simply does not feel like that. "All of the men running for president are members of the football establishment. Four of them have spoken to Blatter in the build up to the election, presumably to ask for advice. All are loathe to condemn the disgraced former president. "The next 24 hours matters a great deal, and much is at stake. But do not assume that it represents the end of this great scandal, or the solution to FIFA's troubles. We should all know better by now." Read Dan Roan's full blog here	Fifa will get a new president on Friday when 207 delegates from around the world gather in Zurich, Switzerland to vote for a successor to Sepp Blatter.
Thunderstorms are short, sharp and shocking - for some literally. If you can hear the clouds rumbling, chances are the storm is close enough for you to be hit by lightning - it can strike up to 10 miles away from the centre of a storm. Count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder - if it is less than 30 seconds, there is a threat. If thunderstorms are forecast, postpone or cancel outdoor activities - especially golf and rod fishing. If a storm is approaching, take cover inside or in a car with the windows wound up - sheds, isolated trees and convertibles do not afford sufficient protection. Boaters and swimmers should get to shore as quickly as possible, as water conducts electricity. So too do metal pipes and phone lines. Unplug all non-essential appliances, including the television, as lightning can cause power surges. Do not use candles if the lights go out, as this poses a fire risk, and instead use a torch. Do not make phone calls, unless it is in an emergency, or put up an umbrella - the metal directs the current into the body. It is also best to put off baths, showers and dish washing, in case lightning strikes the house and sends a jolt of electricity through the metal plumbing. If caught outside in a thunderstorm, find a low spot away from trees, fences, and poles. If your skin tingles and hair stands on end, lightning is about to strike. Crouch down immediately, balancing on the balls of your feet, placing hands on knees with head between them. This makes you into the smallest target possible, and minimises contact with the ground. If someone has been hit by lightning, call for help as they will need urgent medical attention. It is safe to touch them - people struck by lightning carry no electrical charge that can shock other people. Check for a pulse and for breathing - if you know first aid, begin artificial respiration and CPR if necessary. If they are breathing, check for other possible injuries. Lightning strike victims have burns in two places - where the electric shock entered and then left the body, usually the soles of the feet. They may have broken bones or loss of hearing or sight. If waters start to rise, head for higher ground. Do not try to drive to safety, as cars can float in as little as a couple of feet of water, the depth of which is often very difficult to judge. Be wary of venturing out too soon - the BBC Weather Centre advises waiting 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning. Avoid downed power lines or broken cables. And one final tip - it is a myth that lightning never strikes the same place twice and always hits the tallest object. Lightning strikes the best conductor on the ground - whether it has been struck before or not. Sources: The Met Office and BBC Weather	Much of the UK has recently been hit by thunderstorms, but what is the best way to stay safe when thunder and lightning hits?
He had rejected a move to Birmingham on Wednesday but has now agreed personal terms and passed his medical. Stewart, who was in the final year of his contract at at Dens Park, had scored six goals in three games for Dundee already this season. He could make his Blues debut in Saturday's Championship match at Leeds. Stewart is Birmingham's second signing of the week following the arrival of striker Che Adams from Sheffield United. Birmingham opened their Championship campaign with a goalless draw against Cardiff City and were knocked out of the EFL Cup by League One side Oxford United in Tuesday's first-round tie.	Birmingham City have signed Dundee forward Greg Stewart on a three-year deal for a fee believed to be around £500,000.
About 568,000 people have backed a petition calling on the tycoon to be barred for comments he made about banning Muslims from the US. Labour MP Paul Flynn will lead a debate in Westminster Hall on 18 January. David Cameron has condemned Mr Trump, who has major business interests in the UK, but said he should be allowed in. The Commons petitions committee decided to hold a debate on the issue after considering the matter at a meeting on Tuesday. Under the current rules, MPs have to consider any petition with 100,000 signatures for discussion in Parliament. The debate will be held in the Commons' secondary debating chamber rather than the full chamber and there will be no vote at the end of it. Helen Jones, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it would allow for "a range of views" to be expressed. "By scheduling a debate on these petitions, the committee is not expressing a view on whether or not the government should exclude Donald Trump from the UK," she said. "As with any decision to schedule a petition for debate, it simply means that the committee has decided that the subject should be debated." But Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron questioned the decision to allocate parliamentary time to discussing Mr Trump. He tweeted: "Trump is a bloviating billionaire with downright offensive views. But I'd rather we debated inequality or the NHS." Mr Trump is currently the frontrunner, in some opinion polls, for the Republican nomination but he has been roundly criticised for comments he made about Muslims in the wake of December's fatal San Bernardino shootings - remarks which critics said were offensive and inflammatory. Home Secretary Theresa May, who makes decisions on banning orders, has said she cannot comment on the case. A rival petition opposing a ban on Mr Trump as illogical has been signed by nearly 40,000 people. This will also be debated by MPs.	MPs are to debate whether to bar Donald Trump from entering the UK in response to a public petition calling for action against the US Presidential candidate.
Wanda Campbell, 43, of Auchenmalg near Newton Stewart, was jailed for three years earlier this month. She was also ordered to pay compensation of £110,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court. Her appeal against that sentence and the conviction will be heard at the Appeal Court in Edinburgh. She was found guilty after a seven-day trial of acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013.	A woman found guilty of conning a south of Scotland garage firm out of £110,000 has lodged an appeal against her sentence and conviction.
Derbyshire Police said the taxi driver might have "crucial" information. A 17-year-old girl from Evesham has been charged with an attempted kidnap of a child in Normanton on 21 September. Police say the driver may have picked up two teenage girls in Derby on the day of the attempted kidnap. The two girls are both described as white and age 17. One girl had shoulder length blonde or brown hair and was wearing a dark blue blouse, a long cream coat, black trousers and black high-heeled shoes. The second girl had long blonde or brown hair and is believed to be about seven months pregnant. The taxi driver or anyone else with information about the case is asked to contact police.	Detectives investigating the alleged attempted kidnap of a baby are appealing for a taxi driver to contact them.
McGuigan and father Barry, the former world champion, signed Taylor to their Cyclone Promotions company when he won 2014 Commonwealth gold and turned pro. "I thought you saw the complete article," said Shane McGuigan of the man from Prestonpans in East Lothian. "He looked like he could punch - now he can really punch since changing the technique a bit." In addition, the trainer said he was keen to work with Taylor because "he has a great personality, he's a good-looking lad, he's fast and he can really fight - he ticked a lot of boxes". He added: "Also, I felt dad, with his background, a hall of famer, being a Celt himself, can appeal to a lot of the public in Scotland." Taylor left Edinburgh's Lochend club, where he worked under Terry McCormack, and now trains for his pro fights at the McGuigans' gym in Wandsworth, south London. He is aiming for a 10th consecutive win when he defends his Commonwealth super-lightweight title against Hackney's WBC Silver champion Ohara Davies at Glasgow's Braehead Arena on 8 July. "Josh is a phenomenal talent, a phenomenal force," added McGuigan junior. "He's been pro for a short time and he's already the Commonwealth champion and within six to 10 months he will be knocking on the door of a world title. "We've been working together for nearly two years now and he has excelled so quickly. "He has come out of the elite level amateur system and he is still progressing. "He has shown me so much in the gym and now it is our chance to really showcase that talent on the main stage in front of big audiences on television and at Braehead." Cyclone Promotions hopes Taylor will generate the same level of appeal as his stablemate, Belfast's Carl Frampton, a two-weight world champion. "With Carl, we built him up at home and then we took him to America and then to Manchester for a unification fight," said Shane McGuigan. "That's the same sort of platform we would like to set up for Josh Taylor. "We'd like to make him a star back home in Scotland and then filter him out to London, Manchester and the bigger arenas and then eventually go to the States. That is where he is inevitably going to end up, that's where the money is. "It is very rare that you have the Errol Spencers coming to fight for world titles over here. If you build loyalty with your fans they will go anywhere." The McGuigans have already had Taylor on the road, with three of his nine fights being in El Paso, New York and Las Vegas. "The American public loved his crowd-pleasing style, just like they loved Ricky Hatton," said the trainer. "People want to see a good fighter go to work and they will get that with Josh Taylor." Shane McGuigan is anticipating a "tricky" fight against undefeated Davies next month, expecting it to go to the later rounds. However, he believes the home fighter will prevail and take over the mantle of Ricky Burns, for so long Scotland's main boxing attraction but who, in April, lost his WBA belt in Taylor's weight class to Namibia's IBF champion Julius Indongo. "Ricky Burns has been a fantastic ambassador for Scottish boxing and a great champion but I don't see him reclaiming any world title; he's a step below that now. "Josh Taylor is the man. He is going to be holding the flag and going on to bigger and better things. If he can inherit some of Ricky's fans then that would be fantastic."	Scotland's Josh Taylor has all the elements it takes to make it to the top in boxing, says trainer Shane McGuigan.
President Barack Obama has declared the state a disaster area, meaning federal aid can be sent to the affected areas. Soldiers and emergency teams have rescued more than 20,000 people from their homes or cars after the floods, which were caused by torrential rain. Emergency workers told the BBC some people were still stuck in their homes. The neighbouring states of Alabama and Mississippi also experienced severe weather, although rains are lessening as they move west over Louisiana and further. One of the worst-affected areas is the Louisiana capital, Baton Rouge. William Daniel, an official there, told the BBC from an emergency control centre that between 8,000 and 10,000 people were in shelters. "We're still receiving phone calls about people who're trying to get out of their homes because they can't get out because either there's water coming in to their houses or their streets are blocked. "It is definitely an unprecedented flood here in Baton Rouge. Houses that have never ever even come close to flooding have water three and four foot high in to the houses." "This is a flood of epic proportions," JR Shelton, the mayor of Central City told local media. "When we talk about floods now, we'll talk about the great flood of 2016. "Everything else pales in comparison." Shanita Angrum, 32, called the police when she realised her family were trapped in their home. An officer arrived and carried her six-year-old daughter to safety. "Snakes were everywhere," she told Associated Press. "The whole time I was just praying for God to make sure me and my family were OK." John Mitchell, a 23-year-old Louisiana resident, was forced to swim to safety with his girlfriend and her one-year-old daughter. They were rescued by police officers in a boat. "This is the worst it's been, ever,'' Mr Mitchell said. "We tried to wait it out, but we had to get out." Several rivers in Louisiana and Mississippi are overflowing. The state is prone to bursts of extreme weather; thousands of acres of Louisiana were flooded in 2011 to divert water from the flooded Mississippi River and to spare cities, including Baton Rouge and New Orleans, that lie downstream. In 2005, New Orleans suffered one of the worst natural disasters in US history, when Hurricane Katrina hit the city. The storm killed nearly 2,000 people and displaced one million. Thousands of homes were flooded and destroyed in Louisiana and along the Gulf coast.	At least five people have died and thousands have been rescued after "historic" flooding swamped the US state of Louisiana.
The rare Tyrannosaurus bataar, 7m long (23ft), was bought by an anonymous bidder for more than $1m (Â£630,000) in New York. The sale went ahead despite protests from the Mongolian president. Elbegdorj Tsakhia says the skeleton, unearthed in the Gobi Desert, came from Mongolia and that exporting fossils found in the country is illegal. The auctioneers, Heritage Auctions, say the specimen was imported legally. A restraining court order in the name of the Mongolian leader was put on the sale. Tyrannosaurus bataar is an Asian cousin of the meat-eating Tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton in New York is thought to be one of the most complete and well preserved ever discovered, says the BBC's Jonathan Blake in Washington. "When it comes to dinosaurs, number one, dinosaurs in general are extremely rare. But the rarest of the dinosaurs are the carnivores, the meat eaters - the top of the food chain if you will," David Herskowitz, director of natural history at Heritage Auctions, told APTV. "And, of all the meat eaters that are out there, the most famous are the Tyrannosaurids. They are the most desirable, but they are the most elusive. They are the most difficult to find. Even though they are so big, there are not that many of them around." Found about seven years ago in the Gobi Desert, the T. bataar remained in storage in England. The T. bataar was slightly smaller and had longer arms than its cousin, Mr Herskowitz said. This is the second Tyrannosaurid to be sold at auction, says Mr Herskowitz. The first was a T. rex named Sue sold in 1997 for more than $8m. Lawyers for the auction house say the sale did not break any US laws - but it will not be confirmed until it has been approved by a US court.	A row has broken out over the sale of a dinosaur skeleton at auction in the US.
The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday. It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal. Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it "a shambles". According to the draft, Labour would: On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids. First it would introduce an "immediate emergency price cap" of £1,000 a year. The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee. The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election. A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few." The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983. It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone. Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices aren't as controversial as critics would claim But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed. Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does . Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign. These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported. On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called "bedroom tax" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21. The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66. The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph. A Conservative spokesman said: "This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed. "The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk." In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually. Labour is also promising to meet the 2% Nato pledge.	A draft of Labour's general election manifesto has been leaked, including plans to nationalise parts of the energy industry and scrap tuition fees.
The unrest erupted after a policeman allegedly killed the man and wounded two others during an argument over the price of a cup of tea. The policeman has been arrested and the case referred to prosecutors. Video footage showed angry protesters overturning a police vehicle while chanting "the police are thugs". Egypt has seen a series of allegations of police brutality in recent months, stoking public anger. The interior ministry said that Tuesday's incident in the eastern suburb of Rehab began with an argument over the price of a cup of tea between several policeman and a street vendor. One policeman opened fire, killing the vendor and wounding two passersby, it added. Photographs showed what appeared to be a man lying still on the floor, covered in blood, surrounded by angry onlookers. Witnesses said the protest began shortly after the incident. "Security forces brought in two riot police vehicles and an armoured truck and the victim's family is here and pelting them with rocks," one witness told the Reuters news agency. "Security forces are retreating and promising justice but the crowd is demanding police hand over the killer." In February, there was a protest outside the Cairo security directorate after a policeman reportedly shot dead a driver in a street in an argument over a fare. There were also riots in Ismailia and the southern city of Luxor after at least three people died in police custody in a single week in November. The government has also been forced to repeatedly deny allegations that security services were responsible for the killing of Italian academic Giulio Regeni in Cairo earlier this year. Officials have blamed a criminal gang for his abduction and torture.	Hundreds of people have taken to the streets of Egypt's capital, Cairo, to protest after a tea vendor was allegedly shot dead by police.
BBC Wales Sport understands the Gills made an enquiry for Byrne, before Edinburgh changed his mind over a player he brought to Rodney Parade. Edinburgh opted to end the pursuit out of respect for his old club, who he managed from 2011-2015, so as not to weaken their battle against relegation. They are currently 20th in League Two, seven points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Newport have confirmed the release of defender Matt Taylor. The 34-year old joined from Cheltenham in the summer but made just five appearances for the south Wales club. "Further to recent discussions, we can confirm that Matt Taylor will leave the Club with immediate effect having mutually agreed to terminate his contract," a statement from the club read. Taylor is understood to be a target for Torquay United.	Newport midfielder Mark Byrne was a transfer target for Gillingham before a U-turn from manager Justin Edinburgh.
In May, Qatar vowed to improve the rights of migrants in the Gulf state amid growing alarm at their treatment. But Amnesty said  progress to end exploitation had been minimal. Among others, the report highlighted that Qatar was "lagging behind" in reforming controversial laws that tie migrants to a single employer. Amnesty said that requirements that workers obtain exit permits from their employers in order to leave the country were also still in place. Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights at AI, said: "Time is running out fast. It has been four years since Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, putting itself in the global spotlight, so far its response to migrant labour abuses has not been much more than promises of action and draft laws." "Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup tournament that is built on forced labour and exploitation." The Gulf state has seen an influx of foreign workers ahead of the football tournament and expatriates now make up the bulk of the workforce in the country. Earlier in November, Qatar's Sports Minister Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al-Ali told The Associated Press news agency that the country planned to implement labour reforms in the "next few months". Amnesty says the proposals do not go far enough. The report said that Qatari officials increasingly acknowledge the need for improvement but that widespread changes must happen in the coming months. A failure to put serious changes in place would "call into question whether the Qatari authorities are serious about reform," said AI. More than 180 migrant workers died in Qatar last year and a significant number are believed to have suffered injuries as a result of unsafe working practices. Qatar is reported to be spending more than $200bn (Â£121bn) on a series of infrastructure projects, and says the World Cup is a catalyst for a nationwide building project.	Qatar is failing to tackle the abuse of migrant workers, Amnesty International has warned, six months after work began on the Fifa World Cup 2022 stadiums.
This is the first assault by jihadists in the West African state, raising fears of more instability in the region. The attack suggests al-Qaeda-linked militants are increasingly focusing on France's former colonies, as a way of getting back at France for its leading role in fighting them in West Africa. The former colonies have become increasingly vulnerable following a French-led military operation in northern Mali in 2013, which beat back al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and its local affiliates after they seized control of the region and threatened to take the capital, Bamako. The insurgents retreated to their desert hide-outs and regrouped and in the last year have launched high-profile gun and bomb attacks. In November, they killed 22 people in an attack on a luxury hotel in Bamako. In January, at least 30 people were killed in an assault on a hotel and cafe popular with foreigners in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. These were the first such attacks in the two cities, threatening the vital tourism industry. No. Muslims in former French colonies in sub-Saharan Africa have always practised a moderate version of Islam, embracing French culture and its people far more than their counterparts in North Africa. In fact, Ivory Coast's Muslim President Alassane Ouattara is married to French national, Dominique Nouvian, who was born Jewish but later became Catholic. Senegal's former President Abdoulaye Wade is also married to a French national, Viviane Wade. So, the growth of militant Islam in these countries has come as a shock. Groups like AQIM may be exploiting high levels of unemployment to gain recruits. The recent attacks have all been linked to veteran jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, who was behind the audacious siege on the well-secured Algerian gas plant in 2013. Following the Burkina Faso attack, Senegal, another former French colony popular with tourists, ordered that security be tightened at hotels. This followed the arrest in Senegal of some imams in November on suspicion of promoting radical Islamist ideology or having close ties with the Boko Haram, a militant group which launched an insurgency in Nigeria, a former British colony, in 2009. Senegalese officials raised fears that Boko Haram, already active in Niger, Chad and Cameroon, all former French colonies, was expanding its influence in West Africa. Boko Haram is affiliated to the Islamic State group, which is al-Qaeda's rival, and there is concern that competition between the two to be the most ruthless jihadi group could lead to more attacks in West Africa. France has about 3,000 troops in the region as part of Operation Barkhane, which French officials describe as the "pillar" of their counter-terrorism strategy in the region. The troops are spread across five countries - Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad. Apart from tackling militants in these countries, Operation Barkhane aims to break up arms-smuggling gangs, which operate freely across the region because of its porous borders. Many of the weapons come from Libya, which has turned into what some analysts call an arms bazaar since the overthrow of long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.	Militant Islamists are expanding their influence in West Africa, with at least 18 people killed in an attack on a beach resort in Ivory Coast on Sunday.
Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was initially stuck behind Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel but switched to a different strategy to get ahead. The German was third ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Kimi Raikkonen. The result means Rosberg has reduced Hamilton's advantage in the championship to 20 points, while Vettel is 31 points adrift in third place. It was Mercedes' most dominant grand prix since the first race in Australia. Ferrari had come to this weekend with a major upgrade package, with revisions to almost every aerodynamic surface of the car, but Mercedes were perhaps further ahead than they had been all season. Rosberg converted his pole position into a lead at the first corner and simply cruised into the distance as Vettel held up Hamilton behind him. Mercedes urged Hamilton to try to pass the Ferrari, but he told the team it was impossible to get close enough to overtake on the pit straight even with the help of the DRS overtaking aid. Mercedes decided their best option was to give Hamilton some clear track, and told him that they would switch to a three-stop strategy and try to pass Vettel at the end of the race. But Hamilton did not need to overtake the Ferrari on track. Stopping on lap 32 to fit the slower 'hard' tyre, Hamilton immediately set the fastest lap of the race and proceeded to take huge chunks out of Vettel's advantage. Media playback is not supported on this device Twenty seconds behind when he rejoined, Hamilton had cut Vettel's lead in half by the time the Ferrari driver made his second and final stop eight laps later. Vettel rejoined 13.5 seconds behind Hamilton, who continued to pull away until he was 23 seconds in front by the time of his final stop on lap 51, which was comfortably enough to allow him to rejoin in front of the Ferrari. Now 17 seconds behind Rosberg, Hamilton fancied his chances of catching his team-mate for the win, but was told by his engineer Peter Bonnington that he had too much to do and to "consolidate" second place. Hamilton pressed Bonnington, saying: "Is it impossible?" He was told: "Yes, it's impossible. He'll respond if we pick up the pace." "Perfect weekend," said Rosberg. "The car has been awesome - all weekend." Hamilton said: "I got a bad start, had lots of wheelspin but it was a good race. Nico did a fantastic job and I was just grateful I could get back up to second. This was a difficult weekend for me and I'll take this." Behind Vettel in the race, Bottas took fourth, fighting off a stern challenge from Ferrari's Raikkonen in the closing laps. Ferrari inverted Raikkonen's tyre strategy, putting him on the 'hard' tyre for his middle stint rather than taking the conventional route of leaving it for the end of the race. Media playback is not supported on this device That meant Raikkonen had a grip advantage over Bottas, who was on the 'hard' tyre in the final stint, but he was unable to make it pay. The second Williams of Felipe Massa was sixth, from the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo and Lotus's Romain Grosjean. Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz passed Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat for ninth place at the first corner of the last lap. The stewards investigated the incident because Sainz went off track through Turn Two as he completed the move - gaining an advantage by leaving the track is forbidden - but they decided to take no further action. Three laps earlier, Sainz cleanly passed team-mate Max Verstappen for 10th place. The two Toro Rossos had started fifth and sixth and had always suspected it would be tough to beat Raikkonen, Massa and the Red Bulls, all of which had qualified behind them. Sainz took advantage of being on the 'medium' tyres in the final stint while Verstappen was on the 'hard'. The Dutchman ran wide in the final twisty section of the track on lap 62 and Sainz was able to draft past on the straight. Jenson Button finished 16th after a troubled race for McLaren. Team-mate Fernando Alonso ran 12th in the first stint, climbed as high as seventh at one point thanks to a late first pit stop, but retired from 14th place with brake failure.

An 18-year-old woman was driving a Toyota Yaris when it was in a crash with a Ford Transit van on the A595 near Bootle at 19:55 BST on Friday. She and her front seat passenger, also 18, were pronounced dead at the scene. A third 18-year-old woman, in the back of the car, was flown by air ambulance to hospital where her condition is said to be "critical". The 51-year-old man driving the van was also flown to hospital, where he is in a serious but stable condition. The road was closed for six hours for the vehicles to be examined and then removed, Cumbria Police said. The force is appealing for witnesses.	Two teenagers have been killed and another seriously injured in a car crash in Cumbria.
David Crompton, 52, is to step down in November after four years in the post and 31 years in policing. His retirement comes after a report by Prof John Drew found the force's response to the abuse was "inadequate". It was commissioned after the Jay Report found 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. In a brief statement, South Yorkshire Police said: "The chief constable's contract runs until November. He will retire after 31 years in policing." Prof Drew's report, which was published on Wednesday, said the force "regularly missed" opportunities to tackle the problem of abuse and had "seriously under-resourced" its early work. The report also said several attempts to alert senior officers to the issue fell on "deaf ears". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) revealed it was looking into 200 allegations about the conduct of police relating to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. It also said it had 55 ongoing investigations linked to at least 66 officers in South Yorkshire and had received more than 100 allegations linked to officers who have not yet been identified. In a statement, the IPCC said: "From the moment the IPCC wrote to South Yorkshire Chief Constable David Crompton to advise him of our expectations for referrals following the publication of the Jay Report in August 2014, the number of allegations and number of officers involved has steadily increased. "We first announced an investigation in November 2014 and that related to allegations raised in the Jay Report against 10 officers." Aside from the issue of abuse in Rotherham, Mr Crompton also faced criticism when Sir Cliff Richard's home was searched in connection with an inquiry into alleged child abuse in 2014. The force co-operated with the BBC to enable live TV coverage of the raid, which an independent report found had "interfered with his [Sir Cliff's} privacy and may well have caused unnecessary distress". Mr Crompton took over the chief constable role in 2012 from Meredydd Hughes after he retired from the post.	The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police has announced his retirement on the day a report criticised his force's handling of child sexual exploitation.
The market research firm GfK conducted a one-off online survey of 2,000 people after the result was known. Its confidence index fell by eight points to minus nine, a drop not since seen December 1994. Less confident consumers tend to curb their spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the UK economy. It is also one measure watched by the Bank of England when deciding its next move on interest rates. Governor Mark Carney has already warned the UK's economic outlook is "challenging" following the decision to leave the EU. The Gfk survey also suggested that 60% of consumers expect the general economic situation to worsen over the next year, compared with 46% in June. Just 20% expect it to improve, down from 27% last month. The number of people who believe prices will rise rapidly in the next 12 months jumped to 33% from 13% in June. It also showed regional differences in the fall in confidence - with the north of England seeing a 19 point drop and Scotland seeing an 11 point drop. The south of England saw just a two point drop. The survey was run from 30 June to 5 July to capture the mood of consumers immediately after the referendum on 24 June. "Our analysis suggests that in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, sectors like travel, fashion and lifestyle, home, living, DIY and grocery are particularly vulnerable to consumers cutting back their discretionary spending," said Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK. A separate survey indicated that retailers were already beginning to feel the impact. The BDO's monthly High Street Sales Tracker showed a strong start to June, with sales growing 3.8% year on year. That decreased throughout the month and by the end of June, after the referendum, sales had fallen by 8.1% compared with last year. Official economic figures from the Office for National Statistics that will reflect any Brexit impact will start being released in August.	Consumer confidence has seen its sharpest drop in 21 years after the UK vote to leave the EU, a survey suggests.
Police Scotland's dog branch and air support unit have been deployed in the Irvine area in an effort to trace Gordon Speirs. His disappearance was said to be totally out of character. Mr Speirs is described as being 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with red hair and blue eyes. At the time of his disappearance he was wearing navy coloured combat trousers, a black waterproof jacket and timberland boots. Insp David Carballo of Ayrshire Police Division said: "This is totally out of character for Gordon and his family are understandably very worried. "With the deteriorating weather conditions and concerns for his health, we are keen to have him back home safely as soon as possible. "I am appealing to anyone who may have seen him or indeed for Gordon himself to contact us by calling 101."	Police have launched an extensive search for a 53-year-old man who has been missing from his home in North Ayrshire since Thursday morning.
The Treasury has agreed to make the money available over a five-year period for a proposed new Historical Investigations Unit and other bodies. But the failure of Stormont politicians to reach agreement on how best to deal with the past means those institutions, and the money, are now on hold. Justice Minister David Ford told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that until agreement is reached, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and Police Ombudsman will remain responsible for legacy investigations. However, they have not been given any additional funding for the task. The minister said he has been assured that the government intends honouring its financial promise, but only when the new bodies are established. Mr Ford said he has met the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers and "made the point strenuously" that the government has a responsibility to help deal with the past. "There needs to be an arrangement to provide additional money for institutions required to deal with the past," he said. The minister also said the failure of Stormont's recent Fresh Start agreement to decide how best to deal with legacy issues was "potentially throwing away the best opportunity for a generation to deal with our troubled past". He added that the failure had also made progress on legacy inquests "much more difficult". He revealed that he has authorised the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service to recruit "investigative support" for coroners to deal with those inquests, which include some of the most controversial killings of the troubles. The appointments of additional staff are expected to be made by the spring of next year.	The government has been urged to make available part of a special £150m fund which has been set aside for new legacy bodies to the PSNI and Police Ombudsman to investigate the past.
The 44-year-old had been in charge at Rugby Park since February 2016, when he replaced Gary Locke. He kept Killie in the Premiership last season and leaves them in sixth place. Chris Brass, 41, had been announced in December as head coach at Bury until the end of the season after David Flitcroft was fired. "Lee is someone who I have followed through his playing and managerial career," said Shakers chairman Stewart Day. "I firmly believe that Lee is the right man and he has an enthusiasm and passionate desire to take this club forward. I was overwhelmed with his knowledge of the club and the contacts he has in the game and how he believes in what we can achieve together." Former Huddersfield, Birmingham and Blackpool boss Clark takes charge of a Bury side sat in the relegation zone in the third tier and will be on the sidelines for the game against Chesterfield on Saturday. Assistant Lee McCulloch will become interim manager of Kilmarnock, with Peter Leven as his No.2. McCulloch is likely to be offered the position until the end of the season. Clark, a former midfielder at Newcastle, Fulham and Sunderland, won 10 of his 44 games in charge at Kilmarnock. "I have had a wonderful year as Kilmarnock manager," he told the club website. "The club and fans have treated myself and my family fantastically - we are in a good position with a strong and loyal squad and staff. "The directors have given me their full support in rebuilding the squad and the fans will always have a special place in my heart, but I still have huge ambition to one day manage at the highest level in England, which is obviously the Premier League. "I feel that the fresh challenge of managing a club in England's League One could provide me with the platform to build towards this goal."	Lee Clark has left Kilmarnock to become boss at League One side Bury, after they agreed a compensation package with the Scottish Premiership side.

Iwan Wyn Lewis of Penygroes, Gwynedd, had been sectioned at Ysbyty Gwynedd after allegedly assaulting his mother. The 36-year-old was visited by an officer in April 2016 about his bail arrangements, which a doctor said could have added to his distress. His body was found in the Menai Strait on 2 May. Mr Lewis was receiving treatment at the hospital's Hergest unit and was later moved to the Cynan ward where he received the visit from the officer. Speaking at the inquest in Caernarfon on Thursday, consultant psychiatrist Dr Olufemi Adebajo said he was "extremely unhappy" about the visit. "I don't think the police should be able to come to the ward without special permission," he said. Asked by coroner Nicola Jones whether the conversation with the officer could have added to Mr Lewis' agitation and distress, Dr Adebajo said: "It's quite possible - even likely". He said he had known Mr Lewis for more than two years and never considered him to be a suicide risk. The day before his death, he had asked staff for extra medication because he said he was feeling agitated, but they did not change his dosage because they could see no sign of agitation. On the evening of 2 May, Mr Lewis told staff he was going to the shop, but 45 minutes later his body was found in the Menai Strait. The inquest continues.	North Wales Police has been criticised at an inquest for sending an officer to speak to a hospital patient with paranoid schizophrenia.
If you were sold PPI via your credit card then the differences can amount to thousands of pounds. This is because of the way some credit card providers interpret the regulatory guidelines. "It's becoming a bit of a lottery," personal finance expert Jonquil Lowe told BBC Radio 4's Moneybox programme. "The amount of redress you get depends on which provider you happen to have your credit card with," said Ms Lowe, who is a lecturer in personal finance at the Open University. These differences emerged last year when Martin Baker, managing director of the Swindon-based claims management company Renaissance Easy Claim, began challenging redress offers from MBNA, an American-based credit card provider whose cards are extensively marketed in the UK. Mr Baker noticed that MBNA's compensation offers to his clients appeared to be significantly lower than he would have expected from the high street banks. One client, Mark Pascoe, was offered £5,800 in compensation by MBNA. Had his card been with a high street bank, Mr Baker estimates he would have received more than £13,000. Mr Baker now has around 1,000 MBNA compensation clients on his books. "In a sample of our cases," Mr Baker told the BBC's Moneybox programme, "we found 80% were due more if MBNA paid according to the way the high street banks pay." On average, MBNA's redress offers amount to around half what high street banks would award on the same credit card history, he said. Capital One, another American credit card provider, "adopts a very similar approach to MBNA, with similar results," said Mr Baker. So how do such differences arise? When compensating for mis-sold PPI, regulators require card providers to put customers back into the financial position they would have been in if they had never had PPI at all. Each card provider is free to establish its own methodology for calculating redress, within overall regulatory guidelines. A key difference arises when a cardholder occasionally pays off their monthly card balance in full. To calculate the compensation owing, banks have to reconstruct a customer's credit card history, removing mis-sold PPI premiums, fees and charges that premiums triggered - for exceeding a card's credit limit, for example - and any interest charged on those payments. With these PPI charges removed the monthly amounts owing are lower. So when card-holders pay off what was their original monthly balance - they have overpaid according to their reconstructed card history. The differing treatment of such overpayments is a major cause of the differences in compensation offers, argues Martin Baker. While high street banks treat an overpayment as a temporary credit to be set against future spending on a customer's card - MBNA and Capital One treat it as a permanent loan from the customer to themselves lasting for the lifetime of the card, he says. It may sound a technicality, but it can have a significant impact on compensation. Because while regulators require card providers to pay customers 8% interest on such loans, that's far less than the amount MBNA and Capital One charge customers on their card borrowings. Martin Baker describes this as a "systemic flaw" in MBNA and Capital One's methodology. Earlier this year, the BBC asked regulators if they thought MBNA and Capital One's methodologies fell within the official rules and guidelines. The Financial Conduct Authority told the BBC they did not accept that there was "a systemic flaw" in the calculations. The Financial Ombudsman said in the cases they were seeing, "card providers were fairly compensating consumers, taking into account the FCA's guidance and the Ombudsman's approach". To work out how two such very different compensation methodologies could both seemingly be deemed acceptable by regulators, Moneybox commissioned an independent review of MBNA's calculations from the Open University's Jonquil Lowe. After a detailed analysis of MBNA's methodology Ms Lowe found it differed substantially from the regulatory guidance most banks follow. How much difference that makes to compensation, she says, will vary from case to case. Ms Lowe says regulatory guidelines do allow banks to make assumptions about what customers might have done had they not had PPI on their credit cards which include assumptions about how banks treat overpayments in their card reconstructions. But because these assumptions can have so big an impact on compensation over time, Ms Lowe says they need careful monitoring. "If an alternative method is used, it has to be appropriate and fair, given the individual circumstances of the case. "The onus has to be on MBNA to say why its method is fairer and more appropriate than the method set out by the regulator and used, in most cases, by the Ombudsman." Both MBNA and Capital One declined to be interviewed by the BBC, or to say why they claim the assumptions in their calculations are appropriate. In a statement, MBNA said its calculations were developed in line with the FCA's guidance, and based on how the Financial Ombudsman would expect them to look at individual cases. Of Jonquil Lowe's conclusions it said: "Jonquil Lowe's report sets out how she assumes the FOS might deal with MBNA's cases, based on her theoretical interpretation of general guidance. Our aim is to put customers back in the situation they would have been in, had they not taken a PPI product." Capital One said it assessed every case on its individual circumstances and is in frequent contact with the Financial Ombudsman Service to ensure its calculations were "fair and accurate". Meanwhile, regulators continue to stress that any customer who is unhappy with a redress offer can always appeal to the Financial Ombudsman for a ruling. Given the complexity of the calculations behind the offers, however, Jonquil Lowe doubts the practicality of that advice. "It took me 80 hours to unravel what was going on [and] I've got a lot of technical expertise. "The average consumer could not, I think, reconstruct their accounts in the way that I have done. Not least because the information they get along with their redress is usually not detailed enough for them to be able to make that kind of check. "It is extremely hard for consumers to know whether they had a fair redress, or not." With that in mind, Andrew Tyrie MP, the newly re-elected Chair of the influential House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said: "We'll actually be keeping a very close eye on this in the weeks and months ahead. "We've been working very hard to get a decent level of address on PPI for a long time and we're certainly not going to let go of the subject until we're satisfied a correct and decent amount of compensation is being paid."	People who were mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) can receive widely differing compensation, a BBC investigation has found.
"If I'd been in her shoes, I would have sacked me too," he told the BBC. Mr Gove said he regretted standing for the Tory leadership, saying he made "mistakes" in the way he withdrew his support from Boris Johnson. He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as "doing a Gove", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with Fern Britton, to be broadcast on BBC One on Sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to "make a contribution" in the future. Mr Gove said his decision to back Leave in the EU referendum had placed a "significant strain" on his relationship with his long-term friend David Cameron. He and his wife, Daily Mail journalist Sarah Vine, had been close friends with Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha - but the two couples have not had a "proper conversation" since the 23 June poll, he said. Mr Cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the EU referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw Mr Gove back Boris Johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning Mr Johnson's ability to do the job. Mr Gove would not reveal what Mr Johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that "the way in which I declared my stand for the leadership, I shouldn't have done it that way". "As I look back on that time, I think that there were mistakes that I made... "I also think that my initial instinct that I was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed." After Mrs May entered Downing Street, Mr Johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while Mr Gove remains on the Conservative backbenches. "When Theresa May became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if I'd been in her shoes I would have sacked me too," said Mr Gove. "So I entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. "I had six years when I was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - I hope that I did." But he conceded that "nothing is forever in politics". "I have to accept that the way in which I spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences." Mr Gove said he is now focusing on his work on the Commons committee on exiting the EU and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect. Fern Britton meets Michael Gove can be seen on BBC One at 10:00 GMT on Sunday, 11 December.	Former cabinet minister Michael Gove says Theresa May was right to sack him after she became prime minister.
George Wharton, 14, and Rhy Baker, 13, died when Thomas McMeekin crashed into a tree in Morley, near Leeds, on 7 March. The defendant and a teenage passenger were also left paralysed by the crash, Leeds Crown Court was told. McMeekin, of Bruntcliffe Road, Morley, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving. One witness told the hearing McMeekin had driven "like a lunatic". He was accused of "showing off" while driving the car, which had been bought for him by his mother just five days before the crash. The court heard he had advertised "lifts cheaper than taxis" on social media. He will be sentenced next month.	A motorist was driving "like a lunatic" when he caused a crash which killed two teenage passengers and severely injured two others, a court heard.
There will be posters with the slogan "liar, liar" aimed at MPs who U-turned over their pledge to oppose fee increases for universities in England. "We won't let them trade lies for power again," said NUS president Toni Pearce. "The system now is fairer than Labour's fees system," said a Lib Dem spokesman. The coalition government's decision to raise tuition fees in England to a maximum of Â£9,000 provoked a series of sometimes violent student protests. Much of the anger was aimed at the Liberal Democrats, who had targeted the student vote in 2010 with personal pledges to vote against any tuition fee increase. In the current election campaign, the NUS is seeking to mobilise the student vote against MPs who had promised to oppose higher fees but then voted to almost treble them. "I'd like to say directly to Nick Clegg that your apology won't cover any of the Â£40,000 debt that students will graduate with for the first time this summer," said NUS president, Ms Pearce. "They pledged to scrap tuition fees - they lied. We won't let them trade lies for power again. We represent seven million students and are urging every single one across the country to vote against broken pledges." This election issue includes funding for schools, university tuition fees and early years education. Policy guide: Where the parties stand The campaign will involve advertising vans, billboards and newspaper adverts, says the NUS. It is aimed at 28 Liberal Democrats, including leading figures such as Nick Clegg, David Laws and Vince Cable. There are also two Conservative MPs who are accused by the NUS of failing to keep a promise to oppose the fee increase. There were another 21 Liberal Democrat MPs who kept their pledge to vote against the fee increase. The NUS also published a poll of issues that will be important to student voters, which found the biggest concern is cost of living. There have been warnings from students of a lack of recognition for problems in paying for accommodation and living costs and lack of maintenance loans. Labour has promised to cut tuition fees to Â£6,000 per year, while the Conservatives want to lift the cap on undergraduate university places and have called for more value for money for students. Some university leaders have been critical of proposals to cut fees, arguing that higher fees have not deterred poorer students. University applications dipped when fees were increased, but have since recovered to record levels, with more disadvantaged students applying than when fees were lower. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said: "I'm not prime minister, I lead a party of 8% of MPs in the House of Commons, there was no money left... Labour had introduced and whacked up fees before we had come into office. "But I actually think what we did was incredibly impressive for the smaller party in the coalition, all our front page priorities we stuck to - and we will do so again." And a Liberal Democrat spokesman said: "There will be some people who will judge us for one thing we could not do. But many fair minded people will judge us by what we have been able to do: tax cuts for millions of working people; more money for poor children in schools; a record two million apprentices; equal marriage; shared parental leave."	The National Union of Students has launched a "payback time" campaign against MPs who broke their 2010 election promise over tuition fees, including leading Liberal Democrats.
The 35-year-old threw a new F51 European record of 17.68m to score 1100 points and finish ahead of team-mates Josie Pearson and Gemma Prescott. It beat the previous best of 15.83 set by Ireland's Catherine O'Neill in 2001. "I'm throwing well at the moment and once I got the big throw, I knew the pressure was off," said Butterfield. The Glasgow-based newcomer, who was left paralysed by a tumour on her spinal cord in 2011,  took up athletics earlier this year via the talent identification programme Girls4Gold after playing wheelchair rugby for a couple of years. "Because I was already doing rugby and the strength and conditioning work with that, I just had to try to adapt that to athletics," she told BBC Sport. "I've loved it and trained hard but I know I have a lot more to learn. "Representing GB for the first time here has been a bit surreal but the team has been great and everyone has been really welcoming. "The difference sport has made to me is huge but I never dreamed I would be part of this so soon." Compatriot Pearson was frustrated after three of her six throws were deemed to be fouls. "There was a technical issue with my throws with an official saying I was breaking some of the rules," she said. "I've been throwing the same way all season and not been pulled up on it before so it is frustrating for this to happen at a major championship where I know I could have thrown further."	Debutant Jo Butterfield led a British clean sweep of the medals in the women's F32/51 club throw at the IPC Athletics European Championships.
Dressed in a suit, he handed out currencies in exchange for sterling to customers at the Asda in Trafford Park, police said. He then emptied the safe into a bag before walking out of the store at 15:45 BST on 29 July. Police said they were still searching for the man, described as in his mid 20s or 30s, Asian and of slim build. A 22-year-old woman has been arrested and bailed on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.	A man has walked away with £40,000 from a superstore in Manchester after posing as a manager at the Bureau de Change.
Guernsey, who play in the eight tier of English football, will face Thamesmead Town on 20 August at Footes Lane. "To bring the iconic competition to Guernsey will be something special," said boss Tony Vance. When they were last drawn at home in 2013, the tie was moved as the ground was being used by a local rugby club. What was a second qualifying-round match against Dover Athletic in the 2013-14 competition was moved away from Footes Lane to the headquarters of the Sussex County Football Association after an agreement over a rearranged kick-off time could not be reached. The upcoming FA Cup campaign will be the fourth which Guernsey have taken part in, having first been introduced in 2013. "The FA Cup has never gone out of the UK and here's an opportunity when it's going to, so hopefully everyone embraces it," Vance told BBC Radio Guernsey. "Hopefully being a home draw we can be at full strength and have a good game. "It's taken five years to get this opportunity, so it's really pleasing and I hope it goes ahead and there are no issues that happen like last time with Dover." Thamesmead, who played Guernsey's fierce rivals Jersey in a pre-season friendly last year, play in the Isthmian League Division One North - the same step as Guernsey in the football pyramid. Under Football Association rules if a replay is needed after Guernsey have been drawn away, it has to take place at a neutral venue on the English mainland.	An FA Cup game will take place on the Channel Islands for the first time after Guernsey FC were drawn at home in next month's preliminary round.
The Wasps player-manager has been named League One manager of the month for February after three wins and a draw and his side sit second from top. "Since I took myself out of the team we've started playing well," he told league sponsor Ladbrokes. "I was finding it difficult at the beginning to do both. I wasn't giving 100% to either role." But the 35-year-old midfielder, who took charge in October after Jack Ross moved to Goodwin's former club, St Mirren, is not ending his playing career just yet. "I'm not making an official announcement that I'm retiring," said Goodwin, whose side sit second in the table and look certainties for at least a promotion play-off place. "I still keep myself fit and train with the boys twice a week and, if needs must, if we get a number of suspensions and injuries between now and the end of the season, I want to be able to play. "At this moment in time, the lads who are in my position are playing extremely well and I couldn't justify playing myself. "I felt it was better for me if I was going to give the opportunity the best crack then I should take myself out of the playing side of it, which has benefitted me greatly. "I'm now able to see the bigger picture from the side of the park and able to have more of an influence on tactical decisions and substitutions." Alloa began the month with a 2-2 draw at home to leaders Livingston and have since narrowed the gap at the top to seven points with nine games left. "At one stage, they had a 12-point gap and people probably looked at it and thought it was impossible for us to catch them," said Goodwin. "But we never believed that it was over and still don't to this day. "They're certainly in the driving seat, it's their's to lose, but if they're going to win the league then they'll have to go and get it. We won't hand it to them. "If they go and lose on Saturday and we win then it's down to four and we have to play each other."	Jim Goodwin has put Alloa Athletic's turnaround in form down to his decision to drop himself.
The projection from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows a far-reaching shift in the balance of graduate numbers, with the rising Asian economies accelerating ahead of the United States and western Europe. The forecasts for the shape of the "global talent pool" in 2020 show China as rapidly expanding its graduate numbers - set to account for 29% of the world's graduates aged between 25 and 34. The biggest faller is going to be the United States - down to 11% - and for the first time pushed into third place, behind India. The US and the countries of the European Union combined are expected to account for little more than a quarter of young graduates. Russia is also set to decline - its share of the world's graduates almost falling by half since the beginning of the century. Indonesia, according to the OECD's projections, will rise into fifth place. Is this an end-of-empire moment? Higher education has become the mirror and magnifier of economic performance - and in the post-World-War-II era, universities in the US, western Europe, Japan and Russia have dominated. The US in particular has been the university superpower - in wealth, influence and until recently in raw numbers. Up until 2000, the US still had a share of young graduates similar to China. And Japan had as big a proportion of young graduates as India. Now China and India are the biggest players. Their rise in graduate numbers reflects their changing ambitions - wanting to compete against advanced economies for high-skill, high-income employment. Instead of offering low-cost manufacture, they are targeting the hi-tech professional jobs that have become the preserve of the Westernised middle classes. As the OECD figures show, this is not simply a case of countries such as China expanding while others stand still. Across the industrialised world, graduate numbers are increasing - just not as quickly as China, where they have risen fivefold in a decade. The OECD notes that by 2020, China's young graduate population will be about the same as the total US population between the ages of 25 and 64. This changing world map will see Brazil having a bigger share of graduates than Germany, Turkey more than Spain, Indonesia three times more than France. The UK is bucking the trend, projected to increase its share from 3% in 2010 to 4% in 2020. This push for more graduates has a clear economic purpose, says the OECD's analysis. Shifting from "mass production to knowledge economy occupations" means improved employment rates and earnings - so there are "strong incentives" for countries to expand higher education. But will there be enough graduate jobs to go round? The OECD has tried to analyse this by looking at one aspect of the jobs market - science and technology-related occupations. These jobs have grown rapidly - and the report suggests it is an example of how expanding higher education can generate new types of employment. These science and technology jobs - for professionals and technicians - account for about four in every 10 jobs in some Scandinavian and northern European countries, the OECD suggests. In contrast - and showing more of the old order - these technology jobs are only a small fraction of the workforce in China and India. The OECD concludes that there are substantial economic benefits from investing in higher education - creating new jobs for the better-educated as unskilled manufacturing jobs disappear. The OECD forecast reveals the pace of growth in graduate numbers. But it does not show the quality or how this expansion will translate into economic impact. There are other ways of mapping the changing distribution of knowledge. A team at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute has produced a set of maps showing the "geography of the world's knowledge". This measures how populations are consuming and producing information in the online world - mapping the level of internet use, the amount of user-generated material in Google, concentrations of academic activity and the geographical focus of Wikipedia articles. And in contrast to the rise of the Asian economies, this tells a story of continuing Western cultural dominance. "In raw numbers of undergraduates and PhDs, the Asian economies are racing ahead," says Prof Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, from the Oxford Internet Institute. "But what's interesting is how the West persists in its positions of strength - because the West controls the institutions. "There are more students in China than ever before - but they still use Western mechanisms to publish results, they accept the filters," says Prof Mayer-Schonberger. "The big question will be whether the Chinese researchers can be as insightful as their Western counterparts - we don't know yet." The maps also reveal how much Africa and South America are losing out in this new scramble for digital power. Prof Mayer-Schonberger said he was "completely shocked" at the extent of the imbalance. Another feature of the Oxford study is to show how research bases and their spin-out economic activity are clustered into relatively small areas. In the US, says Prof Mayer-Schonberger, there is hugely disproportionate investment around Silicon Valley and the Boston area, with large tracts of "wasteland" between. "Each era has its own distinct geography. In the information age, it's not dependent on roads or waterways, but on bases of knowledge. "This is a new kind of industrial map. Instead of coal and steel it will be about universities and innovation."	By the end of this decade, four out of every 10 of the world's young graduates are going to come from just two countries - China and India.
Experts say a lack of early support means patients are reaching crisis. Data compiled for the BBC by NHS Digital showed that between 2011-12 and 2015-16 the number of patients attending A&E units with psychiatric problems rose by nearly 50% to 165,000. For the under 18s alone the numbers almost doubled to nearly 22,000. These figures represent a small minority of overall A&E attendances - just over 1% in total. But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said that was likely to be the "tip of the iceberg" as these figures just included cases where the primary diagnosis was a psychiatric condition. Patients coming in with self-harm or after an attempted suicide may have been recorded as having a different reason for attending hospital. Some trusts the BBC spoke to said as many as a tenth of patients were attending A&E because of mental health problems. A 999 call comes in. The man says he is ill, he's hearing voices and wants to kill someone. Usually emergency services would be despatched and he'd probably be taken to an already overstretched accident and emergency department. But in Birmingham, the street triage team is sent with a paramedic, police officer and psychiatric nurse on board. By intervening at this stage, they aim to get the patient appropriate help and ease pressures on A&E - the man has been taken there about half a dozen times already in the last few weeks. After talking to the team and physical health checks, it's agreed he'll remain at home and keep an appointment in the morning. The initiative set up by the Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust has reduced the numbers in mental health crisis going to A&Es locally. As part of RAID - Rapid Assessment, Interface and Discharge - psychiatric teams are also based in emergency departments. They aim to see people with psychiatric problems within an hour. Dr Peter Aitken, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the figures were "extremely concerning" "Years of underfunding has meant these children have not been able to benefit from early intervention." He said A&Es needed to invest in specialist psychiatric services to ensure people with mental health problems got the right support. "Mental health presentations to A&E are unlikely to be minor as they represent an urgent crisis point in a person's life," he added. Dr Marc Bush, chief policy adviser at the charity Young Minds, said: "Far too many young people end up in A&E, which can be crowded and stressful, because there's nowhere more appropriate for them to go. "One of the main reasons that crisis services are so overstretched is that young people who are struggling don't get help soon enough, which means that problems often escalate. "Unless we see greater investment in early intervention, the numbers will continue to rise." The figures have been revealed just a day after the prime minister announced a package of measures to support people with mental health problems. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: "As the prime minister has made clear this week - improvements must be made in mental health care both within and outside of the NHS, to make sure people get the support they need before they reach crisis point." She said extra money being invested in the NHS this Parliament would help ensure improvements take place.	There has been a steep rise in the number of people arriving at A&E departments in England with mental health problems, figures show.
The man was once a specialist in chemical and biological weapons for Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader overthrown by the US invasion in 2003, Iraqi and US sources told US media. Named as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, he was reportedly seized last month. In a statement to the BBC, the Pentagon would not confirm his capture. However, its spokesman confirmed US special forces had begun operations in Iraq - part of a more aggressive strategy against IS. The man has already told interrogators how IS loaded mustard gas into shells, US sources told the New York Times. Last month, sources at the global chemical watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), announced that sulphur mustard had been used last year in an attack on Kurdish forces in Iraq blamed on IS. If confirmed, it would be the first known use of chemical weapons in Iraq since the fall of Saddam. Mr Afari was identified as a former employee of the Military Industrialisation Authority, which functioned under Saddam, who used poison gas against Iraq's Kurdish community in the 1980s. Unnamed US defence sources told the New York Times Mr Afari was being held in Irbil, a Kurdish stronghold in northern Iraq. He is being questioned about IS plans to use mustard gas, which is banned under international law, in Iraq and Syria, the paper says. The alleged IS weapons expert reportedly gave his captors details of how the group had weaponised mustard gas into powdered form and loaded it into artillery shells. One defence official quoted by the paper said the gas was not concentrated enough to kill anyone but that it could maim people. Mustard gas, which is liquid at ambient temperature, is a powerful irritant and blistering agent which causes severe damage to the skin, eyes and respiratory system and internal organs. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the prisoner after it was notified of his capture by US officials, the paper adds. No details were given. Two unnamed Iraqi intelligence sources quoted by the Associated Press news agency described Mr Afari as the head of the IS unit trying to develop chemical weapons. A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC on Wednesday: "I cannot confirm these reports. "What I can tell you is, and as the [Defense] Secretary [Ashton Carter] said recently, the Expeditionary Targeting Force [ETF] has begun operations in Iraq, but we will not discuss the details of those missions when it risks compromising operational security. "One of the goals of the ETF is to capture ISIL [IS] leaders. Any detention would be short-term and coordinated with Iraqi authorities." US officials announced last week that a US commando force had captured an IS leader in Iraq without giving his name. IS, a fundamentalist Sunni Muslim group also known as Daesh, is notorious for its brutal methods in gaining territory in Iraq and Syria. It claimed a number of devastating gun and bomb attacks outside the region in 2015, notably the attacks on Paris and downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt. Last week, the UK's national head of counter-terrorism policing, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, warned that IS might be planning a "spectacular" attack in the UK.	A chemical weapons expert from the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq has been captured by US special forces and is being questioned, reports say.
Authors including The English Patient writer Michael Ondaatje and Peter Carey will not attend the PEN Literary Gala in New York on 5 May. They said PEN - known for defending imprisoned writers - was stepping beyond its traditional role. Islamists stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris in January. Twelve people were killed during the attack, over the magazine's depiction of the Prophet Mohammed. Authors Rachel Kushner, Teju Cole, Taiye Selasi and Francine Prose are also against PEN handing the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo, as they are uncomfortable with the magazine's "cultural intolerance". Booker Prize-wining author Carey told the New York Times that the group of writers felt PEN's role was to protect freedom of expression against government oppression. "A hideous crime was committed, but was it a freedom of speech issue for PEN America to be self-righteous about?" said Carey. "All this is complicated by PEN's seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population." The boycott has been criticised by the author Salman Rushdie, a former president of PEN who was in hiding for years over Islamist threats in response to his novel The Satanic Verses. He said his friends were "horribly wrong" and he hoped nobody ever came after them. Charlie Hebdo essayist Jean-Baptiste Thoret, who escaped the attack by arriving late to work, will accept the award on behalf of his colleagues. PEN said it did not believe Charlie Hebdo's intent was to "ostracise or insult Muslims, but rather to reject forcefully the efforts of a small minority of radical extremists to place broad categories of speech off limits." It added: "We will be sorry not to see those who have opted out of the gala, but we respect them for their convictions."	Six prominent writers are boycotting a major US literary event over plans to give satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo a freedom of speech award.
The sanctions focus upon suppliers to Iran's missile programme and groups that help to arm what Washington sees as terror organisations in the region. It is hard to see what practical impact these sanctions will have, since few of these organisations or individuals probably do business in the United States. But the sanctions sends a clear warning to Tehran the guard has changed in Washington. The Obama administration saw its relationship with Iran largely through the prism of the need to negotiate a deal to constrain Tehran's nuclear programme. Iran's regional activities - support for Hamas and Hezbollah, military support for the Assad regime, backing of the Houthis in Yemen, and its growing influence in Iraq  - were all played down to ensure that the nuclear deal might go ahead. For the Obama team, restraining Iran's nuclear activities was the overarching goal. This was seen as an end in itself, one that might stave off military action, but also a step that might, over time, also lead Iran away from its relative economic isolation towards an improved relationship with the West. Opinion was deeply divided on the nuclear deal. The US and its major western allies, along with Russia, saw merit in the nuclear agreement that effectively "kicked the can down the road", postponing any confrontation with Tehran over its nuclear programme. Washington's regional allies though - countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, who have watched Tehran's rise with alarm - were much less impressed. And many of them may well have been hoping that the Trump team - which includes several vocal opponents of Tehran - might seek to undo the agreement. Things are a little more complex than that. On a recent trip to Israel's major annual security conference last week, many experts and officials there took the view that a bad deal, if properly implemented, might be better than no deal at all. What worries Israelis is the fact that Iran is now becoming a major player in the region. Its support for the Assad regime in Syria and the deployment of its allies - Hezbollah and various Shia militias, supported by officers from its Revolutionary Guard Corps - has provided Tehran with at least the opportunity to establish its allies on a long border with Israel from the Mediterranean Sea through Lebanon and Syria - all the way to the Jordanian frontier. Jordan too is concerned, as are several of the Gulf states, which explains their quiet strategic rapprochement with Israel. The irony in all of this is that it was largely US military power that established the conditions for Iran's rise to regional prominence. By deposing its archenemy Saddam Hussein and reducing Iraq to a minor military player with many other security problems on its plate - Washington opened the door to the expansion of Iranian influence in the region. A further irony is that in supporting the Iraqi government's efforts against so-called Islamic State, the US is objectively allied with Tehran, with several Iranian-influenced Shia militias fighting in the same campaign. The Obama administration's failure to countenance the forced removal of Syria's President Assad and its inept and half-hearted efforts to arm and train Sunni forces there, again favoured the emerging Shia axis. So the Trump administration comes to office with a desire fundamentally to change Washington's stance towards Tehran. These sanctions are but the first step. A declaration that Iran is now "on notice", in the words of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, may sound good, but it doesn't amount to a policy. What real steps does the Trump team envisage? Is it ready to back - albeit reluctantly - the nuclear accord while monitoring stringently Iran's behaviour? What wider international support can the US gather for tougher action against Tehran's missile programme - which it insists it is entitled to pursue? On the face of it here the US may have a point. UN Security council resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. A US National Security Council briefing earlier this week noted that ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a payload of at least 500kg to a range of 300km are inherently able to deliver nuclear weapons. "There should be no doubt," the briefing went on , "that the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for adhering to missile restrictions and accountable for behaviour in the region that we consider to be destabilising." But what exactly does the Trump Administration mean by phrases like "holding Iran to account"? These are two countries whose warships potentially come into close proximity in Gulf waters every day. Tensions could spark a major confrontation. Is Washington on a collision course with Tehran? Its rhetoric might suggest so. But it is President Trump's actions - and of course Iran's own responses - that will determine where things go from here.	Within days of an Iranian missile test and a subsequent warning from the Trump administration, the US has now followed up by imposing a new round of economic sanctions.
Aston Villa's Jordan Ayew opened the scoring on 62 minutes, curling the ball past Ley Matampi in the Leopards goal. Paul-Jose M'Poku equalised for DR Congo with a sensational long-range effort from outside the box. West Ham's Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched a winning penalty, sending Matampi the wrong way to seal the win. It marks Ghana's sixth consecutive Nations Cup semi-finals appearance, as they seek to end an agonising 35-year wait for a continental title. In a game that only properly sparked to life in the second half in Oyem, DR Congo - and their captain Dieumerci Mbokani in particular - were left to rue several missed chances early on. The Hull City striker's best opportunity came on six minutes, after a terrible mix-up in the Ghana defence, but he hit the post when he had the goal at his mercy. Mbokani then teed up the competition's top scorer Junior Kabananga on 25 minutes, who fired high over the bar. The Congolese talisman again broke through the Ghana defence, only to slice his chance into the side netting. Ghana showed a lot more intent in the second half, with Wakaso whipping a free-kick at Matampi, who saved with his feet. Jordan Ayew - the younger of the two brothers - scored his first of the tournament, surging into the box and stroking the ball home confidently and decisively. The lead lasted all of five minutes, with M'Poku unleashing a breathtaking long-range shot with the outside of the boot that arrowed into the top corner. Ghana continued to press and were awarded a penalty when Christian Atsu went down in the box after contact from Lomalisa Mutambala, who was lucky not to receive a second yellow card. Andre Ayew then coolly dispatched the spot-kick, sending Matampi the wrong way, to grab his second of the competition. Leopards substitute Cedric Bakambu missed several chances to equalise in the final minutes, forcing a good save from Razak and finding space in the box at the death before shooting badly wide from close range. Atsu could have finished it for Ghana in injury time, but the busy Matampi produced a great save at his feet. The Black Stars' celebrations at the end showed Avram Grant's side's relief at edging the contest. Match ends, Congo DR 1, Ghana 2. Second Half ends, Congo DR 1, Ghana 2.

Ghana's Ayew brothers grabbed a goal each to beat DR Congo 2-1 and put the Black Stars through to the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals.
But on Monday the Church of England broke a tradition inherited from the first Christians 2,000 years ago when the three houses of the General Synod voted to allow women to be bishops. Since the days of Jesus and his 12 male apostles the Church has had exclusively male leaders - bishops whose authority has been handed down the generations by the laying on of hands. Hilary Cotton chairs Women and the Church, which campaigns for women bishops. "Saying yes to women bishops is a cosmic shift," she says. "It changes our whole understanding of what God intended people to be, and even changes the Church's theology by recognising that men and women are equally chosen to lead it." A senior figure on the "high church" wing of the Anglicanism, Prebendary David Houlding, says creating women bishops represents "a massive shift" in the way the Church presented itself to the world. "It's an unprecedented acceptance by the Church of the secular values of society", he says. "There was a lot of damage to the Church's reputation when the measure was defeated before.  It's terrified of sending the wrong signal again." Samuel Margrave, who also opposes the legislation, told the Synod: "This is a show for the media.  It's the end of the Church as we know it." The Reverend Lindsay Southern, the Vicar of Catterick in North Yorkshire, who supports the proposals, said a single vote for woman bishops would have huge long-term effects. "It might look like a small change in direction from the outside, but it's like a ship at sea - a change in course over time will lead us to a completely different place." Women now constitute a third of the 11,000 Anglican priests, several of whom have reached senior positions. The Church's 42 dioceses have given unanimous backing to the latest proposals. But to take such a profound step, each of the Synod's three houses - representing bishops, clergy and lay people - needed to support legislation to create women bishops by a majority of two-thirds. The legislation failed in November 2012 because lay synod members who supported women bishops nevertheless believed that traditionalists were not getting sufficient exemptions from serving under them. The latest proposals would allow traditionalist parishes to ask a woman bishop for a male alternative, and take any dispute over the process to an independent ombudsman. "There will be an 'expectation' that bishops will do their best to accommodate (traditionalist) parishes," says Prebendary Rod Thomas, the leader of the conservative evangelical group, Reform. "But in the end it depends on trust, and that is the big question.  Will there be trust?" Evangelical traditionalists oppose women bishops because of their belief that the Bible calls for men to head churches. Traditionalists on the Catholic, or High Church, wing of Anglicanism believe that because Jesus chose only men to make up his 12 apostles, only men should lead the Church. In fact some do not believe that women can be priests, so that were a woman bishop to ordain a man as a priest, he would not truly be a priest. High Church traditionalists will look for alternative male bishops who have been ordained by a man, and who have not themselves ordained women as priests. With the tide of opinion in the Church, and in wider society, running against them, traditionalists are being offered much less than they wanted. After the legislation is passed, and if Parliament approves it, the new law will be "promulgated" by the Synod in November. Committees looking for bishops for the vacancies in Newcastle, Oxford and Peterborough could then interview women candidates. Senior bishops elsewhere might more quickly appoint a woman in the more junior role of assistant or "suffragan" bishop. Other Anglican churches already have women bishops - there are 20 in Canada, Australia, the United States, Cuba, India, New Zealand, Swaziland and South Africa. The Church of Ireland, which covers Northern Ireland, appointed Rev Pat Storey, as the first woman bishop in the UK in September, 2013.	Not for more than 20 years has the future direction and character of the Church of England turned so profoundly on a single vote.
How about £54,000? If that seems high for a three-year degree, that's how much a think tank has calculated a student could have to pay back with interest. And that wouldn't be the full size of the debt. There could be another £40,000 still outstanding when fee loans are written off after 30 years. When fees start increasing from this autumn, it will mean borrowing about £28,600 for three years, with the amount then rising with inflation each year. But while students have battled for years over the headline figure of £9,000 and now £9,250, the Intergenerational Foundation says they're missing the much bigger picture of what it will really cost in repayments. And it's going to publish its findings in a report called The Packhorse Generation. These extra costs start to rack up while a student is still at university, because interest is charged as soon as students start their courses, adding thousands to the debt before students have even graduated. Students start paying back their fee loans once they earn more than £21,000 per year - and the more they earn the more they pay each month, until the debt, plus interest, is cleared. So this means total repayments can vary widely. The think tank, which campaigns for fairness between generations, forecasts that: A more likely scenario is that a graduate would start on a lower salary and gradually progress upwards. And the think tank gives an example of someone starting out on £22,000 and then rising over the years to £41,000, with the projection that they would pay back about £31,000 and leave a further £69,000 unpaid. These are not necessarily bad deals for students if it helps them into a good career. But Estelle Clarke, a former City lawyer on the advisory board of the Intergenerational Foundation, argues that we're failing to understand the "stranglehold" of debt that we're building up for young people. She also warns we should be looking nervously at the vast scale of write-offs in the current system. At present the taxpayer picks up the tab for unpaid loans after 30 years, allowing graduates to walk away from tens of thousands of pounds of debt and interest charges. "Taxpayers end up paying for this system twice over. Firstly, they will shoulder the burden of an economy deprived of cash as millions of graduates' incomes are diverted to loan repayments," says Ms Clarke. "And secondly, they shoulder the burden of the non-repayment of most loans due to the extortionate ratcheting up of interest in spite of regular payments made." But the government has long considered selling off more of the student loan book to the private financial sector. Would a private operator, looking hungrily at monthly repayments from millions of graduates, want more favourable terms and a bigger slice of that unpaid debt? Ms Clarke warns that there is not nearly enough protection for students against future changes to repayment arrangements to "extract even more cash from graduates' pockets". "No other lending has so little protection," she says. By international standards, the only real comparison for such levels of student borrowing is the United States. But as England is increasing the cost of tuition, the US has been trying to reverse out of a spiral of higher fees and higher debt. This month the governor of New York announced a plan to scrap tuition fees at state universities and colleges for families earning up to $125,000 (£102,000) per year, which would help 80% of households. It reflected deep-seated middle class anxieties about student debt - especially for families not rich enough to afford the fees and not poor enough to get financial support. This really can be a lifetime of debt, with warnings this month of aggressive tactics from lenders trying to recover student loans from pensioners, with the over-60s in the US still owing £55bn of student debt. Under the Obama administration there had been growing efforts to tackle student debt. But with the election of President Trump the future of student loans, now measured in the trillions, has become much less predictable. The Department for Education argues that England's system is already extremely accessible, because there are no upfront costs for any students. Instead the costs are backloaded to be paid after graduates are working. And since graduates are likely to earn more, they can afford the cost of repayments, which in turn supports the next generation of students. "The English system of student funding is sustainable, and has been recognised as such by the OECD," said a Department for Education spokeswoman. "Critically, our system removes financial barriers for anyone hoping to study - with record numbers of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university last year." But this is something of a turning point - with fees and debts about to begin a long upward curve. And the Intergenerational Foundation's warnings cast a cold light on the scale of the escalating costs. Will this be the next stage of a sophisticated, self-funding, open-access, affordable university system, or unwitting steps towards a financial sinkhole?	How much will it cost to get a degree in England when tuition fees increase to £9,250 in the autumn?
The 33-year-old, who has featured just four times for the Potters this season, had a loan stint with the Seagulls in 2002-03 when he was at Arsenal. "Steve has played virtually his entire career in the Premier League," said Brighton boss Chris Hughton. "He knows this club and will supplement our existing midfield options." Sidwell, who had spells at Reading, Chelsea, Aston Villa and Fulham before joining Stoke in the summer of 2014, becomes Brighton's fourth signing of the January transfer window. "We need to make sure we have good options in every position," added Hughton. "Steve is another experienced head.

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said a suspected bookmaker had approached two Sri Lankan players ahead of the match to try to convince them to under-perform and lose the match. Both players turned down the approach and the authorities were informed, Mr Jayasekara said. Sri Lanka went on to win the game. Wicketkeeper Kusal Perera and bowler Rangana Herath were approached shortly before the match in Galle, Sri Lanka, in October, the minister said. "After Kusal turned down the offer, the man approached Herath who also rejected the offer and alerted the authorities," he added. Both a police inquiry and anti-corruption investigation by Sri Lanka Cricket have been launched. The International Cricket Council has also been informed.	Sri Lankan authorities are investigating an attempt to fix an international cricket match involving the national team and the West Indies.
Edinburgh will also provide the venue for the European Challenge Cup the same year, but the host stadium has yet to be chosen for that event. European Professional Club Rugby announced the decision in Geneva ahead of next season's competition draws. France will host the 2016 finals, with both being played at the new Grand Stade de Lyon over one weekend. The Edinburgh finals will also take place over the same weekend. Scottish Rugby director of commercial operations, communications and public affairs Dominic McKay said: "It is a real endorsement of the work Scottish Rugby and its partners have achieved and will create a fantastic sporting weekend in Edinburgh and bring fans to the city from across Europe. "We have a great track record of putting on world-class events, including the highly successful hosting of the previous European Cup finals in 2005 and 2009 at BT Murrayfield, and this award will give us a further chance to showcase the passion for rugby and international sport here in Scotland." The Scottish Government and Event Scotland assisted the Edinburgh bid and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "After what has been quite a successful season for rugby in Scotland with Glasgow being crowned Pro12 champions and Edinburgh reaching the final of the European Challenge Cup, this announcement will keep the feel-good factor in the game going." Clubs finishing highest in the Celtic, English and French leagues qualify for the Champions Cup, while the others take part in the Challenge Cup. Edinburgh were beaten by Gloucester in last season's Challenge Cup final, hosted by Harlequins at the Stoop, while Twickenham was the venue for the Champions Cup final in which Toulon defeated French rivals Clermont Auvergne. Next season's Challenge Cup final will be played in Lyon on Friday 13 May, while the final of the Champions Cup will take place the next day. European Rugby said it had chosen the 2017 host city now to give organisers greater preparation time. President Simon Halliday said: "We received an extremely interesting also from the Scottish Rugby and we wanted to recognise choosing the renowned city of Edinburgh for the finals of 2017." The news was welcomed by Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend. "It's more than just a one-off game now with the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup played in the same city on the same weekend," he said. "With the quality of players in both tournaments, it's the highest level of club rugby, certainly in Europe if not in the world, so it'll be one of those must-see events. "It's great for Scottish rugby that it's going to take place in Edinburgh."	Murrayfield Stadium has been chosen to host the 2017 European Champions Cup final in May of that year.
Both teams had a man sent off - the Terrors' Lewish Toshney, and solitary goalscorer Jason Cummings who picked up two yellow cards apiece at Tannadice. Cummings volleyed in the only goal after 38 minutes, shortly after Toshney's dismissal. But his 75th-minute sending off for punching the ball into the United net made for a nervous finale for Hibs. Neil Lennon's side extended their lead at the Championship summit to nine points, ahead of second placed Falkirk, who play Ayr United on Saturday. Ray McKinnon's United are 10 points adrift in third place, having played a game fewer than Hibs. Clearly, the home side had to start on the front foot and pressure their opponents. With games running out they really had to win to close the gap the Easter Road side. United's eagerness to play at pace and be in Hibs' faces ultimately cost them, epitomised by Toshney's rashness. The right-back was lucky to escape one early reckless challenge, but was correctly punished for another on Andrew Shinnie, and when he clattered the midfielder once again, it was a simple decision for referee Don Robertson. Hibs quickly asserted themselves by going in front and it became too big a task despite Cummings' offer of assistance. United didn't lack fight. They lacked composure and quality on the night. A first home defeat this season was badly timed. They're not entirely out of the title race, but the smart money would be on a play-off place for the Tannadice side. Head coach Lennon might not admit it but few will back anyone other than Hibernian to take the Championship title now. Cummings' fabulous first-half finish was timely, not too long after Toshney's red card. The striker stole in behind a defence that seemed intent on playing a high line. Shinnie exposed that with a lovely lofted ball into Cummings' path and he made no mistake with a vital, instinctive goal. Cummings was also unlucky to be flagged offside when clean through and might have earned a penalty when William Edjenguele appeared to catch him near the goalline just before half-time. It was the 21-year-old's 20th goal of the season - great work from him all-round, until later. Martin Boyle should have ended the contest when he had time, and space six yards out, but volleyed wildly over. The impressive Shinnie thought he had sealed the win after great work from Boyle, only for Cammy Bell to parry his shot over the bar. Hibs rarely looked troubled with goalkeeper Ofir Marciano a virtual spectator. This was a massive step for Lennon's men, and with three home games to follow, they are very much on track for the top flight. For all his positives, Cummings risked this win with few minutes of madness. He was unnecessarily booked for throwing the ball away when ruled offside. Minutes later he threw himself at a cross, blatantly punched the ball in the net and was correctly ordered off. It was utter madness and offered United a lifeline from nowhere. Luckily for him, his team mates saw it through. In total, 10 players were booked, and Lennon was ordered to the stand late on. However, Hibs got the job done, and deserved to finish with three valuable points. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "It was extremely difficult when we went down to 10 men. "I thought we started the game excellently and controlled the first 15 minutes, but the sending-off certainly had a massive impact on the game. "I haven't seen it again, but Lewis has gone for the ball and then he has pulled out. It was clear for everybody on our bench. "The ref is entitled to make that decision, but we were very disappointed. You have to look at all the decisions that were made and some of inconsistencies and tackles that went unpunished. "But what is important is what we do from now until the end of the season and focus on winning every game. "I thought we showed great character to battle back hard with 10 men. We will take the positives out of that and fight for every point until the end and see where we end up." Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "Jason's got to learn to control his temper. "I've been there - I got many a telling off from Martin O'Neill in my younger days - but he's an outstanding talent and he's come up with a really big goal in a big game and he does it consistently and it's not a coincidence. "We were outstanding. The only disappointment was the sending off really, which put us on the back foot for 10 minutes. "The rest of the game, we played really strongly and we looked a very good side. Thoroughly deserved to win. "I wanted them to put down a marker for the rest of the season and hopefully they've done that. "It is a difficult place to come and win, but I thought we were head and shoulders above Dundee United. "I underplayed it this week, but it is probably the biggest game we've had league wise for two or three seasons and they've responded brilliantly." Match ends, Dundee United 0, Hibernian 1.

The Northern Ireland international, 28, was charged on 29 July with breaching FA rule E8, which bars professional players from betting on football-related matters. The offence took place on 20 February. Lafferty made one league appearance for Norwich last season, and played six times for Birmingham City on loan. He was an unused substitute as Norwich started their Championship season with a 4-1 win over Blackburn on Saturday. Rule E8 prevents professional players not only from betting on matches in which they are involved or have an influence, but also on any other football-related matter anywhere in the world - including matches, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.	Norwich City striker Kyle Lafferty has been fined £23,000 and warned as to his future conduct after accepting a Football Association betting charge.

Bayern were dominant early on as Thomas Muller struck from Dante's pass before Mario Gotze scored following a corner. David Silva pulled a goal back from close range after Jesus Navas's cross. Aleksandar Kolarov equalised with a penalty after James Milner was tripped before Milner's fine finish won it. Bayern's last three home defeats in European competition have come against English clubs - Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea It was an amazing turnaround from Manuel Pellegrini's side, who almost earned the 4-2 victory they needed to go through as group winners as Alvaro Negredo had a late effort saved by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. But after Bayern scored twice in the opening 12 minutes, the fact City fought back to claim an unexpected victory will give them confidence as they progress to the last 16 for the first time. Although Bayern and City both finished with 15 points, the German side's 3-1 win during the first group game in Manchester meant their better goal difference proved crucial. Both teams had already qualified before this game but Bayern boss Pep Guardiola was clear that finishing second in the group - and thus facing a seeded team in the first knockout round - was "not an option". But his team looked vulnerable as they suffered only their third defeat of 2013 with Silva and Milner excellent throughout. Media playback is not supported on this device It started with the Germans in imperious form as City looked nervous after an early a mix-up between Joleon Lescott and recalled goalkeeper Joe Hart. And after five minutes the visitors were undone as Dante's diagonal pass caught Kolarov napping and Muller nipped in behind the City captain to finish past Hart. Hart had to save Dante's header and turned Ribery's effort onto the post after another Lescott mistake before Bayern went 2-0 up from the resulting corner. Mario Mandzukic had time to shoot towards goal and his effort found Gotze, who also had space to stroke the ball past Hart from close-range. By this stage, the only question was how many goals Bayern would score. Hart had made four touches, and two of them were to pick the ball out of the net. Matters appeared to worsen when Micah Richards was replaced at right-back by Pablo Zabaleta after pulling a hamstring but the introduction of the experienced Argentine seemed to galvanise the visitors. Source: Uefa CL regulations Shortly after a decent passage of play, City grabbed a goal back. Silva, on his return to the team after a calf injury, tucked in after Milner had headed Navas's right-wing centre back across goal. After a frantic first half, City continued to improve but in the space of three minutes either side of the hour mark, the game then flipped on its head. Silva was the architect as he played in Milner, who was brought down by Dante in the penalty area. Kolarov sent Neuer the wrong way from 12 yards. Spanish midfielder Silva then set Navas free down the right and Milner curled a beautiful shot in at the back post after Bayern's Jerome Boateng had missed the cross, Substitute Negredo could have made it a perfect night when Neuer saved his shot before Pellegrini chose to bring on Jack Rodwell instead of Sergio Aguero as they chased a fourth goal. Whatever the group placings, this was an incredible way for City to flex their muscles before hosting Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday.

The women had been legally married for a few months after one of them passed as a man in front of an Islamic cleric who presided over their wedding. But suspicious neighbours confronted the couple and reported them to police. The two women are now back with their families, forcibly separated and under surveillance by the Islamic police. The local Sharia police chief told them Islam said they must be beheaded and burned for what they had done. But Aceh, the only province in Indonesia that is allowed to implement Sharia law, has yet to adopt any provisions dealing with gay and lesbian people. The provincial parliament passed Islamic laws authorising the stoning to death of adulterers and the caning of homosexuals in 2009, but the governor has refused to sign it. Homosexuality is frowned upon but legal in Indonesia. Activists have blamed Aceh's Sharia laws for encouraging vigilantism and intolerance, and say they violate the Indonesian constitution.	Islamic police in the Indonesian province of Aceh have forced two women to have their marriage annulled and sign an agreement to separate.
Katie Milby, 13, has Morquio A, a degenerative syndrome which affects about 105 people in the UK. It leads to the progressive deterioration of mobility, health and stamina. Her friend Kyle Pirrie has started a petition seeking to see the medicine Vimizim made available on the NHS. There is no known cure to Morquio syndrome but the drug improves the life of people with the condition. It replaces a missing enzyme which allows children to continue to grow, as well as improving stamina and the ability to walk. It also relieves pain. The drug's manufacturers have been providing the treatment to patients at their own expense but they are going to withdraw it unless the NHS in England and Scotland commit to funding it. The Stranraer Academy student said her life would be markedly different without the drug. "I wouldn't be able to move I'd just be in so much pain," she said. "And I probably wouldn't be able to go to school." It was that situation which prompted her friend to launch the petition which now has nearly 2,000 signatures. "As a friend I suppose I felt kind of bad that she was going to be denied this because I know she has got a great outlook on life," Kyle explained. "She's funny, she's friendly and I would hate to see her in pain all the time." Galloway and West Dumfries MSP Alex Fergusson has also backed the petition. "This is not a cheap medication but, as Katie herself asked me, how do you put a value on a human life?" he asked. "There are only just over a hundred sufferers throughout the UK, with just five in Scotland, and those who have had treatment with Vimizim report a massive reduction in pain and the other symptoms of this syndrome. "Life expectancy, which rarely exceeds the mid 20s without treatment, can be considerably extended with this treatment, and it is enormously to the credit of Katie and her friends that they have raised this petition to try to ensure that the treatment is available to all." The Scottish Medicines Consortium said the drug was currently going through its assessment process. It added that a decision on the medicine was expected to be published in early September.	A Stranraer Academy student has set up a petition to ensure a life-enhancing drug is made available to a fellow pupil with an extremely rare disease.
Haig's side have won the past six European Nations Cup (ENC) titles - the division below the Six Nations - finished third in their 2015 World Cup pool and completed an unbeaten Pacific Islands tour this summer. There is no imminent prospect of a change to the Six Nations format, despite alterations to rugby's international calendar after the 2019 World Cup. But Haig believes the status quo is hampering Georgia's development, and their World Cup preparations. "Absolutely, we've outgrown the ENC," Haig told BBC Scotland. "You're not being disrespectful to the other teams - you're saying the obvious. "That's why we've started being public about our desire to get into an expanded Six Nations. Not a promotion/relegation system, that's never been our standpoint, it's always been that the Six Nations gets expanded to seven or eight teams, depending on what the current partners feel is applicable." The New Zealander argues: Almost every Tier Two nation agitates for more frequent fixtures against the Six Nations and Rugby Championship heavyweights, but Georgia's case for greater challenges is compelling. The glaring extent of their supremacy in the ENC can be outlined thus: in the last six championships, they've lost just two matches from the 30 played. Their cumulative points difference reads: for 948, against 264. Georgia have lost only once since last year's World Cup - a narrow defeat by Japan - and completed an unbeaten Pacific tour of Tonga, Fiji, and Samoa this summer. Last weekend, they beat the touring Samoans in Tbilisi. A Tier One nation has never played a Test in Georgia, and outside World Cup pool matches, their fixture with Scotland on 26 November will be only the fourth time in 13 years the Lelos have had the opportunity to pit themselves against top-class opposition. "How can you improve [in that situation]? You can't," says Haig. "The Test schedule for the Tier Ones is already done up to 2019, and the big boys sit around the table and work out a deal. "Effectively there are a couple of weekends free to be filled with Tier Two teams. Then we go to a meeting, all the Tier Two guys go into a room and everybody scraps over what's left. "We all have fisticuffs about who's getting what. I'm being facetious to some degree, but that's not too far away from what happens. "It's not easy - that's the summary of that conversation. It's just not easy for Tier Two teams to get more than one or two Tests every year against Tier One teams. "I'm not saying World Rugby doesn't look after us, they've been very good to us and helped us develop, but we need more. "The challenge is that every Tier Two team says they want more, but it's how you prioritise that that's going to be key." Alterations to the present Six Nations format have long been mooted - outgoing World Rugby president Bernard Lapasset called for a promotion/relegation play-off, with the ENC winners playing the team that finishes bottom in the Six Nations, as he left office in April. That seems a fair proposal on the face of it, but Haig says Georgia have to be cannier in their demands. "The reality is, if you were one of those six partners, not one would want to put their seat in jeopardy, and if it was me sitting in their position, I wouldn't either," says the New Zealander. "But if you go to the negotiating table and don't have any cards to play, you've then got to say, 'there's no threat here of anybody losing their seat, all we're asking for is you put one more seat at the table'. "I think for us, that's the smarter way to go. It's also less threatening to the existing partners and it means they're helping to grow the game in eastern Europe. "There's a massive potential market in eastern Europe, and we would say by including Georgia, or Romania or Russia, you might be able to capitalise on that." The prospect of a global season, a closer alignment of the northern and southern hemisphere calendars, has been hotly debated, but Haig fears that scenario would only condense the international windows, and thereby reduce the already scant opportunities for Georgia to take on the "big boys". "We feel if we can't get World Rugby giving us more Tier One Tests, then the obvious solution would be for us to be included in an expanded Six Nations," he says. "Automatically, you get six more Tier One games. And it wouldn't have to go outside the current Test windows. "It would fit into both our calendar and the Six Nations calendar. Nothing has to change, apart from the fact we'd get much better rugby. "And with much better rugby consistently, we'd perform better at a World Cup. That's where we see our future, and that's where we'll keep having those conversations." Domestically, there is broad scope for growth. Georgia, says Haig, is a nation where rugby is on a rapid upward trajectory, and sell-out Tbilisi crowds of 50,000-plus for ENC fixtures are the norm. But in his 30-man November squad, over half play their club rugby in France or England, rather than the semi-professional Georgian leagues. Meanwhile, as they seek innovative methods to combat Anglo-French wealth, the Pro12 league's representatives have been exploring opportunities to incorporate North American teams or franchises. The New Zealander says they've made enquiries with the Georgian union too - and those enquiries are most welcome. "Our union has been approached by the Pro12 - it was just the initial discussions, but we've indicated that absolutely we'd love to have a team in that competition," he says. "We're trying to put our players, whether at international or local level, into better competitions, so that they learn the game and get better. "It's a pathway for our younger players as well. To have a fully professional team in a competition like that, would do us wonders. "That's an obvious step that we'd like to continue conversations so that hopefully we can within a couple of years get that up and running." The Georgian game has one vital fillip, absent from many of its Tier Two counterparts, that may help smooth its ascent - money. Where the Pacific teams of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga are hampered by modest revenue and ramshackle infrastructure, Georgian rugby is bankrolled by former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. Forbes Magazine puts Ivanishvili's net worth at $4.8bn (£3.89bn). That's over $1bn more than US president-elect Donald Trump ($3.7bn), and just shy of Richard Branson ($4.9bn). In almost five years as head coach, Haig has never actually met the man whose wealth is propelling his vision, but its impact is apparent everywhere. "When I first came here and saw our high-performance base, not even New Zealand had something like that, and probably still doesn't," says Haig. "We have our own 27-room hotel, swimming pool, commercial kitchen, gymnasium, grandstand, one artificial field, one natural field, fully-lit to international standards. "It's incredible what we've got here, and we've continued to improve our high-performance centre. "We've just built a 14x14m fully-covered wrestling dojo that we do a lot of our contact work in. "Prior to the World Cup, I said, it'd be great if we had this, because it'll help us get better, and bang - it was built in 10 minutes. When you have the ability to do that, it helps everything we're doing. "He's not at all a rugby fanatic. He's a very private man. He understands what rugby's doing for the country and the people, and that's why he's happy to invest in the infrastructure, and our day-to-day costs are always covered by the government. "If we've got the opportunity to be sitting at that Six Nations table, it becomes a whole different landscape for Georgian rugby. "And I'd be pretty confident that whatever was necessary in terms of funding or building more infrastructure, he'd be the first to put his hand up and say, yes, we can do that." Haig remains upbeat that as he continues to add tactical nous, game understanding and more polished skill-sets to the historically formidable physical profile of the Georgian squad, and its momentum continues to snowball, there is light at the end of the tunnel. He sees parallels with Argentina, whose case for top-tier rugby eventually grew so irrefutable that they were invited to join the Rugby Championship in 2012 and Super Rugby in 2016, with most of their Test squad contracted to Buenos Aires-based franchise, the Jaguares. And Haig is increasingly reassured by what he perceives to be a change in attitude among the powers-that-be - he says the notion of a bigger Six Nations no longer seems so distant. "Rugby in Georgia just keeps growing," says Haig. "Player numbers for kids are growing; it's getting bigger and bigger. "As we build more infrastructure throughout the country, more stadiums, more fields, it's the old adage - if you build it, they will come, and that's been the mantra for us. "If one of those top nations came to Georgia to play, I can guarantee you we'd be packing out the biggest stadium in Georgia, and it'd be an atmosphere they maybe hadn't experienced for some time. "I understand that London, Paris, Rome, are all very nice places, but again I think if you are a touring team or tourist coming to play or watch a game in Tbilisi will be an experience you probably haven't had before. "We're certainly pretty confident within the next four or five years, it's going to happen. "And the first time it does, it's going to be a big occasion for the country. That's what we keep holding onto - that one day, it's going to happen, and for our country that'll be awesome."	Georgia head coach Milton Haig believes his side merit a place in an expanded Six Nations Championship, and says Tier Two nations are "fighting for scraps" in the battle to earn fixtures against top opposition.
Visitors and residents protested against Lepe Country Park closing its gates by 20:00, particularly during the summer months. The park has views over the Solent towards the Isle of Wight. Hampshire County Council said opening hours would now take account of sunrise and sunset but extra costs would have to be met by additional charges. Paul Stewart, of the Keep Lepe Open Longer, campaign said: "It will be good news if and when it goes ahead." But he criticised the extra charges: "If it were open all the time they wouldn't need someone to monitor the car park." The council had originally said opening times were set to minimise the risk of anti-social behaviour. Mr Stewart said that decision was "persecuting the majority because of the actions of the minority". A decision on exact opening times between April and September will be made at a later stage, after consultation with the landowners and customers.	A New Forest car park that attracts 270,000 visitors a year is to stay open longer following a public campaign.
The ex-Lib Dem MP and ex-wife Vicky Pryce were both jailed after she took his speeding points in 2003. Some 360 former MPs were granted passes for the Parliamentary estate, according to the Press Association's FOI request. Labour MP John Mann said Huhne should not have been given the pass. Mr Mann said: "I do not think someone who has committed a criminal offence that has meant they went to prison should get privileged access to the Houses of Parliament. "Let them queue with the general public if they want to get in." Huhne and Pryce both served two months of an eight-month sentence. Huhne had quit the Cabinet and stood down as Eastleigh MP after pleading guilty. Speaking after his release, he said prison had been "a humbling and sobering experience". Also on the passholders list was ex-Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, and Derek Conway, who had the Conservative whip withdrawn and then stepped down as an MP after his employment of his son was heavily criticised.	Former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne - who was jailed for perverting the course of justice in 2013 - has been granted a Commons pass, a Freedom of Information Act request has revealed.
Ospreys players Olly Cracknell, De Kock Steenkamp, Dan Baker, Dafydd Howells and Sam Parry joined collectors in Baglan Moors on Tuesday. The players said it was to show their commitment to the "Ospreylian community". Last week they took part in collections in Swansea and Bridgend. Cracknell said: "It was an early start but a great work-out for us this morning. "A huge thanks to the recycling teams for showing us the ropes, they do a great job every day and we've enjoyed getting involved and giving a hand."	They are more familiar with recycling the ball than rubbish but five rugby players took a break from the pitch to collect refuse in Neath Port Talbot.
The Better Perth group has blamed online shopping and "inertia" for dwindling profits. More than 50 traders will open later night with special events and promotions to tempt shoppers back into the city centre. Perth and Kinross council is backing the event. Private car parking company Smart Parking said it would be waiving charges on Thursday and Friday afternoons in the run up to Christmas as its way of supporting the campaign. The traders said their "First Thursday" promotion could be a model that other "blighted" towns and cities in the UK could adopt. Businesses involved in the Better Perth group range from small independent boutiques and cafes to big department stores Hairdresser Charlie Taylor said: "Perth is a beautiful city that has been laid waste by the growth in out-of-town developments and online shopping. "After years of city-centre decay, business owners have had enough and are doing things for themselves. We want to reinvigorate Perth and reawaken the sense of community that has been gradually ebbing away over the past years." Perth and Kinross Council said it was pleased to work with businesses to help promote economic growth. A spokeswoman added: "This project is a good example of how businesses and the council can work together to enhance Perth's reputation as a visitor destination, and also to celebrate the diversity of what the city has to offer in terms of retail and food and drink, with many award-winning businesses involved. "Research has shown that consumers want to be able to shop at times convenient to them and the First Thursday campaign is a great way to provide a set late-night opening that people can put in their diaries."	Traders who say they are angered by the decline of Perth city centre have launched a campaign to "re-energise" the high street.
The 56ft (17.1m) converted trawler was 6 miles (10 km) west of South Stack when the crew radioed coastguards at 07:00 BST. Holyhead coastguards said a pump on board the boat was unable to cope with the water coming in. The RNLI lifeboat crew placed a pump and towed the vessel to Holyhead.	Three people have been rescued from a boat which had started to take on water off the Anglesey coast on Friday.
Andrew Platten, 55, from Bingley, died at the scene in Cottingley Cliffe Road in the town on Tuesday.ã€€ West Yorkshire Police said officers had tried to stop the car after seeing the driver "acting suspiciously". Police said the car then "sped off and collided" with Dr Platten a short distance away. The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A 22-year-old Bradford man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail. Dr Platten worked at Leeds Beckett University. Its website describes him as an associate dean for international and collaborative provision in the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology. In a statement, his family said: "Andrew excelled as a respected and dedicated academic, with a love for art, poetry and music. For anyone that knew him, cycling was his true passion as he became a recognised competitive rider on the roads. ã€€ "Most importantly he was a loved friend, loyal brother and uncle, loving partner and a truly inspirational father. He will be deeply missed, but he has left his stamp on all who met him. "He will always be cherished and never forgotten, living on in all our hearts."	A cyclist who was killed when he was hit by a car police were pursuing has been described by his family "as a respected and dedicated academic".
An insipid performance in Tbilisi was bad enough, but in Frankfurt, immediately after that 1-0 victory for Georgia,Germany served up a display against Poland to add another layer of gloom to any analysis of Monday's likely outcome. As Mats Hummels told BBC Scotland afterwards, this was not Germany back to their all-conquering best, but at times against a very good Poland side, they came very close. This was particularly true of the offensive aspect of their play. They swarmed forward, time after time, their incisive passing opening up gaps in the Poland defence. After 20 minutes in the Commerzbank Arena, they had battered the Poles seemingly into submission and the 2-0 scoreline at that point looked like it might become five or six by the end. Thomas Muller, scorer of the first goal, was one of several Germany players on song in that opening period, his languid style belying a sharpness and intelligence that more often than not leads him to be in the right place at the right time in the opposition's box. In Karim Bellarabi, the Bayer Leverkusen winger, Germany appear to have added yet another attacking weapon to their already considerable arsenal. Given his international debut in the defeat by Poland last year, he has become a regular in Joachim Low's line-up and on Friday night showed why. Linking on the left with another relative newcomer - the Cologne full-back Jonas Hector - he gave Lukasz Piszczek, the experienced Borussia Dortmund defender, the run-around, creating Muller's goal and causing havoc. Alan Hutton, or whoever is given the nod by Gordon Strachan at right back, will require support from players in front of and beside him if Germany are not to run amok. Much has been made of the lack of playing time some of Scotland's starters against Georgia had under their belts for their clubs. In the German ranks, a similar issue seemed not to affect Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze. The midfielder has started just two of Manchester United's six competitive matches this season, with Gotze starting just once in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich. Yet both men played significant roles in overcoming Poland. Gotze - nominally playing as a striker - drifted to find space, allowing Muller to fill the gaps left behind. He scored twice - the first a finish from the edge of the box after dancing past Polish defenders on the left of the penalty area - and also struck the post as he sought to reward Low's loyalty in the face of Pep Guardiola's continuing quandary about how best to accommodate him at Bayern. And Schweinsteiger, apparently still trying to adjust to the pace of the English Premier League, prowled the midfield, breaking up attacks, starting lightning counter-movements and generally looking majestic. It's no secret. The German side is brimming with talent - and that's without mentioning Toni Kroos or Mesut Ozil! Or indeed Manuel Neuer, who produced two out-of-this-world saves to help ensure the three points stayed in Frankfurt. But there or thereabouts lies the merest chink of light for the Scots. For one of those saves was the result of a wayward clearance from the flamboyant keeper. And he was not the only member of Die Mannschaft to carelessly concede possession or to lose concentration to allow the opposition an opportunity. It happened relatively regularly - sometimes the result of Polish harrying, but on other occasions simply because of a mental or physical lapse by a German player. If Scotland are to take anything from Monday's match, they must surely capitalise on any such failings. The introduction of Hector and Emre Can of Liverpool at full-back looked good from an attacking perspective, but there remains an uncertainty about the German defence. Hummels and Jerome Boateng are undoubtedly excellent defenders, but if their full-backs are caught high up the pitch they can be vulnerable when dragged out wide. These are scraps, though, on which Scotland must attempt to feed. The Germans have a feast of options at their disposal.	It is difficult, in the wake of Friday's fixtures in Group D, to find much to be optimistic about from a Scotland perspective.
The Bench was written in English, but the script was changed to Polish and actors with no experience enlisted from the town of Legnica. Green Valley Films' Kevin Phillips had said it would be a "miracle" if it triumphed at the London International Filmmaker Festival. But it won best original screenplay of a foreign language film on Saturday. The film was written by a group of friends from Blaenau Gwent - and was their first attempt at writing a movie. But after encountering logistical problems with closing streets in the valleys to film, they decided to shoot in the town of Legnica - where Mr Phillips had filmed a documentary. They changed the script to Polish and enlisted children from a local special school and orphanage, with pupils from two Blaenau Gwent schools flying out to be extras. Filmed for just Â£4,000, with all involved giving their time for free, it had been listed in the best original screenplay of a foreign language film and talented new filmmakers categories. Looking at the budgets of the other films, from countries such as Japan, the US and Germany, Mr Phillips said it would be "a miracle" if it won. He said they had just gone to the awards "for the experience", adding: "It was our first movie, shot totally independently, nobody had ever acted. "It brought so many people together with everyone working for free. It was a terrific project." With about 30 children from Pen y Cwm special school and Deighton Primary, Blaenau Gwent, flown out to be extras, he said it was a good "concept film", an example of how communities could establish bonds through film. Judges said international exposure from winning could help promote it in the UK, Poland and other countries. It is due to have a premiere in Legnica in April and has also been entered in Hollywood's Polish Film Festival.	A film by valleys directors shot in a language they did not understand with orphaned children has won an award.
Inspectors criticised Darul Uloom school when they saw a "female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room". But a statement from the school says the school did not segregate, but was respecting the governor's choice. A wave of Ofsted inspections found nine private faith schools "inadequate". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had written on Tuesday to Education Secretary Nicky Morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including Manchester, Coventry, Birmingham and Leicester. These had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the Bridge Schools Inspectorate - but from this autumn Ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks. Religious studies GCSE 'error of law' Inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not "promoting fundamental British values" and were not encouraging "mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs". They highlighted particular concern about Darul Uloom Islamic High School in Birmingham, where inspectors observed that "the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. "As a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. "A senior HMI has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women." In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can "sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this". The private boys' schools says it has an "open door policy" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the West Midlands police. The school issued a statement from the unnamed governor saying that "my request to sit as I please" was a way of "demonstrating the school's strong promotion of both Islamic and British values". "The right for a person to choose is a universal value," she said. But she claimed that the "British values" requirement was opposed to this. Darul Uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by Ofsted inspectors since 2011. In October 2013, Ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as "forward thinking". Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the BSI inspection system. Among the 22 schools inspected 15 were Muslim and seven Christian. They had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the Bridge Schools Inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools. Among the 22 schools inspected by Ofsted, one was "outstanding", four were rated "good", eight were rated as "requires improvement" and nine were "inadequate". Sir Michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former Bridge Schools Inspectorate schools.	The female governor at a private Muslim school in Birmingham - at the centre of criticism from Ofsted - chose to sit separately from men, says the school.
The Republican nominee's latest outreach to black voters, at a North Carolina rally, drew a swift backlash. Many on social media questioned whether Mr Trump had considered the US history of slavery and segregation. It follows a report that his charity used funds to settle lawsuits for which he was personally liable. At Tuesday's campaign event in Kenansville, the White House hopeful said: "We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. "Ever, ever, ever." Obama's legacy in black America He continued: "You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. "They're worse, I mean honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities. "And I say to the African-American communities, and I think it's resonating, because you see what's happening with my poll numbers with African Americans. They're going, like, high." The businessman-turned-politician is continuing his outreach to African-American voters by meeting a group of pastors Wednesday in Cleveland, Ohio. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Mr Trump's recent overtures to the black community may be aimed primarily at assuring moderate white voters of his racial sensitivity. According to recent polls, he still faces an uphill climb in winning over even a modest level of black support. Aside from a blip in one unconventional tracking poll, Mr Trump's black support continues to be mired in low single digits. This is roughly equal to the levels earned by the Republicans who ran against Barack Obama, the first black US president. Last month, Mr Trump also raised eyebrows when he asked black voters: "What do you have to lose?" He told a nearly all-white audience in Michigan that African Americans "are living in poverty" and their "schools are no good". Mr Trump said his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, "would rather provide a job to a refugee" than to unemployed black youths. Meanwhile, his running mate Mike Pence has been defending the nominee against new criticism of his charitable foundation. What's the deal with the Trump Foundation? The vice-presidential candidate told NBC in an interview aired on Tuesday evening that he is confident the Trump Foundation "fully complied with the law". The Washington Post reported hours earlier that Mr Trump used $258,000 from his charity for legal settlements involving his Mar-a-Largo resort in Florida and a New York golf course. The transactions could violate federal tax laws against using charities for "self-dealing", according to the newspaper. The Post reported that in 2007, Mr Trump used foundation funds when his Palm Beach club was fined $120,000 by the town for having a flagpole almost twice the height allowed under local rules. As part of the settlement, he donated $125,000 to veterans' charities from the Trump Foundation. The foundation's money comes mainly from other donors, not Mr Trump himself. The Post also reported that in 2010, a golfer sued when he was denied a $1m prize for a hole-in-one in a charity tournament at Mr Trump's course outside New York City. A $158,000 settlement also came from the Trump Foundation. The report was based on interviews and legal documents. Mr Pence told NBC there are "a number of factual errors in that story", though he was unable to specify any.	Donald Trump has faced criticism after declaring that African Americans are in the worst shape "ever, ever, ever", in a town named after a slaveholder.
The Dow closed up 0.7% at 18,506.41, while the S&P 500 index added 0.5% to close at 2,163.75. Data showing China's economy expanded by a better-than-expected 6.7% in the second quarter boosted sentiment. In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 rose for a fifth straight day by 0.7% to close at 16,497.85 points. An outperformer is messaging app Line, which has seen shares closing 31% up in its trading debut in Tokyo after gaining more than 26% in New York on Thursday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3% to finish the day at 5,429.60 and South Korea's stock market closed 0.4% higher at 2,017.26. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 0.5% higher at 21,659.25 and the Shanghai Composite closed flat at 3,054.30. Margaret Yang from CMC Markets in Singapore said the global share rally was due to a "flood of liquidity". "Equity valuations have been elevated by the prolonged low interest rate environment and markets are expecting more monetary easing from the Bank of Japan, European Central Bank and Bank of England to support the fragile economy," she said. Singapore's stock market resumed trading as normal on Friday after a major disruption the previous day. All trading had to be halted after a technical glitch affected its confirmation system. This is the fourth major interruption to its trading system in two years. Singapore Exchange's chief executive, Loh Boon Chye, issued an apology for the interruption. "Our recovery time has to be better and we must minimise downtime for market participants," he said in a statement. Singapore's Straits Times index closed 0.6% higher.

Striker Aluko, 30, quit the team in May 2016 after making the claims. The Chelsea player said she also felt "undermined and belittled" by England staff and claims their negative bias contributed to her not being picked. But the FA said an independent report found no evidence of wrongdoing by Sampson or his staff. Aluko and the FA agreed a settlement earlier this year, with one national newspaper claiming it included a £40,000 confidentiality agreement. BBC Sport understands the figure was higher. The FA said Aluko was not "precluded from speaking about the facts of that complaint" and that it agreed "a mutual resolution" to avoid disrupting the England squad's preparations for Euro 2017, which finished on Sunday. England were knocked out of the competition in the semi-finals by eventual winners the Netherlands. The case sheds light on the confusion surrounding Aluko's England career, which has stalled over the past year despite her being the Women's Super League One top scorer in 2016. Aluko, part of the England team that won the bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup, has 102 caps and has scored 33 international goals, but last played for her country in April 2016. She remains a centrally contracted player. A qualified lawyer, Aluko became the first female pundit to appear on Match of the Day and worked for Channel 4 in the same role during Euro 2017. Allegations made by her include accusations of staff calling her "lazy", Sampson belittling her in front of the squad and what she says are "false claims" by Sampson of "bad behaviour". In the complaint, Aluko said: "It is inevitable that such damaging behaviour and bias from the ultimate leader of the group in the presence of my England team-mates will and has influenced other staff and team-mates to be empowered to also attempt to undermine and belittle. "I submit that this is the basis of a culture of bullying and harassment." She added: "Although I am well adjusted to the final decision of a manager, I submit that Mark Sampson's negative personal behaviour towards me has led to inconsistency, disparity of treatment and confusion regarding the criteria for team advancement." The FA commissioned an independent investigation conducted by a barrister, Katharine Newton, which started in December and concluded in March this year. Newton also wrote to Aluko to "ensure complete transparency and objectivity of the findings", the FA said. Sampson was appointed England manager in December 2013, replacing Hope Powell who had been in charge for 15 years.	England boss Mark Sampson was cleared of wrongdoing after Eniola Aluko made a complaint to the Football Association about "bullying and harassment".
All is not lost, however, for the team that just over three years ago were celebrating their fourth consecutive world title double. Red Bull were the only team to beat Mercedes last year and finished second in the championship. But although Red Bull were clearly the third best team in Melbourne, there is good reason to believe they will make it a three-way fight at the front in 2017. Red Bull admit they have work to do with both their chassis and the Renault engine, but improvements to obvious faults are on the way. Red Bull qualified 1.3 seconds off pole position in Australia. Which sounds a lot - indeed, it is a lot. But it is worth bearing in mind that last year, which they ended with two victories and could have had three, they were 1.6 seconds off the pace at Albert Park. In the race, their pace was hard to judge - Daniel Ricciardo was never really in it after what team boss Christian Horner said was a "weekend from hell". And Max Verstappen spent much of the afternoon bottled up behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. There were only a handful of laps in the first stint in which Verstappen was more than two seconds behind Raikkonen - the gap at which drivers say their car starts to be affected by aerodynamic turbulence from following another car. On average, on those 'clean-air' laps, Verstappen was about 0.7secs off the pace of leaders Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. After his pit stop, the Dutchman was pretty much on the leaders' pace - sometimes quicker, sometimes slower, sometimes about the same - but then the picture was skewed by the fact that he was on a softer, faster tyre. In all, Horner reckoned Red Bull needed to find "a good half a second to get into that fight with the cars ahead". Coincidentally, 0.5secs is about the margin Red Bull believe they are losing as a result of the Renault engine in race pace - and as much as 0.6-0.7secs in qualifying. The Renault, which has been redesigned for this season, has had reliability problems this year and fixes for these had a direct impact on performance in Australia. Primarily, Renault were suffering in pre-season testing with overheating of the MGU-K - the part of the hybrid system that recovers energy from the rear axle. The temporary fix for this was to use last year's MGU-K, which is 5kg heavier than the 2017-spec design and also requires an extra air bottle, which is at least another 1kg. That weight accounts for about 0.2secs in lap time itself, and a revised version of the new MGU-K is set to be introduced for the fourth race of the season in Russia. Renault will then introduce a major upgrade for either Monaco - the sixth race - or, more likely, the subsequent event in Canada. This is referred to by Red Bull as "significant" - which is code for about 0.3-0.4secs in lap time. Horner said the lap-time deficit of the Red Bull-Renault to Mercedes and Ferrari was "probably an equal share" between car and engine. And it was clear the Red Bull was far from its best in Australia. Both drivers struggled to find the right set-up - complaining of the balance switching too easily between extremes. The car, in its current form, has what is known in F1 as "a narrow set-up window" - it is hard to home in on the correct balance - as well as a performance shortfall to the Ferrari and the Mercedes. But Horner says: "It's still early days. The regulations are still very immature. We've chosen a different concept. I believe there's really good development potential in the concept that we have." What does he mean by "different concept"? The key is in the aerodynamics - and particularly in the design of the front wing. In all F1 cars, the front wing is crucial in setting up the airflow around the rest of the car. It creates what are known as vortices that sweep around the sides of the car and then under the floor in front of the rear wheels. The faster these vortices can be made to travel, the more aerodynamic downforce will be created by the floor between the rear wheels. These vortices start at the inner tips of the flaps on either side of the front wing. Most teams send them between the front wheels and over the various fins and curved plates that can be seen in front of the side pods - the bodywork either side of the cockpit. But because it is so crucial that the airflow hits all these pieces of bodywork, that means that overall downforce of the car can be badly affected in less than perfect conditions - such as in a cross-wind, or in traffic. The Red Bull has far fewer of these additional pieces of bodywork than the other front-running teams, and that's a conscious choice by Red Bull's aerodynamic team under chief technical officer Adrian Newey. They wanted a car that was more consistent in changing conditions. The key to the way it differs from other cars can be seen in the front wing. On the Mercedes and Ferrari, the inboard ends of the series of flaps on either side of the wing point downwards towards the wing mainplane. Red Bull's inner flaps point upwards - because they are directing the airflow higher up around the car. That means there is reduced need for the intricate cascading flaps downstream. It's a classic example of the philosophy long-espoused by Red Bull design chief Newey, whose genius resides in not only producing great performance, but also in doing it in a manner which means the driver can access more of it more of the time. The performance is not there at the moment, but as Horner put it: "I think development is going to be incremental at every event. Looking at the amount of notes Adrian has taken away from this weekend, for sure it's going to keep our design office pretty busy." Last year, after Red Bull were 1.6 seconds off the pace at the first race, Max Verstappen won the fifth race in Spain. That win was only possible because Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out on the first lap. But two weeks later, Daniel Ricciardo took a brilliant pole in Monaco and would have won but for a delay caused by a pit-stop mix-up. From then on, Red Bull were usually Mercedes' main challenger - Ricciardo again came close in Singapore and then did finally win a week later in Malaysia, albeit this time after a Hamilton engine failure. At this early stage, the pattern looks very similar - a deficit in Australia, a major engine upgrade at the sixth or seventh race, consistent chassis improvements. On that basis, it is easy to believe Horner when he says: "There's a lot of positives to take out of Australia, at a track where we have not been competitive for the last couple of years. I'm sure that we can build on this over the coming races. "We have a good basis and a good direction and as the regulations are quite immature, I think things will move quite quickly. So I honestly believe we will get ourselves into a competitive situation this year."	Red Bull were one of the prime movers behind the push for faster, more demanding Formula 1 cars this season, so it is somewhat ironic that they started the season off the pace of Ferrari and Mercedes.
Janet Jordon, 48, her daughter Derrin, aged six, and her partner Philip Howard, 44, were found in a house in Vicarage Road, Didcot, on 23 May. The body of murder suspect, Janet's son 21-year-old Jed Allen, was found two days later in woodland near Marston Ferry Road, Oxford. The private funeral is being held at Oxford Crematorium. The families of the murder victims described their deaths as an "unimaginable" tragedy. Post-mortem examinations confirmed all three died from multiple stab wounds.	A funeral is being held for a family who were found stabbed at their home in Didcot, Oxfordshire.
Foden, 26, scored his third try in two matches as Saints beat Quins 24-3 in the Aviva Premiership. But he told BBC Radio Northampton: "If he continues to perform, I'm going to have to push myself to the limit. "Hopefully it'll bring out the best in both of us and put England rugby in a good place." Interim England coach Stuart Lancaster will name his squad for the Six Nations on Wednesday, with Brown expected to return for the first time since the tour of New Zealand in 2008. Also 26, he has scored 10 tries in 17 starts for Quins to help them reach the top of the Premiership table. Meanwhile, Foden is hopeful that Saints will again contribute a good number of players to the England squad for next month's tournament, after he joined Tom Wood, Chris Ashton, Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley at the 2011 World Cup. "We're performing well and if guys are fit, hopefully we'll see a few more representing the green, black and gold," he added.	Northampton Saints full-back Ben Foden believes his rivalry with Harlequins' Mike Brown can benefit both players and England.
Meaning "to watch a large number of television programmes (especially all the shows from one series) in succession", it reflects a marked change in viewing habits, due to subscription services like Netflix. Lexicographers noticed that its usage was up 200% on 2014. Other entries include dadbod, ghosting and clean eating. Helen Newstead, Head of Language Content at Collins, said: "The rise in usage of 'binge-watch' is clearly linked to the biggest sea change in our viewing habits since the advent of the video recorder nearly 40 years ago. "It's not uncommon for viewers to binge-watch a whole season of programmes such as House of Cards or Breaking Bad in just a couple of evenings - something that, in the past, would have taken months - then discuss their binge-watching on social media." Those partaking in binge-watching run the risk of dadbod, one of ten in the word of the year list. Referring to an untoned and slightly plump male physique, dadbod is not without its admirers, with actors like Seth Rogen and Leonardo DiCaprio fitting the purported brief. "Once again, the list of Collins' Words of the Year offers a fascinating snapshot of the ever-changing English language," said Newstead. Those words that remain popular could be included in the next print edition of the Collins English Dictionary, due in 2018.	Collins English Dictionary has chosen binge-watch as its 2015 Word of the Year.
Shankaracharya Swaroopanand's comments came two days after the Shani Shingnapur temple in Maharashtra state let women into the inner sanctum. For centuries, the temple had been open only to men. Last month, the Mumbai high court affirmed the right of women to enter and pray inside all temples. Women's activists had led protests demanding entry specifically to the Lord Shani shrine. "Women entered Shani temple's inner sanctum," news agency ANI quoted the 94-year-old as saying on Monday. "The women are worshipping Shani in the temple. By doing so, Shani's eyes would fall on women and this would result in increase of rape incidents." Women were kept out of the Shani Shingnapur temple for nearly 400 years and temple officials, in the past, had claimed that the ban was actually "to protect women since Shani emits radiation which can harm them and cause deformity in a foetus if a pregnant woman enters the temple". Last year, temple priests carried out an elaborate ritual cleansing after a woman managed to gain entry inside and offer prayers. The temple authorities relented after last month's Mumbai high court ruling that women had a fundamental right to enter temples, and said those trying to prevent them would be handed a six-month jail term. Several temples in India preserve the tradition of barring entry to women and in recent months, courts have been considering legal challenges to the policy. Shankaracharya Swaroopanand's statement has caused outrage in India with many taking to social media to criticise him: There were a few messages of support too:	A Hindu religious leader's comment that allowing women into a shrine devoted to Lord Shani (Saturn) will increase rapes has drawn criticism.
A letter from an NHS England official to managers and GPs in one region suggests vulnerable practices could be left to "wither by the system". The note, seen by the BBC and Pulse magazine, claims NHS England is no longer able to "continue supporting practices irrespective of their ability… to transform appropriately". NHS England denied this was the case. A spokesman for the British Medical Association said it was "unacceptable" that some NHS managers believed that some GP practices would be left to close. A practice may be vulnerable due to: These are often practices rated by regulators as "inadequate" or "requiring improvement". It comes as media reports suggest much of a special fund to help struggling GP surgeries has not yet been handed out more than a year after it was unveiled. In June 2015, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced a £10m investment in GP practices in England which were deemed to be vulnerable. This was formally launched by NHS England later in the year. But last week, the medical publication Pulse reported that barely any of the fund had reached GPs.  Managers administering the fund in each area were said to be still identifying which vulnerable practices would qualify for the support. NHS England did not deny the report, though a source said the organisation was "working through its local teams to ensure the funding available through the vulnerable practice programme is fully committed to named individual practices by the end of October". Around 800 out of a total of 8,000 practices are deemed by NHS England to be in the vulnerable category. The criteria include a high number of patients per GP and an "inadequate" or "requires improvement" rating by the regulator, the CQC. NHS chiefs said the aim was to provide support for practices under pressure and to ensure patients had continued access to high quality care. In April 2016, NHS England announced an extra £16m for this year for a so-called "practice resilience programme", with another £24m in subsequent years. This pool of money was also aimed at shoring up struggling practices and was part of the GP Practice Forward View unveiled by the head of NHS England Simon Stevens. But a letter sent by Paul Twomey, medical director of the NHS England North Yorkshire and Humber area team, to local GPs and health officials in August suggests a harder line stance. In it he says: "The message we need to communicate to general practice is the GP Practice Forward View must be about transformation and in that sense is not like a pilot." He goes on to express his belief that local health leaders will understand that "vulnerable practices must either transform and deliver a quality service or be allowed to fail and wither by the system. We are no longer in a position to continue supporting practices irrespective of their willingness or ability as a provider to transform appropriately." Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association's GP committee said this approach was unacceptable. He called on the government to deliver the funding immediately and "deter a mindset amongst managers that some GP practices can be allowed to disappear". An NHS England spokesperson said: "Rising patient demand is placing GPs under more pressure and that is why we are reversing the historic under-investment in general practice through a wide-ranging action plan, backed with half a billion pounds to support struggling practices. "This includes a four-year, £40m programme for helping the GP surgeries facing the most difficulties and further practical measures to stabilise general practice for the future." References to surgeries and practices being "allowed to fail" comes at a sensitive time in the debate about the state of NHS primary care in England. There has been a steady stream of surgery closures and recruitment problems. GPs complain of a growing and sometimes intolerable workload. Last month 2,000 patients were left without a GP after a surgery was closed in Nottingham following an "inadequate" regulatory rating. They were advised to contact other surgeries nearby. In July, an Oxfordshire doctor's surgery announced it would close because it claimed changes to the national GP contract made it "financially unviable" and two partners were due to retire. This week, a North Yorkshire practice said it would close in the New Year. NHS England, while promising to boost the share of the overall NHS budget going to general practice, has encouraged doctors to pool resources by forming "super-partnerships" and federations. Improving out-of-hours access and working more closely with community health services are also on the task list for GP groups. The underlying message is that more efficient ways of delivering care at a time of stretched resources are required. NHS chiefs are under pressure to find efficiency savings and a multitude of smaller practices might not be the best use of resources. But the danger is that a process of modernisation and consolidation involving surgery closures could leave patients in some areas unable to get a GP appointment.	Some struggling GP surgeries in England will be allowed to fail and close, according to a leaked document.
Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, had been missing since the collapse in February. His body was found on Wednesday and workers who carried out the search formed a guard of honour as it was driven from the site in the early hours of the morning. Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, remain missing. The body of a fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was previously recovered from the site. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris, who has been involved with the family since the incident, said they still did not know all the facts about the collapse. She said: "I feel very sad. My heart and my prayers go out to the family who have waited desperately for Christopher's body to be found. They can finally have closure, and say goodbye to him and grieve his loss. "But let's not forget that there's two other families who are still waiting for their loved ones to be returned." The building was due for demolition when it partially collapsed in February.	A body found in the ruins of a collapsed building at Didcot Power Station has been identified.
He said he hoped the treaty would help prevent the transfer of weapons to "warlords, human rights abusers, terrorists and criminal organisations". The deal also bans arms supplies if this promotes war crimes or genocide. So far 60 nations have ratified the accord, but not the US - the world's top arms exporter. Washington signed the agreement in 2013, but now it requires approval by the Senate, where opposition is believed to be strong. Other major weapons traders - like China, Russia, India and Pakistan - are yet to put their signatures under the deal. In a statement, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the treaty "marks the opening of a new chapter in our collective efforts to bring responsibility, accountability and transparency to the global arms trade". "Ultimately, it attests to our collective determination to reduce human suffering by preventing the transfer or diversion of weapons to areas afflicted by armed conflict and violence." Mr Ban also called on all countries to join the agreement "without delay". Other leading campaigners for a tighter regulation of the arms trade - such Amnesty International and the Control Arms Coalition - urged world governments to strictly adhere to the treaty's principles. The accord has been signed by nearly 130 nations, and five of the world's top 10 arms producers - Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain - have already ratified it. The accord regulates cross-border transfers of conventional weapons ranging from small firearms to tanks and artillery. The global business is estimated to generate up to $85bn (Â£55bn) every year, although some analysts say the figure is even higher.	A global arms trade treaty regulating the multibillion-dollar business has come into force - a move hailed as "a new chapter" by UN chief Ban Ki-moon.
CIA code that obscures malware's origins was detailed in the latest release by the whistle-blowing site. The code could be used to create a "signature" for CIA malware, said one virus hunter. The information is part of a larger cache about CIA hacking tools that started to be released last month. The release of the information could be "one of the most technically damaging" said Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California in Berkeley, in an interview with the Washington Post. "It seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations and attribute previous operations," he said. Before now, the information released about the CIA's hacking tools by Wikileaks has largely been only text describing many different ways the agency spies on targets. The latest release differs as it involves actual code used to hide the ultimate origins of malware used by the US organisation. It shows the obfuscation techniques used to make it harder to reverse engineer malware to unmask who made it. Included in the code library are fragments of Chinese and Farsi that are intended to be used in malware, as well as methods of moving data around that seek to thwart tools examining whether different samples have anything in common. Jake Williams, founder of security firm Rendition InfoSec, said the release was "significant". "It allows the attribution of previously discovered malware to the CIA specifically," he wrote, adding that the code samples could add up to a signature for spotting agency work. "It is likely that malware has been discovered previously which was not attributed to CIA then, but can be today thanks to the release of the code," he said. The CIA would not comment on the authenticity of the information released by Wikileaks, but a spokesman said Americans should be "deeply troubled" by the organisation's actions. "Dictators and terrorists have no better friend in the world than Julian Assange, as theirs is the only privacy he protects," said the spokesman.	Current spying campaigns run by the CIA could be disrupted, say experts, after more data on the agency's hacking techniques was released by Wikileaks.
The Tykes were knocked out of the FA Cup in the first round on Saturday by National League side Altrincham. They have also lost their last seven league games, and 34-year-old Johnson admitted it had been a "shocking run." Media playback is not supported on this device He told BBC Radio Sheffield: "I understand people want me gone. If I do stay - and I want to and believe I will - I know what we require." Johnson continued: "I have to take full responsibility and I do. It's my place to make changes, whether that be changing personnel or rallying the troops. "We have to put people out there that we believe will play for the badge on the front and not the name on the back." The former Oldham boss joined Barnsley in February on a three-and-a-half year contract, but the Reds have struggled to make an impact this season. They have won just four of their 16 matches, leaving them in 22nd place in League One. "The whole club has to assess the way to move forward because there's too many losing mentality characters around the place," he added. "The Under-18s rarely get a win, the Under-21s haven't got enough wins and we haven't got enough wins. Something has to have a clean sweep of the mindset and change."	Barnsley manager Lee Johnson has asked for time to change a "losing mentality" at the struggling League One club.
India's greatest leader had moved to a village called Segaon two years earlier. He had renamed it Sevagram or a village of service. He built an ashram, a commune which was home to "many a fateful decision which affected the destiny of India". Gandhi had moved in with his wife, Kasturba, and some followers. There was also a steady stream of guests. Kanu Gandhi, a callow young man in his 20s and a grand nephew of the Mahatma, was also there. Armed with a Rolleiflex camera, he was taking pictures of the leader. He had wanted to become a doctor, but his parents had goaded him to join Gandhi's personal staff doing clerical work, looking after accounts and writing letters at the ashram. Kanu Gandhi had developed an interest in photography, but Gandhi had told him there was no money to buy him a camera. The nephew did not relent. Finally, Gandhi asked businessman Ghanshyam Das Birla to gift 100 rupees ($1.49; Â£1.00) to Kanu so that he could buy the camera and a roll of film. But the leader imposed three conditions on the photographer: he forbade him from using flash and asking him to pose; and made it clear that the ashram would not pay for his photography. Kanu made do with a stipend from a Gandhi acolyte who liked his work. He also began selling his pictures to newspapers. Over the years and until Gandhi's assassination in 1948, Kanu Gandhi shot some 2,000 pictures of the greatest leader of the Indian Independence movement. For decades, his pictures remained in obscurity, once surfacing with a German researcher who began compiling and selling them. Now, 92 of those rare pictures of Gandhi during the last decade of his life have been published in an exquisitely produced  cloth-bound monograph by the Delhi-based Nazar Foundation, a non-profit trust founded by two of India's most well-known photographers Prashant Panjiar and Dinesh Khanna. This is possibly my most favourite image from the book. Here Gandhi is standing on a weighing scale at the Birla House in Bombay (what is now Mumbai) in 1945. For a man who undertook more than a dozen fasts during the freedom movement as a part of his non-violent protests - to bring peace, demand Muslim rights or to shame rioting mobs - the picture is telling. "This is a picture of a man keeping an eye on his weight, testing himself all the time. It tells you a lot about the man," says leading photographer Sanjeev Saith who went through more than 1,000 images and helped curate the monograph. Here, Gandhi is seen in front of his office hut at Sevagram ashram in 1940. A pillow covers his head as protection against the severe heat. It is, at once, an intimate and remote image. Which is one of the reasons, many say, that made Kanu Gandhi's pictures of the Mahatma so special. "Although he had incredible access to the icon, we are always struck at the way Kanu, perhaps because he was in awe of Gandhi always kept a respectful distance, and yet managed to convey a sense of intimacy and proximity," says Panjiar. "And because he kept a certain distance, Kanu intuitively found a more modern language of photography than what was prevalent in those times in India, framing many of his images with an interesting and unconventional use of the foreground, breaking many of the accepted rules of composition". Kanu Gandhi travelled far and wide with the leader. Here's his image of a van carrying Gandhi being pushed by Pathans and Congress workers over some rough terrain in the North West Frontier Provinces in October 1938. This is a picture of Gandhi, and his wife Kasturba, in Abottabad in November, 1938. Kanu Gandhi's first-ever book of photographs chronicles the leader's political and personal journey in his last decade in vivid detail. There are pictures of Gandhi in his many moods - brooding, joyous, pensive, grieving - and with his supporters. Here Gandhi is being massaged by a relative and his elder sister Raliatbehn during a three-day fast in Gujarat's Rajkot city in March 1939. "These images may be old, but they are not old-fashioned. They are not straightforward, beautifully shot and carefully framed, neat pictures which were popular then," says Panjiar. "It possibly helped that Kanu was not a trained photographer because many of his images would have been rejected by his contemporaries on account of being blurred, slightly out of focus or double exposed. But these find pride of place, lovingly pasted by own hands in albums." Gandhi and his wife Kasturba are seen here at a wedding of a Christian man and an untouchable woman in Sevagram ashram, 1940. Sanjeev Saith says the picture of a dying Kasturba Gandhi lying on a bed at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune in 1944 a few months before her death counts among his favourites. A broken shaft of light is streaming in through a window behind her. "Here is this austere woman lying regally on this stately bed, she is about to die. This picture just shakes me up," he says. And then there is this historic 1938 picture of Gandhi in a convivial mood with freedom hero and radical nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose. In the background, Kasturba Gandhi is drawing her sari, and looking into the distance. This was the high noon of Bose's political life: he had been elected as president of the Congress party. Gandhi had overruled objections from independence hero Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had objected to Bose's appointment. The two leaders had shared a complex relationship and fell out later over differences. "This is an amazing picture," says Saith. "It contains two of India's greatest heroes in one frame. Bose is young, cherubic, almost looking at Gandhi in admiration. Gandhi has his characteristic toothless grin. It is a nice, warm moment." Here's Gandhi and Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, in February 1940, a study of two great men in meditation. "Look at the bottom of the picture. It is an accidental double exposure [a technique which combined two different images into a single image]. It's rather inventive. Kanu Gandhi knew it was a good picture, and he didn't throw away the negative," says Saith. There's a series of pictures of Gandhi collecting donations for a fund for the untouchables during a three-month long train journey that took him to Bengal, Assam and southern India in 1945-46. In some he's stretching his arm from a carriage for money; in others he's surrounded by people and collecting the money in a slender basket. "He's an old man, but he looks agile. He's almost begging for alms, and he's serious about picking up every bit of money for a good cause. He understands money," says Saith. "I am a bania and there is no limit to my greed," Gandhi once said, alluding to his Indian caste comprising mainly of moneylenders. Being the only person who was allowed to take Gandhi's photographs at any time, Kanu Gandhi was shooting every day. Sometimes Gandhi intervened: one such moment was when Kasturba, lay dying in his lap at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. The nephew, however, was allowed to shoot this image of the leader, draped in a shawl, looking at Kasturba after she passed away in February 1944. According to several accounts, Gandhi kept a vigil for hours, sitting by her side, praying. "After sixty years of constant companionship," he said later that night. "I cannot imagine life without her." Ironically, for a man who followed Gandhi like a shadow, Kanu Gandhi was away in Noakhali in east Bengal when his leader was killed in 1948. "Gandhi's death had a profound effect on Kanu and his wife, Abha's life. For Kanu, photography was no longer as important as the need to convey his leader's message," says Panjiar. Kanu Gandhi died after a heart attack while on a pilgrimage in northern India in February 1986. Photographs by Kanu Gandhi/Â© Gita Mehta, heir of Abha and Kanu Gandhi.

The arrests are part of an operation that has seen women targeted for posting photos showing them not wearing headscarves on Instagram and elsewhere. Women in Iran have been required to cover their hair in public since 1979. The eight unnamed people were among 170 identified by investigators as being involved in modelling online. They included 59 photographers and make-up artists, 58 models and 51 fashion salon managers and designers, according to a statement from the court. The arrests were announced by the court's prosecutor Javad Babaei during a state television programme broadcast late on Sunday that focused on the "threats to morality and the foundation of family" posed by social media. Mr Babaei claimed modelling agencies accounted for about 20% of posts on Instagram from Iran and that they had been "making and spreading immoral and un-Islamic culture and promiscuity". Of the 170 people found to be involved in online modelling, 29 were warned that they were subject to criminal investigation, the prosecutor added. "The persons who reformed their behaviour after receiving a notice did not face any judicial action, and eight out of the 29 have been arrested," he said. A spokesman of the Iranian Centre for Surveying and Combating Organised Cyber Crimes, Mostafa Alizadeh, said: "Sterilising popular cyberspaces is on our agenda. "We carried out this plan in 2013 with Facebook, and now Instagram is the focus," he added, saying fresh operations would begin in the coming days. There was no immediate comment from the photo-sharing site Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.	Iran has arrested eight people working for online modelling agencies deemed to be "un-Islamic", the prosecutor of Tehran's cybercrimes court has said.
Haseeb Hamayoon, 28, sent the image to friends and a co-accused branding the officer "kaffir" - non-believer - London's Woolwich Crown Court was told. Prosecutors say Mr Hamayoon, Yousaf Syed, 20, and Nadir Syed, 22, plotted an attack using a Rambo-style knife. The cousins deny all charges. The image, allegedly taken on 19 September 2014, shows the back of the officer and was apparently taken by someone in a car. Mr Hamayoon wrote: "Look at this kaffir. Hounslow parking lot." Nadir Syed wrote back: "How can you pray in such a place?" Mr Hamayoon replied: "You're right I'm walking out. This kaffir cop yeh.  Looking inside every car who's in there. I gave him a dirty look." Mr Syed replied: "He's looking for u mate. Mi5 sent him to keep eye on y." The messages were exchanged on encrypted messaging service Telegram. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: "You'll see on Mr Hamayoon's mobile phone two photos taken that show a police officer or PCSO walking away from the car and around a car park. "The photos are taken from the driver's seat of the car. Those images are created on the telephone. It's quite clear what Mr Hamayoon was writing messages about." Two days later, IS militants issued a "fatwa" calling on followers to attack Westerners. It implored them to: "Rig the roads with explosives for them. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads." Prosecutors claim the trio plotted to carry out a terror attack in the UK. Mr Hamayoon and Nadir Syed, from Hounslow, west London and Yousaf Syed, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, filmed themselves stamping on a Remembrance Day poppy and were obsessed with the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby, it is claimed. The trial continues.	A supporter of so-called Islamic State photographed a police officer in a mosque car park before plotting to carry out a knife attack around Remembrance Sunday 2014, a court heard.
It was taken by ex-students and staff from UWC Atlantic College in the Vale of Glamorgan who also stayed to help. The boat will be used to try to ensure the safe landing of boats from Turkey. A narrow stretch of water has become a crossing point for people from Syria and other countries which has claimed many lives. College alumni Robin Jenkins and Lily Eckersley-Jones helped transfer the rescue boat to Lesbos with college tutor Michel Creber where another former student, Dr Annegret Berne, had been volunteering. Mr Jenkins, originally from Llantwit Major and a lecturer at University of the Arts London, said: "The faces of the people on board when we come alongside is something that I cannot put in to words. "We were a reassuring sign of safety. "We must do more and we will start on constructing another boat." The first vessel, named LB1 Red Mist, had formerly been used by the college at St Donat's, near Llantwit Major, and its students before being sent to Lesbos. It is now being used by a group called the Lifeguard Hellas Training Centre. Its design is the same as the original rigid hull inflatable boat (RIB) made in the early 1960s by students from the college and which has become the model for RNLI inshore boats across Britain - known as the Atlantic class. Mr Jenkins set up a help group called the Atlantic Pacific Rescue Boat Project to deliver a boat to Japan to assist lifeguards and now others are being made to help rescuers in Lesbos. He said college students working with tutor Michel Creber have already began work on a second RIB and he had also received a donation on Tuesday to cover the cost of making a third.	A Welsh lifeboat has been sent to Lesbos to help people trying to ensure the safety of refugees and migrants arriving by boats on the Greek island.
The head of the mission, Peter Graaff, met the Ghanaian president to thank the country for hosting the agency since it was set up in September last year. A small team will stay until the end of June to co-ordinate air operations, the agency, known as Unmeer, said. Ghana has not been affected by the epidemic in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people. Africa news: Tuesday 9 June as it happens Why Ebola is so dangerous Ebola basics: What you need to know The BBC's Africa health correspondent Anne Soy says the mission set up its headquarters in Accra as it was far enough away from the affected countries, where there was logistical lockdown, but close enough the epicentre of the outbreak. "By allowing us to set up our headquarter in Accra, President [John ] Mahama demonstrated extraordinary leadership and solidarity," Mr Graaff said in a statement. "He made Ghana the only open gateway to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone thus allowing the movement of thousands of Ebola responders and medical and essential supplies when they were most needed." As a result, Unmeer said Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone now had the necessary response capabilities in place to efficiently test, treat and isolate Ebola patients. 11,164 Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected (Includes one in the US and six in Mali) 4,806 Liberia 3,912 Sierra Leone 2,431 Guinea 8 Nigeria President Mahama said the downsizing of Unmeer was a sign of success for "short and sharp interventions". Most of the mission's staff and assets have been moved to Sierra Leone and Guinea, where 24 new cases of Ebola were reported in the last week. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Liberia free of Ebola as the country had had no new cases in 42 days. The basics: What you need to know	The UN's emergency Ebola response headquarters in Ghana's capital, Accra, is to close as the outbreak slows.
Chernova, now 27, beat Briton Ennis-Hill to gold at the 2011 World Championships in Korea. This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-tested - but kept her world title. "She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use," Minichiello said. Russian anti-doping agency punished Chernova with a two-year ban, backdated to 22 June 2013. It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before  she won world gold in Daegu with a personal best of 6,880 points, beating defending champion Ennis-Hill's 6,751. Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken. Minichiello wants athletics' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to have a "long, hard look" at the Russian anti-doping agency's punishment. The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action. "Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test," added Minichiello. "I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time. Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective." Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics. "It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them," said Minichiello. "That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at." Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences. Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year. The IAAF said last week it was concerned about the number of Russian doping cases in the sport.	Jessica Ennis-Hill's coach Toni Minichiello wants Russian heptathlete Tatyana Chernova's drugs ban to be re-examined by the sporting authorities.
Between 2012 and 2015, cases of syphilis increased by 76%, from 3,001 to 5,288, while gonorrhoea infections rose by 53%, from 26,880 to 41,193, Public Health England data reveals. The rise was notable among men who have sex with men. At the same time, rates of genital warts decreased, thanks to a vaccination campaign. Rates of sexually transmitted infections as a group also went down slightly, totalling 434,456. But experts say this could be because fewer people came forward for testing. Chlamydia was the most commonly diagnosed STI, accounting for nearly half of the cases diagnosed in 2015. Young people are routinely offered chlamydia screening, but only 13% of young men and 32% of young women were tested in 2015. The large fall in genital warts - a 7% drop - was seen in young women, and experts say this was probably because of the national human papilloma virus vaccination programme. All girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the jab as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The FPA charity's chief executive, Natika Halil, said boys should be offered the vaccine too, which is something ministers are considering. Genevieve Edwards, of Marie Stopes UK, said the statistics should "set alarm bells ringing" about the availability of sexual health services for young people and men who have sex with men. "We have to keep a focus on preventing sexual ill health, and providing prompt diagnosis and treatment to those who need it," she added. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the continued rise of gonorrhoea was extremely disturbing, given the further spread of drug-resistant infections. Dr Gwenda Hughes, head of STI surveillance at PHE, said: "We need to do more to raise awareness about STIs and how they can be prevented, especially the effectiveness of using condoms. "We recommend that anyone having sex with a new or casual partner uses condoms and tests regularly for HIV and STIs."	Syphilis and gonorrhoea sexually transmitted infections are continuing to rise in England, new figures show.
Sturm won a split decision after a superb fight with two judges favouring Sturm by 116-112 and the other seeing it 115-113 for Macklin. Sturm's sharper work in the second half of the contest swung the fight his way. Macklin made a blazing start which gave him genuine hope of an upset before fading late on. Sturm is unbeaten in five years and was making his 10th defence in his second reign as WBA middleweight champion, on his own show in his home city. But if the odds were stacked against Macklin, who had himself not tasted defeat since 2006, he shrugged them off in an explosive start in which he slung hooks to Sturm's body and made the champion cover up. Far from blowing himself out, Macklin appeared to grow stronger as the early rounds progressed with Sturm relying on single, accurate shots to repel his opponent's continuous advances. But Sturm finally got to grips with fight as it moved deeper into the second half, gaining control behind a stiff jab which had scarcely been in evidence in the opening stages. Sturm enjoyed a big 10th round when a crashing uppercut followed by a right cross had Macklin temporarily in trouble, but the Irishman continued to fight back in pursuit of his dream. Sturm caught the eye again in the last, finishing the contest with a furious assault which left Macklin almost out on his feet. Although both men claimed victory at the end, the verdict went with Sturm. Macklin insisted: "I should be champion. I believe I was the better fighter, but it is not Felix's fault, he wasn't a judge." But Sturm said: "It wasn't a wrong decision, but it was close. "It was not my most outstanding performance, but I have had a few clear shots and Matt worked hard. In my view, the decision was absolutely correct. "We will definitely have a second fight, we have already agreed it." Meanwhile, Kell Brook kept his world title ambitions on course with a comfortable points victory over Lovemore N'Dou in his home city of Sheffield. Brook now has 24 wins and no defeats, although he was unable to extend a run of eight wins inside the distance against the wily veteran.	Germany's Felix Sturm edged a tough contest against Birmingham-based Irishman Matthew Macklin in their WBA middleweight title fight in Cologne.
Andrew Virco, 50, and Katharine Walker, 51, from Cambridge, died with two other Britons when the aircraft crashed into a glacier on South Island, on Saturday. Ms Walker's daughter, Rebecca, 22, said the couple were on a "big adventure" that had been planned for some time. "They do holidays but this was the big one... they had waited for," she said. "New Zealand was her dream. Her and Andy had been planning it for a long time. It was what they would do for their 50th birthdays. "It was their celebration together." Ms Walker was head of radiotherapy at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Her daughter, a university student, said: "She was everything. She had a special spin on life. She worked hard and she played hard. That's the way she lived her life. "She affected so many people in so many good ways. The things she did at work were incredible. "You just walked through town and everybody would be like 'hi, hi'. I couldn't go shopping without her seeing someone she knew. Cambridge is a big place but she affected so many people. "Not having her here is just going to break so many people. It hasn't sunk in yet." She described Mr Virco, an award-winning photographer, as "amazing". "He took me into his world," she said. "He treated me like his daughter and you can't say much more than that. He's going to be missed." Nigel and Helen Charlton, aged 66 and 70, from Hampshire, also died in the crash, along with Sovannmony Leang, 27, and Josephine Gibson, 29, both from New South Wales, Australia; and pilot Mitchell Gameren, 28, from Queenstown, New Zealand. The recovery operation has been halted for the day after weather conditions at Fox Glacier deteriorated. Three bodies have been recovered. The cause of the crash is being investigated.	A couple who died in a helicopter crash in New Zealand were on a "dream" holiday to celebrate their 50th birthdays, their family has said.
Click to enlarge image A black and white photo of the publication's Manhattan headquarters takes pride of place, with the strapline #lastprintissue. The nod to Twitter is regarded as a backhanded compliment. The death of the print edition was caused by falling advertising revenues, as audiences moved online. From the new year, Newsweek will be a digital-only publication. Editor Tina Brown described it as "a new chapter" for the magazine. In a defiant editor's letter, she wrote: "This is not a conventional magazine, or a hidebound place. "It is in that spirit that we're making our latest, momentous change, embracing a digital medium that all our competitors will one day need to embrace with the same fervor. "We are ahead of the curve." Ms Brown became editor of the publication two years ago, after it merged with The Daily Beast, a news website she co-founded in 2008. Newsweek's first edition was published on 17 February, 1933. It made an immediate splash with its front cover, featuring seven photos - one news story for each day of the week. Although it always took second place to its rival, Time, it  gained prominence in the 1960s for its coverage of the civil rights movement. At its height, it had a circulation of 3 million, but declining readership and advertising revenue saw it fall into losses. It was sold by the Washington Post Company to businessman and publisher Sidney Harman for $1 in 2010, and was merged with the Daily Beast three months later. Ms Brown is a former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. She unveiled Newsweek's final front cover via Twitter, saying: "Bitter sweet! Wish us luck!" One reader commented that the hashtag headline was "like using your final breath to ID the killer". The move to a digital edition will allow Newsweek to cut costs such as printing, postage and distribution. However it will lose money from print advertisers, who traditionally pay more than their online counterparts. As the final edition went to the printers, The Daily Beast confirmed it would be making many of its editorial staff redundant.	The 80-year-old US current affairs magazine Newsweek has revealed the image that will grace the cover of its last-ever print edition.
Manuela Carmena in Madrid and new Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau are the most striking examples of the change, having led completely new political organisations to success. In Madrid's Cibeles city hall, where many gathered to cheer the counting of votes for a new mayor, Ms Carmena said she wanted to begin "governing by listening". The former judge's main occupation before the campaign was running her shop selling children's clothes stitched by female prisoners. She now plans to arrange for council sessions to focus on single policy objectives, such as child poverty, calling in experts and all available data to help formulate solutions. To the city's poorest, Carmena said: "We are going to improve the situation." Apart from their policy priorities to tackle poverty caused by Spain's economic crisis, all three mayors insist that the style of their rule will be very different. Spain's leading anti-austerity party Podemos is part of the two groups taking hold of city hall in Madrid and Barcelona - Ahora Madrid and Barcelona en Comu. In Valencia, Mayor Joan Ribo's Coalicio Compromis was formed by leftists, Valencian nationalists and greens in 2010. However, more than a simple jerk to the left on the political spectrum, the new mayors say they want to redefine politicians' roles, becoming unalloyed conduits for popular will and participation. Thousands gathered to listen to Ada Colau's acceptance speech in Barcelona on Saturday, watching on screens in Sant Jaume square outside the city hall. "Voting every four years is not enough," she said. "Never trust the idea that we will represent you well. Kick us out if we don't do what we have promised." Until last year when she got involved in BComu, Ms Colau was regularly photographed being removed by police from a cordon of people blocking a repossession. Now she will be in charge of Barcelona's metropolitan police force. In Valencia, as in Madrid, 24 years of uninterrupted Popular Party rule were brought to an end by a veteran left-winger espousing a new way of doing politics. "Authoritarianism is over," said 67-year-old Joan Ribo. "I don't want the rod or the rule. I prefer talking with citizens [and] working side-by-side with neighbourhood movements." However, the three new mayors do not enjoy majorities in their respective council chambers. In Madrid and Valencia, potentially stable deals with other left-of-centre parties have been struck, but the situation in Barcelona is more complicated due to the fragmentation of politics along the axes of left and right as well as Catalan sovereignty. Despite her publicised sympathy for Catalonia's "right to decide", Ada Colau has so far resisted signing up to the nationalist parties' "road map" for independence. Elsewhere, the Podemos-linked Zaragoza en Comun group took control of Spain's fifth most populous city, while Santiago de Compostela, A Coruna and Cadiz are among other towns and cities which now have left-wing coalition chiefs as mayors. With a general election looming at the end of the year, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy described deals between left-wing groups and the chief opposition Socialist Party as "eccentric and sectarian". His Popular Party was the most-voted for option across Spain and in cities such as Madrid and Valencia, but has only found support from centrist anti-corruption party Citizens in some towns and regions.	A 71-year-old anti-Franco judge, an anti-evictions campaigner and a teacher have been elected mayors of Spain's three biggest cities - as left-wing coalitions swept to power promising an end to corruption.
The deaths plunged the community in the town of Arnstein into mourning. The five young men and a woman, all aged 18 or 19, were found on Sunday by the landowner whose son and daughter were among the victims. Police say a wood-burning stove was in use at the hut, but other possible causes are still being investigated. "The six adolescents... died from carbon monoxide poisoning," said a police statement. "The cause of the leakage of the toxic gas remains under investigation." The owner of the hut said he had gone there after his children failed to return from the party the night before. A neighbour told German media that his daughter had been celebrating her 18th birthday. The brick building is some distance outside the town and the area was covered in snow. The tragedy has caused an outpouring of grief in the town, which is about 30km (18 miles) north of the city of Wuerzburg. An area has been set aside in the local church for flowers, candles and other tributes to the teenagers. A gathering for friends and relatives was held there on Monday "for grief, remembrance and prayer".	Six teenagers found dead in a garden hut in the German state of Bavaria died from carbon monoxide poisoning, police have said.
Researchers funded by the charity found that by looking at a specific group of genes they were able to reliably detect underlying problems. It follows the death of Sir David Frost's son Miles, who died suddenly from a condition thought to have been inherited from his father. His family aims to raise Â£1.5m to make genetic testing available in the UK. The eldest son of the late presenter and broadcaster died last year, aged 31, when he was out jogging near his family's home in Oxfordshire. He was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Previous genetic tests looked at a small number of genes and were only able to identify specific conditions, leading to higher costs and longer diagnosis time - a major barrier to rolling the test out across the NHS. But researchers from Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre say the new test, which looks at 174 genes, is quicker and more reliable. It has already been rolled out at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust in London , with around 40 patients per month being successfully tested. Dr James Ware, a consultant cardiologist specialising in inherited heart conditions, said: "Without a genetic test we often have to keep the whole family under regular surveillance for many years. This is hugely costly for both the families and the health system. "By contrast, when a genetic test reveals the precise genetic abnormality causing the condition in one member of the family, it becomes simple to test other family members. Those who do not carry the faulty gene copy can be reassured and spared countless hospital visits." The research has been funded by the British Heart Foundation and the findings published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Translational Research.	A new blood test could help diagnose people with inherited heart conditions, the British Heart Foundation has said.
HP split into two separate companies in November - one focused on the printer and PC businesses and the other on corporate services. Shares of Hewlett Packard Inc fell 4% while services focussed Hewlett Packard Enterprises rose 2.3%. The Dow Jones gained 19 points to close at 17,812, after a bumpy start. The S&P 500 rose 2 points to 2,079.22, while the Nasdaq gained 20 points to 5,102. Hewlett-Packard's revenue fell 9.5% to $25.71bn in the fourth-quarter. On a broader theme, concerns about global political tensions weighed on early trading after it was reported that Turkey had shot down a Russian warplane. Stocks regained their footing, though on the back of news that the US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter of the year. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product rose at an annual pace of 2.1% in the quarter, up from the 1.5% rate it reported last month. Oil prices rose sharply on concerns that there could be more uncertainty in the Middle East. Brent crude jumped by 2.5% or $1.14, to $45.97 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude climbed $0.94 to $42.96 a barrel. As a result, shares in oil firms rose, with Exxon Mobil up 2% and Chevron 1.5% higher.	(Close): Shares of the two newly split Hewlett Packard companies diverged after its last report as a consolidated company.
The captain, who retired hurt on 60 with a back problem on the first day in Adelaide, returned to make 128. "The way he played speaks words for the guy," said Steve Smith, who hit 162 not out as Australia reached 517-7. The Test was delayed after Hughes, 25, died after being struck by a ball while playing for South Australia. Clarke, 33, helped carry his team-mate's coffin and made an emotional speech at his funeral on 3 December. Clarke, who received a standing ovation from the Adelaide Oval crowd after reaching three figures, celebrated his century by kissing his helmet and embracing Smith. "He came out here and tried to do something for Hughesy," said Smith. "He certainly did that." Smith also praised Clarke for his efforts over the past three weeks. "It's been tough for all of us, but he's spent the whole time by Hughesy's family's side," said Smith. "Just the strength and courage he's showed throughout those times was unbelievable." Australian batsman David Warner also hit a century on day one of the Test and dedicated it to Hughes. The Test is the first in a four-match series, which ends in January.	Michael Clarke scored a century on day two of the opening Test against India, Australia's first match since the death of batsman Phillip Hughes.
The Dudley Muslim Association has offered Dudley Council £325,000 to drop court action in a dispute about the site where the mosque is to be built. If accepted, the association would retain ownership of the land on Hall Street, and the council would not invoke its buy-back clause. The council has so far incurred £213,000 in legal costs. The land at the centre of the dispute was bought by the association 10 years ago, with the aim of replacing its current building on Castle Hill, which it said it had outgrown. Proposals include a community and training centre, sports facilities and a two-storey car park, but the mosque itself and its three prayer halls have been the focus of opposition. Branded at times a "mega mosque", the plans have attracted EDL supporters from across the country, although community leaders have in turn accused them of "scaremongering". At its meeting on 25 June, the council's cabinet will refer the settlement offer to its scrutiny board for consideration. Pete Lowe, leader of the council, said both the authority and the association were keen to avoid further costly legal disputes. "We are carefully considering that offer in the interests of everyone concerned," he said.	An out of court settlement has been offered by a Muslim group to end a long-running dispute over a new mosque.
The Conservatives claimed the amount councils are spending on education is at its lowest level for six years. But the Scottish government said the figures being quoted were "inaccurate and misleading". Each council decides for itself just how much to spend on education although some important costs like teachers' pay are set nationally. The Conservatives claimed official government figures said spending on education by councils had fallen to its lowest level for six years. They said councils spent Â£4.67 billion between them last year - down Â£140m on the previous year. The government said the Conservatives' figures were wrong as some of the numbers quoted were not directly comparable. Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Mary Scanlon said: "At a time when the schools budget in England has been protected, these new figures reveal another cut in funding for schools in Scotland. "The cost of this is clear. In England the number of full-time teachers has increased by more than 3,000 between 2010 and 2013. "But in Scotland, over the same period, the numbers have fallen by around 1,000. "This is the price schools are paying for the SNP's failure to take any responsibility for our schools system and undertake the reforms that are necessary to turn it around. "It's not good enough for them to blame others - the cuts to spending and the fall in literacy and numeracy standards is happening on the SNP's watch." But the Scottish government insisted the Conservatives' use of figures is wrong. A Scottish government spokesperson said: "This comparison is completely inaccurate and misleading, as it compares net expenditure in 2014/15 with gross expenditure for past years. Provisional outturn was higher in 2014-15 than it was in 2013-14. "We also know councils are planning to spend 3.3% more on the delivery of education in 2015-16 - the largest increase in six years. "We know spending per pupil is significantly higher in Scotland than England. "Despite Westminster austerity, we remain wholly committed to mitigating the effects of welfare cuts and ensuring our education system is resourced to continue to meet the needs of children, parents, schools and communities." The largest teaching union, the EIS, said education budgets had been under pressure, but had little sympathy for the Conservatives' claims. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The damaging age of austerity imposed by the UK government has had a significant detrimental impact on the funding available to public services in Scotland. "Education has not been immune from the downward pressure on Scottish government and local authority budgets, and this had led to serious challenges in our schools owing to declining teacher numbers, lack of school resources and rising class sizes. "The attempt by the Tory party, however, to exploit the impact of an austerity programme which they are imposing seems somewhat hypocritical. "Scottish education needs additional resources but it does not need the type of retrograde policies pursued so disastrously in England by the likes of Michael Gove." Each council decides for itself just how much to spend on education, although some important costs like teachers' pay are set nationally. However, councils receive the overwhelming bulk of their money from the Scottish government. Education is the biggest service councils provide, and the biggest challenge facing councils just now is money. Typically about 80% of each council's budget comes from the Scottish government. Council tax, which makes up most of the rest, has been frozen since 2007. The latest council funding agreement obliged councils to maintain teacher numbers or risk losing money. Some councils objected to this - arguing this amounted to micro-management in their affairs, and claiming there was more to raising attainment in schools than simply maintaining teacher numbers. While the government strongly disputes the Conservatives' use of figures, there is little doubt that some council education budgets are under scrutiny as councils continue to look for savings. In recent months four councils looked at reducing the length of the primary school week, while services such as school libraries have also been under the spotlight. The Scottish government - which currently receives all its money from Westminster - argues it has been trying to do its best for councils in the face of tight funding settlements and believes the council tax freeze has been a help to family budgets. However, critics point out that councils are left with little practical control of the size of their overall budgets.	A row has broken out over claims councils have slashed their education budgets.
The Newry firm had been run by its founder Lord Ballyedmond, until his death in a helicopter crash in March. Mr Nagle is currently the chairman of the Dublin-based Sisk Group, one of the largest privately owned companies in Ireland. Sisk is primarily a construction business but also has a significant manufacturing division. Mr Nagle is an experienced corporate manager, having held senior roles at firms like Intel and Nortel. He joined Sisk in 2005 as head of its non-construction trading activities and led the development of a strategy to diversify the business. Sisk entered the healthcare sector and initially acquired a number of businesses in Ireland and the UK. Norbrook chairman Sir Roy McNulty said Mr Nagle "brings a wide range of skills and experience which will be of great benefit to the team in Norbrook".	The Northern Ireland pharmaceutical firm Norbrook has appointed Liam Nagle as its new chief executive.
The security breach led to the possible theft of bitcoin worth $65m (Â£49m). Bitfinex told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that nearly 120,000 bitcoin were stolen from its exchange platform. All transactions on the virtual exchange have been suspended while the security breach is investigated. In a statement on its website, Bitfinex said that it was "deeply concerned about the issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it". The hack is one of the biggest thefts in bitcoin's history and is being treated as a "major deal" by many in the virtual currency community. "Unfortunately, we continue to have vulnerabilities in the form of exchanges and wallets," former Singapore-based bitcoin broker David Moskowitz told the BBC. "The vulnerabilities almost always occur on the exchange or wallet side and this is an area that continues to need improvement and more secure protocols, no different than when a bank gets robbed." Securing bitcoin trading platforms has been a key challenge, with hacking and thefts seen as the biggest threats. In 2014, the Tokyo-based Mt Gox trading exchange declared bankruptcy when hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins vanished or were stolen. But Mr Moskowitz stressed that in spite of the latest alleged theft "the core protocol is extremely robust and has not been hacked". He said while there would most likely be a price correction in bitcoin, he remained confident that it would continue to be an appealing alternative asset.	The price of bitcoin has fallen more than 10% after the Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex said it had suffered a major hack.
Most of the injuries were minor, but several people had been taken to hospital, one official said. The trains had come from Bakersfield and Los Angeles. They collided near Oakland Station at around 2200 local on Wednesday (0500 GMT Thursday). A fire official told Associated Press one train had been stationary and the other was travelling at 15mph (24kph). A passenger said there had been "an awful jolt" when the collision took place. Oakland Fire Department battalion chief Emon Usher told AP the stationary train had been unloading passengers when it was hit. He said several of 16 people injured in the collision had been taken to local hospitals. The Oakland Tribune and KTVU-TV put the number of injured at 18.  They said most had suffered bruises and bumps, with one report of a broken arm. Authorities said the injured came from both trains. Amtrak said it had been a "low speed" collision between the "San Joaquin" train - travelling between Bakersfield and Oakland - and the Coast Starlight, which was on its way from Los Angeles to Seattle. The wheels of both trains' lead engines had derailed, a spokesman said. Train traffic through Oakland Station has been suspended and emergency services and rail inspectors are at the scene.	At least 16 people have been injured after two Amtrak trains collided in California, US media reports say.
The planned opening of the primary and secondary schools, in the Castel, has already been delayed by a year and is now scheduled for September 2018. Chief Minister Jonathan Le Tocq said putting the decision back by a month would not cause further delays. He said the time would be used to ensure points raised had been answered. Deputy Le Tocq said the Policy Council had only had the chance to discuss three elements - the Education Department's report, the Treasury and Resources Department's comment and the independent review panel's report - on Monday. He said: "Having discussed all three, I will be actively encouraging both the Education and the Treasury and Resources Departments to address points raised, in order to ensure we demonstrate a balance between the needs of our community's education system and best value-for-money for taxpayers." The plans include an autism centre and improved sports facilities. The secondary school is the last of the States high schools to be redeveloped, following the rebuild of Les Beaucamps and St Sampson's.	A final decision on the £59m redevelopment of La Mare de Carteret schools will not now be made until May, Guernsey's Policy Council has ruled.
Seven riders in the peloton crossed with the safety barrier down, but were not sanctioned for breaking race rules. Sir Bradley Wiggins finished 18th in his final race for Team Sky, 31 seconds behind German winner John Degenkolb. "It's the most beautiful race in the world and we get bothered by a train," said French champion Arnaud Demare. "This needs to be taken care of, it was dangerous. We went through but it was close." One rider from the Belgian Lotto team was clipped by a barrier which came down seconds before the 60kph train sped past. Race organisers said the peloton were 10m from the barrier as it started to descend and that the leading riders "could not stop in safe conditions". A police motorcycle stopped the rest of the pack, before organisers of the 151-mile race slowed the leaders to allow the pack to catch up. Former British champion and Olympic track medallist Rob Hayles, commentating on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, said: "That could have ended in disaster. "You could see riders nip across but that train wasn't slowing down." A similar incident occurred last year but it affected only the eight men in the breakaway. In 2006, three riders who were chasing a lone breakaway by eventual winner Fabian Cancellara were disqualified after crossing a railway line after the barrier was down.	Several Paris-Roubaix riders were seconds from being hit by a train as they raced over a rail crossing while a TGV approached.
There was a time when by-elections were a speciality of the Liberal Democrats. They enjoyed a string of famous by-election victories, snatching seats in  Newbury, Eastleigh and Dunfermline West. Of course all that was before they went into government. In Corby they came fourth behind the UK Independence Party and lost their deposit. Their candidate, Jill Hope, admitted it was a setback but put it down to the "hard and unpopular decisions" the coalition government had been forced to make to tackle the economic mess it inherited. Even before the result was announced the Lib Dem President Tim Farron said his party was bound to get squeezed in a mid-term contest in a marginal seat. They did come second in the Manchester Central by-election, but their candidate Marc Ramsbottom saw a 17% swing against his party and mustered just 1,571 votes. In Cardiff, the Lib Dems came third after another slump in their vote. In the elections for Police and Crime Commissioners, in England and Wales, the party did little better. The Lib Dems came fourth behind UKIP in Wiltshire and Northumberland and fourth behind an independent in Merseyside. In South Yorkshire, Nick Clegg's backyard, the party came fifth behind both UKIP and the English Democrats. As we have reported, the turnout was very low, but Lib Dems are supposed to be good at local campaigning, getting their supporters out. Party morale has suffered another serious blow.	The results of Thursday's elections make grim reading for the Liberal Democrats.
It allegedly took place as the girl was leaving the Ashton Court Estate at about 22.30 BST on Saturday 8 August. Avon and Somerset Police want to speak to a man aged between 25 to 30 with short black hair and a stubbly beard. Officers said he had a silver stud in his left nostril, a scar on the knuckles of his left hand and spoke with a foreign accent.	Police are investigating a report of a sexual assault on a 16-year-old girl at the Bristol Balloon Fiesta.
The council backed a French-drafted resolution to send up to 228 police for an initial period of a year. Burundi earlier said it would accept no more than 50 police officers. More than 400 people have been killed in unrest since President Pierre Nkurunziza said he would run for a third term in office last April. More than 200,000 people have fled their homes. "Given an increase in violence and tension the Security Council must have eyes and ears on the ground to predict and ensure that the worst does not occur in Burundi," said French UN Ambassador Francois Delattre. "This is a strong act of preventative diplomacy," he added. The government of Burundi earlier warned it would agree to no more than 50 UN police officers. Diplomats are now negotiating how to implement the UN Security Council's resolution. Although both Burundi's opposition and government forces are ethnically mixed, some fear that the violence could descend into a repeat of the genocidal killings which the country has previously experienced. President Nkurunziza is the former leader of a Hutu rebel group which battled a Tutsi-dominated army for many years until he came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal.	The UN Security Council has authorised the deployment of a UN police force to Burundi to try to quell violence and human rights abuses in the country.
Tynan, a former Manchester City player, died after being hit by a train at West Allerton station in Merseyside on Tuesday, British Transport Police said. Tynan's death is not being treated as suspicious. Her family paid tribute to a "vibrant, generous and fun-loving girl", who was "a dedicated athlete, never happier than when she had a ball at her feet". Tynan began her career at Liverpool Feds, spent six years at Everton's Centre of Excellence and was playing for Women's Premier League side Fylde Ladies. A family statement also said she was a "the most loving and caring daughter and sister anyone could wish for" and that she was the "ultimate team player". It added: "Zoe always knew how to cheer anyone up, and was a loyal, straight-talking friend to many. She touched so many people's lives and will never be forgotten." Tynan joined Manchester City in 2015, making one Women's FA Cup appearance before moving to Fylde. Floral tributes have been left at the scene, according to the Liverpool Echo. England internationals including Lucy Bronze and Casey Stoney have also paid tribute. Fylde manager Luke Swindlehurst said: "We want to remember Zoe in the best possible way: a hugely talented player and an immensely likable character." Tynan had appeared for England at various youth levels and was recently included in the Under-19 squad for a training camp at St George's Park. The Football Association said it was "deeply saddened" by the death and Tynan's Under-19 coach Mo Marley described her as a "hugely-liked and popular member of the team".	England Under-19 Women's and Fylde Ladies midfielder Zoe Tynan has died, aged 18.
The performance artist is spending 512 hours interacting with the public at the show, held in three completely empty rooms. Phones, cameras and even watches are banned, as Abramovic takes people by the hand and encourages them to spend time focusing on the bare white walls. "Take in the silence," she whispered to one. "Just be present." After half-an-hour, the gallery was filled with human statues, manoeuvred into position by the Belgrade-born artist and her team of six "guards", all clad in black. Participants closed their eyes and rocked on their heels, some assumed meditative positions, while others followed Abramovic around, hoping for a personal interaction. "I really wanted to connect with her, so I said a little prayer," said Sophie, a student sculptor from London. "Connecting with her presence was really special. She said, 'stay here as long as you like, take deep breaths, be present'. "It was perfect, really." Entry to the exhibition, which lasts for 10 weeks, is free but only 160 people can be admitted at a time. Each can stay as long as they wish, with the gallery imposing a "one in - one out" policy. Abramovic herself opened the gallery doors at 10:00 BST - as she will every day - by which point there were already hundreds of acolytes and art lovers queuing in Kensington Gardens. Geraldine, an art professor from Kensington, had arrived at 06:30 BST to be amongst the first to see the performance. "It was like being at a very beautiful party where nobody talks," she told the BBC. "It may push me into doing some meditation, which is probably very good for me, so it changed my life in a very positive way." "Just to sit and get lost in one's thoughts, I think it's very relaxing," said Andrew, a psychiatrist visiting the UK from San Francisco. "And certainly some people were crying, too, so perhaps it brings up some thoughts that one pushes down from normal life." The show is titled 512 Hours, after the amount of time Abramovic will spend in the gallery. It is her first performance work since The Artist is Present, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she sat motionless, six days a week, looking directly at whoever sat down in a chair placed opposite her. Both shows lack the startling drama of her earlier performances, including one in which she systematically stabbed her hand with knives. In another, she whipped herself, before cutting a five-point star in her stomach with a razor blade and lying on a cross made of ice. Once, she nearly died after lying in the middle of a burning cross made of petrol-soaked sawdust. On another occasion, she allowed an audience member to hold a loaded gun to her head. Nonetheless, she told the BBC her latest show "really frightens me". "I worry about the British public," she said, adding that the public's cynicism might get in the way of creating "a pure emotional connection". "My only chance with the British public is to be vulnerable," she told Radio 4's Front Row. "The audience is someone who completes the work." Ahead of the show, the 67-year-old was accused of failing to acknowledge other artists who engage in the "art of nothing". Two weeks ago, a  group of US art historians curators wrote to the Serpentine, asking it to recognise the influence of Mary Ellen Carroll. a conceptual artist who has been working on a project called "Nothing" since 2006, when she went to Argentina with only her passport. But Abramovic dismissed the accusations, telling the BBC: "There is nothing on the walls of the gallery, no work. But I am working eight hours a day with the energy of the public." During the first hour of the first day of her performance, Abramovic seemed to be playing a giant game of cosmic yogic chess, with the public as her pieces, positioned carefully throughout the gallery. There was something eerie about entering a room full of bodies frozen in space but, once guided into position, most of the visitors reported feeling an overwhelming sense of wellbeing. "I started seeing the sky - the clouds in the sky - in the white of the wall," said Chester, a TV producer who had skipped work to attend the opening. "It was a religious experience. I think you'd have to sum it up as that." Abramovic says the performance will evolve over the course of its 10-week run. "Maybe it's complete silence, maybe we all scream together, maybe we all lie on the floor. "Everything is there, in possibility. We need the public, we need me, and we need chemistry." 512 Hours runs at the Serpentine Gallery in London until 25 August.	Audience members were moved to tears at the opening of Marina Abramovic's new show at London's Serpentine Gallery.
The Crucible's production of Show Boat and its new musical Flowers for Mrs Harris are both up for best musical. Paapa Essiedu, the Royal Shakespeare Company's first black Hamlet, is in the running for best performance in a play. Sir Ian McKellen will receive a special prize at this year's event, to be held at London's Guildhall on 9 October. Previous recipients of the outstanding contribution to British theatre award include Sir Peter Hall, choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne and actor Simon Callow. Clare Burt is nominated for best performance in a musical for Flowers for Mrs Harris, which was adapted from a 1958 novel by Paul Gallico. Daniel Evans directed both Flowers for Mrs Harris and Show Boat, which transferred to the West End in April. He has since left Sheffield Theatres to become artistic director of Chichester Festival Theatre. Chichester's exuberant summer production of Half a Sixpence is up for two awards ahead of its West End transfer next month. Actress Lesley Manville, host of this year's awards ceremony, said she "looked forward to celebrating a year of artistic achievement". The full list of nominations is as follows: Theatregoers have until 12:00 BST on 19 September to cast their vote for the UK's most welcoming theatre.

The Italy player had reportedly been linked to a reunion with ex-Juve manager Antonio Conte at Chelsea. The 29-year-old joined the Serie A champions from Bari in 2010 and has since made 291 appearances. In that time he has won five consecutive league titles, two Italian cups and reached the Champions League final in 2015.	Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci has signed a contract extension that will keep him at the club until 2021.
Evie Markham, 18, from Albrighton in Shropshire, made it to the embassy in Kathmandu on Friday evening only to be told it was closed, her mother said. Sue Markham said her daughter was now safe in a hostel. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said it was looking into her case. In a statement, a spokesperson said FCO teams were "working around the clock" to to help British nationals in Nepal and had assisted more than 350 people, arranging flights for 140 of them. Sue Markham, however, said her daughter had received "no help whatsoever" after arriving at Kathmandu airport. "Most countries had representatives there taking people to the embassies and sorting them out," she said. "Evie got there and there were no British people out there at all. She made her way to the embassy and was told it was closed. "They said 'our doors are closed, we work nine to five'. "She's 18 and on her own completely. When she got upset they got her inside and gave her a drink and a Snickers bar and that's all the help she's had." Evie has been on a gap year since September, visiting a number of countries. "She met up with some people she'd previously met in Cambodia and she decided to join them trekking to Everest base camp," Mrs Markham said. She said her daughter had just left base camp when the earthquake struck a week ago. "They had to run for their lives to a village, where they stayed for a couple of days. "Food was running low and and they had no access to money, so they decided to trek to Lukla, nine hours away, which was quite hazardous." With no access to money, a British man she met at Lukla airport stepped in and offered to pay the $130 for her flight to Kathmandu. Mrs Markham said her daughter was now safe and hoped to fly back to the UK on Monday or Tuesday. She said she had spoken to the FCO and would be lodging a formal complaint. The FCO said it was still heavily involved supporting British nationals in Nepal. "Helicopter airlifts continue to assist Brits in remote areas. We have emergency response teams working to locate British nationals and they have assisted several groups in the mountains over the past 48 hours," a spokesperson said. "An RAF C-17 is on its way to Kathmandu and will take British nationals out of Nepal and to New Delhi."	A woman whose daughter was travelling around Nepal when the earthquake struck has said she was shocked at the lack of support from the British embassy.
The partnership running the current system in Rhyl, Prestatyn and Rhuddlan say it is not sustainable and has agreed to pass it to Cheshire West and Chester council. The scheme will see 32 prioritised cameras beamed to England. If anything is spotted, officers will alert North Wales Police immediately. The system in the towns was run and funded by Denbighshire council until 2015. County council spending cuts saw it passed to a partnership of Denbighshire, three town councils and North Wales Police about a year ago for a trial period. In the last 12 months, the cameras have been operational 24 hours a day but have not been monitored full-time, with crime figures in the area remaining much the same. The network's server at Rhyl police station is said to be beyond its serviceable lifetime and, with a replacement costing about Â£80,000, grants are being sought. The partnership board prioritised 32 cameras in the three towns according to their importance in tackling crime and disorder and their contribution to the community. Ranked as lower priority, the remaining 48 cameras will not be repaired or replaced if they break.	The monitoring of CCTV cameras in three north Wales towns will be handed across the border to Chester.
The actor was charged with culpable homicide in Mumbai for the September 2002 incident. Mr Khan has always denied he was at the wheel. If convicted, he faces 10 years in prison. Mr Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films. Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits. Late on the night of 28 September 2002, his Toyota Land Cruiser hit the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say. The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the street, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries. The prosecution has alleged that Mr Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk. In March the actor told the court he was not drunk and was not driving the car. But many witnesses have said that was not the case. A constable attached to Mr Khan's security said in a statement to the police that the "drunk" actor had lost control of the car. The policeman died in 2007 of tuberculosis. In April, Mr Khan's driver told the court that he had crashed the car after a tyre burst. At the scene, Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Mumbai It's not uncommon most days to find people camped outside the house of Salman Khan hoping for a glimpse of the star. But on Wednesday morning dozens of journalists and fans gathered as they waited for the actor to leave on the way to court. Even Mr Khan's father was ambushed as he went on a morning stroll along the seafront encircled by security guards - proof this is a case that has gripped Bollywood and wider India.	An Indian court is due to rule on whether Bollywood star Salman Khan is guilty of running over five men sleeping on a pavement, killing one.
Mohammed al-Barghathi earlier said he had decided to step down in the wake of the recent sieges by armed groups of the justice and foreign ministries. But he was subsequently told by Prime Minister Ali Zeidan not to present his resignation at a cabinet meeting. The gunmen had demanded parliament pass the Political Isolation Law, which bars Gaddafi-era officials from office. The General National Congress did so on Sunday despite criticism from human rights groups, who said the legislation was too vague because it potentially barred anyone who worked for the authorities between 1969, when Muammar Gaddafi came to power, and 2011, when he was ousted. Despite this, some gunmen have refused to withdraw from the ministries. Addressing a news conference in Tripoli on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Barghathi cited the sieges as the reason for offering his resignation. "I will never be able to accept that politics [can] be practiced by the power of weapons," he was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. "This is an assault against the democracy I have sworn to protect." However, Mr Zeidan's office later issued a statement saying: "The cabinet would like to clarify that the resignation was not officially presented to the prime minister. "The prime minister has asked the defence minister to renounce it and [he] has confirmed that he will continue his work and expressed his understanding of the present circumstances in the country." The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli notes that the Political Isolation Law will apply to Mr Barghathi when takes effect. He was commander of the air force in Benghazi before retiring on a government pension in 1994, The law could affect other senior members of the government, including the head of the General National Congress Mohammed al-Megaryef. He defected from Gaddafi's government in the 1980s after serving as Libya's ambassador to India. Gunmen who have remained at the foreign ministry - the first to be targeted on Sunday 28 April - said they were prepared to go but have not done so as yet, our correspondent says. The gunmen outside the justice ministry, which was surrounded last Tuesday, have said they are waiting to be replaced by official security forces, she adds. The various militias around the ministries have different allegiances. The Higher Revolutionary Council, which claims to represent various ex-fighters and is believed to control some of the armed groups, told the BBC it wanted to see the prime minister removed from office. Our correspondent says Mr Zeidan, who it seems will not be affected by the new law, recently described those behind the armed protest as the "losers" in last year's nationwide elections.	Libya's Defence Minister has withdrawn his offer to resign, hours after saying he was leaving his post.
They were brutal, inhuman regimes led by men with notorious reputations for violence and suppressing opposition - Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay, Jorge Rafael Videla in Argentina and so on. One of the great success stories across the region, in the intervening three or four decades, was how most of those dictatorships were driven out - usually by the overwhelming force of peaceful, popular pressure - and were replaced by elected democratic governments. The general consensus among observers, politicians and the Latin American public is that democracy is here to stay. That is certainly the case here in Brazil, a country that has grown into one of the world's top 10 economies, where vigorous political debate is the everyday norm and where, since the return of civilian rule in 1985, the army's place has unquestionably been back in the barracks. So, even in these times of social unrest and economic crisis in Brazil, there is no real threat of military intervention. But many people are describing the removal of the country's first female leader as a coup, albeit one carried out by politicians rather than generals. That is certainly how Dilma Rousseff herself sees things after a vote in the country's senate triggered her dismissal over charges that she illegally manipulated government accounts to hide the scale of the budget deficit. For Ms Rousseff the experience was not as physically painful as the torture and abuse she suffered as a prisoner under the former dictatorship, but she felt just as keenly a sense of injustice and abuse of power. Dilma Rousseff vigorously denied the charges which in the great scheme of things could be characterised as relatively minor. She has repeatedly described the process as a plot by her political opponents to force her from office, replacing without an election a leftist, socialist government with a centre-right, market-friendly alternative. In other words, say Ms Rousseff and her supporters also believe it was a coup. But if the term "coup" describes a sudden and illegal seizure of power, that is arguably not what happened in Brazil. Dilma Rousseff's removal was a long drawn-out legal affair, overseen by the country's Supreme Court. Impeachment is a provision laid out in the Brazilian constitution, as it is in many other democracies. As flimsy or irrelevant as many thought the charges were, the [now] former president was able to defend herself by legal argument and with counsel throughout. The law might be an ass, but it is still the law. Dilma Rousseff has never been formally accused of corruption or self-enrichment, unlike many of the men who have sat in judgment over her in the Brazilian Congress during the recent turbulent weeks and months. Nor has she been implicated in the wide-ranging "car wash" corruption scandal, involving the payment of billions of dollars in bribes in relation to contracts at the state controlled oil giant, Petrobras. Several senior politicians, including members of Ms Rousseff's own Workers Party, have been ensnared in the scandal. One widely-held belief is that the overriding concern for Brazil's well-heeled political elite is to find a way of shutting down or, emasculating, the corruption investigation before it goes any deeper. Fernando Gabeira, once a left-wing senator but who now commentates on Brazilian politics says what has happened is "good for Brazil". "The rules were obeyed, the constitution was considered and it means that Brazil's democracy will be stronger than before." Others, including Gleisi Hoffman, a former minister in the last Rousseff government disagree. She described the removal of a democratically elected leader as  "a sordid and lamentable affair". Dilma Rousseff's biggest mistake, and perhaps the real reason that she was impeached, was her unwillingness or inability to make the deals and alliances necessary to run an effective government in Brazil's fractured multi-party system. Her last two years in office have been plagued by an economy in recession, rising inflation and unemployment. Brazilians have become worried that many of the gains made in the first 10 years of Workers Party rule could be lost under her stewardship, in stark contrast to the years of plenty, fuelled by high oil prices, overseen by her more charismatic, politically astute and but perhaps less scrupulous predecessor, President Lula da Silva. In the shape of Ms Rousseff's replacement and former deputy, Michel Temer, Brazil now has a centre-right president who has promised to protect the popular social programmes introduced by the Rousseff/Lula governments. But, vowing to get the country's broken economy back on track, Mr Temer is also looking to cut government budgets and change priorities. It is a familiar conundrum and within an hour of being sworn in, the new leader was flying to China for the G-20 summit. Brazilian democracy has been damaged and sullied in the eyes of many by what happened in Brasilia. Back-stabbing, betrayal and the ever-present spectre of corruption? Yes.  But a coup?  Probably not.	Back in the 1970s, when I first lived in Latin America and was hooked by a fascination for this region that has never left, virtually every country here was ruled by a military dictatorship.
That is the eye-catching accusation in the Guardian, following a report in a trade publication, the Bookseller. Amazon will not confirm that it has managed to do this. The accusation hinges on the fact that since 2006, its UK business has been a subsidiary of its European headquarters in Luxembourg. As a result, anyone buying anything from Amazon in the UK makes a payment to the retailer in Luxembourg, with the profits taxed there rather than here. That is despite the fact that Amazon employs hundreds of staff in the UK, at several large depots, selling tens of millions of items each year to millions of UK customers. "Amazon EU serves tens of millions of customers and sellers throughout Europe from multiple consumer websites in a number of languages, dispatching products to all 27 countries in the EU," Amazon said. "We have a single European headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation." Campaigners against tax avoidance arrangements - which are in fact quite legal - have taken a very dim view of all this. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said the government had turned a blind eye to this sort of thing and was even encouraging it. "I severely criticise our tax authorities for putting up with this sort of arrangement," he said. "It is part of our "open for business" agenda - we will let a multinational company do what it likes, so long as they put some jobs in the UK, but we won't ask for tax." In fact, HMRC has long had a specialist unit of 1,200 tax inspectors dealing just with the affairs of the 770 biggest companies. It is called the Large Business Service for firms with a turnover of Â£600mn or more, or assets of Â£2bn or more. "We can't discuss Amazon for legal reasons, but HMRC applies the tax laws as they apply to multinationals so the UK receives the tax revenues to which it is legally entitled," HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) said. "Where there is a high risk of the UK losing out, we move our resources to challenge that risk," it added. When it comes to multinationals and tax authorities arguing about how much tax should be paid, and to whom, the arguments often last for years, frequently hinging on a concept known as transfer pricing. This occurs when a division of a multinational in one country charges a division of the same firm in another country for the supply of a product or a service. This is sometimes criticised as a technique in which artificially high charges are levied internally, with the aim of siphoning money from a firm's business in a high-tax country to a low-tax one. There is nothing new in this problem and the issue hit the headlines in the UK as far back as the 1970s. There is now a lot of legislation to stop transfer pricing being abused, but in the end, there may be no right answer to how much tax is owed by a firm, and a settlement can all come down to haggling. One tax adviser at a leading firm of accountants - who wished to remain anonymous - said it was wrong to suggest the UK tax authorities were just sitting on their hands, watching taxable income move abroad. "There are some very bright people at HMRC scrutinising these sorts of things, it is wrong to assume we are lax at policing this." Another commonplace technique for multinationals to lower their tax bills - a variation on the transfer pricing theme - is for the head office in one country to charge all the national subsidiaries a large fee for "management services", such as accounting. If the fee is legitimate, then it is an allowable expense and can be set against a national division's profits to reduce its tax bill, while cash is transferred from that outpost to the head office. Ronnie Ludwig, a tax adviser at Edinburgh accountants Saffery Champness, says the arrangement is commonplace. "It is perfectly legal for a company to levy a management fee on a subsidiary," he says. "The question is whether it is proportionate and reasonable in relation to the actual services provided - the companies will be asked by the HMRC exactly what they are doing to justify the fees," he added. For its part, Amazon says in its accounts that it may have to pay an extra $1.5bn in back taxes in the US if it loses various transfer pricing disputes with the tax authorities there, going back to 2005. Amazon's accounts, filed at the United States chief financial regulator, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also make it clear that is facing investigations of some sort from several other national tax authorities. "We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom [and France]," the accounts say. As a result, the company has set aside $229m to pay any extra tax bills that may now arise from these. "Everyone of these jurisdictions is going to be very jealous of its entitlements to get tax," says Philip Spencer, a tax partner at accountants BDO. "It is commonplace to have lots of investigations on the go at any one time." Multinational firms will inevitably look for a good central site to administer their businesses in a region, not just for a low-tax regime, but to get good staff and enjoy good communications. It all makes life easier. Philip Spencer at BDO points out that a key advantage of a country like Luxembourg is that it also has a good network of double-taxation treaties with other countries. These regulate the taxation of cash flowing from business activity in one country to another. "Luxembourg is very favourable, it has lots of these treaties, which help avoid having to pay tax in one country and then reclaim it if tax is also levied in a second country." A key feature in all this is that the internationalisation of business has been give a huge boost by the advent of the internet and online trading. And this has made life increasingly hard for national tax authorities to deal with. "What everyone is grappling with is e-commerce," says John Whiting, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT). "Everyone can see that firms like Amazon are making a shedload of profits - the question is where the profits were made."	Has the giant online retailer Amazon managed, quite legally, to avoid paying any corporation tax at all to the UK in the past year?
Kuba Moczyk, 22, died in hospital after he was knocked out in an unlicensed fight at the Tower Complex, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 19 November. A memorial mass has been held at St Mary's Church in the town. Father Philip Shryane told the congregation Mr Moczyk' was a "good man" whose "life was boxing". More on this story and others from Norfolk He said Mr Moczyk was "a young man with a good heart, with so much to give and so much to look forward to... but always a gentle smile". His uncle, Marcin Smigaj gave a tribute, in Polish, on behalf of the family. Mr Moczyk was due to be cremated. Mr Moczyk, originally from Poland, worked at a chicken factory and lived in the town. His trainer Scott Osinski said earlier that Mr Moczyk was winning the fight when he took the fatal blow. His opponent is believed to be aged 17.	Friends and family of a boxer with a "gentle smile", who died after being knocked out in his first fight, have attended a memorial mass.
Revenue rose to $20.26bn (Â£14bn) between January and March, from $17.26bn a year earlier. But Alphabet's share price fell about 6% in after-hours trading, as the revenue figure fell short of analysts' expectations. Net income for the quarter was $4.2bn, up from $3.5bn a year ago. The earnings report came one day after the European Commission issued formal antitrust charges against Google over claims that it abuses the dominant market position of its Android operating system. Google's advertising revenue jumped 16.2% in the first quarter to $18.02bn. The company said the number of ads, also known as paid clicks, jumped 29%. But the average price of online ads, known as cost-per-click, fell 9% in the quarter. Ruth Porat, chief financial officer at the parent company Alphabet, said the first quarter results represented a "tremendous start to the year", and that the company is "thoughtfully pursuing big bets and building exciting new technologies" which she hopes will put the company in a good position for long term growth. Google embarked on a restructuring drive late last year and created a new parent company - Alphabet. Under the rebranding, Google retained its best-known businesses, such as search, apps, YouTube and Android. Some of the newer entities, such as the investment and research divisions, the "smart-home" unit Nest, and the drone arm will be run under Alphabet.	Alphabet - Google's parent company - has reported a 17% rise in quarterly revenue after strong advertising sales on mobile devices.
The Military Reaction Force was the subject of a BBC Panorama programme last November. Former members said the unit had shot people who may have been unarmed. The PSNI investigation has found none of the men featured "admitted any criminal act or being involved in any of the incidents portrayed". In a statement,  the PSNI said: "Detectives from Serious Crime Branch have studied the contents of a BBC Panorama programme broadcast last year into the activities of the MRF. "Although there does not appear to be any admission to criminality by individuals featured in the programme, it will form part of an HET review into all deaths linked to soldiers. "This review will begin when HET resumes its work in the near future." The unit was disbanded in 1973, after 18 months. The plain-clothes soldiers carried out round-the-clock patrols in Belfast in unmarked cars. Three former members of the unit talked to Panorama. They said they had been tasked with "hunting down" IRA members in Belfast. When asked if on occasion the MRF would make an assumption that someone had a weapon, even if they could not see one, one of the former soldiers replied "occasionally". "We didn't go around town blasting, shooting all over the place like you see on the TV, we were going down there and finding, looking for our targets, finding them and taking them down," he said. "We may not have seen a weapon, but there more than likely would have been weapons there in a vigilante patrol." One of the soldiers said they were "not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group". Solicitor Padraig Ã“ Muirigh represents families who believe their relatives were killed by the MRF. He said police should further investigate the soldiers' claims. "They very openly and brazenly admitted that they were in a terror gang, that they acted outside the rule of law, that they also acted outside of the yellow card rule," he said. "They also admitted being involved in fatal incidents in which people may not have been armed. "I think all of that and that very high-profile Panorama programme pointed in the direction that there should have been further investigation of these matters. "Unfortunately it appears that the PSNI have not done that, despite the request from the director of public prosecutions."	Families of people allegedly killed by an Army undercover unit have been told former members of the unit who appeared on TV admitted no crimes.
Twenty-one animals had first beached at Staffin on Monday afternoon. Most of the whales were saved but 10 then went on to strand themselves on rocks on nearby Staffin Island. Eight whales died including a female and her new born calf. The stranding is thought to have been triggered by the female having problems while calving.	A group of long-finned pilot whales that became stranded on rocks off Skye were able to return to open water with help from rescuers on Tuesday evening.
Alexander Reid repeatedly told Department of Work and Pensions staff in application forms and at interviews that he was single. But in reality he was living with his wife Kathleen Reid, despite having claimed to be separated. Reid was found guilty following a trial at Dundee Sheriff Court. The 59-year-old, from Dundee, had denied a charge under the Social Security Administration Act that he fraudulently claimed employment support allowance and income support totalling £39,808. Defence solicitor John Boyle asked that Reid be spared jail and given a community payback order as an alternative to a prison sentence. Sheriff Tom Hughes told Reid: "Because of the sum of money involved a custodial sentence is the only option."	A man who fraudulently claimed nearly £40,000 in benefits over the course of almost 11 years has been jailed for 18 months.
Voters in Bassetlaw District Council take to the polls to elect a third of the north Nottinghamshire authority. Labour currently has an overwhelming majority on the council but admitted its biggest fear is UKIP. The Conservative group is hoping to increase its share and go someway to returning to its only period in power. The Lib Dems have six candidates. Labour has controlled the council for decades apart from two brief periods in the 1970s and then again about eight years ago. The area of Bassetlaw is divided in two by the A1 with the Labour heartland of Worksop to the west and the more Conservative Retford to the east. Despite being in Nottinghamshire economically it looks to its large neighbour in Sheffield, rather than the distant county town of Nottingham. It prides itself on being the birthplace of the United States of America - three of the first four signatories to the Mayflower Compact were from Bassetlaw. Labour's John Mann has been MP for Bassetlaw since 2001. That was towards the end of Tony Blair's leadership when the party was unpopular nationally, even in the former coal-mining heartland of Bassetlaw. The Conservatives enjoyed several years in power but in 2011 the council returned to red and this is the first election where it faces a serious challenge from UKIP. "Our biggest worry is UKIP," councillor Griff Wynne said. "This is the first time they have entered candidates in every ward. "They are targeting Labour seats for the first time and they are an unknown quantity." Mr Wynne, deputy leader of the council, said the main issue though is to convince people to vote at all. Former leader of the council and the Conservatives Mike Quigley is hoping to win back a seat after he lost two years ago. "The problem with local politics is that people tend to be driven on what's happening nationally," he said. "We took control when Labour was doing pretty badly nationally and I think that's often how people vote." UKIP is hoping to capitalise on the party's popularity nationally and is the only party to field a candidate in every ward, hoping to build support for future European elections. Roger Vernon said: "We did quite well in the county council elections last year, which isn't bad considering we [the local branch] were only formed in March. "We are up against a strongly entrenched Labour party, we realise it is a hard race for us to row." The Liberal Democrats have not had a councillor in Bassetlaw for more than 10 years. A total of 54 candidates are fighting for 16 seats including two independents.	A dyed-in the wool Labour council is facing UKIP in every ward for the first time in Thursday's election.
His solicitor Julia Cooper has asked Surrey Police to explain a statement that he had confessed to the murder. Bellfield, 47, was given a whole-life prison sentence in June 2011 for murdering the schoolgirl. Surrey Police confirmed it had received a letter from Bellfield's solicitors but said it was standing by its statement on the confession. Milly was kidnapped while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Ms Cooper said Bellfield, now known as Yusuf Rahim, believed a "covert tape" may have been used to record his response to a police interview in prison. She said "my client denies giving a confession". She has written to Surrey Police requesting the tape recording and notes from the meeting. Ms Cooper said Bellfield contacted her very soon after Surrey Police distributed its press statement relating to the Dowler case. She said Bellfield denies all the crimes for which he has been convicted. Last month, Surrey Police revealed Bellfield had made the admission during an investigation into whether he had an accomplice involved in the abduction and rape, but not murder, of Milly. The force said it stood by its original statement. A police source speaking to the BBC would not comment on how the admission was recorded. Milly's body was found 25 miles away from where she was kidnapped, in Yateley Heath, Hampshire. Experts could not say how she died. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and murdering the teenager following a trial at the Old Bailey where a judge described him as a "cruel and pitiless killer". He was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, 18, when he went on trial accused of killing Milly. He lived 50 yards from where Milly vanished but did not become a suspect until he was arrested by police in London for the other crimes in 2004. On Wednesday, the Dowler family revealed harrowing details of Milly's final hours, saying they had been made aware of her suffering last year after Bellfield had spoken to police.	Serial killer Levi Bellfield has denied confessing to the abduction, rape and killing of 13-year-old Milly Dowler.
Media playback is not supported on this device Asked if Saturday's opponents have scrummaged illegally during the tournament, England head coach Eddie Jones said: "100%. Terribly illegally." Jones says his side have a stronger scrum, adding if the laws are enforced England "will get an advantage". Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde highlighted England's Joe Marler is a frequent infringer at the scrum. "He definitely needs to scrummage legally otherwise we will be pointing our finger," said McBryde. Wales, who are one point behind Six Nations leaders England with two games remaining, felt harshly done by at the scrum in their 28-25 win over England in the pool stage of last year's World Cup. And McBryde said loose-head Marler had been "found out" when England lost to Australia in their next World Cup game. "There was a big focus on the loose-heads' angles, particularly with [Wales prop] Gethin Jenkins being highlighted," said McBryde. "So we were very disappointed in that England game to fall on the wrong side of decisions and we felt the problem lay elsewhere." However, Jones says he is "quite upset" by Wales' approach to the set-piece. "They play the laws very well," the Australian told BBC Radio 5 live. "They pre-engage all the time, which is against the laws of the game. "And then they get penalised one or two times at the start of the game, but the referee gets sick of penalising it. "Because if the referee keeps penalising it, you know what happens? The referee gets criticised. "We really want to have a scrum contest on Saturday - it's an important part of the game - so we are really hopeful the referee enforces the law in that area." Jones added: "If you are the referee and you keep penalising Wales for pre-engaging, then all the smart guys in the commentators' box say 'this referee is ruining the game'. "But they are not ruining the game, it's the team that is scrummaging illegally which is ruining the game. "So we want the referee to be really hard, and if he has to ruin the game, he has to ruin the game."	England and Wales have accused each other of illegal scrummaging before the Six Nations showdown at Twickenham.
A number of leading politicians have stepped down from their positions within the Northern Ireland Executive including Peter Robinson who was the First Minister. The Northern Ireland Executive is a power-sharing government made up of ministers from the five biggest parties. Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, who represents the UK government, is now holding talks with all of the different parties to see if they can continue to work together to run the country. She expects the talks to take up to six weeks. The crisis has come about after a murder which the police say was carried out by the IRA - they were an armed group who wanted Northern Ireland to be part of a united Ireland separate from the UK. Sinn Fein is one of the biggest political groups in Northern Ireland. It traditionally had links to the IRA. The leaders of Sinn Fein insist that the IRA have "gone away". It's not clear what will happen if the political parties can not come to agreement. There might have to be a new election. At the moment people living in Northern Ireland won't be noticing any differences to their day to day services like schools and rubbish collections. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that he wants the talks to resolve the problems as soon as possible.	Politicians in Northern Ireland are holding talks over the next month to prevent the collapse of the government.
The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95% compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than Â£10,000 a year. The introduction is a gradual process with 66% of employees now signed up. The latter stages are widely seen as the most challenging as employees such as nannies, care workers, plumbers and bar staff are enrolled into a pension. This means employers who only have one or two staff may need to add a pensions policy to their pay and conditions. This group represents more than a third of those who will be required to comply with the rules from now. Employees have the option to opt out of saving. The auto-enrolment system was started in 2012, and aimed to ensure that workers save to enable them to top-up their state pension on retirement. This has reversed falls in workplace pension saving. The full roll-out is taking years to complete, but MPs and regulators have welcomed a successful take-up by workers and compliance by employers - both of whom pay into the pension pot. "The compliance rates achieved have been consistently at the top of our expectations and the savings landscape has been transformed. But we know the job is not yet done and there are still significant challenges ahead," said Charles Counsell, executive director for automatic enrolment at the Pensions Regulator. Those challenges include a question over whether enough is being put into these pension pots. There is concern that some workers may feel that the pensions box has been ticked, only later to find that their pension does not offer them the standard of living they are expecting. New figures from the Pensions Regulator show that the average contribution from employers is 3% a year of an employee's salary. Steve Webb, now director of policy at Royal London insurance company, was pensions minister when the system was created. He said such contribution rates were "woefully inadequate to provide a decent retirement". "The fact that the average employer contribution rate among firms so far is just 3% shows the mountain that we have to climb," he said. "Getting the combined rate of contributions from employers and employees to realistic levels as quickly as possible should be the central focus of the 2017 review of automatic enrolment.  Without this, millions of workers in generations to come will simply be unable to afford to retire." Minimum contribution rates will increase from 2% to 5% in April 2018, and from 5% to 8% in April 2019. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: "We want to make it as easy as possible for businesses to manage automatic enrolment which is why we made the decision to gradually increase the amount employers contribute to workplace pensions. We also know that people will need to save more and we will be considering how to get people to do this as part of our 2017 review." Concerns also remain about certain trusts that administer these pensions for small firms, as revealed by a BBC investigation.	More than six million workers have now been signed up automatically to a pension savings scheme but fears remain over how much is being set aside.
Trafford Council closed Bollin Primary School in Bowdon, Greater Manchester on Monday after concerns about a "reduced capacity of senior leadership". The council said the school had appointed an interim head teacher and it would reopen for Key Stage 2 pupils on Thursday. Other classes will return in the next few days, said the council. It follows a strike by teachers on Thursday, supported by some parents who demonstrated outside school. The school has appointed Kylie Spark as interim head teacher while Michelle Brindle was "not in school", the council said. There are no details about how long Mrs Spark, of Sale's Tyntesfield Primary School, will be in post. A number of staff have been neutrally suspended while investigations continue into a video purporting to show teaching staff at a party making comments about Ms Brindle. Trafford Council added it has applied to the Department for Education for approval for an interim executive board consisting of experienced governors. One parent of a pupil at the school, which was rated as "outstanding" in its last Ofsted inspection, said she was worried many of the teachers will not return. Julie Saunders said: "That is massively disruptive and upsetting for the children. "It is not just a building with a few supply teachers; a school is a community which knows and understands the kids." Sean Anstee, leader of Trafford Council, said he understood parents' concerns and the council had been working with the governing body to resolve issues. He added: "We are doing everything we can to reopen the school and return it to the wonderful school we know it to be." Key Stage 1 pupils will be invited back into school on Friday and early years pupils will return on Monday. A petition of no confidence in Ms Brindle has been signed by more than 900 people. The head teacher told the BBC she did not want to comment. The school teaches more than 200 pupils from the age of three to 11.	A school shut by council bosses days after a staff strike over workloads is to have a "phased" reopening.
Pop Recs Ltd hosted in-store gigs by acts from Franz Ferdinand to James Bay. It also earned the group an award for Britain's hardest-working band from the Association of Independent Music. Drummer Dave Harper, who runs the shop, is now looking for a new site. "We need to be somewhere else," he said. "Not existing is not an option." The band opened Pop Recs Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few bricks-and-mortar stores left to sell it. Housed in the city's former tourist information office, it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks. But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists. It also became a community hub, hosting regular music tuition plus poetry, stitching and toddler groups. Now, however, they have moved out after Sunderland City Council, which owned the building, sold it for student flats. Pulled Apart By Horses played the shop's final gig on Saturday. Harper said he was looking at one possible new premises, and that comments from the shop's regulars had made him realise it was important to reopen. Things like the poetry group, which has 40 members, and the Saturday morning "stitch and bitch", will "stop happening here", Harper said. "That's absolutely terrifying because, if you walk around this city, and if you don't want baked pastry goods or go to a charity shop or cash a cheque or put a bet on, I don't know what people do. "I'm standing here with grease on my hands and I hadn't cried for years until I realised this place was done, and people were saying pleasant things about it. It's really driven home so acutely what this place has meant to people." Members of shop's the regular meetings have told him that the groups help with their mental health problems, he said. "They feel comfortable here and they don't feel comfortable anywhere else that's state sponsored or medication related," he said. "I didn't know we were doing this. "People have just come and told us recently, and that was infinitely more upsetting, yet satisfying, that we were achieving things we didn't even realise under our own noses." The band have always known the council was trying to sell the building, Sunderland City Council's cabinet secretary Councillor Mel Speding said. "That has now been secured with its development into student accommodation. "This is in line with council objectives to see more people living and working in the city centre and, in the interests of council tax payers in these financially challenging times for local authorities, it secures a capital receipt. "Naturally, with the success and popularity of Pop Recs, the council and others have been looking at ways and means of continuing and securing a similar venture elsewhere in the city centre."	A record shop opened by indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings in their home town of Sunderland two years ago has shut after the premises was sold.
Stella has spent a number of years travelling to a variety of countries, working as a nanny and teaching French to children. Her latest job has taken her to Saudi Arabia. "I've shot neon in a lot of locations," says Stella. "But it's the way it is used in Saudi which interested me the most. Partly because of the way it looks aesthetically in that environment - the empty roads and pitch-black desert sky give it a very stark appearance, and partly because, as Saudi friends have explained to me, it has a real cultural significance there. "Light is very spiritually important, but we also forget that it's a very young country - within any family, you'll have older generations who remember a time before they even had electricity. So now that it's arrived, there's a real love for, and status attached to, this kind of artificial light. "It feels more powerful in a country which is predominantly open desert - it's pitch dark in a lot of Saudi at night, with these vast, beautiful skies. In that environment, a neon light travels a huge distance and feels very powerful. It's like a modern version of the campfire." Stella is self-taught, having been given a camera for her 30th birthday - but she notes that once she starts to photograph a subject, she usually keeps going until she can get it out of her system before moving on to something new. And once she had noticed the neon,  she set about taking lots of pictures. "I was asking my driver in Saudi about it, and he liked the idea of my project so agreed to drive me around in the evening," she says. "I had a break when the people I worked with went for their meal to break the fast during Ramadan, so the streets were pretty empty. "That suited me, because I was more interested in looking at the actual physical geography of the place. So we went out every night, drove around until I saw something which looked right, and then we shot very quickly - there was no real set-up or off-camera lighting. It was just a case of me getting out of the car, shooting, then getting back in." Stella was also keen to avoid what she sees as the visual cliches people often fall into when photographing the country. She says: "I felt really lucky that I got to travel there and see it. I wanted to take pictures which captured how I felt when I was there, and the neon did that. I hope the photos give other people an insight into what the real country behind the headlines is like as well." NOUR by Celine Stella is published by No UFOs.

Bright neon strips of light that punctuate the dark skies of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia caught the eye of Celine Stella, who set out to photograph them whenever she had a spare moment.
According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed "the Cinderella cancer". "We just don't make enough of it" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. "On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked". Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. "What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour." But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. "It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer," says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. "That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years". If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. "The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery" says Prof Neal. "It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient".	It's a sobering thought for all us carriers of the Y chromosome, but prostate cancer kills almost as many men every year as breast cancer does women.
US researchers say the slow-is-more-accurate rule generally applies. In a series of calculations, they looked at the physics behind releasing a projectile with the human arm. Their equations suggest a slow underarm throw is the best strategy for getting a piece of paper into a nearby bin. Lead researcher Madhusudhan Venkadesan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Yale University, said faster throws tend to be less accurate. This is because the ball travels in a nearly straight line, so any errors in the angle at which the object is released tend to be amplified. In slow and curved flight paths, small errors in the angle of release have little effect, he said. "What we find is that almost the slowest arc is often the most accurate," said Dr Venkadesan. "We've compared these calculations to published data of people throwing into wastebaskets; we've compared it to a study in dart throwing." In sports such as basketball or darts, the strategy depends on conditions and the trade-off needed between speed and accuracy. For example, experienced darts players throw overarm at about 5.5 metres per second, optimally releasing the dart 17 to 37 degrees before the arm becomes vertical. On the cricket pitch, fielders are more likely to strike the wicket with a fast underarm throw. And in basketball, the underhand free throw, nicknamed "the granny throw", has a marginal advantage over overhand, despite almost disappearing from the game. Accurate throwing is uniquely human - a skill relied upon by our ancient ancestors for hunting with spears or stone tools. The researchers say monkeys also throw things, but they are really bad at it. The study is published in the journal, Royal Society Open Science. Follow Helen on Twitter.	Scientists have calculated the optimal strategy for throwing something accurately - whether it's a dart or a crumpled-up piece of paper.
The app samples wireless signals to see if data is flowing uninterrupted from routers to phones and tablets. The app is released alongside research which suggests wi-fi in six million homes and offices is not running as fast as it could do. The app also provides tips to help people spot what might be slowing down their wi-fi speed. Interference could come from other electronic devices such as baby monitors, microwaves or Christmas fairy lights, said Ofcom in a statement. Statistics about home wi-fi speeds are in Ofcom's 2015 Connected Nations report that looks at the state of telecoms and wireless networks in the UK. The report said there had been "good progress" on the availability and use of telecoms services. About 27% of UK homes now have super-fast broadband that runs at speeds in excess of 30 Megabits per second (Mbps). Last year the figure was 21%. Super-fast broadband is now available to more than 83% of UK homes - up from 75% in the same period in 2014. The research also found that those with the higher speed connections to the net are doing more with them. People with faster connections were now making significant use of catch-up TV services, online film rental services and video calls, it said. Much of the UK's appetite for data was being driven by households that have the super-fast services, said Ofcom. However, despite the growing use of high-speed broadband it also acknowledged there was "still more to do". The research found that 2.4 million UK homes, about 8%, cannot get speeds of 10Mbps or more. Many of these homes were in rural areas. It also said broadband speeds needed to increase for those on the move and said small businesses were being particularly poorly served when it came to access to services of 10Mbps or more. About half of all small or medium-sized firms based in business parks do not have access to net links of such speeds.	Christmas tree lights can slow your wi-fi warns watchdog Ofcom as it releases an app that can check home broadband.
The Queen's cousin, 79, was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Monday after he suffered the injury while staying at Balmoral. He was seen walking to a waiting car with the help of a walking stick. The duke, who undertakes a large number of official royal engagements and has close associations with many charities, suffered a "mild stroke" in 2013. He is perhaps best known as president of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, in which capacity he has presented trophies to winners at Wimbledon. He is also grand master of the main organisation of Freemasons in England, the United Grand Lodge. He became Duke of Kent in 1942 at the age of six after his father, brother of King George VI, died in an RAF plane crash. Balmoral is the Scottish home of the Royal Family.	The Duke of Kent has left hospital following successful treatment for a dislocated hip.
The move showed the UK has no "real influence" over world events, Russia's foreign ministry said. Mr Johnson said events in Syria had "changed the situation fundamentally" and he would go to G7 talks instead. The UK deplored "Russia's continued defence of the Assad regime even after the chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians," he added. The foreign secretary said: "We call on Russia to do everything possible to bring about a political settlement in Syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated." Rather than travelling to Moscow to meet Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, he will now be travelling to Lucca, in Italy, for a G7 meeting, where he will call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull his troops from Syria. His Russian visit, which would have been the first by a UK foreign secretary in five years, was cancelled after discussions with the US, which is sending Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to Moscow to deliver a "clear and co-ordinated" message to the Kremlin. In a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said: "During Johnson's visit to Moscow there were plans to hold open and exhaustive talks on the entire spectrum of international problems, and also to discuss the state of Russo-British relations, which have, in essence, been forced into a dead end by the UK. "The decision to call off Johnson's visit to Moscow confirms once again doubts in the presence of added value in speaking to the UK, which does not have its own position on the majority of present-day issues, nor does it have real influence on the course of international affairs, as it remains 'in the shadow' of its strategic partners. "We do not feel that we need dialogue with London any more than it does." The Russian statement added that Mr Johnson's plan to "discuss Russian support for the Assad regime" with G7 partners showed a "fundamental misunderstanding or ignorance of what is happening in Syria, Russia's efforts to settle this crisis, and the purpose of diplomacy in general". Russia and Iran have condemned US air strikes against Syria as a violation of international law. The SNP's Foreign Affairs spokesman Alex Salmond joined in with the criticism of the foreign secretary on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, saying: "Boris Johnson just looks daft. "What is the argument for not going ahead with a visit? "Rex Tillerson is going on Wednesday so it can't be that we have moved to a Cold War position of no talking whatsoever. "And the idea that the foreign secretary can't be trusted because he might pursue his own line or have an independent thought or cross over what the Americans might say makes him look like some kind of 'mini-me' to the USA and that's not a position that any foreign secretary would want to be in." Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News the foreign secretary "should be in Moscow nowâ€¦ saying to the Russians just how appalling the situation is and the role they should play". He added: "We've got to be frank with them and we shouldn't just allow the Americans to go off and do that. We should be doing that ourselves." Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron claimed Mr Johnson was considered a diplomatic liability. "Boris has revealed himself to be a poodle of Washington, having his diary managed from across the pond," said Mr Farron. "It is pretty shameful when even Trump judges you to be a buffoon." A government source accused Mr Johnson's critics of playing politics. "It's a shame that some like Farron, Salmond and McDonnell put polls and politics above sorting out a civil war - it's very sad and shows how desperate they are," they said. BBC Political Correspondent Ben Wright said the criticism would not "unduly bother" Mr Johnson, who had spent the weekend calling counterparts, including the Germans. French and Italians, ahead of the G7 meeting. The foreign secretary would also be speaking to Mr Tillerson again, ahead of the US Secretary of State's visit to Moscow to agree a joint position on Syria. Mr Johnson's position was defended by International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who said the UK was working with the US and international partners on a co-ordinated response in the wake of US missile attacks on Syria. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: "This isn't just about one voice. "This is about the international community coming together and our foreign secretary is working with his American counterpart as that is the right thing to do." In January, Mr Johnson said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be allowed to run for election to remain in power and warned that Britain may have to "think afresh" about how to handle the crisis after failing to live up to its long-held position that the dictator must go. But sources insisted he has always believed Assad cannot remain in power. It comes as UK Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said Russia was to blame for "every civilian death" in the chemical weapons attack last week in Syria. Sir Michael, writing in the Sunday Times, said the Kremlin was responsible "by proxy" as the "principal backer" of the Assad regime.	Russia has criticised Boris Johnson's decision to scrap a planned trip to Moscow after discussions with the US.
Five out of six (84%) of those who voted in the ballot backed walkouts and the union said its leaders will now consider their next move. Destinations on the line include London, Aberdeen, Inverness and Hull. Virgin Trains responded to the result by saying it would run a full timetable during any RMT strike action. The two sides are in dispute over staffing changes, which the company says would have no impact on safety and no compulsory job losses. The union's general secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT will not sit back while nearly 200 members' jobs are under threat and also conditions and safety are put at risk." David Horne, managing director for Virgin Trains on the east coast, said: "With our guarantees that there will be no compulsory redundancies, no impact on safety and a full timetable in place during any action, we urge the RMT not to call a strike which will cost its members pay for no reason, and to rejoin us around the negotiating table."	Virgin East Coast rail workers have voted to go out on strike in a dispute over job cuts, working conditions and safety, the RMT union has said.
Mark McCarroll, a father-of-one, was working as a fork lift driver at Hayes Fuels depot in Belfast's Harbour estate when the accident happened. Hayes Fuels director Allister Hayes and risk manager Stanley Gibson both pleaded guilty at Belfast Crown Court Mr Gibson pleaded guilty to two charges, while Mr Hayes, on behalf of his company, pleaded guilty to charges of failing to ensure the safety of its employees and failing to ensure the safe storage of materials and objects. The family of Mr McCarroll, a 49-year-old grand-father, was present in court when details of the events surrounding his death were outlined to the court. A prosecution lawyer told the judge that on the day of the accident on 27 March 2013, heavy goods vehicle driver Brian Wilshaw was at the yard where his lorry was being loaded with mixed coals and briquettes. "Mr Wilshaw flagged down Mr McCarroll in his forklift truck and he put two of three full pallets of coal on the lorry,'' the prosecution lawyer said. "Mr McCarroll and Mr Wilshaw were in shed two on the premises calculating the number of briquettes on a slack pallet which had been already been picked up from the ground. "The full pallets needed by Mr Wilshaw were still in the shed and while he was engaged in gathering loose briquettes from this area, Mr McCarroll was standing on the slack pallet counting the bales. "Mr McCarroll pulled a bale out and had time to set this on the ground, at which stage, two pallet stacks fell on top of him. "Mr Wilshaw shouted a warning but Mr McCarroll was unable to avoid being hit.'' The court heard that medical assistance was called to the yard but Mr McCarroll died two days later on 29 March from chest and pelvic injuries. The judge was told that the Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland (HSENI) found a number of breaches by Hayes Fuels, including: HSENI said that Hayes Fuels should have used an overlapping or 'staircase' system to store pallets. The court was told that in September 2012, Hayes Fuels hired Stanley Gibson Partnership to advise them on health and safety issues and his company subsequently carried out an audit of the premises. The Stanley Gibson Partnership provided "numerous risk assessments'' to Hayes Fuels and lignite materials (briquettes) was intended to be included in the risk for solid fuels. "However, there is no account mentioned to matters such as the size of pallets how the pallet and load base varied or how the lignite pallets are to be stacked," the prosecution lawyer said. "It considered that the risk assessments and safety audit completed by Stanley Gibson Partnership were neither adequate nor sufficient.'' The court heard that Mr McCarroll's partner, Barbara Thompson, had "suffered both emotionally and financially from the loss of her long-term partner''. The prosecution lawyer added that his only son Christopher had suffered "disruption to his employment and sleep patterns in the wake of his father's untimely death''. The court heard the maximum penalty that could be imposed was an unlimited fine and/or two years in prison. However, the judge heard that fines in previous similar cases of a death of an employee at a workplace has ranged from £20,000 to £60,000. A lawyer for Mr Gibson told the judge: "I have read the victim impact statement and I want to publicly state just how devastated my client is that he has been in any way associated with or responsible for the tragic accident. "You cannot read those statements without recognising the impact this has had on his family. "He identified the problem on the premises but accepts he did not take the next step and complete his audit.'' A lawyer for Hayes Fuels said that on behalf of the company and Allister Hayes he wanted to "express their sincere apologies to the McCarroll family''. The judge adjourned sentencing for a month, and told the court: "This is a very tragic case and there is a great deal for me consider.''	One of Northern Ireland's fuel distributors has admitted breaching health and safety legislation in connection with the death of one of its employees.
Ashya was being treated in hospital in Southampton when his parents took him abroad without telling staff last year. They ignored medical advice and took him to Prague for proton beam therapy. It was later revealed Ashya did not receive subsequent chemotherapy in Prague, a move the team in Southampton say could jeopardise his recovery. Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Dr Peter Wilson, paediatric intensive care consultant at Southampton General Hospital, said: "We are unsure as to exactly what treatment he is receiving but what we do know is... every month that goes by that he's not getting chemotherapy, his outcome worsens. "There are experts in the country that have already quoted figures of halving survival - so survival going from 80% to 40% or 50%, which is quite dramatic." The Kings' version of events last year sparked a public outcry and staff members in Southampton said they received angry emails, letters and phone calls which, at one stage, forced the hospital to shut its switchboard. The King family, who in March said five-year-old Ashya was now cancer free, declined to be interviewed as part of the BBC programme. In March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Brett King told a national newspaper a recent scan showed "no evidence" of the tumour. But cancer experts have told the BBC although it appears Ashya is in remission it is far too early to say he has been completely cured. Oncology specialist Professor Karol Sikora said: "Ashya is not completely out of the woods yet, but 78% of children with this type of rare cancer actually survive and are cured. "The fact he is disease free at this point is great, but it doesn't mean he is cured yet." The breakdown in the relationship between Brett King and the hospital stemmed from his belief that Ashya should not receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy following surgery to remove a brain tumour. Mr King claimed in a YouTube video that staff threatened him with a court order if he refused Ashya's treatment, something the hospital has denied. He told journalists in Spain after his arrest: "They were going to kill him in England or turn him into a vegetable." Through the media, the King family raised tens of thousands of pounds for Ashya's treatment before the NHS agreed to pay for proton therapy in Prague. Dr Nicky Thorp, of the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group of paediatricians, said: "We were dismayed, but on reflection I can see why NHS England agreed to fund that child's case. The child was there, the child needed radiotherapy. "The use of protons does not improve cure rates of tumours... and it saddens me to see the way the truth can be twisted and misunderstood." In Prague, Ashya's parents refused the chemotherapy, which had been recommended by doctors and ordered by the High Court. But in March, four months after the proton treatment ended, Mr King said his son was cancer free. Paediatric oncology consultant Dr Ramya Ramanujachar, who was involved in Ashya's treatment, warned the case could set a worrying precedent. She said: "I don't think the parents can look after their own child with a brain tumour and be not only the carers but also the professionals directing, managing and dictating their child's treatment." Dr Wilson said the case had led to an "impossible situation" for clinicians faced with families in the same situation. "That is deeply unfair when the NHS is always supposed to be about equal healthcare for all," he added. Ashya: The Untold Story is to be broadcast on BBC1 in the South region on Friday at 19:30 BST.	Doctors and nurses who treated cancer patient Ashya King have criticised his parents while speaking out for the first time in a BBC documentary.
Yves Jego has launched a drive on the Change.org website calling for vegetarian alternatives to be compulsory in all schools. More than 73,000 people have so far backed the petition. The move comes after a town in eastern France banned all pork substitutes in school meals last week. The conservative mayor of Chalon sur Saone had earlier launched his own campaign on Change.org, reiterating France's secular values. His campaign has gained 2,750 supporters. "Messages of support and of encouragement have come from every corner of France and from French people of all backgrounds, faiths and professions," the mayor, Gilles Platret, wrote. A court in the city of Dijon last week rejected an appeal against Mr Platret's intention to ban pork substitutes. "Can we force a Catholic child to eat meat on Good Friday because nothing else is proposed, or a Jew or a Muslim to eat pork?," Mr Jego asked in his petition, set up in response to Mr Platret's. He said he would propose a law if the petition received 75,000 signatories. France insists on the separation of religion and the state, and in 2004 introduced a ban on headscarves in schools. France has five million residents of Muslim descent, half of whom are under the age of 24. It also has the largest Jewish population in Europe. A secular solution to the problem of school meals was possible, said Mr Jego, of the left-wing Radical Party. The petitions have led to a debate in some quarters on the nature of secularism and what is ethically correct. "Secularism is not the denial of religions and beliefs, but the respect of all religions," wrote Houari Zeidouni, who signed Mr Jego's petition. But France's Agriculture Minister, Stephane le Foll, wrote in a tweet: "Supporting French livestock with vegetarian menus: that's Yves Jego's programme! Let's be consistent."	A French MP is campaigning for vegetarian school meals to be introduced to help pupils whose religions prevent them eating pork.
Christine Lacson Abad, 27, of Cary, North Carolina, was charged with arranging a child sex offence, attempting to groom a 15-year-old in Wrexham and two more sex offences. But the Crown Prosecution Service said it was no longer pursuing the case. It said the decision followed further information from North Wales Police. A spokesman for the CPS added: "Having undertaken this review, it is not now considered that there is a realistic prospect of obtaining a conviction and accordingly, a decision has been made to stop the proceedings."	An American woman accused of travelling thousands of miles to commit a child sex offence in north Wales has been cleared after her case was dropped.
Indongo, unbeaten in 21 fights prior to this unification contest, forced his fellow 34-year-old on to the back foot for much of the fight. Burns rallied in the fifth and sixth rounds but the tall southpaw emerged a worthy winner. That was reflected in the judges' scoring - 120-108, 118-110, 116-112. "The better man won on the night, no excuses," said Burns. And no-one could argue. Media playback is not supported on this device This was Burns' third fight at the Hydro and 13th at world title level, while Indongo - "on a mission" from Namibia's president Hage Geingob - was fighting overseas for only the second time as a professional. On his first, in December, he knocked out IBF champion Eduard Troyanovsky in Moscow. It was clear from early in Saturday's fight that Indongo would try to use his greater height and reach to throw jabs at Burns' head, and he did this to good effect in the opening three minutes. Burns has started slowly in recent fights before finding his rhythm, and the Namibian began much the livelier, bouncing around the centre of the ring against a hesitant home fighter. Indeed, he looked to have won the first four rounds by dint of his greater work-rate and accuracy, though Burns was beginning to connect with his right. With their man having 47 bouts under his belt to Indongo's 21, the home fans may have wondered if the tactic was to use his experience to let his opponent tire himself out. Rounds five and six signalled an improvement in Burns' form, with his aggression rewarded as Indongo was forced backwards for the first time. The lead Indongo had built was thanks to the accumulation of cleaner shots rather than anything that badly hurt the Coatbridge fighter in his 17th year as a professional. And, though Burns was still strong in defence, by the time the ninth round had ended he must have realised he was trailing heavily on the scorecards. His task in the remaining three rounds had to be to stop Indongo for the first time in his nine-year career. That looked increasingly unlikely as he struggled to get inside to inflict damage. Too often he was over-stretching to land a meaningful shot, and when he did trouble Indongo his opponent snuffed out the attack with footwork and by holding on. It leaves Burns' dreams of a further unification bout against Terence Crawford in Las Vegas in tatters, though it would be a surprise if he was considering retiring. Ricky Burns: "He was so so awkward. He was a lot better than we thought he was going to be. He can hit as well. "I'm going to have all the doubters saying I'm finished - but I'll come again. "He started the rounds fast and the height and reach advantage meant he was out of my distance." Julius Indongo: "I feel very proud. My home crowd are watching. It's for the whole of Africa. This is so great. "I am very proud for opening my doors and now the world can see me." Adam Booth, David Haye's former trainer, on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: "It was pretty one-dimensional from Ricky Burns, who was trying to jump in from long distance on a fighter who was bigger, with longer arms and a heavy puncher. "Indongo was dominant, knew what he was about, kept swinging dangerous bombs and didn't let Burns in at all. "In the last two rounds, when he had the match won, he still wanted to dominate, and like true champions, wanted to get rid of his challenger. "He ticks all the right boxes. It is going to take a high-level operator to cope with him. I think Terence Crawford is that kind of guy."	Scotland's Ricky Burns failed to unify the super-lightweight division as his WBA title was taken by IBF and IBO champion Julius Indongo in Glasgow.
It wants to redress the balance from the university's walls being lined with pictures of "dead white males" by adding more women and ethnic minorities. The portraits include broadcasters Dame Esther Rantzen and Reeta Chakrabarti. Oxford's head of equality Trudy Coe said it was "sending a signal". This commissioning of portraits is one of the biggest projects by the university to create a more diverse range of people portrayed in its public places - including more women, people from ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians and people with disabilities. The university faced a high-profile controversy last year over whether a statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed - after claims that the Victorian colonialist's attitudes on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated. The new pictures on the ancient walls will include scientist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and author Jeanette Winterson. There will also be some men, including film maker Ken Loach. "We're not taking anyone down - but the portraits have been almost exclusively men and we're just beginning to redress the balance," says Ms Coe, head of the university's equality and diversity unit. "It will allow students to look up and see people who look like them. It's sending a signal to a wider range of students that they belong here," she says. Ms Coe says the new pictures will reflect the modern reality of university life - and the people who have been painted or photographed have been nominated by current staff and students. The people depicted have links with the university - such as being former students or academic staff - with the criteria that they were examples of excellence and widened the range of pictures from the "narrow and traditional" and "challenged stereotypes". Among the people to be represented will be criminologist and disability rights campaigner, Marie Tidball. "Symbols are important," she said. There are millions of people with a disability in the UK, Ms Tidball said, but they have a "lack of visibility in public spaces". The commissioning of a picture of an academic with a disability was a "very significant" step towards making sure that all kinds of students could feel at home at the university, she said. "I really hope that this speaks to kids now doing their GCSEs," said Ms Tidball. And she rejected suggestions of an excess of political correctness as "absolute nonsense". BBC journalist Reeta Chakrabarti said it was a project which reflected the university's current staff and living alumni. These are people who are "alive and kicking, a representation of modern day Britain," she said. "You could just continue to portray the same people, but it wouldn't be a reflection of how the university and society have changed," she said. "Different ages, different societies celebrate different values." As a student at Oxford, she said "there weren't many people there who were like me, from my sort of background". But she had an "overwhelmingly positive experience" and "nothing about Oxford made me feel out of place". Oxford University has faced questions about whether it is admitting enough poorer students and state-school pupils. Admissions figures published earlier this year showed that Oxford had one of the lowest proportions of state school pupils of any UK university. This showed that universities such as Bristol, Durham and Cambridge were admitting a higher proportion of state school pupils than Oxford. The new portraits:	Oxford University is revealing the identities of more than 20 people whose portraits will be put on display to try to "promote greater diversity".
The announcement was made on Sunday before the final round of this year's tournament at Portstewart. Keith Pelley, the European Tour's chief executive, said that the tournament's host Rory McIlroy had strongly endorsed the Inishowen peninsula venue. "Rory absolutely loves Ballyliffin," said Pelley, who described the venue as "stunning". "Some months ago, Rory and I spoke about the possibility of the Irish Open coming to Ballyliffin. "I have worked with athletes for 25 years and have never seen anybody who is more giving of his time than Rory. Having his name associated with the tournament is something we are proud of, and we do not take it for granted." The European Tour chief said that he played at Ballyliffin on Friday before checking out hotel accommodation in the area. "It's a fantastic venue - 36 outstanding holes. Then I drove around the region and visited the hotels. "The golf course is spectacular, but the support we will receive from the region will be similar to what we have received at Portstewart. "Donegal will definitely put on a great show and support us in every possible way." Media playback is not supported on this device Next year's Irish Open will be held from 5-8 July - two weeks before the Open at Carnoustie. Ballyliffin's bid for the tournament was framed as a cross-border initiative with strong backing being provided by both the local councils from Donegal and Derry & Strabane. The Donegal venue's Old Course staged the 2008 Irish Senior Open but next year's tournament will be staged on the 22-year-old Pat Ruddy-designed Glashedy links which will be lengthened to more than 7,400 yards for the event. With Sport Ireland also confirming Irish Government backing for the tournament in 2019 and 2020, the event seems certain to be played in the Republic of Ireland over the next three years although Ballyliffin is only a 35-minute drive from the city of Londonderry.	Ballyliffin in County Donegal will host the Irish Open for the first time in 2018.
The #BringBackOurGirls group should be ashamed of manipulating "the victims of terrorism", he said. Mr Jonathan had been due to hold his first meeting with some of the girls' parents on Tuesday. Islamist group Boko Haram captured more than 200 girls during a raid on their boarding school in Chibok in April. Mr Jonathan had been widely criticised for failing to meet distraught parents and not doing enough to rescue the girls. #BringBackOurGirls was a global campaign launched on social media to secure the release of the girls. Mr Jonathan agreed to the meeting on Monday following an appeal by Pakistani rights campaigner Malala Yousafzai. Mr Jonathan had planned to meet 12 parents and five girls who escaped shortly after being captured but the parents withdrew at the last minute without giving any reason. "Unfortunately, political forces within the Nigerian chapter of Bring Back Our Girls have decided to take this opportunity to play politics with the situation and the grief of the parents and the girls. They should be ashamed of their actions," he said in a statement. "Those who would manipulate the victims of terrorism for their own benefit are engaging in a similar kind of evil: Psychological terrorism," he added. Mr Jonathan's spokesman Doyin Okupe said the president was "extremely distraught". "He cannot understand this. He cannot fathom this - that Nigeria's mothers will do this type of thing for children," Mr Okupe said. Nigeria is due to hold presidential elections next year. Mr Jonathan has not yet declared his candidature, but speculation is rife that he intends to run for another term. Last year, he declared a state of emergency in the north-eastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, which are worst affected by the insurgency. All three are under opposition control. New York-based Human Rights Watch says more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in Nigeria this year by Boko Haram. The deaths occurred in around 95 separate attacks in more than 70 towns and villages in the north-east, where Boko Haram launched its insurgency in 2009.	Nigeria's president has accused activists of "playing politics" after his meeting with parents of the abducted schoolgirls was called off.
Michael Graydon, 29, disappeared on 21 February and his body was found almost two weeks later on private land. The inquest revealed authorities in Monaco kept his brain, heart and lungs after a post-mortem examination. The coroner said he could only record an open conclusion as the pathologist was unable to give a cause of death. Mr Graydon's mother, Jane Graydon, said: "We just feel terrible, I'm just back to the 21st of February because they've still got my son in Monaco." She added his body was kept for an autopsy in the UK for two weeks before being released to the family. This meant UK authorities were already aware body parts were missing ahead of the inquest. The family were told of the missing organs just before the hearing began. Sister-in law, Carly Billiau, said: "I feel very distressed. I feel that our family have been kept in the dark from the very start." She said her family had pushed for sniffer dogs to be used in the hunt for Mr Graydon but this did not happen for several days. Ms added: "Had they sent those dogs out in the days that we got there, and we pleaded with them, he would have been in a state where they would have been able to obtain that information and would have been able to give us some answers. "We are now left open, we have no closure, we have nothing." Mr Graydon went missing after being asked to leave a nightclub. He was tracked on CCTV running through the streets on his own and then walking near a church. It is thought he may have fallen through a hole in a wall whilst walking up some steps in the dark. He was on the French Riviera to watch a boxing match featuring Bristol fighter Lee Haskins, but he did not attend the bout or arrive at the airport for his flight home.	The family of a boxing promoter who died in Monaco feel distressed and angry after discovering his body was repatriated with missing organs.
Lyndon Gooch's long-range dipping effort caused Fleetwood keeper Chris Maxwell to make a fingertip save. Amari'i Bell fired into the side-netting for the hosts, while Richard Chaplow scuffed a chance for Rovers. Jimmy Ryan's 25-yard effort almost won the game for the hosts but the ball struck the crossbar.	Fleetwood Town dropped into the League One relegation places as they had to settle for a point after a stalemate with Doncaster.
Ahead of a Westminster debate on the abuse faced by MPs, Labour claimed the Tories had run a "negative, nasty campaign" targeting shadow home secretary Diane Abbott in particular. It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse. The PM has called for parties to unite against "bullying and harassment". Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like "burn the witch". On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with "vitriolic abuse". But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement. "Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree," they wrote. "The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign. "Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission." They claimed Labour "fought a positive, hopeful campaign" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks. On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was "surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that". Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on "the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections". Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections. People wanting to publicly support candidates were being "driven away from politics at a time when we need them" he said. "This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally," he said, claiming there had been a "deafening silence" from political leaders. Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a "significant part" in this shift. But Momentum dismissed his accusation as "baseless". "If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution," a spokesman for the group said.	Labour has accused the Conservatives of putting "vitriolic personal attacks" at the heart of their election campaign.
Thanks for sharing your pictures of #DogsAtPollStations. Welsh Springer Spaniel Dyddgu went with owner Rhiannon Williams to Grangetown Pavillion, a former bowls club, in Cardiff. Macey the dog lives on a farm in Wincanton in Somerset where a temporary polling station has been sited. Don't worry Brody it happens to us all! Brody the golden retriever caught blinking in Heaton Norris in Stockport, Greater Manchester. "What do you mean I can't vote?" asks Fausto in Richmond, London. Orinoco looks happy to be at St Christopher's Church in Hinchley Wood, Surrey. Albus joined owner Tony outside Aldermaston polling station in Berkshire. Not wanting to be left out in the cold, or the rain, this cat decided to create an alternative trend by using #CatsAtPollingStations at Wilnecote Junior School in Tamworth, Staffordshire. And he wasn't the only one... ...with Atticus the polecat becoming a poll-cat for the day. Owner Alison Catterall from Low Wood in the Lake District said: "He's also capable of giving a sound bite. A very sound bite."	As voters head to the polling stations for the EU referendum so have some dogs - although cats and even a political polecat have been keen to get in on the act.
The Women into Sustainable Employment scheme aims to improve language and workplace skills and is being piloted in Dundee and Glasgow. It is run by Bridges Programmes, which supports refugees, asylum seekers and others who do not speak English as a first language. If successful, the project could be extended across Scotland. The Scottish government said research suggested women from black and ethnic minority groups face many barriers to work and are under-represented in Scotland's labour market. Minister for Youth and Women's Employment, Annabelle Ewing, said: "This course is aimed at precisely that group of women and I am very pleased that the Scottish government is able to fund the programme in two of Scotland's cities to help improve their employability, including building up their confidence, sharpen their English language skills and experience the workplace itself. "We hope that if successful, such an innovative approach to the provision of English for speakers of other languages can be rolled out across Scotland to allow many more to benefit in the future. "We are committed both to strengthening the economy and reducing inequality in Scotland. Schemes such as Bridges will help us make progress on both fronts by helping a minority group take their rightful place in the workplace." Founder and director of the Bridges Programmes, Maggie Lennon, said "We are delighted that the Scottish government is funding what we know to be a successful and practical way of getting black and minority ethnic women into work. "The key to the approach is working closely with employers at every stage, to ensure that the training is relevant to their needs as well as the women, meaning work- placements are more successful which in turn can lead to more sustainable job outcomes. "Once again we see Scottish employers taking a pro-active role in supporting people far from the workplace."	A new project to help women from ethnic minority backgrounds into work has been given £110,000 of government funding.
He will make 19 speeches during his tour of Kenya, Uganda and the Central African Republic (CAR) and they will probably address these issues: He is expected to focus on religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence at a time of rising political instability and extremism in much of the region. Security is expected to be tight throughout the trip, as the faithful flock to see this popular Pope, who has previously said that Christians would be wrong to equate Islam with violence. His first stop, Kenya, has seen some of the worst Islamist violence: Two years ago, gunmen from the Somali militant group al-Shabab massacred at least 67 people inside Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall. In Uganda, his second stop, al-Shabab bombed sports bars in Kampala where fans were watching the 2010 football World Cup on TV. Many think the third stop on his trip, the CAR, is too dangerous for him to visit. The Pope's visit to the capital, Bangui, where many have died in violence between largely Muslim Seleka rebels and mainly Christian "anti-balaka" militias, is seen as his most dangerous yet - but potentially also one of his most fruitful as a peace-maker. In short: He will probably urge Christians and Muslims to get along. 2. Poverty This is a Pope who has been hailed as the champion of a church for the poor. His emphasis on the developing world, and the example of simplicity he sets in his own life, will be welcomed in countries where corruption in public life is often seen as an issue. His capacity to look beyond Europe and embrace the concerns of people around the world is also likely to endear him to the faithful, and to those of other faiths, as this Pope from the southern hemisphere offers a message of hope to the dispossessed, and the struggling. In Kenya, 75% of the wealth is owned by around 1% of the population, so Pope Francis's message may well prove popular among many of the remaining 99%. He is likely to criticise inequality and corruption and will visit Kenya's multi-ethnic Kangemi slum - home to around 100,000 people. In short: He will probably criticise corruption and inequality. With international climate change talks starting in Paris on 30 November, many will be listening closely to what Pope Francis has to say when he speaks in Nairobi to the UN's Environment Programme. His encyclical on the environment, "Laudato Si" published earlier this year, raised hackles among big business in the US with its apocalyptic warning that humankind risks turning the earth into a "vast pile of filth" by mistreating the planet. The Pope is unlikely to mince his words. He will probably emphasise the need for the developed world to stop abusing the planet for profit and to the detriment of the poor, whom he sees as the victims of climate change. In short: He will probably tell big business to think of the poor. LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activists, especially in Uganda, would like the Pope to encourage greater tolerance and speak out against the criminalisation of homosexuality in many African countries. In the past, when the Pope was asked about a gay priest he said, "Who am I to judge?" However, the recent Synod on the Family in Rome did not budge on the issue of greater acceptance within the Church for gay Catholics. Might he directly address the discrimination against gay and lesbian communities on a continent where being gay is often still a crime? Activists certainly hope so. They think it could make an enormous difference to attitudes in the continent. Attitudes like that of Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah who told the Synod that what Nazi and Communist ideology were to the 20th Century, so the twin "beasts" of "Western homosexual and abortion ideologies, and Islamic fanaticism" were for the 21st. In short: He is unlikely to lecture Africa on LGBT rights. The Pope once said that Catholics did not have to breed "like rabbits", before the Vatican clarified his remarks to insist that he was not speaking out against large families. However, many international aid agencies and some Western governments would like the Roman Catholic Church to give up its opposition to artificial contraception, especially its ban on the use of condoms, to help people on a continent where Aids/HIV remains a problem. Pope Francis is likely to meet people with HIV, but unlikely to budge on contraception. Large Catholic families are helping to ensure that Africa becomes an ever more important part of the Church. And the Synod on the Family in October reiterated the Church's hostility towards aid programmes that try to link development aid to the use of artificial contraception. In short: He is unlikely to scrap the Catholic ban on contraception. Five African countries with the most Catholics: 1. Democratic Republic of Congo: 31 million 2. Nigeria: 20 million 3. Tanzania: 14.2 million 4. Uganda: 14.1 million 5. Angola: 10.8 million Christianity is projected to be sub-Saharan Africa's largest religious group by 2050 with 1.1bn followers from 517 million in 2010. The Muslim population is expected to grow at faster rate, rising from 248 million to 670 million.

The Academies Enterprise Trust (AET), which runs Weston Academy, said it made the "sad decision", due to falling pupil numbers. The 56-pupil school was classed as "inadequate" by Ofsted in March. A petition set up by parent George Metcalf, describing closing the school as a "huge waste of resources" attracted more than 500 signatures. The campaign won the backing of the National Secular Society as parents claimed the nearest alternatives were all faith schools. The school was placed in special measures following an Ofsted report in March which criticised leadership and management, pupils' behaviour, the quality of teaching and achievement of pupils. But in May the watchdog reported that teaching and leadership was improving. AET said the school had less than 40 pupils and the Department for Education had confirmed its agreement to closing the school at the end of December. Chief executive Ian Comfort said: "Closing a small school is always a very sad decision to make, and is only taken as a very last resort. "The declining numbers at Weston, however, have been making it increasingly difficult for the school to provide pupils with the quality of education they deserve. I am sure they will all thrive in their new schools and we wish them, and the staff, every success in the future."	An Isle of Wight primary school is to close, despite a parents' campaign to keep it open.
The pictures show the swirling clouds of the gas giant at both its poles - views that no previous mission has managed to acquire in such detail. Juno captured the data last weekend as it made its first close approach to the planet since going into orbit in July. The flyby took the spacecraft just 4,200km above Jupiter's multi-coloured atmosphere. The 6MB of data downlinked to Earth from the encounter is still being analysed, but principal investigator Scott Bolton said new things were already obvious. "First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before. It's bluer in colour up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms," the Southwest Research Institute scientist explained in a Nasa statement. "There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zones and belts that we are used to - this image is hardly recognisable as Jupiter. "We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features." Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, UK, is a member of the Juno mission's science team. He told the BBC that his colleagues were bowled over when they first saw the pictures: "The team's reaction was amazement. 'Look at these images; they are coming from Jupiter; we're flying over the pole for the first time!' It's just jaw-dropping." When the Juno probe arrived at Jupiter in July, its instruments and camera were switched off. It had to perform a critical rocket manoeuvre to get into orbit - and engineers did not want the complication of taking pretty pictures at the same time. But after successfully turning around the planet, Juno booted up its other systems, and last Saturday's return pass was the first opportunity to get a good look at the gaseous world. The probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) has acquired unique views of Jupiter's southern aurora. Earth telescopes have tried but failed to get such images. And Juno's Radio/Plasma Wave Experiment (Waves) has recorded the blizzard of particles moving through the planet's super-strong magnetic field. Juno's quest is to investigate the secrets of the Solar System by explaining the origin and evolution of its biggest planet. The spacecraft's remote sensing instruments will look down into the giant's many layers and measure their composition, temperature, motion and other properties. We should finally discover whether Jupiter has a solid core or if its gas merely compresses to an ever denser state all the way to the centre. We will also get new information on the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on Jupiter for hundreds of years. Juno will tell us how deep its roots go. And Dr Nichols said Jupiter was a wonderful laboratory to try to understand even more distant places. "We can go to Jupiter and kick the tyres to see how it works, but that then gives us some insights on lots of other objects in the Universe. "We can use Jupiter as an analogue for things like brown dwarfs and exoplanets - basically, any fast-rotating body with a magnetic field can be modelled in some way like Jupiter." The spacecraft is currently flying on an ellipse around Jupiter that takes 53 days to complete. Its next close approach is due on 19 October, when the probe will fire its main engine to tighten the circuit to just 14 days. This configuration will then be held until February 2018 when the spacecraft will be commanded to make a destructive dive into Jupiterâ€™s atmosphere. By that stage, however, scientists hope to have built a formidable data-set to help answer their most pressing questions about this vast world.

There is a general belief here that if you typed Ghana or Ghanaian into a search engine, the words that would be suggested automatically as a follow-up should be politics and football. It is these two subjects that spark animated discussions and get the juices flowing. Even though in football, we have not won anything on the continental or world stage for a very long time, we still believe that the Black Stars, our national team, are special. One of the inner sources of the strength that help Ghanaians survive is the fact that our national team regularly beats the national team of the United States at football. Trying to get a visa from Ghana to the United States is one of the most humiliating experiences for Ghanaians. But we are able to endure it all by simply repeating over and over again under our breaths: "World Cup 2006, we defeated you, World Cup 2010, we defeated you." Now, we discovered quite unexpectedly that defeating the US at football has even deeper implications, when news broke that our government had accepted two Yemeni ex-detainees, Khalid al-Dhuby and Mahmoud Omar Bin Atef, from Guantanamo Bay, where the US detains terror suspects, to live in Ghana. Elizabeth Ohene: "They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Star - they know him and they like him very much" The government has struggled to explain this decision. We have been told the two men pose no danger whatsoever to Ghana; they were innocent 20-year-olds when they were arrested and to drive home their innocence, our president compares them to his own 20-year-old son. We have been told that even though the two men are such thoroughly harmless and nice people, their every move will be monitored. Normally taciturn officials from the US embassy are suddenly all over the radio and television trying to assure us we should all be proud of our government for bringing to Ghana men the US Senate deems too dangerous to enter their country. When none of these interventions appeared to be calming the protests, the two thoroughly harmless and nice men were brought out to state their own case on national radio. Guantanamo Bay prison: The pair said they do not belong to any terrorist group, and have been wrongly arrested for 14 years without any charge. They have suffered but are not looking for revenge. They want to live in Ghana quietly and peacefully, and put their lives together. All that did not sound very convincing to any of us here; what everybody really wanted to know was why they had been brought to Ghana - did they just pick us on the map because Ghana happens to be the physical centre of the world? And suddenly it all comes tumbling out. They are excited to come to Ghana because of Asamoah Gyan, the captain of the Black Stars, they know him and they like him very much. A lot of the detainees like Ghanaians very much, and during the 2010 World Cup, most of the people there in Guantanamo Bay - no, not most of them, all of them -  were with Ghana and when the Black Stars beat America, they were very happy. So now we know... beating America at football has consequences. I am afraid I don't know what happened to our secret supporters in Guantanamo in 2014. They obviously did not cheer loud enough that year, which must be why we lost to the US. And for that reason alone, I think our two long-term visitors should be sent back to reorganize our supporters club in Guantanamo. More from Elizabeth Ohene:	In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene looks at the uproar that greeted Ghana's decision to allow two Yemenis freed from the US jail in Guantanamo Bay to live in the West African state.
The development could be the starting point for breeding a strain of ash to replace thousands expected to succumb to ash die-back in the next few years. Ash die-back is now established and spreading within Britain Researchers are hoping that genetics might yield the knowledge to fight back. A joint project by the John Innes Centre, the Genome Analysis Centre and the Sainsbury Laboratory  - all based in Norwich - has reached this milestone just two months after receiving the samples. Dr Mario Caccamo of the Genome Analysis Centre said: "Speed is important to the research so that all those studying the epidemic can start to look for clues to tackle it." And they do mean everyone. All the data is being put on a crowd sourcing website OpenAshDieBack to enable experts from around the world to help identify genes that might be connected to the trees' ability to withstand the fungus. These genes could then be part of a breeding programme for resistant trees. The samples for the latest research came from so-called "tree 35", a strain of ash from Denmark originally bred nearly 100 years ago, which has shown an ability to tolerate the fungal disease, when virtually all its Danish relatives were wiped out. But just planting this variety in the UK would leave us with a narrow genetic base vulnerable to future diseases and not ideally suited to British growing conditions. Prof  Allan Downie of the John Innes Centre believes this genetic understanding of both the lethal fungal infection and the surviving strain could help fill the impending gap in the canopy. "We're trying to give nature a bit of a helping hand by identifying the right kind of (native) trees to do the appropriate crosses," he said. "It would be wonderful to be part of the solution but the problem is enormous and the breeding is going to take a long time." In March, a related team sequenced the genome of the fungus that causes die-back. The firm grip of this disease is evident in many of East Anglia's woodlands. While filming with Countryfile in Suffolk, Paul Beales from Fera, the government's Food and Environment Research Agency, set up a search for the Chalara fraxinea fungus itself. The symptoms of the disease were plain to see in scars on the trunk and skeletal canopies, but the source of the infection - the sporulating fungus - had not been found in Britain. After half an hour on hands and knees in the leaf litter and some identification first by magnifying glass and then by genetic analyser, that all changed. Paul Beales said: "We've just got the sporing stage of this particular fungus picked up from the ground which has never been found in the UK before.  "This is a first. It's here to stay." If that is true, breeding a tree which can survive alongside it is more crucial than ever. Countryfile is broadcast at 1900 BST on BBC One.	Scientists have sequenced the genome of a type of ash tree with resistance to the deadly fungal disease sweeping the UK.
The Board of Community Health Councils (CHCs) is refusing to say why chief executive Tony Rucinski was suspended. Emails show that before his suspension Dr Rucinski raised concerns the board's chair Mutale Merrill may have been influenced by a government minister to stop him doing media interviews. Ms Merill said she does not accept the emails' content is "factually correct". Dr Rucinski said he has been "instructed not to comment." The organisation describes itself as the "independent voice of patients" in Wales. It and the seven CHCs it oversees had an annual budget in 2015-16 of Â£3.8m. Dr Rucinski was appointed as chief executive of the Board of Community Health Councils in a newly-created role in July 2015. At the time, he told BBC Wales that he had been "put in place to make things happen". He said he wanted CHCs to become a "much more proactive and effective patient voice". Four months later the Welsh Government appointed Ms Merrill as the board's new chair. Dr Rucinski was then suspended in February 2016. Several sources have told BBC Wales that there was tension between Mr Rucinski and Ms Merrill prior to his suspension. In emails written to Ms Merrill before his suspension, obtained by BBC Wales, Mr Rucinski raises concerns about being stopped from doing interviews on a Welsh Government digital health initiative in December 2015 and on a report by the OECD think tank comparing UK health services in February 2016. In the emails Dr Rucinski stated that his job description involved doing media interviews and suggested he felt Ms Merill's instructions to him not to do interviews may have been influenced by a meeting with a Welsh Government minister. He wrote: "I am genuinely concerned about the comments you have relayed from your meeting with the minister." Following his suspension, a board meeting was held in which Ms Merrill appears to try to explain the disagreement over media coverage between her and the chief executive. The minutes state that Ms Merrill said a "media embargo" had "only been imposed on the chief executive regarding this one news item [the OECD story]", and "it was noted that there was some context behind this decision which could not be shared, however the board chair had required the chief executive to provide a briefing prior to the commenting on any issue in order to decide the best approach and deliver the message to the media". "A conversation regarding a need for a media protocol had been discussed with the chief executive," the minutes said. The document also said that the chief executive had shared a text message from Ms Merrill with staff "without her knowledge and without context of previous discussions". Following his suspension Dr Rucinski claimed in an email to the Wales Audit Office in April 2016 that Ms Merrill "informed me verbally that the minister had instructed her to not let me do any further media engagements or public appearances". In that email he also said he believed "the independent voice of patients and the public in Wales has been gagged during a crucial time for healthcare debate nationally". Alyson Thomas and Clare Jenkins are in "acting chief executive" roles. Dr Rucinski was previously chief executive of the Macular Society from March to November 2014. Ms Merill said: "I can confirm on behalf of the Board of Community Health Councils in Wales that there are ongoing personnel processes relating to the chief executive officer and due process is being followed in respect of those matters." Ms Merill added that she did not accept that Mr Rucinski's allegations in the emails were factually correct and said she was unable to provide further comment at this stage whilst internal processes are ongoing. Dr Ruckinski said: "I have been instructed not to comment." BBC Wales understands the Welsh Government was made aware of the suspension. A spokesman for Welsh ministers said: "The suspension of Mr Rucinski is wholly an internal matter for the CHC Board. "It is not appropriate for us to comment any further." A spokeswoman for public spending watchdog the Wales Audit Office said: "We have received correspondence on this matter but after careful consideration we have concluded that it seems to fall outside of the remit of the auditor general, though we will naturally keep a close eye on any developments."	The head of the patients' watchdog has been suspended on full pay since February 2016, BBC Wales understands.
The Baggies took the lead before the break when Saido Berahino finished well, before Craig Dawson doubled the lead in the 54th minute with a header. Media playback is not supported on this device A minute later Lukaku rose to nod in Gerard Deulofeu's cross, and then set up Arouna Kone who fired in to level. Belgium striker Lukaku grabbed the winner with a close-range strike from another excellent Deulofeu delivery. The result moves Everton up to fifth on 12 points, while West Brom, who have yet to win at home, drop to 15th with eight points. It was a certainly a game of two halves, following a dire opening 40 minutes, but Lukaku himself had a contrasting 90 minutes. The 6ft 3in 22-year-old has had to carry the burden of a £28m price tag ever since he signed on a permanent deal for the Toffees in July 2014, following a successful season on loan in 2013-14. Media playback is not supported on this device And despite scoring 20 goals last season, his performances were mixed, which prompted manager Roberto Martinez to defend him. Everton fans must have been wondering which Lukaku they would see at The Hawthorns. They saw both. The left side of the graphic below shows that Lukaku found himself in deep positions in the first half as he tried to get into the game. However, with Everton chasing the match after the break, he moved further forward and became more of a threat in and around the area. The service also improved from Spaniard Deulofeu, who delivered two fantastic crosses for the Belgian's goals. For a team that came into the game having conceded only six goals in six matches, shipping three goals in one half would be a surprise to the casual observer. However, two injuries caused the Baggies' tight defence to become flaky. The first occurred when Gareth McAuley was hurt in training prior to the match, and the second when Jonas Olsson came off in the 28th minute with what appeared to be a groin problem. Everton's defence also looked brittle in the first half, which again could be attributed to injuries, with John Stones, Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines missing. Fortunately for the inexperienced backline, the team's emphasis focused on attack as they chased the game after the break. West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "The first goal kills us. We should deal with it. The other two goals are poor goals - the second one looks offside, the linesman is looking the wrong side. It's a poor decision. "It's really, really disappointing because before we scored the second goal we had some good chances. We switched off and Everton will punish you." Everton manager Roberto Martinez: "We were very disappointed with the first half. We were off, every single individual. "The mountain we had to climb, it would have been easy to lose focus but we got three goals against the best defensive structure in the Premier League. "Every three points is huge but it feels extra good. Deulofeu took extra responsibility, he wanted the ball all night and it was a real mature performance." BBC Radio 5 live's Steve Claridge at the Hawthorns: "Everton looked far more comfortable when they threw the shackles off and went for it. Going 2-0 down was the best thing that could happen to them." A brilliant win sets Roberto Martinez's Everton up nicely for Sunday's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, with Liverpool only a point behind them in the table. As for West Brom, they are away at seventh-place Crystal Palace on Saturday.	Romelu Lukaku scored twice as he led a superb comeback by Everton, who battled from 2-0 down to win at West Brom.
Japan should learn "profound lessons from history", China's defence ministry said after Japan's parliamentary vote. The vote allows Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since the end of World War Two 70 years ago. Tensions between China and Japan have escalated in recent months over a group of islands to which both lay claim. The security laws were voted through Japan's upper house late on Friday, with 148 lawmakers voting in support and 90 against. It followed nearly 200 hours of political wrangling, with scuffles breaking out at various points between the bills' supporters and opposition members attempting to delay the vote. Compiled by BBC Monitoring The government says that the changes in defence policy are vital to meet new military challenges such as those posed from a rising China. But China's defence ministry said on Saturday they "run counter to the trend of the times that upholds peace, development and co-operation", the Xinhua news agency reports. "The move has breached the restrictions of Japan's pacifist constitution," the ministry added. Many Japanese who opposed the bills - which prompted large public protests - were also attached to the pacifist provisions in the constitution that banned fighting overseas. China also urged Japan to "heed the security concern" of its Asian neighbours and do more to promote regional peace and stability. South Korea, which also has a tense relationship with Japan, has warned Tokyo not to exercise the new defence laws without its approval. But the US, Japan's ally, and the UK have both welcomed the changes. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he looked forward to Japan "taking an increasingly active part in peacekeeping operations". Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve international conflicts except in cases of self-defence. The new security legislation allows Japan's military to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? Critics say the changes violate the pacifist constitution and could lead Japan into US-led wars abroad. Supporters of the measures insist they are essential for the defence of Japan and its regional allies, and will permit greater involvement in peacekeeping activities around the world. Critics have focused on what they say is ambiguity in how the principles of the legislation will be interpreted, and the possibility that future governments will interpret them more broadly.	China has said Japan is endangering peace in the region after it passed controversial laws expanding the role of its military abroad.
The exercise was carried out in Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd, Sowerby Bridge, Elland and Brighouse. About 2,700 homes were flooded along with more than 4,400 businesses in the area in 2015, said Calderdale Council. Scenarios played for the exercise included a mock rescue of casualties from a sinking canal boat. Operation Calderdale16 was its biggest ever live training exercise, the council said. The Environment Agency has eight flood sirens to warn the upper Calder valley when rivers are expected to flood. The sirens sounded for about two minutes during the exercise.

He was speaking in a BBC interview in which he paid tribute to the Queen on the eve of her 90th birthday. She had been a "guiding example" of what a good monarch should be, he said. Meanwhile, a picture of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, Prince William and Prince George, for stamps to mark the monarch's birthday, has been released. The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, met staff and viewed an exhibition at Windsor's Royal Mail delivery office in the first of a series of events to mark her birthday on Thursday. Text and video coverage of the day's events 'Super fans' turn out to glimpse Queen in Windsor In pictures: The Queen at 90 in 90 images BBC - iWonder - Queen Elizabeth II- Britainâ€™s longest reigning monarch Full coverage: Queen at 90 Her visit marked the 500th anniversary of the postal service and she was welcomed with singing from the Royal Mail choir. The royals then headed to Alexandra Gardens in the town for a ceremony to officially open a new bandstand and met pupils from the six schools involved in its decoration. The children also sang Happy Birthday. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the political leaders who said they were looking forward to wishing the Queen a happy birthday, at Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Cameron said Thursday was an "important landmark", adding the monarch had served the nation with "dignity". In an interview with BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell, Prince William said: "The Queen's duty and her service, her tolerance, her commitment to others - I think that's all been incredibly important to me and it's been a real guiding example of just what a good monarch could be." The prince's own commitment to royal duty has been questioned in recent months, with headlines in some newspapers referring to him as "work-shy William". He said he did not ignore such criticisms but did not take them completely to heart. "I take duty very seriously. I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role," he said. He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so. 'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interview BBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah Campbell The recent headlines about William being a "work shy" prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him. In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response. He accepts that he will be criticised "but it's not something I take completely to heart". An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions. It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself. There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be. When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was "the best role model I could have in front of me". Full details of Queen's birthday celebrations Ten stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family. The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year. Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role. On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance. It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months. In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday. On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle. Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June. Republic said the Queen's birthday "does not warrant this kind of coverage" and that the BBC had a "duty to report, not to celebrate the royals". Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had "failed completely" to report the birthday in a way that was "fair, balanced and proportionate".	Prince William has answered criticism of his commitment to royal duties, saying he is willing to take on more responsibility when the time comes.
If you don't like the latter, I'm afraid there's only bad news in store - there will be more leaflets and canvassing than ever during the next six weeks. That's in large part due to the fact that there is a real spring in the step of the smaller parties, buoyed by a general disappointment in their larger, more-established, opponents. Let's talk about UKIP first because it is they who are making this election so different across the North West. In terms of winning seats, their main - and arguably only - Greater Manchester target appears to be Heywood and Middleton, where they ran Labour very close in last autumn's by-election. But UKIP's impact will be felt much more widely - their claim last week that they are the "new party for the working class" will have sent shivers down some Labour spines. The Tories, meanwhile, are just as worried about losing precious votes in the key marginals which will ultimately decide the result of the election nationally. Chancellor George Osborne will surely be hoping his devolution deals, and the inclusion of Greater Manchester in the so-called Northern Powerhouse, will win over some hearts, minds and votes - but for decades this hasn't been a happy hunting ground for Conservatives. The Greens are also talking up their chances, but it will be interesting to see from whom will their votes come if they do? And will Bez have as much of an impact on politics in Salford and Eccles as he did on the Manchester music scene with the Happy Mondays? Bez - more formally known as Mark Berry - will be fighting on an anti-fracking ticket in the seat being vacated by Labour's Hazel Blears, who has represented the area since 1997. Political punditry can often be a mug's game but let's take a look at some of the other key battles across the region. Labour is very confident of taking Manchester Withington back from the Liberal Democrats. John Leech may have voted against his government on the Bedroom Tax/ Spare Room Subsidy issue, but his party's U-turn on university tuition fees may not play so well in a constituency packed with students. The Lib Dems could also be at risk in their more established seats of Hazel Grove and Cheadle, but their support is much more established in those seats. Elsewhere, the Tories are after Bolton West - where Labour's Julie Hilling has a majority of just 92 - while Labour fancy their chances of regaining Bury North. Conservative David Nuttall swept in there last time after the expenses scandal which ultimately saw the jailing of Labour incumbent David Chaytor. During the next six weeks, BBC North West Online and BBC Radio Manchester will be giving you all the information you need to make an informed choice about the parties and their positions. Three big events during the campaign will be one-hour live debates on Thursday evenings from mid-April, in Withington, Heywood and Bolton. The economy, immigration, and health - chosen as a result of audience research - will be the main themes. Will the parties' manifestos come alive or quickly unravel? Will there be any "Gillian Duffy" moments when the party leaders visit our area? Nobody yet knows but it will be fascinating to watch it all unfold. And to return to the Greater Manchester run - It's a 10k grind rather than a sprint - something we should all remember as this first week of the campaign begins to pick up pace. You can follow my updates on Twitter and listen to my reports on BBC Radio Manchester throughout the campaign.	It's always just after the clocks go forward that the streets around here fill up with two things - people in garish clothes training for the Great Manchester run, and political candidates chasing your vote.
Mandla Hlatshwayo and his friend were shot after confronting a group of men who had robbed women of their mobile phones in a pub in Soweto. The suspects were found in possession of drugs and an unlicensed gun. South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world with more than 50,000 cases reported every year. "Police are questioning the suspects to see if they can link them to the shooting," says the police's Lungelo Dlamini. Tributes are still pouring in for the star who was also a DJ on local radio station Jozi FM. Those who knew the 40-year-old have described him as a selfless man.	South African police say four people have been arrested in connection with the murder of former actor on popular local TV series Generations.
Northumberland County Council said the weather was now warm enough for its Jetpatcher machines to tackle the holes. It is hoped that 145 potholes each day will be "filled in" over the next four months, the council said. Extra staff will also be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and to clear debris from gutters.	A county council has set aside £1m to fix almost 3,000 portholes created during Storm Desmond flooding.
GB Taekwondo have overlooked the world number one three times in favour of Muhammad, ranked 59th in the world. The move has been investigated by the BOA and, while they feel selectors acted properly, they were disappointed by the way the issue has been handled. "There are two world-class athletes directly impacted by this nomination," read a statement issued by the BOA. "Our panel would have preferred to see the selection process managed in a manner that would have been of much greater service to both athletes. Overturning the selection made by a national federation would have been an unprecedented decision for the BOA. They asked GB Taekwondo to reconsider their choice of Lutalo Muhammad and the governing body returned with the same name, and, satisfied that proper selection procedures had been followed, the BOA didn't have much choice. That doesn't mean they're happy. They say they might revisit the matter should the international federation's investigation bring new issues to the fore. They're aware of the pressure this has put on both athletes and have criticised the apparent lack of transparency that has made GB Taekwondo's decision to leave out the world number one hard to understand. "That said, after a thorough review, the panel is now sufficiently satisfied that the agreed selection procedures have been followed, and it is on that basis we are ratifying the nomination." GB Taekwondo welcomed the BOA decision. Performance director Gary Hall said: "This has been a long and difficult process for all involved, for the selection panel members and particularly for the two athletes concerned. Both are outstanding candidates and truly world class, both capable of winning medals in London. This has been the most difficult of selection decisions." Cook's camp is now considering whether to launch legal action. "Aaron is naturally incredibly disappointed with the BOA decision," said his agent Jamie Cunningham. "He should be competing in the 2012 Games. It is an absolute disgrace that a British world number one has not been selected for the London Olympics by either his governing body or Olympic Association. "He is world number one, European champion and has beaten 10 of the top 15 athletes in the Olympic rankings in his most recent fights. What more could Aaron have done? "We urge the World Taekwondo Federation to consider the ramifications of this flawed decision. Aaron will be considering whether he wishes to pursue a legal route to contest this decision over the weekend." Bob Mitchell, solicitor at Harbottle & Lewis representing Aaron Cook, added: "Everyone is extremely disappointed by the outcome today. We have retained a leading sports QC and will be deciding over the weekend what the best way is to proceed for Aaron from a legal and sports perspective. A further statement is likely to be issued early next week." The BOA's Olympic Qualification Standards panel can only accept or reject athlete nominations - it is not within its remit to select individual athletes. However, the BOA noted the importance of working closer with national governing bodies over selection policies for future Games. The panel added it reserves the right to reconsider the nomination subject to an ongoing inquiry by the World Taekwondo Federation.	The British Olympic Association has ratified Lutalo Muhammad's nomination for London 2012 ahead of Aaron Cook.
Apple was sued in 2014 for allegedly using a technology developed by a professor and his students in its iPhone chips without the University of Wisconsin-Madison's permission. Apple was ordered to pay about $234m (Â£179m) when it lost the patent case. That sum has now been more than doubled because it continued to use the tech. The judge said that additional damages and interest brought the sum owed to $506m. However, Apple still hopes to overthrow the fine by appealing against the original jury verdict. The penalty is still less than the $862m the university had originally sought in damages. That is because Apple was found not to have deliberately infringed the university's microchip technology. The patent in question outlined a way to boost computing performance by predicting how processors are about to be used. The original case covered Apple's use of the invention in its A7, A8 and A8X processors, which are found in devices including the iPhone 5S and the iPad Air 2. Apple did not re-engineer the chips after losing the dispute in 2015 nor pull the relevant products from sale, and thus became liable for the additional payout. The university is also seeking further compensation for Apple's continued infringement of the patent in its A9 and A9X chips, which power its iPhone 6S and iPad Pro models. However, the follow-up legal action has been put on hold until Apple's appeal has been considered.	A US judge has ordered Apple to pay more than half a billion dollars to a university after the tech firm failed to abide by an earlier court ruling.
His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as "a shock but not a surprise". Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis. Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande. In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an "heroic figure" whose "escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history". Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a "major emblematic figure".	One of the leading figures of the French resistance against the Nazis, Raymond Aubrac, has died aged 97, his family says.
Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, appeared in a Chicago court on Friday. The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (Â£42,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: "Where was your sense of decency?" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December. He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents. Prosecutors say the suspects each face two hate crimes counts, one because of the victim's race and the other because of his disabilities.	Four people accused of kidnapping and torturing a mentally disabled man in a "racially motivated" attack streamed on Facebook have been denied bail.
Broadband suppliers will now have to show upfront and monthly costs, without separating out line rental prices, according to the changes brought in by the Advertising Standards Authority. The rules were originally due to be implemented in May, but firms asked for more time to comply with the changes. The ASA said customers were now much less likely to be misled. "The effect should be a real positive difference in how consumers understand and engage with ads for broadband services," said ASA chief executive Guy Parker. The move comes after research by the ASA, conducted with regulator Ofcom last year, found that most users could not correctly calculate bills based on the information given in a selection of broadband ads. People were "likely to be confused and misled" by price claims in the adverts, the ASA found. Geoff Roberts, from Northampton, told the BBC that he found broadband adverts "completely misleading". "What was advertised up front - when you really went into it - was nothing like what they were offering. The monthly amount was not clear." He was paying nearly Â£45 for his phone and broadband, but reduced that amount to Â£26.50 when he switched to another provider. To comply with the new rules, broadband providers will now have to: Digital and Culture Minister Matt Hancock welcomed the ASA's move. "Making broadband providers show all-inclusive, upfront prices in their advertisements means consumers will be much better placed to make an informed choice when deciding on a service," he added. Technology expert Chris Green told BBC Radio 5 live: "It's going to level the playing field, and make pricing more transparent. "But mostly it's about providing a lot more clarity to customers." However, there will be no change to the rules on the way providers are allowed to advertise the broadband speeds on offer. "If a broadband company advertises a particular speed, actually only up to 10% of people need to get that speed, which a lot of people would say is quite misleading," said Steve Nowottny from Moneysavingexpert. One reason for that rule is that different customers will experience different speeds, according to how far they live from the telephone exchange.	New rules forcing broadband firms to be clearer in adverts on the costs of their contracts have come into effect.
Joey's Pizza has 212 stores across Germany with annual sales of â‚¬143m ($156.5m; Â£103.9m). Germany is the world's fourth-biggest pizza market and the deal is worth up to A$120m ($86m). The deal will increase the number of stores owned by Sydney-listed Domino's Pizza Enterprises to 1,870. The joint venture will be two-thirds owned by the Australian company, with the remainder owned by the London-listed Domino's Pizza Group, which already has operations in Germany. Don Meij, chief executive of Domino's Pizza Enterprises, said that entering the German market represented a long-term growth opportunity. "The acquisition of the market-leading Joey's Pizza business provides immediate scale and marketing presence which we can build from," he said. The company's Sydney-listed shares jumped more than 12% after the deal was announced. The stock has soared more than 125% in the past 12 months. The Australian company also raised its profit outlook for the year to June by 30% -  to A$166.1m net income before tax and other items. The Domino's brand globally is owned by the New York-listed Domino's Pizza Inc. The London-listed company has more than 800 stores in the UK, and holds franchises in Ireland, Germany and Switzerland. Up to 15 of its German stores will be bought by the joint venture. Shares in Domino's Pizza Group have risen by 38% this year and the company is valued at Â£1.6bn. Domino's Australia is the world's largest franchisee for the pizza brand. It holds the Domino's brand network in Australia, Belgium, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Monaco. The Joey's Pizza deal is expected to be completed early next year, subject to regulatory approval.	The companies that own Domino's Pizza in the UK and Australia have set up a joint venture to buy Germany's biggest pizza chain.

However, since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation. In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected, Indian-dominated coalition. This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy. A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks. These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation. Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years. In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history. In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member. Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India. The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority. Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society. There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans. Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing. Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.	The 800-plus volcanic and coral islands that make up the Pacific nation of Fiji enjoy a tropical climate and host a significant tourism industry.
From September, it will offer the language to students also reading international business and politics. While shorter courses are available at other universities, this is the first time Urdu has been included in the title of an official degree. About 100 million people speak it in the world, including 400,000 in the UK. Yasmin Hussain from the Routes Into Languages university consortium campaigned for the introduction of the new degree. She said: "The discourse is that modern foreign languages like French and Spanish are more important. Minority languages aren't seen to be as valued and so it has taken a long time." Students on the full-time courses will have the chance to learn how the language has been used in film and literature, as well as using Urdu to discuss topics related to their core subject. The launch of the course saw students from local schools take part in workshops and activities, as well as performances by poets and musicians. Writer Sabeena Khan was among those at an open day to launch and promote the Urdu courses. She believes young British Pakistanis in particular would benefit from having Urdu as part of their degree. Ms Khan said: "The language is rich in meaning, its style and usage. It's beautiful and I don't want to see it die out, I want to see more people learning Urdu." Urdu facts... ... And it has also contributed a few words to English Sheraz Ali is one of the lecturers who will be teaching the new undergraduate degree course. "There is a demand for Urdu-related jobs not just in this country but also in many others, especially within professions such as teaching and the health and legal sectors," he said. Mr Ali believed the course would attract students from different backgrounds and not just native speakers of the language. He added: "The Urdu degree is open to everyone, not just people from the South Asian diaspora. We live in a multicultural society, where language isn't only a pile of words but something which can bring people together." You can hear more on this story on BBC Asian Network at 17:00 GMT on Friday, or after that on the BBC iPlayer.	Manchester Metropolitan University has become the first higher education institute in the UK to offer students the chance to earn a degree in Urdu.
Lancashire County Council has earmarked land on the former Glenburn Sports College and Skelmersdale College. The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused. The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre. Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956. The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council. County councillor John Fillis, cabinet member for highways and transport, said it was an "exciting step forward". He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion. He added: "It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area." The authority confirmed it will now start the process of acquiring the relevant land. Skelmersdale was designated a new town on 9 October 1961.. It is one of the largest towns in the north west of England not to have its own railway station.	The preferred location for a town's first railway station in 50 years has been revealed.
Simone Sorensen scored the crucial spot-kick after Austria missed their first three penalties. The Austrians will rue wasting the best chance of the match when Sarah Puntigam fired over a first-half penalty. Denmark also went close in normal time through Sanne Troelsgaard, whose strike came off the crossbar. The Danes will face the hosts in the final after their 3-0 win over England in the second semi-final. It was a tight and tense semi-final between Denmark, the two-time semi-finalists, and tournament debutants Austria. Denmark, beaten at the last-four stage four years ago, were second best to the unfancied Austrian side during the first 45 minutes. Dominik Thalhammer's side should have taken the lead when they were awarded a penalty in the 13th minute. Maja Kildemoes was the unlucky Dane when she was judged to have intentionally moved her arm to block Verena Aschauer's effort. Freiburg midfielder Puntigam stepped up, but blazed her penalty over the bar. Denmark's best effort of the opening half fell to Rosengard's Troelsgaard, whose angled left-foot strike struck the bar. It was not until extra-time that either goal was seriously threatened again. First, Katrine Veje's effort cleared the Austria bar with a strike from eight yards. And then Pernille Harder, arguably the player of the match, headed over in the final few seconds before the spot-kicks.

He said the target to cut net migration to the UK could not be achieved as long as Britain remained a member of the EU. Launching UKIP's campaign poster on immigration, Mr Farage said an "honest debate" on the subject was needed to restore public trust in politics. The Conservatives said UKIP's immigration policy was in "chaos". Speaking in Dover, Mr Farage told the gathered media that the other parties were making false promises on immigration during the election campaign. But he said the only solution to controlling immigration was to leave the EU - which UKIP campaigns for. The prime minister pledged in 2011 to reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK to levels last seen in the 1990s, about "tens of thousands" each year. But the target has not been met, with the latest figures showing net migration rose to 298,000 for the year ending in September 2014 - higher than when he came to office. Nigel Farage swept in and out of a blustery press call in the shadow of the white cliffs of Dover. The UKIP leader - helped along by a backdrop of party activists - unveiled a poster attacking the Conservatives' record on immigration, in response to which they said UKIP's policy was in "chaos". An initially well-behaved press pack soon descended into a gentle scrum, with Mr Farage directed towards one camera then another for a series of interviews. He announced new target immigration figures, was challenged over his views on migrants with long-term illnesses and set an ambitious timeframe to get immigration down. Then, time for a coffee - not a pint - in a local pub before Mr Farage was whisked away again. A picturesque media opportunity, but one that revealed little more about UKIP's immigration policy other than the obvious fact it is central to their campaign. The symbolic location, with the shadow of France on the horizon, was deliberately chosen by Team UKIP to keep Britain's relationship with the continent at the forefront of people's minds. Although - perhaps ironically - it also caused some mobile phones to switch to French networks in order to function. Downing Street said the rise has been driven in part by Britain's economic success relative to its neighbours in the eurozone. Labour said the government's pledge was "in tatters". But, unveiling UKIP's campaign advert, Mr Farage said: "When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest. "Because he knew the truth and I think now the British public, five years on, know the truth: that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain all the while you're members of the European Union." He issued a call for a "return to normality", saying net immigration - the difference between the number of people leaving the UK and the number coming in - should be brought down to about 30,000 people per year. Charlie Elphicke, Conservative candidate in Dover, accused Mr Farage's party of performing U-turns on immigration policy. "All we've seen from UKIP on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay," he said. I am not sure if it is by design or if he just wants a slow start, but two days in to this general election campaign and UKIP leader Nigel Farage appears to be taking it easy. Or at least that is how it seems. This is a candidate who has to win on 7 May. If he fails to become the next MP for South Thanet he has said he will quit as leader. Yet I have seen no door-knocking. Our cameras have not been told of any public event, yet. We have had two poster-unveiling ceremonies with impromptu leader interviews. He arrives, he speaks, he answers questions, then he leaves. Read more from Robin. The EU, and the UK's place within it, is set to be a major issue in the election campaign. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU and put it to a public vote in 2017, if the Conservatives win in May. Labour has said it does not support an in/out referendum, while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said his party would not "play footsie" with the idea of leaving the EU - although he has refused to say he would block a referendum as part of any coalition deal. The Financial Times has reported the Lib Dems would only agree to support a poll if the franchise was extended to EU migrants resident in the UK and 16- and 17-year-olds. The party is also said to want to have a say on the wording of the question and the timing of the vote. In response, UKIP's economic spokesman and campaign chief Patrick O'Flynn accused Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg of preparing to "rig" a referendum if they are in power together again. He said it would be "profoundly unfair" to allow UK-based EU nationals to participate, and claimed the idea to give younger people a vote was designed to sway the result towards an "in" vote.	David Cameron was "wilfully dishonest" when he pledged to cap immigration to the tens of thousands, UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said.

An all-party group has called on the UK government to consider devolving some immigration control. That could involve Wales being able to set its own visas and migration quotas. And the group chairman said immigrants should have to learn English or Welsh. The UK government said different rules for different areas would cause difficulties for employers. Currently, there is no separate Welsh immigration policy. A number of recommendations have made by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration (APPGSI) report on how the UK's immigration system could promote better integration. It said speaking English was "the key to full participation in our society and economy". Group chairman Chuka Umunna MP said he wanted Wales to have a bigger say in developing immigration policies. "This is a really hot topic, it's become very toxic, very polarised and we want to build a consensus on what a new system could look like," he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. When asked if immigrants could learn Welsh if living and working in Wales as an alternative to English, he said: "Absolutely. Why not?", adding that people could not fully integrate in society if they could not speak the language. David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth, called it a "ludicrous idea". "People will just go to whichever nation... is offering the easiest visas and move to where they want to move to," he told BBC Wales. "Once they've got a visa to go to Wales there will be nothing to stop them going to England or vice versa." The MPs' report claims the UK's existing points-based immigration system is "generally unresponsive to demographic, economic and cultural differences between our constituent nations and regions". "Shaping immigration criteria to address nation or region-specific economic and cultural needs might instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area", the study said. It added: "Enabling nations and regions to set regional immigration quotas would create new incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area." Devolution could involve the introduction of region-specific visas, with quotas for how many are issued. Canada is given as an example, where all 10 provincial governments are allowed to set region-specific requirements for immigrants. Immigrants are required to live in the region that approves their visa until they become eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship. The province of Quebec is also able to set its own criteria for its visas and evaluate applications. A small element of regional policy on immigration already exists in the UK, where Scotland has a list of occupations in addition to a UK-wide version where employers can advertise outside of the EU without first advertising domestically. The UK government, the report said, should appoint an independent commission to explore how a devolved or regionally-led immigration system might work. Questions for the commission could include extending existing powers for Scotland to Wales, Northern Ireland, London and the English metro regions, and whether the UK government might copy the Quebec model. A Welsh Government spokesman said: "It is important that the needs of Wales are reflected in future migration policies and that people who settle here are supported to integrate into communities." Plaid Cymru external affairs spokesman Steffan Lewis said: "Plaid Cymru has long advocated a Welsh visa system to boost our public services such as the NHS and support the private sector in attracting high-skilled workers from around the world. "It is also of great regret that Westminster policies have damaged our reputation as a destination for international students. "Student visas should be devolved and would benefit our universities and our economy." A UK government spokeswoman said: "Applying different immigration rules to different parts of the United Kingdom will complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity and causing difficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff to other parts of the UK." She said the UK government was rolling out a Â£20m fund for English language provision and had made Â£140m available to councils to manage impacts on communities "caused by issues such as poor English language skills". The spokeswoman added: "We must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services. "Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need."	Immigration rules tailored to the needs of Wales could build public confidence in the system, a group of MPs has said.
A television documentary and two radio productions took the top prizes in their categories for the BBC. Peter Johnston, BBC Northern Ireland's director, said the awards were "a great acknowledgement of the creativity and dedication of our production teams". The three-day festival took place in Dungarvan in County Waterford this week. BBC One NI's True North: Keepin' Er Country took the main accolade in the factual entertainment category. Made for the BBC by the Alley Cats production company, it told the story of country music fans with a passion for dancing. BBC Radio Ulster's Saturday morning programme The John Toal Show won the best radio magazine show award. And BBC Radio Ulster also took the main award in the radio documentary section for Lacrimosa, produced by Conor Garrett. The programme, broadcast last summer, was a personal look at why presenter Proinsias O'Coinn found it difficult to cry. It has also been selected for the 2016 International Features Conference.	BBC Northern Ireland programmes have won three awards at the Celtic Media Festival in the Republic of Ireland.
The toilet, in a busy park in Pudong New Area, will have 10 unisex stalls, plus some urinals and a stall for disabled people. The opening on 19 November will coincide with World Toilet Day. Unisex facilities will spare officials having to decide how to share out male and female stalls, say reports. "It is an apparent problem that women have to wait in lines for toilets," Fu Liping, an official involved in the project, was quoted as saying, by the Xinhua news agency. The stalls will be more spacious than regular ones. To guarantee safety and privacy, there will be attendants and higher partitions between stalls. But there are no plans yet to build more unisex toilets, as authorities are unsure whether citizens will embrace the idea. Their caution seem to be well-grounded, as people online have been less than enthusiastic about the unisex lavatory. "I don't really support the idea. After all, men and female are different," said Weibo user Zhu Zhu Xia. Another Weibo user said: "The problem will be solved if they build double female toilets."	Shanghai is trialling a unisex public toilet block to lower the time women have to spend waiting in queues, Chinese media have reported.
Kenneth Dymond, 37, also made contact with a 15-year-old girl over the internet. Lincoln Crown Court heard that more than 500 images were recovered from Dymond's computers and phones after a raid on his home in August 2015. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years. More on this and other Lincolnshire stories. Dymond of Magna Mile, Ludford, Lincolnshire, was serving as an detective constable in the Met's Specialist Crime and Operations Command at the time of the offences. Stephen Kemp, prosecuting told the court that the internet search history on Dymond's computers "identified various terms which indicated searches for material of a paedophilic nature". Mr Kemp added: "There were extracts of a Skype conversation recovered from a laptop which appeared to be from a 15-year-old girl's brother calling the defendant a paedophile. "That person threatened he would go to the police if the defendant did not delete his sister's profile." Reka Hollos, defending, said Dymond suffered from chronic depression and had undergone counselling for his addiction to pornography. "He is very remorseful for what he has done," she said. Judge Michael Heath, passing sentence, told him: "As a serving police officer you ought to know that children are grievously abused so that this material, this utter filth, can be put out there on the internet for people to view it. "I cannot suspend the sentence in a case such as this."	A detective serving with the Metropolitan Police has been jailed after admitting downloading hundreds of pornographic images of children.
The mythical ruler's legendary court has been associated with locations throughout Wales, including Carmarthen, St David's, and Cardigan. Now a retired Bangor University professor has revealed what he believes to be the true location of Camelot. And it turns out to be a small Roman fort at Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Prof Peter Field, a renowned expert in Arthurian literature, said:  "It was quite by chance. I was looking at some maps, and suddenly all the ducks lined up. "I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery." Previous best guesses for the location of the round table include Caerleon in Newport, Somerset's Cadbury Castle, and Tintagel in Cornwall. In Roman times, Slack was home to a fort called Camulodunum, which means "the fort of the god Camul". Over the years, well-recognised linguistic processes would have reduced Camulodunum to Camelot. Though almost forgotten and insignificant today, and even though it was abandoned and dilapidated by the relevant time of King Arthur around A.D. 500, Prof Field argues that this site at Slack would still have been considered a strategic stronghold. At that time, Celtic-speaking Britons, who could have been led by King Arthur, held the north and the west coast against the invading Anglo-Saxons. Slack, on the Roman road from Chester to York, would have been the ideal location from which to defend the east coast. Prof Field added: "If there was a real King Arthur, he will have lived around AD500, although the first mention of him in Camelot is in a French poem from the Champagne region of France from 1180. "There is no mention of Camelot in the period between those dates, known as the Dark Ages, when the country was at war, and very little was recorded. "In this gap, people passed on information, much got lost in transmission, and people may have made up facts or just messed up known information." Prof Field, who taught at Bangor from 1964 to 2004, has been researching the location of Camelot for the past 18 months. He spoke about his findings during the official launch of Bangor University's Stephen Colclough centre for the history and culture of the book.	The quest to find King Arthur's Camelot has puzzled and intrigued scholars and fans for over a thousand years.
The study says girls as young as 10 are forced to marry much older men in countries including Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Somalia. Save the Children says early marriage can trigger a cycle of disadvantage across every part of a girl's life. Conflict, poverty and humanitarian crises are seen as major factors that leave girls exposed to child marriage. "Child marriage starts a cycle of disadvantage that denies girls the most basic rights to learn, develop and be children," said Save the Children International CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt. "Girls who marry too early often can't attend school, and are more likely to face domestic violence, abuse and rape. They fall pregnant and are exposed to STIs (sexually transmitted infections) including HIV." The girl who said no to child marriage Europe struggles with migrant child brides Gambia and Tanzania ban child marriages Big money for Niger's child brides The report, called Every Last Girl, ranks countries based on the hardest place to be a girl based on schooling, child marriage, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and the number of women in parliament. Chad, Niger, Central African Republic, Mali and Somalia were ranked at the bottom of the index. The report says girls affected by conflict are more likely to become child brides. It says many refugee families marry off their daughters as a way to protect them against poverty or sexual exploitation. The charity used the example of a 13-year-old Syrian refugee in Lebanon it called Sahar - not her real name - who was married to a 20-year-old man. Now 14, she is two months pregnant. "The wedding day, I was imagining it would be a great day but it wasn't. It was all misery. It was full of sadness," Save the Children quoted her as saying. "I feel really blessed that I am having a baby. But I am a child raising a child." The report says girls also suffer during humanitarian crises such as the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone where the shutting down of schools led to an estimated 14,000 teen pregnancies. The UN children's agency, Unicef, estimates that the number of women married in childhood will grow from 700 million today to around 950 million by 2030. The Save the Children's report coincides with International Day of the Girl on Tuesday.	One girl under the age of 15 is married every seven seconds, according to a new report by Save the Children.
It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's "forensic" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was "the only one able to do that". He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. "I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround," Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. "The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled." However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. "The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it," he said. "And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. "Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies." But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. "We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default," said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. "It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. "And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too." Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it "plans to more aggressively encourage people" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. "When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece," chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. "I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing."	Apple has expanded its use of "two-step verification" checks to protect data stored online by its customers.

Media playback is not supported on this device England have won their opening two Six Nations games and face Ireland at home on Saturday before Wales' pivotal visit to Twickenham on 12 March. "We're undefeated in three games and it sets it up a massive game for two weeks time in Twickenham," said Warburton. "Everyone knows what is on that match. It's a match the fans want to see." Wales, who are chasing their fifth Six Nations Championship since 2005, are hoping for their their first back-to-back wins over England at Twickenham since 1978. Wales won their first game at Twickenham in 20 years in Warren Gatland's first game in charge in 2008 before winning the 2012 Triple Crown at English rugby's home in 2012. And British and Irish Lions skipper Warburton added: "We got a victory there last year in the World Cup. We went there in 2012 with this same bunch of boys and won so we've had good experiences at Twickenham." George North's try and 14 points from Dan Biggar's boot eased Wales to victory over France in Cardiff, adding to their opening draw against Ireland and win over Scotland. Media playback is not supported on this device After helping to send England out of the 2015 World Cup by beating them at Twickenham, Wales return there hoping for the first back-to-back wins since 1976 and 1978 Five Nations triumphs in west London. "The England games are honestly some of the toughest Test matches I've been involved in," said Warburton. "Twickenham is one of my favourite places to play rugby. It'll be a fantastic atmosphere and the England players will be highly motivated. "You haven't seen the best of us and I don't think you have seen the best of any side in the Six Nations this season." Warburton admitted the match was so boring he expected a Mexican wave to break out in the stands "I remember thinking on the pitch 'the fans are going to start a Mexican wave in a minute - it's pretty boring'," said the Cardiff Blues flanker. "Jamie Roberts just said to me walking on the pitch 'it was an ugly way to win at Test match'. "Defences are getting better and better every year. We're trying to score nice wide tries." "It's what we work on in training week in week out, but it's one thing doing it on the training pitch and another doing it in front of a highly skilled, motivated international team. "There's not much space on the field any more and it's sometimes down to individual brilliance." But while Warburton felt the game was "boring", coach Gatland was "happy" with the win. Gatland said: "I thought it was brilliant. It's what Test rugby is all about. We defended brilliantly in the second half. "Things we had worked on looked really good for us."	Captain Sam Warburton wants a "10% improvement" in Wales' possible Six Nations title showdown against England after their "ugly" win over France.
Benjamin Netanyahu's statement came after an emergency meeting of his cabinet and security chiefs. Alexander Levlovitz died in a car accident apparently caused by a rock-throwing attack in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, clashes between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters continued for a third day in the city. "On the eve of the Jewish new year, we once again saw how throwing stones can kill," Mr Netanyahu said in his statement. "These kinds of activities will be met with a very fierce punitive and deterring response." The government agreed to establish mandatory minimum penalties for those who "endanger human lives by throwing stones, fire-bombs and explosives". It also said it would introduce heavy fines on parents who allow their children to engage in violent rioting. Mr Levlovitz died and two passengers were reportedly injured after their car was pelted with stones on Monday. Police are investigating the incident. Separately, violence has again rocked the al-Aqsa mosque compound. The compound - known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif - is the holiest site in Judaism, and contains the al-Aqsa Mosque - the third holiest site in Islam. The compound is a source of religious and political tension between Israel and the Palestinians. It is a frequent flashpoint for violence. On Tuesday, police spokeswoman Luba Samri told AP that police entered the Al-Aqsa mosque compound early in the morning to disperse protesters who had stayed inside the mosque overnight. The protesters threw projectiles at officers, Ms Samri said, adding that two Palestinians were arrested and five police officers were slightly injured. Twenty-six Palestinians were injured on Tuesday, none of them seriously, the director of the Palestinian Red Crescent emergency unit, Amin Abu Ghazaleh, told Reuters. UN Special Envoy Nickolay Mladenov later warned that unrest in Jerusalem "may ignite violence beyond its walls". He also urged all leaders "to ensure visitors and worshippers demonstrate restraint and respect" at holy sites.	The Israeli prime minister has vowed to "use all necessary means" to stop stone throwers after an Israeli man died in a car crash linked to such an attack.
The girls were "touched inappropriately" in the Castaway Camp playground at the park in Windsor, Berkshire, on Thursday 11 August. Thames Valley Police refused to give the suspect's age or say where he was arrested, citing "safeguarding issues". The boy has since been released on police bail until 2 December. Police previously issued an E-fit of a suspect, who was described as a white man in his teens or early twenties. Officers said he was white, under 5ft 8in tall, wearing dark slim-fitting trousers, a dark t-shirt and trainers. Police began following up new leads in September after a reconstruction was shown on BBC One's Crimewatch. A 22-year-old man previously arrested on suspicion of carrying out the attacks was released without charge. Thames Valley Police said: "This is remains a live investigation and we continue to appeal for the public's help".	A boy has been arrested in connection with the sexual assault of two six-year-old girls during a trip to Legoland.
Hundreds of protesters gathered at the venue at the University of Illinois at Chicago hours before Mr Trump was due. Inside the auditorium, fighting broke out between supporters and protesters, who waved flags and chanted. A statement from Mr Trump's campaign said the candidate decided to postpone the event after meeting with police. In pictures: Chicago rally hit by protests What Trump says about protesters at his rallies However, a Chicago Police Department spokesman said the force had not recommended that Mr Trump postpone the rally. The clashes began more than an hour before the event was due to start, and continued after it was cancelled, minutes after Mr Trump was to have appeared. There were chants for Mr Trump from his supporters and for Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders from some of the protesters. There were several violent clashes sparked by Trump supporters attempting to wrestle flags from protesters. One protester had to be physically removed from the stage by what appeared to be a Secret Service agent. Violent clashes continued outside the venue, with helicopter footage showing chaotic scenes as police attempted to control the large crowds. One protester, student Ali Alhechimi told the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper: "This is a victory. This is an absolute victory. I want to thank everyone who showed up." The full statement from Mr Trump's campaign read: "Mr Trump just arrived in Chicago and after meeting with law enforcement has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonight's rally will be postponed to another date. "Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace." Speaking to Fox News after the events, Mr Trump denied using hate speech or playing any part in fostering division. "I represent a large group of people that have a lot of anger," he said. "There is tremendous anger out there on both sides." Discussing the decision to cancel the rally, he said: "I think it was a very good thing we did, I think it was an intelligent decision." It was supposed to be a political rally. Instead, many of the scenes resembled a bar-room brawl. Protesters had spent days planning the disruption, and they succeeded. The scenes inside the venue, where Trump supporters and protesters shoved and shouted at one another, were raw and angry. The two sides have one thing in common: rage. Many Trump supporters are disillusioned and disenfranchised by a political establishment they feel does not represent them. The protesters in turn perceive the tone and rhetoric of Mr Trump's campaign as racist and divisive. Will it harm the billionaire's election prospects? He may come across as the candidate who was denied the right to speak at his own political event. Or it may make voters wonder whether his entire campaign would be beset by rage. And if it comes down to a contest of angry Americans - are there more with him or against him? Why are Americans so angry? How extreme is Donald Trump? Could Trump's vulgarity cost him the nomination? The Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus supporting Trump Mr Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both called the incident "sad". "When you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence," Texas Senator Cruz said, "you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discourse." Staff at the university had earlier petitioned administrators to cancel the rally, citing concerns it would create a "hostile and physically dangerous environment" for students. A number of Trump rallies have been interrupted by protesters before. Earlier on Friday, 32 people were arrested after protests at a rally held by Mr Trump rally in St Louis, Missouri. Mr Trump was repeatedly interrupted by the protesters, whom he called a "disgrace". These latest clashes come just a day after a Trump supporter was charged with assault after multiple videos showed him punching a protester at a campaign rally in North Carolina. The billionaire later said that the supporter's actions were "appropriate".	Donald Trump has called off a rally in Chicago after protests against the Republican presidential front-runner led to violent clashes.

Corrie Mckeague, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds following a night out. CCTV images show the 23-year-old, believed to be from Dunfermline, Fife, walking through the streets of the town after he left friends. His uncle Tony Wringe said his nephew kept in close contact with his family. "He is a real fun guy. He is so close to his family and friends so this is out of character. He has a strong family support network," said Mr Wringe. He added the family was finding it "hard to deal with the uncertainty. That is the most difficult thing". Officers, supported by the RAF, Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue and the National Police Air Service helicopter, have been continuing to look for Mr Mckeague. He has not been seen since about 03:20 BST last Saturday. On Friday officers continued the search between Bury St Edmunds and Honington and said that over the weekend these ground searches will be expanded. Officers are also continuing to go through CCTV footage in a bid to find any sightings that may take the investigation forward. Anyone with information is asked to call Suffolk Police.	The uncle of an RAF serviceman who went missing a week ago has said his disappearance is "entirely out of character".
The 22-year-old won the BBC's Women's Footballer of the Year Award in 2015 before joining Arsenal from Liverpool. She helped the Gunners win the Women's FA Cup at Wembley in May 2016 and was recently awarded the African Women's Player of the Year Award. She also played for her country at the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada.	Nigeria winger Asisat Oshoala has left Women's Super League One club Arsenal Ladies to join Chinese side Dalian Quanjian.
Kev Brady from Gloucester said he was terrified as he paddled more than 200 miles (320 km) along the Mahaweli. He now aims to paddle the 800 miles (1,300 km) around the coast of the island of Sri Lanka. His previous feats include canoeing along the Mississippi and swimming the length of the River Severn. Mr Brady said he had suffered minor scratches and scrapes during the journey, but the most "frightening" thing was having to paddle past the crocodiles. "I was on my own and standing [on the paddle board] only 2in or 3in above the water. "I saw a two-foot long head pop up only 5m away from me. "These are saltwater crocodiles that can grow up to 6m long and are considered man eaters. "I was terrified." Mr Brady said he felt relieved to have finished the river challenge. "I was anxious and afraid most of the day and night, in between appreciating how beautiful and amazing it was. "So there was a lot of relief when I finished - relief I've still got both arms and both legs."	A paddle boarder faced man-eating crocodiles during his quest to travel from source to sea along the longest river in Sri Lanka.
The capital has had a representative in Super League since its inception in 1996 but London's side has never won the league title or the Challenge Cup. "London is a unique opportunity," Nigel Wood told BBC London 94.9. "It is almost inconceivable to consider yourself a national sport without having a strong presence in the capital. We just have to make sure that we get that presence right. "It is probably not right as it is and we need to work with all the stakeholders to improve that. "It is extremely important that we 'do London' and 'do London' well in terms of rugby league." Three separate attempts to introduce a professional rugby league club in London had been made in the 1930s with London Highfield, Acton & Willesden and Streatham & Mitcham. The sport returned to the capital in 1980 when Fulham FC chairman Ernie Clay announced the formation of Fulham Rugby League Club. London's team has had four name changes since then: Games have been staged at various venues around London, with Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and Twickenham Stoop among longer-term homes. Semi-professional side London Skolars were formed in 1995 while Hemel Stags join the ranks in third tier Championship One this season. London Broncos are England's sole Super League side south of Widnes while Hemel Stags, on the outskirts of London, have recently joined London Skolars among the semi-professional ranks. The numbers of people playing the game in London and the south have grown since the advent of Super League, but Sport England cut rugby league's funding by £10.1 million in December. Wood is keen that the sport continues to progress in the south of the country. "First and foremost, there needs to be a very easily understood plan," Wood added. "I think it is important we pull all the strands together to come up with a credible plan that the whole of the rugby league community in London can get behind and buy into. "Once we find that then I think the game has a chance to go from strength to strength. "It's not any one person's problem. It's our problem. "We will try and work with all of the key decision-makers within London rugby league and its environs to come up with a strategy that works." Rugby league was played professional in London in the 1930s, but the sport returned to the capital in 1980 when Fulham FC chairman Ernie Clay announced the formation of Fulham Rugby League Club. Since then, London's rugby league club has gone through four separate guises and played at a number of different sports venues in and around the capital. The franchise have finished in the bottom four in the table in each season since 2007 and the Broncos only secured their first victory of 2013 against Salford Reds last Friday, in what was their fifth game of the campaign. Broncos head coach Tony Rea said last year that, in time, the club could become the biggest in Super League and Wood says the RFL are committed to continuing to help the Broncos in their development. "Clearly they have got their challenges as a club at the moment and I know that [owner] David Hughes, [chief executive] Gus Mackay and Tony will be working as hard as they can," he said. "We have worked closely with the club in the past and we need to continue to do that. "There is a lot of rugby league played around London and we need a Super League club to sit on the top of that. It is almost inconceivable to consider yourself a national sport without having a strong presence in the capital. It is extremely important that we 'do London' and 'do London' well in terms of rugby league "But that is not a licence to occupy a place in Super League indefinitely. "There are standards that have to be maintained. "On-field success is one of those, as are other issues such as making sure there is a decent attendance so that everybody who engages with the club has a positive impression. "It is important to us and important to David and we are going to do the very best we can. "It is important that the Broncos could be credible, competitive and be contenders. "Most people would settle for that and an understanding they are making progress off the field with attendances and revenues that go with it. "The development side and the production of young talent has made remarkable strides over the last decade. "People judge the progress the club will make with what happens on the field with the first team. That's where we need to see some improvement if we can. "We'll help David as much as we can." The club, who were renamed London Broncos last year, have played at the Twickenham Stoop since 2006 following their affiliation with rugby union side Harlequins. Their average league attendances have dropped in the last four seasons and the Broncos face a dilemma over where their long-term future lies. In the years since their formation in Fulham in 1980, London's side have staged their home games at a plethora of venues across the city, including Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and the Twickenham Stoop, as well as staging one-off games further afield. The Broncos are looking to move ground ahead of next season, having decided against renewing their ground-share with rugby union side Harlequins. Wood says it is up to the owners to decide where to base the club. "The Broncos had have a concern over where they should be located in the capital," Wood said. "We need to make sense of that and within the club they need to work out where their location is best served. "There are pockets of activity in east London, some in the north and some out in Feltham where they train. "The club is privately-owned and ultimately they are responsible for the destiny and direction of the club. "The League will seek to assist and support and, where possible, provide counsel and advice. "But at the end of the day we have to stop short of being the people that make the decisions as we are just a governing body." While the Broncos have fostered dual-registration ties with London Skolars and Hemel Stags, Wood says it is also the RFL's responsibility to aid and encourage new clubs further down the leagues. Along with the Stags, Oxford and University of Gloucestershire All Golds are additions to the third tier Championship One this season and all three played their first competitive games at the weekend. "Fundamentally as a governing body, we have got an obligation to invigilate the rules and adjudicate between the clubs on an impartial basis," Wood said. 2009: 3,436 (13 games) 2010: 3,374 (13 games) 2011: 3,131 (13 games) 2012: 2,703 (11 games) "That is our first and foremost requirement. "Rugby league has always, because of its dependency on certain geographical areas, stepped out of that straitjacket. "We have said what more can we do to support the clubs that don't have the benefit of 100 years' worth of flourishing community game and or close neighbours who they can trade players with. "We have tried over the last decade to work with clubs - as we have in London and Wales and as we will do so with Hemel, Oxford and Gloucester - to understand that they have slightly different challenges. "It also presents fantastic opportunities. When you have a professional club in a new area they are frankly the only employment opportunity for certain players. "We try and work with those clubs without over-stepping our mark of impartiality."	The chief executive of the Rugby Football League says the governing body needs to improve its strategy in London.
The line from Llandudno Junction, Conwy, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, was shut after water reached platform level at North Llanrwst station. In Ceredigion, a tree has been removed from the line between Aberystwyth and Birmingham International after a reported landslip at Llanbadarn. Network Rail said it was "pulling out the stops" to keep services running. On Anglesey, speed restrictions remain in place around Gaerwen due to flooding. Network Rail said the situation would be monitored as more heavy rain is forecast for Wednesday. Wales route managing director, Paul McMahon said: "We're working really hard to keep services running, but unfortunately the Conwy Valley line will be closed for several days with flood waters having reached platform level at North Llanwrst. "Elsewhere in Wales the impact on services has been relatively limited so far. However, we are monitoring the situation very closely, and with more bad weather predicted it's really important passengers check before they travel, via the National Rail Enquiries website or by calling 03457 48 49 50." Four flood warnings are in place for north and south west Wales, along with dozens of alerts. Check if this is affecting your journey	The Conwy Valley rail route in north Wales could remain closed for several days after heavy rain caused flooding.
Colchester Hospital was rated as inadequate after a recent Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection found it was relying on "unsuitable" agency staff. Norman Betchley died in 2009 after he was mistakenly fed a pill by an agency nurse. The hospital said the CQC report did not reflect improvements it has made. Inspectors said the hospital demonstrated "poor leadership" and "only a limited capacity to improve". Staff were let down by agency workers, who were not as committed and were "unsuitable in terms of their skills and knowledge". Mr Betchley's daughter Linda said she feels angry that "nothing has changed" since he died. More on this story on BBC Local Live in Essex She added: "At the time they said there was a deficit in trained staff and there was a breakdown in management and the girl was thrown in at the deep end. "Many of the items raised in this most recent report were raised back then. I don't see them being addressed soon. "There is no leadership, there is no support for the actual nurses on the wards." Chief executive Frank Sims, who started in the role last month, admitted its biggest challenge is "reducing our dependency on agency staff." "We have got more staff employed now than we have ever had, and since September we have recruited 75 more qualified nurses but we have still got a long way to go." The trust which runs the hospital has been in special measures since 2013. The CQC has recommended it remains in special measures for the next three months, during which time it must submit a weekly improvement plan. Mr Sims said his intention is to "focus entirely on getting out of special measures this year".	The daughter of a man who died after a hospital failed it its "duty of care" said lessons have not been learned.
Ken Plowman and Leslie Kershaw were in their 20s in 1945, when they took part in the largest air assault in history. Flying Horsa gliders, they joined an armada of 3,000 aircraft landing 14,000 troops on the River Rhine's east bank. Darren Lewington, from Jet Age Museum, said: "They play down their heroics in such a way that it is truly humbling." Nearly 400 Horsa gliders were involved in the operation, in March 1945. Made by cabinet makers, with an 88ft (27m) wingspan, most of the wooden giants broke up on landing. "Flying a heavily laden, unarmed glider into enemy territory under intense fire was immensely brave," said Mr Lewington. "Casualties amongst glider pilots were as high as 30% but these two play down their heroics in such a matter-of-fact and unassuming way that it is truly humbling." In 2013, the Gloucester museum was awarded Â£9,000 to build a replica Horsa glider cockpit which is now nearing completion.	Two veteran RAF glider pilots have returned to the "cockpit" at a museum in Gloucestershire to mark the 70th anniversary of Operation Varsity.
Frank Field, who is backing the Leave campaign, will say the 23 June poll poses "an untold danger" for his party's prospects of power. The vast majority of Labour MPs back EU membership. Meanwhile former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson will tell union members that EU membership is "vital" for workers' rights. The UK's EU vote: All you need to know Mr Field, the MP for Birkenhead and a former welfare minister, is expected to warn in a speech that the referendum could be "the second-longest suicide note in Labour's history" - behind the manifesto that preceded its 1983 general election drubbing. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has expressed Eurosceptic views in the past, recently made his first major speech of the referendum campaign setting out a "socialist" vision for Britain in Europe. He said there was "nothing half-hearted" about Labour's campaign and said he would continue to make the case for membership in the run-up to polling day. But Mr Field will say: "The last thing Jeremy needs to do is to undermine further the traditional Labour vote, much of which wishes to leave the European Union. "For the party leader more actively to campaign for the Remain campaign will push even more Labour voters into the arms of UKIP." Mr Field, who campaigns for "balanced migration", will criticise an "open-door policy" which he says pushes down wages and puts a strain on public services. Ahead of the speech, Mr Field said Labour MPs' overwhelming support for staying in the EU was "very unrepresentative" of the views of many of the party's activists in the country at large. "While the polls show a majority of Labour voters support staying in Europe, about 40% do not and the number of MPs who represent that view are a mere handful," he told BBC Radio 4's Today. "It is our job to make a good case for leaving Europe so these voters feel that at last their views are being represented in the debate." The Leave campaign has targeted migration this week with interventions from Michael Gove and Boris Johnson as it attempted to regain the initiative following warnings about the economic effect of a vote to leave. Alan Johnson, who is leading his party's Remain campaign, will claim a vote to stay in the EU would be as important as the election of Labour's reforming government in 1945, which led to the creation of the NHS and expanded welfare. "From nurses and builders to railway workers, steel workers, postal workers and shop workers, trade unions will be campaigning for a Britain that remains in Europe," he will tell the Usdaw union's conference. "The rights of working people are protected by our EU membership, and Labour and our union movement are united in campaigning for Britain to remain in Europe." Elsewhere in the EU debate, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee published what it said was a "reliable, unbiased analysis" of the issues involved. The cross-party committee, which was divided on whether to back EU membership, said it had chosen not to endorse either side. Instead it urged voters to consider the UK's trading relationship with the rest of the EU and the rest of the world, its "international representation and reputation" and how the EU and its policies might develop in the future. Committee chairman Crispin Blunt said: "The referendum offers the British people a once-in-a-generation opportunity to chart a course for the UK's role in the world. "Voters should consider not only the short-term consequences of staying or leaving but the long-term opportunities and challenges."	Labour risks losing "a swathe" of voters to UKIP by campaigning to remain in the EU, one of its MPs is to warn.
The report warns that a failure to reintegrate returnees may lead to further radicalisation. Somalia's Islamist al-Shabab militants are believed to be recruiting heavily in neighbouring north-eastern Kenya. Kenya has seen a series of militant attacks with one at a university earlier this year killed 148 people. Although the report does not mention where the returnees came from, Deputy Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (Supkem) Hassan Ole Nadu has confirmed to the BBC that they were fighting for al-Shabab. The 36-page report was compiled by the IOM, Supkem and the Kenya's interior ministry. Researchers found that although most adults joined the group voluntarily, nearly a third of children interviewed said they were forced to enlist. The return of the youth, the report says, provides both "opportunities and threats for and to Kenyans". "On the one hand, they present an opportunity to counter the radicalising ideologies and recruitment strategies of armed groups," the report says. "On the other, the response of the security forces is widely perceived to be promoting further radicalisation as the returnees themselves believe that they are unsafe and have limited reintegration options." Security in the country was identified by participants as the main obstacle to their successful reintegration in the country. A total of 185 respondents were interviewed, representing nearly 30% of the estimated total of 684 returnees in the country. The majority were between 18 and 34 years old.	Nearly 700 recruits have returned to Kenya after quitting militant groups, a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) says.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the pilots were "guided by co-ordinates" from "Turkish partners". "There should not have been Turkish troops at those co-ordinates," he said. But the Turkish military insisted the troops had been at the building for 10 days and that Russia had been advised of their position on Wednesday. The two countries, which support opposing sides in Syria's almost six-year civil war, are working together to drive the Islamic State group from its last stronghold in Aleppo province. Turkish-backed rebel fighters have been besieging al-Bab from the north since December, while Russian-backed government forces are advancing from the south. Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to call his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to offer condolences after Thursday's air strike, which also wounded 11 Turkish soldiers. On Friday morning, Mr Putin's spokesman told reporters in Moscow that the causes of the incident were "clear". "Unfortunately, when carrying out strikes against terrorists, our military were guided by co-ordinates that had been handed over by Turkish partners," Mr Peskov said. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister, Numan Kurtulmus, meanwhile said the air strike was still being investigated. "According to initial information we received, it is a total accident," he was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency. "But how it happened and how the co-ordination was miscalculated will be clarified." The Turkish military subsequently issued its statement challenging Mr Peskov's account and stressing that the soldiers' position had been communicated the previous day to both officers at Russia's Hmeymim airbase in Syria and the Russian military attache in Ankara. The air strike came as rebel fighters clashed with pro-government forces near al-Bab for the first time since coming within firing distance of each other. Russia had to intervene to prevent further fighting at a village south-west of the town again on Friday, according to the Reuters news agency. Both sides view al-Bab as a prize, and it is not clear whether they intend to fight for control of it. The rebels have already entered the town's western outskirts, but pro-government sources told the New York Times on Wednesday that Russia and Turkey had agreed last month that government forces would enter the city, giving them access to a key water facility that supplies the city of Aleppo. Meanwhile, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that at least 38 civilians in al-Bab had been killed by air strikes and artillery fire by Turkish-led forces in the past three days.	Turkey's military has denied that it mistakenly told Russian warplanes to bomb a building in Syria on Thursday, killing three Turkish soldiers.
The 21-year-old has been playing in the Glasgow first team since 2012 and made his senior international debut the following year. Gray regularly partners brother and former Warriors lock Richie in Scotland's second row. "I'm very happy to be staying at Glasgow," the younger Gray told Glasgow's website. "It's my home club and I'm just glad I've had the opportunity to sign. "It's been a a fantastic few years development for me. When I was younger I always had the ambition to play for Glasgow and Scotland and playing in a Rugby World Cup has been a fantastic experience. "It's great to see [team-mate and fly-half] Finn [Russell] signing as well [for three years] and there is a lot of talent at the club and it's great to be a part of it. "Everyone works very hard and that just makes you want to improve as a player and improve the team as well. To have the opportunity to work with the coaches and players at the Warriors is fantastic. "Scotstoun is a fun place to be and everyone works hard for each other and the culture is great. "I used to go and watch my brother playing at Firhill and it's incredible to see the crowds growing since we moved to Scotstoun. The fans are really passionate and they make it a very special place to play." Gray has made around 60 appearances for club and country in his professional career and played in four of Scotland's five matches during their World Cup campaign, which ended at the quarter-final stage. And head coach Gregor Townsend said: "Jonny has made a huge contribution over the last couple of seasons and it's great news that he's staying with us for another three years. "He works very hard and has made the breakthrough for club and country over the last couple of years."	Scotland lock forward Jonny Gray has signed a new contract with Pro12 champions Glasgow Warriors until 2018.
The memory of the "Boy from Bassendean" - a suburb in the Western Australian state capital - is being erased by the local council. He has gone from favourite son to outcast by a simple show of hands at a council meeting. Harris's artworks will be taken down from its chambers and his status as a freeman has been rescinded, while a plaque outside his childhood home was stolen before the local authority could remove it. "We simply cannot tolerate the horrendous crimes for which he's been convicted," Bassendean Mayor John Gangell told ABC radio. And the backlash is spreading. In Melbourne a public mural, the "Entertainers of the Century" that features 100 prominent performers, will be changed to paint over Rolf Harris's cheery image. There is speculation, too, that Harris could be stripped of his Order of Australia award, one of the nation's most coveted honours. His conviction comes at a sensitive time for Australia, where the depravity of paedophiles is being scrutinised like never before. A royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse continues to uncover a terrible flood of atrocities, and could take years to complete its task. Justice Peter McClellan, who chairs it, believes that victims who have suffered alone for so long are finally coming forward because of high-profile court cases, including the conviction of Harris. "It is becoming apparent as we do our work that as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about, survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities," said Justice McClellan. "That which may have been kept secret for years may now be told. The burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence," he added. The law firm Slater & Gordon says since Harris's trial began it has been contacted by around a dozen women in Australia and New Zealand alleging they were molested by the TV presenter. "My understanding is that we're talking about assaults that occurred in those countries going back to the 70s and 80s," said lawyer Alan Collins. "Given what we heard in [Southwark Crown] court, a number of victims have suffered a very profound damage, I would have thought it highly likely that claims would be brought." Hetty Johnston, founder of one of Australia's most prominent child safety groups, Bravehearts Inc, raised the prospect of further charges against Harris. "Rolf Harris - icon to inmate. Victims vindicated. Hopefully when he comes out there will be more victims waiting to send him right back," Ms Johnston tweeted. Convicted by a court half a world away, 84-year old Harris has felt the full force of media outrage back home. The Australian has detailed "his most spectacular fall from cuddly establishment showman to jailbird," while the Sydney Morning Herald said he was "always an embarrassing curiosity rather than a national treasure". Harris was, the paper told its readers, a "mild colonial boy who simply went bad".	Australia is racing to distance itself from Rolf Harris as the shamed Perth-born entertainer starts a jail term for abusing young girls.
Resuming on 25-1 on day two, Lancashire batted throughout all three sessions to reach 311-8 at the close of play. England's Stuart Broad took 3-57, as did fellow paceman Jake Ball. But 55 from wicketkeeper Alex Davies, 48 from Alviro Petersen and then Livingstone's 63 not out helped the home side end the day on top. Coming in at number seven, at 156-5, with his side still 86 runs in arrears, Livingstone put on 72 for the sixth wicket with Davies. And the 22-year-old has so far put on a further 62 for the ninth wicket with Zimbabwean Kyle Jarvis, who ended the day also unbeaten on 36. Earlier, Warrington-born Steven Mullaney claimed the 50th first-class victim of his career on his old home ground when he had his former Red Rose team-mate, Lancashire captain Steven Croft, caught behind for 15. Lancashire batsman Liam Livingstone told BBC Manchester: "I found out I was going to play on Friday afternoon. It's been a very good day for me but also for the team. We're in a strong position. "There's still two days left in the game so we're looking at building as big a lead as we can, so that we can set attacking fields in their second innings. "A lot's been said that we've got a young squad but that doesn't mean that we're not talented enough to fill the gap left by Ashwell Prince. We're all working hard to try and prove people wrong." Notts fast bowler Jackson Bird told BBC Radio Nottingham: "Obviously, it's a pretty flat wicket but we did well to contain them. After the new ball lost its shine it was tough work. "It was disappointing we couldn't break that partnership. Once it got soft there wasn't much bounce or movement at all. "They're only 69 ahead so hopefully we can get these last two wickets early. We can still get a positive result. Hopefully the wicket will start to go up and down and maybe reverse swing will come into it. If we can get a reasonable lead, you never know on day four."	Lancashire youngster Liam Livingstone marked his first-class debut with an unbeaten half century to build a useful 69-run lead over Nottinghamshire.
Shahid Tarafdar, 45, was hit by a Peugeot 307 on Stockport Road at about 15:45 GMT on 7 February. He was taken to hospital but later died. Michael Joyce, 21, from Reabrook Avenue, Manchester has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Both have been remanded to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later. The teenager has also been charged with a number of other driving offences including driving whilst disqualified, failing to stop and report a collision and using a motor vehicle without insurance.	A 17-year-old boy has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, after a man died after he was hit by a car in Levenshulme.
Juhel Miah had flown to Reykjavik, Iceland, with the party from Llangatwg Community before boarding an onward flight to New York. But before the plane took off on 16 February, he was escorted off by security staff. BBC Wales has asked the US Embassy in London to comment. Neath Port Talbot council has written to the US Embassy to "express its dismay" at the treatment of Mr Miah, who the local authority said had a valid visa to travel. The school trip continued as planned but Mr Miah's removal left pupils and colleagues "shocked and distressed," a spokesman said. "We are appalled by the treatment of Mr Miah and are demanding an explanation. "The matter has also been raised with our local MP." The council confirmed Mr Miah has a British passport and does not have dual nationality. His family's ethnic background is Bangladeshi. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was "providing support to a British man who was prevented from boarding a flight in Reykjavik". Mr Miah, who teaches maths at the 700-pupil school, was also denied access to the US Embassy in Reykjavik, the spokesman added. "No satisfactory reason has been provided for refusing entry to the United States - either at the airport in Iceland or subsequently at the embassy. "Understandably he feels belittled and upset at what appears to be an unjustified act of discrimination." On 27 January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries, sparking numerous protests and legal challenges. A week later a federal judge in Seattle suspended it nationwide - a ruling which was later upheld at an appeals court hearing in San Francisco. Mr Trump is now considering a revised plan. Abdul-Azim Ahmed, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Wales, said he was "deeply troubled" by the incident. "What we do know is quite troubling and in the context of a school trip and the children being left with one less teacher because of this," he said. "This is the latest in a series of incidents where Muslims have been denied entry to the US which date before even Trump was elected." The school party returned to the UK on Monday after the week-long trip.	A Muslim teacher from Neath Port Talbot has been denied entry to the United States while on a school trip.
Now the 29-year-old has become one of the youngest people in Northern Ireland to hold a ministerial portfolio. She has only been an MLA for two years. So what is her background? In 2008, after graduating from Queen's University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in politics, Ms Sugden became an intern at the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. She subsequently took up an internship with the US Department of Health on the Washington/Ireland Program. In 2011, the former Coleraine High School pupil managed the late MLA David McClarty's election campaign when he stood as an independent in East Londonderry. She was co-opted onto Coleraine Borough Council in 2013 after Mr McClarty resigned his seat. Ms Sugden was Mr McClarty's parliamentary assistant for five years and he nominated her to take up his East Londonderry post when he became ill. After he died in April 2014, she became one of the youngest MLAs at Stormont when she took the vacated seat. Now living in Castlerock, the former prison officer's daughter has assumed ultimate responsibility for the Prison Service. The new justice minister has, in her own words, a "huge challenge" ahead of her, but her colleagues in the executive have given her a clear vote of confidence on her first day in the role.	Claire Sugden is used to being the youngest - she grew up in Coleraine with four older siblings - three sisters and a brother.
The 32-year-old was dropped in 2013 after playing nine Tests, amid reports he fell out with coach Andy Flower. He was recalled for last winter's series win in South Africa. "For some people cricket is a lifestyle. For me it's a job," he said. "Because I don't laugh and joke with the media or the opposition, that doesn't mean I'm intense." Batting at number three, Compton scored 245 runs at an average of 30 as England won 2-1 in South Africa, but his place for the first Test of the summer against Sri Lanka starting on 19 May is not certain. In his first spell in the Test side, Compton opened with captain Alastair Cook, averaging almost 32 in nine matches. "I don't think I'm far off cementing my place in the side," the Middlesex batsman told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra. "I felt really settled in the England team in the South Africa series. It was a good group of guys to be around - professional and relaxed. "I am an intense performer - I go out there and concentrate my hardest. The job of batting in the top three can be tough and I pride myself on my work ethic. "Off the field I am a different guy. I do have a lot of friends away from cricket and a lot of other interests. People don't always see that."	England batsman Nick Compton says his approach to the game does not make him an intense character.
Bethan Rhys Roberts hosts Ask the Leader on BBC One Wales at 19:00 BST on Wednesday. Kirsty Williams has been a member of the Welsh Assembly since it was created in 1999 - at 28, she was one of the youngest AMs elected. After the 2007 election, she successfully opposed her party entering into a so-called rainbow coalition with the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru in Cardiff Bay. The episode caused divisions in the party - which she ended up leading some 18 months later. Early on in her leadership Ms Williams launched Project 31 - a plan which would see the Welsh Liberal Democrats aim to win a majority of seats in Cardiff Bay. However, in her only assembly election campaign in charge so far - 2011 - the Lib Dems lost one of their six seats, and polls suggest they have a fight to keep the rest this time around. Despite leading the smallest party in the assembly, Ms Williams can take credit for getting Welsh Labour ministers to deliver Lib Dem policies such as increased school funding for poorer pupils as part of a deal to support the government's budget. Her reputation as a party leader may be enhanced - but the biggest challenge for Kirsty Williams is making sure that there are enough Lib Dem AMs re-elected to ensure that she has a party group to lead for the next five years. Thursday 14 April - Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Aberystwyth Friday 15 April - Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones in Llangollen Monday 11 April - Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies in Swansea Tuesday 12 April - UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill in Swansea Ask the Leader can be seen on BBC One Wales at 19:00 each day and on the BBC iPlayer.

The twin-engined CN235 transport plane came down in a rural area near the town of Codazzi, in Cesar province, having reported engine difficulties. Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos described the victims as heroes. An investigation into the cause of the crash has been ordered, says the commander of Colombia's air force, Gen Carlos Bueno. Colombian media reported (in Spanish) that local residents said the plane had been struck by lightning. All of those killed were members of the Colombian air force. The CN235 is manufactured by Airbus, who said in a statement that the plane concerned was produced in 1998 in Seville.	A Colombian air force plane has crashed in the north of the country, killing all 11 of those on board.
Cerberus bought the loan portfolio for £1.3bn in 2014. It paid a £15m "success fee" to the Brown Rudnick law firm for work it had done on the portfolio. Brown Rudnick also claimed it could help Cerberus "position itself effectively with key stakeholders". Cerberus chief operating officer Mark Neporent said Brown Rudnick claimed that they could get access to the executive via the Belfast law firm Tughans. "They told us they could get us access to other stakeholders... the Northern Ireland Executive, people in the Republic," he said. Mr Neporent is giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee in Dublin. Cerberus agreed to hire Brown Rudnick on 24 March 2014 and on 25 March the Cerberus chairman Dan Quayle met First Minister Peter Robinson at Stormont. Mr Neporent agreed with committee member Mary Lou McDonald that Brown Rudnick "were as good as their word"  in getting access. Nama, an Irish state agency, was established in 2009 to take control of billions of euro of bad property loans which were damaging the Irish banks. Controversy has surrounded the sales process. Brown Rudnick and Tughans had previously been working with another fund, Pimco, which was bidding for the portfolio. Pimco withdrew from the bidding process when it emerged that its fee arrangement with the firms was to involve a payment to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama advisor. Cerberus then engaged Brown Rudnick on what it terms "a success fee only basis", meaning a fee would only be paid if the deal was done. Brown Rudnick agreed to share the success fee with Tughans. Cerberus said it received "express confirmation" from both firms that no fee or commission was payable to any current or former Nama advisors.	The investment fund which bought Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio was told by a law firm that it could get them "access" to the NI Executive, an Irish parliamentary committee has heard.
Accident and emergency waiting times for patients have lagged behind other parts of the UK. Two years ago, a major hospital in Belfast, Royal Victoria, was said to be "at breaking point", as a backlog of patients built up and a major incident was declared. But, even with the latest provisional figures showing a decline in A&E performance, there is a determination among clinicians and nursing staff to draw a line and build a level of service to be proud of. There is evidence of a change of mood with the opening in August of an emergency department at Royal Victoria, part of a new Â£150m critical care facility. Doctors, bruised by the turmoil in the 2013-14 winter, have developed new ways of working, designed to speed the flow of patients through the system. It's early days, but there are some encouraging signs - in recent months, there has been a 10% year-on-year increase in the number of patients treated or assessed within four hours. The most recent data for November, though, shows an increase of five percentage points year-on-year. The hospital points out it has dramatically reduced the number waiting 12 hours or more. A key policy at the Royal Victoria is putting senior clinicians close to the "front door" of the emergency department. Their task is to quickly triage patients and send them through different treatment streams. Special report page: For the latest news, analysis and video Analysis: The lost beds problem Winter across the UK:  A guide to how the NHS is coping Video: Why hospitals are under so much pressure Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt The idea is to avoid a build-up of people waiting in reception. Badly injured or sick patients are dispatched through the system in the normal way, but a more sophisticated approach has been developed for those who are less seriously ill. A critical-assessment unit next to the emergency department receives patients, with the aim of dealing with their medical needs within the day. This could involve an initial appraisal and then sending a patient home for the night with an appointment booked the next day. Known as a "virtual ward", the idea is to carry out treatment without patients needing overnight stays, so reducing pressure on bed occupancy. Specialist equipment is made available to this unit, allowing doctors to order scans and other procedures to accelerate the patient's progress. Royal Victoria and other emergency departments are facing deep-rooted pressures. Northern Ireland does not have a 111 or NHS Direct helpline to guide patients, where appropriate, away from A&E towards other forms of treatment closer to home. And there are only a few minor injuries clinics to take the pressure off the major hospitals. The Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board has announced measures to boost GP out-of-hours services and promote alternatives to turning up at A&E. The NHS has to cope with long-standing health problems in some areas, including mental health, which can be linked to economic decline and deprivation. The integration of health and social care offers Northern Ireland the opportunity to tackle major problems common to all parts of the United Kingdom. Problems caring for the elderly at home and in their local communities have left most UK hospitals struggling to discharge patients and free up beds for new patients to occupy. Southern Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland is pioneering consultant-led care of the elderly in the community, offering, in effect, hospital care in a patient's own home. The service aims to treat at home patients with a wider range of acute illnesses. In its first year, the pilot service has prevented about 440 hospital admissions. With 1.8 million people, it will always be a challenge for Northern Ireland to sustain a full range of NHS services and specialist care. There is clearly a will to rise to that challenge, but no-one is denying the task may get harder with rising attendances at hospitals, an ageing population and complex health needs.	The NHS in Northern Ireland has not had a good press in recent years.
Remarkably, this year's finale features the two franchises who have waited longer than any other to win a championship. Cleveland's last title came way back in 1948. In ordinary circumstances a win for "the Tribe" would be a baseball fairytale: this year it would mostly be remembered for crushing Chicago's dreams. The Cubs, despite being one of the most popular and historic franchises in baseball, have not won a World Series title since 1908. They have not even played in the Fall Classic since 1945, when legend has it that a curse was placed on the team when a local tavern owner was asked to leave a game because the smell of his pet goat was upsetting other fans. Baseball is fond of hexes. The "Curse of the Bambino" - placed on the Boston Red Sox when they sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees - was blamed for the Red Sox's 86-year World Series drought, while the 1920 Black Sox betting scandal was fingered as the reason for the failure of the Cubs' cross-city rivals, the Chicago White Sox, to win a championship for 88 years. Media playback is not supported on this device But the Sox, red and white, finally came good in successive years a decade ago. The Cubs' winless streak stands at 108 years and counting. Various, possibly more likely, reasons have been advanced for the Cubs' epic failure, including playing more daytime games than most (which some believe denies the players the opportunity to settle into a rhythm), a failure to tap into Latin American talent and a poor system for developing young in-house stars. Some also believe the innate pessimism of the fans creates a counter-productive atmosphere of tension at their beautiful but capricious Wrigley Field home - where the wind can swirl unpredictably - when things get tense at the business end of the season. In 2003, the fan effect was more tangible when Steve Bartman covered himself in infamy by impeding a fielder's attempt to catch a key fly ball in a post-season game against the Florida (now Miami) Marlins. Needless to say the Cubs went on to lose the game, and the series and Bartman issued a public letter of apology. As he puts it on his Twitter feed: "Some people are remembered for a lifetime of great work, I'm remembered for five seconds." In 2008, a priest even sprinkled holy water in the Cubs' dug-out before their National League Division Series against Los Angeles. They did not win a single game, losing the best-of-five series 3-0. So why does 2016 finally promise something better? It seems the key was to make Theo Epstein president of baseball operations in 2011. He is now the highest paid manager in US sport, reportedly on a five-year contract paying more than $50m (£40.87m). Epstein had already tasted success at the Red Sox, relying on a scientific, analytical method to identify talent. He has repeated the process in Chicago, transforming a team that finished in last place in the National League Central Division for the first three years of his presidency. The batting line-up was the third most productive in the majors during the regular season. Dynamic infielders Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo both achieved the notable double of driving in more than 100 runs and hitting more than 30 home runs. But the Cubs' domination of their division, which they won for the first time since 2008 with three weeks of the season still to go, was primarily down to a group of pitchers as daunting as any seen in the major leagues in recent decades. The key measure of a pitcher's effectiveness is the earned run average (ERA) - the average number of runs they give up during a full nine-inning game. The Cubs' Kyle Hendricks posted the lowest ERA in the major leagues, and team-mate Jon Lester was second. The Cubs' bullpen - the group of relief pitchers who come into the game in the later stages when the starter has run out of steam - was also among the strongest in baseball. Sceptics thought the Cubs might again struggle to maintain their form into the postseason, but they eased past the San Francisco Giants 3-1 in the National League Division Series, and then came roaring back from 2-1 down to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. Just reaching the World Series prompted scenes of wild celebration. As David Haugh from the Chicago Tribune put it: "The reaction was visceral, the elation indescribable and the relief undeniable as a crowd of 42,386 fans unleashed 71 years' worth of frustration and disappointment." The Indians comfortably won the American League Central Division, despite losing their best hitter Michael Brantley to injury for most of the season. But with injuries to two of their key pitchers, few expected them to beat the Red Sox in the AL Division Series. In fact they swept the Sox, and went on to beat the Toronto Blue Jays in a low-scoring AL Championship Series. Deftly managed by Terry Francona, who won championships at Boston in 2004 and 2007, the Indians have proved themselves to be consummate battlers this year. Reaching a World Series is an impressive achievement for a franchise with one of the smallest payrolls in baseball. But many expect the Cubs to end their years of pain - if they can overcome their internal demons, and a smelly goat.	The Chicago Cubs will be hoping to end the most infamous run of failure in US sport when they face the Cleveland Indians in the World Series, which starts on Tuesday.
Daniel Braxton was driving through Towyn, Conwy county, with his 18-year-old daughter at 07:15 BST on Tuesday. She thought she saw a dead baby in the bus stop near the Magpie and Stump pub and screamed at her father to drive back to check, which he did. Mr Braxton, 35, said he saw the lifeless naked baby on the ground, with her umbilical cord still attached. "We blocked the road off and rang the emergency services," he told BBC Radio Wales. "I had a dressing gown in the car and ran to grab that, wrapped the baby up, gave her some good hard rubs on the chest and the head. "She took one big gulp of breath and opened her beautiful little eyes." Mr Braxton, who is originally from Birmingham and living in nearby Pensarn, said they guessed that the baby was less than one hour old. "To be honest, I think the fatherly instinct and the adrenaline kicked in because my daughter was hysterical and my partner was hysterical," he added. "So it was just a case of as soon as I saw her lying there, her naked little body just left on cold concrete, I knew something had to be done." Mr Braxton said police have told him that the baby has "stabilised and is on her way to a full recovery". Police are concerned about the welfare of the baby's mother and have urged her to come forward. Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said: "We are concerned about the health of the mother of the baby girl and are appealing for her to come forward. "Alternatively, if anyone knows who the mother is or can provide any information which may assist in identifying her please contact North Wales Police. "We want to ensure that the mother is provided with the medical support she needs."	A man has described how he managed to revive a lifeless newborn baby which was found in a bus shelter.
Kane scored both goals as Spurs came from behind to secure a 2-1 win over Arsenal at White Hart Lane. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said England should select Kane, 21, after scoring 22 goals in 34 matches this season. And former England international Murphy added: "Not just selected, but build the team around him." Murphy, speaking on Match of the Day, added: "He's so young, but he's so powerful. "I'm struggling to see a weakness in the lad's game." Wenger said: "When you have scored the number of goals he has scored, if you don't put him in there somebody else will give him a passport." Media playback is not supported on this device Hodgson was in attendance at White Hart Lane as he continues his preparations for England's next European Championship qualifying fixture against Lithuania on 27 March, before a friendly against Italy four days later. Kane, who is also eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland through his father, has represented England at every level from Under-17 to Under-21, and has previously stated his desire to break into the senior England squad. Hodgson has used Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney in attack for England's previous four fixtures, but can now call on Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge, who has returned from injury, and the in-form Danny Ings at Burnley and QPR striker Charlie Austin. Both of Kane's goals on Saturday came in the second half as his close-range finish following a corner and well-taken header turned the game around after Mesut Ozil's close-range finish opened the scoring for Arsenal in the first half. "Harry showed today that he is a great player, with a great performance, but my idea is that he can improve still and we need to push him to develop his potential because his potential is massive, but it was a fantastic performance today," said Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino. Kane told BBC Sport: "It's my first north London derby and it was incredible. I watched so many as a kid and the feeling now is one I can't describe and won't forget. I'm happy for the team and the club. It is a special day. Media playback is not supported on this device "I am working on all aspects of my game and when I get in those areas I am confident. I am enjoying my football at the moment and playing with a smile on my face. "It [the next England game] is not until March and there is a lot of football to play before then. I have just got to keep doing what I am doing and do my best for the team, and we will see what happens."	England manager Roy Hodgson should build his team around Tottenham striker Harry Kane, according to ex-Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy.
Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time. Specialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said. Earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home. "In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex," National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement. There were also reports of gunfire. The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said. The incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections. The deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month. While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes. However, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.	A man armed with a machete has forced his way into the rural home of Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto after wounding a police guard, police say.
KLM has added a 06:00 weekday flight from the Highlands airport and an evening flight from Schiphol. Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (Hial) said the flights would allow people to spend a full day in the Netherlands before returning home. It is the latest addition from KLM since it started Inverness-Amsterdam flights last year.	New scheduled flights have been introduced between Inverness and Amsterdam.
The final member of the family, a male marmoset called Gomez, was found by police on Monday, having been abandoned on a vets' doorstep. A female and a baby were retrieved on Sunday, and are already back at Symbio Wildlife Park, south of Sydney. Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of dealing with proceeds of crime. Brothers Jesse and Jackson George are not believed to have snatched the monkeys from their enclosure, but they were charged with trying to profit from the theft. Pygmy marmosets - the world's smallest monkey species - command up to A$5,000 (Â£3,000, $3,700) on the black market. Police found the men after a tip-off from the public. A desperate appeal for information had been launched by the zoo, amid fears that the baby marmoset would die within 48 hours if unable to feed from its mother. The four-week-old was found when the Georges' car was pulled over at Appin, southwest of Sydney. The female marmoset was found about 20km (12 miles) away in the Campbelltown area. Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the brothers had exchanged marmoset pictures with a third person via mobile phone, along with messages about how much a monkey could sell for. "Ay, check out my monkey," wrote the third person, according to court documents. "That's mad bro. Wanna sell it bruh?" Jackson George replied. The baby marmoset is now home and well, said Symbio Wildlife Park, after they reunited it with its mother. "Mum cradled the baby straight into her arms and bub immediately began to feed," the zoo wrote in a statement on Facebook. Police say they are continuing their investigation into the theft.  The zoo said the marmoset enclosure is currently closed "to give the family privacy".	Three rare pygmy marmosets have been rescued and are set to be reunited, after being stolen from a Sydney zoo at the weekend.
NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh says he worries they will put vulnerable people "at risk", while chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says they will "inevitably lead to patients suffering" and Health Minister Ben Gummer claims they will be put in "harm's way". It's easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute. It means as well as downing tools for their routine duties, medics will walk out of A&E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others. But will the reality of the all-out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put them at risk. And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place. The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks. The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what they need and put plans in place. This has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory . And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope. This is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work. GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on-the-day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead-up to the strike to think carefully about how they use the health service during the stoppages. The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying they are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place. In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A&E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as they will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult. Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors. Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08:00 to 17:00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days. Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x-rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge. Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, their skills may be a little rusty or they may simply not know their way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption. However, that doesn't mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot. It concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene. If they aren't there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked.  And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter. It was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. He wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days "would always wonder" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be "irreparably damaged", he warned. This blog was first published on 15 April, but has since been updated to take into account subsequent developments. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter	The warnings about the forthcoming all-out junior doctor strikes have been coming in so thick and fast that you could be forgiven for thinking it will be Armageddon.
Seal wardens on the National Trust (NT) reserve at Blakeney Point have recorded 180 more grey seal pups compared to this time last year. Coastal ranger Ajay Tegala said the location is a "fantastic" breeding site as "human disturbance is minimal." Mr Tegala predicts up to 1,800 pups could be born by the end of February. "The seals like Blakeney Point as it has beaches and dunes which are safe and easy places to have a pup with no predators," he said. Last year, 1,566 pups were counted during the four month breeding season at Blakeney Point, a split of shingle and sand jutting out into the North Sea. Seals have been breeding on the site since about 2001, when just 25 were recorded. Pup numbers reached over 1,000 for the first time during the 2012-13 breeding season, with newborns now increasing by about 25% year-on-year. Blakeney has become well known for its seals with thousands of tourist taking boat trips to see the colonies each year. Mr Tegala said: "We do a pup count twice a week and comparing this year to last year we're almost 200 ahead so it looks like the number will continue to increase and another record-breaking year is on the cards." Source: BBC Nature Visitors have been flocking to the north Norfolk coast to see the seals, prompting the NT to warn people to keep their distance and keep all dogs on leads.	More than 900 seal pups have been born on a north Norfolk nature reserve in the last three weeks giving experts hopes of another record breaking year.
The Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective (Garc) is protesting against an agreement aimed at resolving a long-running dispute in the area. They are planning to stage a protest on Friday night. However, a community advert placed in the Irish News said the protest would not help ease tensions. Among the signatories are politicians, academics and sporting organisations as well as the Catholic Bishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor, and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Connor, Alan Abernethy. It stated: "We believe this is the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to resolve an issue, which has divided our community for many years. "It is our view the introduction of another evening parade, no matter what part of the community it comes from, would inevitably and regrettably, whether intentional or otherwise raise tensions, damage community relations, and has the potential to end in confrontation and undermine a long sought after resolution." The agreement to which Garc is opposed was announced last week between the Orange Order and the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (Cara). The group is billing its protest as a "march and rally to oppose ongoing sectarian parades and SF/UVF deal (Sinn FÃ©in/Ulster Volunteer Force)." The SDLP has not added its name to the advert. However, in a statement SDLP North Belfast MLA Nichola Mallon said: "There are genuine frustrations and fears in this community as the weekend approaches. "However, it is also important that people express their views and feelings in a responsible manner. "Our advice to Garc is to reconsider their planned parade this Friday, to take a step back and act in the interests of peace in our community." The Parades Commission has granted permission for Garc to hold their parade on Friday evening subject to a number of conditions -  including directing it away from "part of the notified route between Ardoyne Road or Crumlin Road". Permission has also been granted for Garc to hold a protest parade on Saturday morning. Garc spokesperson Damien 'Dee' Fennell attended the launch of dissident republican party Saoradh on Saturday 24 September, and Garc has been consistently highly critical of Sinn FÃ©in.	Church leaders have appealed to a nationalist residents' group to call off a protest against an Orange Order parade in north Belfast.
Regina Edwards, 52, strangled Priscilla Edwards, 78, with a scarf in February, the Old Bailey heard. Edwards, who lived in Plumstead, south London, had a history of mental health problems. In 1995 she was convicted of stabbing one of her daughters in the leg. She has been sentenced to life with a minimum of 10 years. During a phone call to a family member soon after her mother's body was found at her house in Kirkham Street, Plumstead, Edwards said: "I did it, it was me." Priscilla, a former midwife, was suffering from dementia at the time of her death. After her 1995 conviction, Edwards - who has a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder - spent ten years in a psychiatric unit under the care of Oxleas Mental Health Trust. She was discharged in 2006. Judge John Bevan, who said there was a "serious risk" she would attack someone again, ordered Edwards be returned to a secure hospital. If she is deemed suitable for release from psychiatric care within 10 years, she will be kept in jail until eligible for parole. In statements, Edwards's family said they felt "hurt and extremely angry" and pleaded for her to stay locked up. They expressed anger at the acceptance of her plea of diminished responsibility, but felt it was inevitable. Judge Bevan said: "The daughters argue the defendant should be in secure accommodation indefinitely and express considerable concern about the Bracton Centre, where she is at the moment, because they live in the area and in the past she absconded and visited the home. "There is real fear for their security when she is not taking her medication."	A woman who strangled her mother because she thought she was a "witch" has pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
Felix Alexander, from Worcester, was 17 when he was hit by a train on 27 April last year. His mother Lucy Alexander has set up The Felix Project, launched at Pershore High School on Monday. The programme aims to help teachers spot the signs of a child being victimised and to train pupils to give peer support. See more stories from across Herefordshire and Worcestershire here It is being run by the children's charity Place2Be. Ms Alexander said: "I carry huge guilt that I did not say more when he was still alive and I feel compelled to give him a voice now." Advice she gave out to the Pershore pupils included some words on banter, saying it is only funny if people are secure in their friendships. Pershore High head teacher Clive Corbett backed the scheme, which Ms Alexander hopes will become embedded in the school curriculum. "We will train pupils to be what we call a peer mentor, and also staff from this school and other schools to make sure we are providing training for them," he said. "However well we feel we might do, we clearly can do things better." Speaking after the event, a couple of the pupils said Ms Alexander was "inspirational". She previously said her son was subjected to "cruel and overwhelming" taunts on social media, which eventually became unbearable. An inquest heard he made friends at Pershore High School, where the staff described him as bright and kind, after facing difficulties at his previous school.	The mother of a teenager who took his own life because of online bullying has set up a programme to tackle the issue.
Tom Westley (57) and Ravi Bopara (61) made half-centuries but lacked support from the rest of their top order. Just before tea, visiting captain Mark Cosgrove removed Bopara, chopping one of his medium pacers on to the stumps. Bad light brought play to an early end with Essex on 266-9 - Charlie Shreck (4-79) the pick of the bowlers.	Division Two leaders Essex made a faltering start as Leicestershire's bowlers restricted them with wickets throughout the opening day.
It will be the robot's first foray into healthcare after previous deployments in shopping centres, banks and train stations. One hospital plans to deploy more robots over the next 10 years. Some experts have questioned the usefulness of social robots such as Pepper. Softbank, the company behind Pepper, and partner French robotics firm Aldebaran have seen huge success with the creation, with each batch of 1,000 selling out fast in Japan. The hospital-based robots will be significantly more expensive than the $1,850 basic model with a $34,000 (Â£24,000) price tag. This will include specially designed software from Belgian firm Zora Bots, as well as access to the helpdesk should issues arise when Pepper is on duty. The 1.2m (4ft) tall robot can recognise the human voice in 20 languages and can detect whether it is talking to a man, woman or child. In the CHR Citadelle hospital in Liege, Pepper will remain in the reception area but, at the AZ Damiaan hospital in Ostend, it will accompany visitors to the correct department. The Liege hospital wants to become one of the world's most futuristic over the next 10 years. "It's about architecture, future rooms and robots, the ones we already have and the ones we're going to get," said CHR Citadelle's communication director Nathalie Evrard. Both hospitals already use the smaller Nao robots, also made by Softbank, in both their paediatric and geriatric wards. The little robots assist in exercise sessions and help children overcome their fears of surgery, sometimes going to the theatre with them. Some remain sceptical about how useful Pepper can be in both homes and commercial settings, with robotics expert Prof Noel Sharkey previously telling the BBC: "It is good at conveying human-like gestures but the way it detects human emotions might be over-hyped."	Pepper, the humanoid robot programmed to "understand" human emotions, is to take a new job - as a receptionist in two Belgian hospitals.
Barcelona said it paid €57m (£43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to €83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received €40m and his former club, Santos, was paid €17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40% of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received €6.8m of Santos's €17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: "They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice." The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated €13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus. But the 23-year-old has also encountered legal difficulties in Brazil, where a court has frozen $47m (£33m) of his assets in connection with suspected tax evasion between 2011 and 2013.	Brazilian football star Neymar has appeared in court in connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to FC Barcelona.
The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September. Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects. The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said. "Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement. "They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings. "The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit." Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings. Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions. The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty. However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation. The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment. The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand. He had previously rejected offers of assistance. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds. Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.	UK police are to return from Thailand after reviewing an investigation into the murders of two British tourists, Scotland Yard has said.
It is thought the body was dumped some time between 21:00 BST and midnight on Sunday, just off the A628 at Tintwistle, near Glossop, Derbyshire. Police are liaising with Europol, as the unidentified victim could be a foreign national. A member of the public discovered the remains on Monday. At a press conference, a police spokesman said a witness saw a fire close to the road on Sunday. Live updates and more from Derbyshire. Assistant Chief Constable Bill McWilliam told reporters he was "pretty satisfied this poor individual" was not murdered in the lay-by. Mr McWilliam said: "We are working with other forces to ascertain whether our victim may have been reported missing in a neighbouring county but we recognise he might not have been reported missing at all. "I recognise this must be a very shocking incident for either people who live in the area or frequent the area for recreation." Post-mortem examinations revealed the body belonged to a white man under the age of 50, but no DNA matches have been found on the national database. The cause of death is still unknown. Police have urged anyone who may have information about the man's identity to contact them. Officers would also like to hear from anyone who was in the area on Sunday night or who travels regularly along the A628 between Tintwistle and the Flounch roundabout. A murder inquiry began on Tuesday after the man's remains were found, led by officers from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit.	The badly burned body of a man found in a lay-by near the Peak District had its head and limbs missing and was stuffed in a suitcase, police have said.
The fold-out note, penned by Lennon when he was 11 years old, thanks his Aunt Harriet for presents she gave him, including a book about ships. He sent the thank you message shortly after Christmas in 1951 to his mother Julia's younger sister. During his Beatles career, Lennon often wrote to friends and family but this is understood to be his first letter. In the letter, which has a few grammatical errors, the young Lennon says how much he is enjoying reading a book about famous ships. He wrote: "Dear Harrie Thankyou for the book that you sent to me for Christmas and for the towel with my name on it, And I think it is the best towl (sic) I've ever seen. "The book that you sent to me is a very interesting one. I am at the bottom of page 18 at the moment. The story is famous Ships its all about a man called Captain kidd the pirate. "I am on the second chapter, the first chapter is called the Victory and the second is called the Mary Celeste. "Thankyou for the red jumper that you sent to me. "I hope you have a happy new year. Love from John x" The letter - which was formerly the property of his cousin David Birch, Harriet's son - is to be sold at an online auction that closes on 3 April. The auction contains around 300 lots of Beatles and music memorabilia, including the address book from Liverpool's Cavern Club where the group played many gigs, and a collection of records that were previously owned by Lennon.	The earliest known letter written by John Lennon is expected to fetch more than £30,000 at auction next month.
The 22-year-old has not appeared for Shrewsbury this season, but has played once for Mansfield Town and four times for Wrexham while on loan. Bolton youth product Caton has also played for Blackpool and has loan spells with Accrington and Chester before joining Shrewsbury in 2014. Caton follows Jamie McCombe, 33, in signing for the National League side. The centre-back, who played 101 games for the club during his first spell, has left Stevenage and signed a contract until the end of the 2016-17 season.	Lincoln City have signed Shrewsbury winger James Caton on loan until the end of the season.
On Wednesday East Northamptonshire Council backed plans to add a further five restaurants to the unbuilt Rushden Lakes complex. In all, the development at the old Skew Bridge ski club site in Northamptonshire will now boast eight restaurants. Planners also approved proposals for an additional 154 car parking spaces. The original plans had catered for a 1,300-space car park. The complex will feature a home and garden centre, shops, a drive-through restaurant, lakeside visitor centre, restaurants and a boathouse. Marks & Spencer is expected to be the anchor store. It is predicted to create 2,000 jobs. The development had been approved by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles following a public inquiry after concerns about its impact on nearby town centres. The matter had been referred to Mr Pickles, who called in the application for further scrutiny. Developer LXB Retail Properties submitted its original application for the derelict brownfield site in 2011.	Proposals to increase the size of a Â£50m shopping and leisure development have been approved.
Hadleigh Parkes and Gareth Owen went over for the Welsh side in the first half and Scarlets were good value for their 15-9 lead at half-time. But three Ian Madigan penalties kept Leinster within touching distance and they dominated the second half. Mike Ross' close-range try and Madigan's conversion soon after the restart put Leinster into the lead and another Madigan penalty capped the win. Leinster coach Leo Cullen had named a completely new starting XV for the game against the league leaders, his options boosted by the return of half-a-dozen Ireland internationals. Scarlets also had returning World Cup stars, with scrum-half Gareth Davies returning to the fold after Wales duty. The Welsh side took an early grip with a series of drives at the Leinster line that allowed centre Parkes the space to barrel over, his try converted by Dan Jones. Leinster responded to put Scarlets under pressure, with lock Jake Ball sin-binned for overstepping the boundaries during some frantic defence. In his absence Leinster closed the gap with two Madigan penalties, although they lost Rob Kearney to injury and there could be a nervous wait to see if the Ireland full-back is fit for Europe next weekend. Back to full strength, Scarlets stretched away again as number eight John Barclay joined the line to put Owen away for an unconverted try. Madigan added a third penalty but Jones responded in kind to ensure Scarlets took a six-point lead into the break, although it could have been more with Aled Thomas wide with a long-range kick. As well as Scarlets had played, they found themselves behind for the first time within five minutes of the restart as Ross went under almost under the posts for a converted try after a series of forward drives. Media playback is not supported on this device Johnny Sexton come off the bench for the home side, with the Ireland fly-half slotting in at centre outside Madigan. The combination almost produced a decisive try as Sexton loped away to the line, only to be denied by a crossing call confirmed by video replays. But Madigan added his fourth penalty to give Leinster a four-point cushion, although Scarlets at least had the consolation of a losing bonus point despite being dominated in the second half. Scarlets coach Wayne Pivac told BBC Radio Wales: "I'm very disappointed, I thought the boys played very well. I'm disappointed the breakdown was refereed one way, I thought. "The stream of penalties against us [made the difference], I thought we got into some really good positions over the ball and every other week we're getting penalties for that. "From where I was sitting, we got into some great positions for turnovers and didn't get the rewards... It should have been seven wins. "I don't think it takes anything out [of the season's momentum], the boys know they can compete with these sides now away from home. "That was the pleasing side of it, that we had an opportunity to win the game at the end but we probably blew it really. We got in behind them when Maselino [Paulino] had the big break and we bombed a try." Leinster: Rob Kearney; Zane Kirchner, Garry Ringrose, Noel Reid, Cian Kelleher; Ian Madigan, Isaac Boss; Cian Healy, James Tracy, Mike Ross, Devin Toner, Tom Denton, Dominic Ryan, Sean O'Brien, Jamie Heaslip (capt). Replacements: Bryan Byrne, Jack McGrath, Marty Moore, Hayden Triggs, Dan Leavy, Luke McGrath, Johnny Sexton, Ben Te'o. Scarlets: Aled Thomas; Tom Williams, Gareth Owen, Hadleigh Parkes, Michael Tagicakibau; Dan Jones, Gareth Davies, Rob Evans, Emyr Phillips, Peter Edwards, Jake Ball, Lewis Rawlins, Aaron Shingler, James Davies, John Barclay (capt). Replacements: Ken Owens, Dylan Evans, Will Taylor, Tom Price, Maselino Paulino, Aled Davies, Michael Collins, Harry Robinson. Referee: Leighton Hodges (WRU). Assistant referees: Leo Colgan, Olly Hodges (IRFU). Citing commissioner: Wayne Sheridan (IRFU). TMO: Seamus Flannery (IRFU).	Scarlets had their 100% Pro12 record ended by Leinster at the RDS in Dublin.
Mostly they land upright with a reassuring thud on the crash mats. There are dozens of children taking part. Kirkcaldy gymnastics club is noisy and life-affirming. It's a strange place to find a dying man. Gordon Aikman has motor neurone disease (MND). He was diagnosed at 29. This cruel condition is shutting down his body. There's neither a cure nor an effective treatment. But Gordon refuses to give in without a fight. He's raising money for research and campaigning for better patient care. His old gymnastics club is donating Â£700. Gordon competed for and coached at Kirkcaldy. It's January 2015 - seven months after doctors gave him the devastating diagnosis. He can still walk with a crutch and he drove himself here from Edinburgh. But his days as a gymnast are behind him. "It's difficult" he says. "I've looked back at pictures of me doing handstands and cartwheels and I love exercise and sport. "And I still dream of being able to run but I can barely walk, so it's a dream I'm not going to realise again." Throughout 2015, Gordon's physical condition deteriorates. He has to give up driving. An electric wheelchair replaces his crutch. Carers help him feed, wash and dress. And there's worse to come. "The thing that I'm most scared of is losing my voice," he says. "I think that would be incredibly difficult. So, not only are you paralysed, unable to move, you're then suddenly not able to communicate and speak." As an insurance policy, Gordon banks speech samples with an Edinburgh university team who are developing a voice synthesizer. He also secures new rights, for all those who lose their speech, to access voice technology. As Gordon's body weakens, his campaign - Gordon's Fightback - is going from strength to strength. It's on course to raise Â£500,000 for MND research. It has convinced the Scottish government that the NHS, rather than charity, should fund a team of specialist MND nurses and double their number to 12. Gordon's inspiring example has been widely recognised. His awards include the British Empire Medal, an honorary doctorate from Edinburgh University and the Public Campaigner of the Year title at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards. Yet Gordon is modest about his achievements. "It's what I could do," he says. "It's what I could give back. It's how I could make a difference". Gordon Aikman's story is told in a new BBC television documentary. The Fight of Gordon's Life will be broadcast on BBC1 Scotland at 20:30 on Monday.	They run, jump and hurl themselves through the air.
Friend, who cut his face, was treated in the tunnel before being taken to hospital, where he stayed overnight. The incident happened as the first half came to an end at the Vitality Stadium. Friend was due to take charge of Southampton and Sunderland on 5 March but concussion protocols mean he will not now do so. The start of the second half was delayed by five minutes as Friend was replaced by Dean Treleaven, a qualified referee who was watching the match. "I was on the bench and he came to us and he fell against the dugout, with his nose, and then fell to the ground," said Saints boss Ronald Koeman. "For maybe five seconds, he was out of everything." Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe, whose side won 2-0, added: "I saw him collapse. I saw him very dazed and shaken."	Fourth official Kevin Friend has been released from hospital after collapsing and hitting his head in Tuesday's game between Bournemouth and Southampton.
Singer Bono said: "We've lost a family member," adding, "He wasn't just a legend in the music business, he was a legend in our band." Sheehan had been on the road with U2 for more than 30 years. The band are in the middle of their latest tour and are currently playing a string of concerts in Los Angeles. They paid tribute to Sheehan on the video screens at Wednesday night's show, said Billboard reporter Shirley Halperin. As he introduced the song Iris, from their latest album Songs of Innocence, Bono said: "U2 is kind of family. We look after each other and it takes a lot to put on a show like tonight. "Last night we lost a member of our family. Dennis Sheehan was his name. He was U2's tour manager for 33 years. He loved, as we all do, the city of Los Angeles and he called the Sunset Marquis his 'home away from home'. "He came to this city as a young man in the 70s, working for Led Zeppelin. He always thought maybe U2 could be the next Led Zeppelin, which of course is impossible." Sheehan, who was in his late 60s, had worked with other rock legends including Iggy Pop, Patti Smith and Lou Reed. Los Angeles County Fire Inspector Chris Reade said a medical response team was sent to the Sunset Marquis hotel at around 0530 (1330 GMT) on Wednesday to reports of a man in cardiac arrest. Sheehan was pronounced dead at the scene. Global Music Live Nation chairman Arthur Fogel confirmed the death calling Sheehan "a dear friend to us all". "Our heartfelt sympathy is with his wonderful family," he added. Sheehan's death is the latest in a series of recent woes for U2. Last year, Bono underwent extensive surgery following a high-speed bicycle crash, leaving him unable to play the guitar. Guitarist The Edge then fell off stage on the opening night of the band's tour in Vancouver, gashing his arm. The band were also derided when Songs of Innocence was automatically uploaded into customers' iTunes libraries. Bono later apologised, saying the stunt was inspired by "a drop of megalomania".	Irish band U2 have mourned the death of their "irreplaceable" tour manager Dennis Sheehan, who has died of a suspected heart attack.
The US economy added 215,000 jobs in July, while the unemployment rate held at a seven-year-low of 5.3%. The Dow Jones closed down 46.37 points at 17,373.38, while the S&P 500 dropped 5.99 points to 2,077.57. The tech-focused Nasdaq index fell 12.90 points to 5,043.54. Although the number of jobs added in July was slightly below expectations, the figures for May and June were revised upwards by 14,000. Among individual stocks, Groupon fell 5.34% after the daily deals website reported disappointing revenue growth. Second quarter revenues rose 3.1% to $738.4m, which was below expectations. The firm also said revenues for the current quarter were set to fall to $700m-$750m, from $757.1m a year earlier.	(Close): US stocks fell and the dollar fell against the yen and euro, after the latest jobs figures were seen as leaving the door open to a rate rise in September.
The International Bomber Command Centre is being built in Lincolnshire, which became known as Bomber County in the war because it had so many RAF bases. The centre is due to open in 2016 but a memorial spire has already been erected at the site in Lincoln. Organisers want to invite every veteran to the unveiling on 2 October. They already have names of 900 veterans but believe there are more still to be identified. Nicky Barr from the International Bomber Command Centre says they have made some new contacts. "A lot of the veterans that we've now been able to invite weren't on any comprehensive database or squadron lists," she said. "We've picked up thus far about 50 that come under that category. We suspect that there's probably, at an estimate, another 100 out there." The spire stands higher than the Angel of North and will be surrounded by a "wall of names" recording the 55,573 men who lost their lives serving in Bomber Command. Other elements of the centre will include an exhibition and education space called the Chadwick Centre, an amphitheatre and acres of landscaped gardens. Anyone knowing of any Bomber Command veteran is urged to register their names by emailing events@internationalbcc.co.uk or writing to The IBCC, 13 Cherry Holt Road, Bourne, Lincolnshire, PE10 9LA.	Every living veteran who served in Bomber Command during World War Two is being sought for the unveiling of a new memorial.
The technique is being hailed as a breakthrough in understanding how the trillions of complex cells in a body are descended from a single egg. "It has the potential to provide profound insights into how normal, diseased or damaged tissues are constructed and maintained," one UK biologist told the BBC. The work appears in Science journal. The human body has around 40 trillion cells, each with a highly specialised function. Yet each can trace its history back to the same starting point - a fertilised egg. Developmental biology is the business of unravelling how the genetic code unfolds at each cycle of cell division, how the body plan develops, and how tissues become specialised. But much of what it has revealed has depended on inference rather than a complete cell-by-cell history. "I actually started working on this problem as a graduate student in 2000," confessed Jay Shendure, lead researcher on the new scientific paper. "Could we find a way to record these relationships between cells in some compact form we could later read out in adult organisms?" The project failed then because there was no mechanism to record events in a cell's history. That changed with recent developments in so called CRISPR gene editing, a technique that allows researchers to make much more precise alterations to the DNA in living organisms. The molecular tape recorder developed by Prof Shendure's team at the University of Washington in Seattle, US, is a length of DNA inserted into the genome that contains a series of edit points which can be changed throughout an organism's life. Each edit records a permanent mark on the tape that is inherited by all of a cell's descendants. By examining the number and pattern of all these marks in an adult cell, the team can work back to find its origins. Developmental biologist James Briscoe of the Crick Institute, in London, UK, calls it "a creative and exciting use" of the CRISPR technique. "It uniquely and indelibly marks cells with a 'barcode' that is inherited in the DNA. This means you can use the barcode to trace all the progeny of barcoded cells," he said. Jay Shendure collaborated with molecular biologist Alex Schier of Harvard University to prove the technique on a classic lab organism - the zebrafish. Not only did they show the technique works, they could trace the lineage of hundreds of thousands of cells in mature fish. They also showed it has the power to change perceptions about biological development. "We can look at individual organs - say the left eye or the right eye, or the gills or the heart," Prof Shendure explained in an interview with the BBC's Science in Action radio programme, "and the real surprise was that in every organ we looked at, the majority of the organ came from just a handful of progenitor cells." For example, although they identified over a thousand cell lineages within one of their fish, it took only five of them to create most of the blood cells. The surprise is evident in the published paper, which includes a few suggested explanations. James Briscoe also finds the discovery remarkable. "It's striking that a barcode found in one organ was rarely found in another," he wrote in an e-mail, adding that in the early embryo, cells are often mobile and so a richer mix could be expected. An unexpectedly small group of "founder cells" would be one explanation. Or "there could be many founding cells, from different lineages (barcodes), at early embryonic stages, but many of these lineages die off as the tissue develops." Further experiments with the technique could unwrap the details. But the fact that a simple, profound question was immediately thrown up by the new technique shows just how powerful it is. And the technique does not have to be limited to healthy development. "Cancers develop by a lineage, too," Alex Schier told the BBC. "Our technique can be used to follow these lineages during cancer formation - to tell us the relationships of cells within a tumour, and between the original tumour and secondary tumours formed by metastasis." And Prof Shendure points out that many inherited diseases develop because of faulty genetic programming. "Many of these may well have their basis in the skewing of the cell lineage," he explained. The technique comes with the somewhat tortured acronym GESTALT - the German for "shape". It is easy to use, and could easily be improved, says Jay Shendure. James Briscoe is already thinking of ways to use it with his experimental animals - mice. For developmental biology, GESTALT could be the shape of things to come.	Researchers have invented a DNA "tape recorder" that can trace the family history of every cell in an organism.
Trains from Nottingham Victoria Station used to take passengers to destinations around England, including London, York, Bristol and Oxford. It was demolished in 1967, a year after the final service to London left the station. The site is now home to a shopping centre. Following the station's closure, all rail traffic was sent to Nottingham Midland, now the city's central station. Exhibition organiser Janine Tanner said: "It was one of the most beautiful stations there has ever been. "People used to refer to it as a cathedral. "I think the majority of people were horrified when it closed. "Obviously there were people who thought it should stay but the general consensus was that it shouldn't have closed." The station opened in 1900 and was named after Queen Victoria but its owners cited falling passenger numbers and increased car travel in the 1960s as the reason for its closure. All that remains now as a reminder of the site's railway past is the clock tower, a tunnel entrance and a retaining wall. Pictures highlighting its past are on show at the Nottingham Industrial Museum for the next three weekends. The images then go on display at the Great Central Railway at Ruddington and the Victoria Shopping Centre.	An exhibition of photographs has gone on show to mark 50 years since the demise of "one of the most beautiful stations there has ever been".
The first planes landed on the sand in the wide bay of Traigh Mhor in June 1936. It was officially licensed as an airport in August that year. Today, it is one of Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd's busiest sites and regularly features on lists of the world's most scenic airports. Flights to and from Barra are dictated by the tide and its three runways are fully submerged at high tide. Small planes, specially designed to be able to land on the beach, fly between the island and Glasgow on a lifeline service subsidised by the Scottish government. Last year, Canadian company Viking Air Limited won the contract to provide two new 19-seater Twin Otter DHC6-400 aircraft to fly on the route. According to Hial, the route involves more than 10,000 passengers a year. There are also about 60 private light aircraft flights to Barra per year.	The Isle of Barra's world famous beach airport is 80 years old.
The jazz film is the follow up to director Damien Chazelle's Academy Award-winning film Whiplash. The People's Choice, voted for by the audience, has proved to be a decent predictor for Oscars success in recent years. Previous winners include 12 Years a Slave and The King's Speech. La La Land, set for release in December, stars Stone as an aspiring actress in Los Angeles who meets a jazz pianist (Gosling) who is trying to stay true to the music he has devoted himself to. The film also stars singer John Legend and JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in Whiplash. La La Land has enjoyed rave reviews since premiering at the Venice Film Festival in August. Chazelle wrote the script six years ago but was not able to persuade anyone to make it until he broke through with Whiplash in 2014. Stone, who won the best actress prize at Venice for her La La Land role, previously starred with Gosling in Crazy, Stupid, Love. Toronto's Platform prize for international directors was won by Pablo Larrain for Jackie, the Jacqueline Kennedy biopic starring Natalie Portman. Raoul Peck won the People's Choice documentary award for I Am Not Your Negro, which follows the lives and assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers. The film is based on James Baldwin's unfinished book, Remember This House. Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.	Musical movie La La Land has picked up the prestigious People's Choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).
The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in July fell more sharply, down by 29,000 to 1.4 million. The unemployment rate remains at 7.8%, still well above the 7% rate target set by the Bank of England. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, says interest rates are unlikely to rise before that target is reached. The ONS said the figures meant unemployment was "broadly unchanged" from the first three months of the year. The number of people in work increased by 69,000 in the three months to June, up to 29.78 million. That is the highest level since records began in 1971. That means 307,000 more people are in employment in the UK, compared with the same time last year. Latest unemployment figures across the UK The ONS's David Freeman said two-thirds of this increase had been seen in UK nationals. A third of the employment increase came from non-UK nationals working in the UK. Suddenly everyone is watching out for the unemployment rate. That's because the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has said future interest rate rises will not start until, barring unexpected events, the rate falls to 7% of the workforce. The latest figures, the first since the Bank's forward guidance announcement, showed the rate was unchanged at 7.8%.  Yet the figures also showed the number in work was at a record high.  And therein lies a problem for the Bank. The economy is creating jobs but the workforce is growing.  So there may be solid economic growth over the next couple of years, but the unemployment rate still takes a while to come down.  And during that time, inflation alarm bells may start to ring. Analysts said the figures portrayed a mixed picture of the UK jobs market. "Despite some good news in the latest jobs figures there are worrying signs about the underlying state of the UK jobs market," said John Philpott, from the think tank, The Jobs Economist. "The rise in employment is almost matched by an increase in the size of the workforce, which means the unemployment rate is unchanged at 7.8%. "The headline jobs figures may continue to be broadly positive but one only has to dig a little deeper into the statistics to see that millions of people are continuing to be hit by a combination of lack of jobs and a ceaseless sharp fall in the real value of their pay." Youth unemployment, among those aged 16-24, increased by 15,000 to reach 973,000. The number of people out of work for more than two years also rose by 10,000 to 474,000, the highest number in 16 years. The ONS also released figures showing that wages grew by 1.1% over the past 12 months. When bonuses were included, wages grew by 2.1% - the highest annual growth rate since June 2011. The small fall in unemployment comes a week after Mr Carney linked the Bank of England's interest rate policy decisions to the unemployment rate for the first time. He said the MPC will not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate falls below 7%, which he predicted would take about three years and the creation of 750,000 jobs. Work and Pensions minister Steve Webb told the BBC that "things were starting to look much more positive". He said the jobs figures added to a general picture of an economy that was starting to pick up. But Labour's shadow employment minister, Stephen Timms, said the reality was that for ordinary families things were getting "harder not easier", highlighting the rise in part-time workers. "Ministers just sound out of touch when they ignore the fact that the number of people who are working part-time because they cannot find a full-time job is at record levels," he said.	UK unemployment fell by 4,000 in the three months to June leaving 2.51 million out of work, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Out of nearly 12,000 fans, 52% were in favour and 48% against a game which would raise funds for the Ladies' team and a final decision will now be made. The match would be the final public game at Upton Park but some fans want the Premier League win over Manchester United to be the last at the stadium. The Hammers are moving to the Olympic Stadium after 112 years at Upton Park. West Ham beat United 3-2 and then held a 45-minute celebration after full-time, involving fireworks and former players. Eastenders actor Danny-Boy Hatchard, who plays Lee Carter in the BBC One soap opera, is one of those backing the Ladies' game.	A West Ham Ladies' charity match at Upton Park on 5 June narrowly won a vote over whether it should take place.
On Saturday, James Brokenshire became the first secretary of state to attend a gaelic football match in Northern Ireland. It is understood he was in the stadium's control room when the anthem was played. The Northern Ireland Office said he attended "in the spirit of friendship". However, A County Armagh Labour MP said Mr Brokenshire had "snubbed" the anthem. "I think that's quite a regressive step," Conor McGinn told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. "I'm confused and bemused by it and I've asked him to clarify why he did it." Mr McGinn said he understood Mr Brokenshire arranged it so "he wouldn't be present to take his seat" when the anthem was played before the McKenna Cup final. "Four years ago Her Majesty The Queen visited Dublin and Croke Park, we've since had a reciprocal visit from the Irish president where both anthems were played with mutual respect, were attended by the taoiseach (Irish prime minister), the prime minister, other ministers. "So what I want to find out is: Is this a change of protocol and why Mr Brokenshire didn't observe the normal courtesies and protocols around the playing of the national anthem?" In 2012, then first minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson attended the McKenna Cup final, his first GAA match. Mr Robinson also took his seat just before the game began after the anthem was played. In 2011, then sports minister Carál Ní Chuilín became the first senior Sinn Féin member to attend a Northern Ireland international football match. She also did not take her seat until after God Save the Queen was played. Mr McGinn said he was "not naive" about the feelings of unionist or nationalist politicians, but that Mr Brokenshire is a "UK government minister". "James Brokenshire should be there as the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, a co-guarantor of the (Good Friday) agreement and someone who is above the fray, in a sense. "He should observe proper respect and protocols for the Irish national anthem, in the way that I would expect the Irish foreign minister to observe the protocols of the UK national anthem." A spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said Mr Brokenshire was "delighted" to attend the match and he "did so in the spirit of friendship". "Saturday night was about sport, not politics," the spokesperson added. Speaking about the match on Saturday, Mr Brokenshire said he had received an "absolutely incredible" welcome.	The Secretary of State has been criticised after it emerged he took his seat at a GAA game after the playing of the Irish national anthem.
The seven men had been given six-year jail sentences after an earthquake devastated the medieval town of L'Aquila in 2009, killing 309 people. The verdict triggered alarm, with some saying that science itself had been put on trial. On Monday an appeals court cleared the group of the manslaughter charges. Judge Fabrizia Ida Francabandera ruled that there was no case to answer. "The credibility of Italy's entire scientific community has been restored," said Stefano Gresta, the president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology. The seven men - all leading scientists or disaster experts - had been members of a committee convened in L'Aquila in March 2009 following a series of tremors in the region. Days after they met, a 6.3 magnitude quake struck the town in the middle of the night. Many of L'Aquila's medieval buildings were destroyed, and some locals blamed the disaster committee for not providing adequate advice. Prosecutors in the subsequent trial said the experts had offered falsely reassuring information to residents. According to Reuters, they noted that one committee member had said there was "no danger" from the tremors. Following the guilty verdicts, more than 5,000 scientists signed an open letter to Italian President Giorgio Napolitano in support of the experts. Many argued that the convictions represented a fundamental misunderstanding of earthquake science. Monday's decision to overturn the verdicts came after a month-long appeal process. The prosecution can still seek to have the original verdicts reinstated via a higher court.	A group of Italian scientists convicted of manslaughter for failing to predict a deadly earthquake have had the verdict quashed.
Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and Scott Walker will take the stage in Cleveland on Thursday night with seven rivals. Fox News selected the 10 most popular Republicans based on five national polls, excluding Mr Perry and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Those two and five other candidates will take part in an earlier debate. Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum reacted angrily to his omission. "The idea that they have left out the runner-up for the 2012 nomination [Santorum], the former four-term governor of Texas [Perry], the governor of Louisiana [Bobby Jindal], the first female Fortune 50 CEO [Carly Fiorina], and the 3-term Senator from South Carolina [Graham] due to polling seven months before a single vote is cast is preposterous," his spokesman said. In contrast, Mr Perry tweeted that he was looking forward to being on Fox at 5pm for "a serious exchange of ideas and positive solutions to get America back on track". The main debate takes place four hours later at 9pm local time (01:00 GMT). All eyes will be on hotel tycoon Mr Trump, who leads the polls and has made headlines with outspoken remarks about many of his rivals. A fun guide to the 10 Republican debaters One of the Republican frontrunners, Jeb Bush, became embroiled in a row with leading Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton over women's health funding on Tuesday. The former Florida governor was attacked by Mrs Clinton after he told a conservative Christian audience he wasn't sure "we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues". But he later said he "misspoke" after criticism of his remarks. Meet all of the 2016 hopefuls	Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is not among the 10 Republicans running for president who will take part in the first primetime TV debate.
Measuring 50cm x 76cm (19.6in x 30in), it was bought by a Welshman living in England at Rogers Jones & Co auctioneers in Colwyn Bay on Saturday. Its guide price had been £200-£300. The poster features soldiers beside a cannon, with the caption: "Anibyniaeth sydd yn galw am ei dewraf dyn" - or "Independence calls for its bravest man" in English.	A World War One recruitment poster written in Welsh has sold at a Conwy county auction for £440.
Mr Abe described the 90-minute meeting in Trump Tower, New York, as "candid", with a "warm atmosphere". Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: "We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. "I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence." The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues. Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who have emerged as key advisers to Mr Trump since his surprise election victory, also met Mr Abe at Trump Tower. Media speculation over her role has included the possibility of her becoming ambassador to Japan. In the days since the election, Mr Trump has been speaking to dozens of world leaders as well as possible cabinet appointees from his home and office inside the Manhattan skyscraper. In other developments: Elsewhere, vice president-elect and Trump transition lead Mike Pence has said he is confident Donald Trump's administration can work with Democrats. Emerging from meetings with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Mr Pence said he looks "forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward". Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama has urged his successor to stand up to Russia if it deviates from US "values and international norms". Speaking after talks with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Mr Obama said he hoped Mr Trump would "not simply take a realpolitik approach" to dealing with Russia.	Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has said he has "great confidence" in US President-elect Donald Trump and he believes they can build a relationship of trust.
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which oversees the rules of the game, passed the law at a meeting in Zurich. It will come in to force on 1 June, in time for the World Cup in Brazil. The new law was proposed by the Football Association and will apply to domestic and international football. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: "The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed." From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous "Why Always Me?" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: "It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup." Law 4 of the game, which relates to players' equipment, will be amended. It states: "Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo. "A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa." Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called "triple punishment" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because "it is a clear yes or no decision". An IFAB statement read: "Concerns were raised about video replays slowing the game down and increasing the number of stoppages."	Players who display messages on T-shirts worn underneath their strips will face punishment after new proposals were agreed.
Media playback is not supported on this device An early Zak Jules own goal got Dee started but Louis Moult soon levelled. The Well defence then went missing, with a Marcus Haber double and goals from Mark O'Hara and Craig Wighton making it 5-1 at half time. The home side went close through Craig Clay and Chris Cadden but were unable to reduce the deficit. In their three previous games, Well lost 3-0 to Hearts, 7-2 at Aberdeen and 2-0 at Celtic, while Dundee's victory was their second in succession following the 2-1 triumph over Rangers. The result was the biggest away win of the season in the Premiership and means Dundee remain in sixth spot, with Well now just two points clear of second-bottom Inverness Caledonian Thistle. On-loan Reading defender Jules was in for the injured Stephen McManus and he made an early impact, although not one he would have wanted. It was a simple high ball into the box but Jules got his footing all wrong and looped a header over the advancing Craig Samson and into the net. Moult's equaliser came midway through the half as he reacted quickest in the box to shoot low past Scott Bain from close range. The visitors were moving the ball around efficiently and they were back in front when Haber fired a right-foot shot across Samson into the bottom right hand corner of the net. Mark O'Hara finished the third after excellent build-up play before former Well favourite Henrik Ojamaa set up Wighton to blast in number four. Paul McGowan then curled an effort inches wide of Samson's left hand post as confidence flowed through Paul Hartley's Dundee dominant outfit. With seconds remaining in the first half, a Wighton free-kick from the left found Haber totally unmarked at the back post and he duly nodded in the fifth for Dundee. As the half time whistle blew the home fans' boos rung out around the stadium. Media playback is not supported on this device Dundee had not recorded an away win since the end of October, but Lanarkshire is clearly lucky for the Dens Park men as that triumph in October came at Hamilton. Despite the four-goal deficit Motherwell returned for the second half with the same personnel and made a better impression, albeit against a Dundee side who had taken their foot off the gas. Well's Craig Clay had two good efforts but Bain was up to the task, while Ojamaa had a couple of pot shots at the other end with no joy. The home fans were furious at the end of the match as Motherwell face up to a relegation battle. Dundee boss Paul Hartley: "The first half we won the game with some outstanding play and goals, and carried it on from last week. "We told them at half time to make sure we don't concede any goals. In the second half we didn't pass it as well and sometimes that happens when you have such a commanding lead, but overall the players were outstanding. "We worked a little bit in the week about getting balls to the back to (Mark) O'Hara and (Marcus) Haber and that managed to pay off today, but the overall team performance was excellent."

The goal is to see if a computer can beat four of the best players in the variant of poker known as no-limit heads-up Texas hold 'em. In a similar tournament in 2015, the humans won. The algorithm could be adapted for use in medicine, cybersecurity, business and the military, its creators said. The matches - dubbed Brains v Artificial Intelligence -  are being held over 20 days at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. The four human players are matched against Libratus, an artificial intelligence program developed at Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) school of computer science. It uses algorithms built over 15 million core hours of computation at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre to analyse the rules of poker. Viewers can watch the entire event live on video-streaming games site Twitch, where there will be a stream for each of the human players: The players are vying for shares of a $200,000 (Â£162,000) prize, while the CMU scientists are hoping to set a new benchmark for artificial intelligence. "Since the earliest days of AI research, beating top human players has been a powerful measure of progress in the field," said Tuomas Sandholm, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. "That was achieved with chess in 1997, with Jeopardy in 2009 and with the board game Go just last year. "Poker poses a far more difficult challenge than these games, as it requires a machine to make extremely complicated decisions based on incomplete information while contending with bluffs, slow play and other ploys." A similar contest in 2015, with a computer program dubbed Claudico, failed to beat the humans, with scientists concluding that the 80,000 hands it had played had proved too few to establish its superiority. This time around, there will be 120,000 hands. Claudico also made some obvious bluffs that they had been able to exploit, the players said. This time around, the AI will be able to bluff with precisely calculated values to balance risk and reward. It will also be able to deploy random moves in a way that human players would have great difficulty doing. The scientists hope that it could baffle human opponents, with unusual strategies such as making tiny bets or massive over-bets. Player Jason Les said of the new contest: "I'm very excited to see what this latest AI is like." "I thought Claudico was tough to play; knowing the resources and the ideas that Dr Sandholm and his team have had available in the 20 months since the first contest, I assume this AI will be even more challenging." Solving the complex game of poker had many real-world applications, Dr Sandholm said. "Extending AI to real-world decision-making, where details are unknown and adversaries are actively revising their strategies, is fundamentally harder than games with perfect information or question-answering systems," said Nick Nystrom, senior director of research at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center . "This is where it really gets interesting."	An unusual poker game is taking place in Pittsburgh, pitting human players against  an artificial intelligence program.
The troubled NHS trust has been struggling financially and has some of the worst response times in England. However, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said staff were committed to providing high quality, safe care despite suffering from low morale. The health watchdog said inspectors also saw some "outstanding practice". Prof Sir Mike Richards, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said EMAS, which serves about 4.8m people across six counties, required improvement. He said: "There was an unrelenting demand for emergency services combined with a lack of staff and resources to meet the need. "We found that while people were cared for and treated well, there were insufficient staff and a lack of appropriate skill-mix to meet the needs of patients in a timely manner." The trust was told it must ensure there are sufficient emergency vehicles to safely meet demand and response times must also meet the needs of patients by reaching national targets. In April it was revealed EMAS had overspent by almost Â£12m in the last financial year and had to take out an additional loan to help with running costs. Staff were also reported to be under pressure and unable to take scheduled breaks. Richard Henderson, acting chief executive of EMAS, said: "We will be continuing our recruitment campaigns. Last year we recruited over 300 staff. This year again we will be doing exactly the same. "We will be increasing the numbers of vehicles available but most importantly we need to ensure we retain our existing workforce." EMAS said emergency calls had increased and handover delays at hospitals had caused it to incur the extra costs. The service which covers Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland has about 2,700 members of staff and receives approximately 2,000 calls a day.	A report into East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) has found it has "insufficient staff" to meet the needs of patients in a "timely manner".
The centrepiece is a plan to take any refugees and migrants who cross the sea to Greece in smugglers' boats and return them, directly, to Turkey. European Union officials say whatever is finally agreed "will comply with both European and international law". Privately, though, some admit that, while the assessment of their lawyers is "quite promising", there are legal hurdles that must be overcome. So can Europe carry out mass returns of entire groups of people? UN officials have cited the European Convention on Human Rights, arguing that it explicitly prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners. And they say that under international law, it is not illegal for someone fleeing persecution and conflict to cross a border and ask for asylum. Around 90% of those arriving in the Greek islands say they are fleeing conflict, primarily from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan. Under international law, each person's case must be heard on an individual basis, not as a group, because they may have very good reasons for seeking protection. The second difficulty, UN officials have said, is that while returns can be legal, people can only be sent back to a country that is safe, is able to care for them, give them full access to work, to education, to healthcare, and, most important of all, will take responsibility for processing the individual's asylum claim. The reason many Syrians are leaving Turkey is that it can't provide work, education and healthcare for them all. A system to apply for asylum in Europe from Turkey doesn't exist yet. Until now, the EU has not returned people to Turkey. It hasn't viewed Turkey as what's called a "safe third country". Turkey is not a full member of the Geneva Convention. It does not offer Syrians asylum, only a lesser form of international protection. And other groups like Iraqis and Afghans don't even have that option in Turkey. So while returning Syrians is questionable, returning non-Syrians may be even more problematic. Even if all the legal issues are settled there remains the practical problem of how Greece would send back all those making the crossings. Desperate people, men, women and children would have to be rounded up, held and then transported back across the sea. In exchange for the mass returns, the EU is offering to take in large numbers of asylum seekers directly from Turkey. So for every Syrian sent back to Turkey, one already in Turkey will be resettled in Europe. But finding EU countries willing to accept the new arrivals may not be easy. Last year, EU countries pledged to shift thousands of refugees directly from Greece, Italy, and Turkey and give them new homes in the EU. Just a few hundred have actually been moved. Could countries achieve now what they have failed to make happen so far? Hungary has made clear that it is not prepared to accept quotas under this new plan. Other countries in central and eastern Europe are also opposed. So to make this work, a "coalition of the willing" - countries prepared to welcome Syrians - will have to be assembled. Germany and the Netherlands may have to be the leaders here, but they will need support from other states too. Among Turkey's demands to secure a deal is visa-free access to the EU for Turks, ideally by the end of June, but there is significant political resistance. It would allow more than 70 million Turks to travel (but not work) visa-free in Europe's Schengen zone. That hasn't happened before now because some EU countries have worried about the political backlash at home from anti-immigrant parties. France in particular has been opposed. The indications from behind closed doors at the summit were that President Francois Hollande may be willing to accept a deal on visas. But then there is the problem that Turkey does not officially recognise the Greek-Cypriot government in Nicosia (Cyprus is an EU member). That's one issue to overcome, and there is also significant opposition to visa concessions for Turkey in the European Parliament, which would have to approve the change as well. Even if all of these issues are resolved, sources say that EU countries will probably still insist Turkey meet all the technical conditions necessary for visa-free access. The hurdles, such as Turkey introducing more sophisticated biometric passports, are significant. This is another of Turkey's demands. It may be largely symbolic, as most EU countries believe Turkey is years away from achieving EU membership, but making any headway on this will be even harder than on the subject of visas. Opposition from Cyprus is one big issue here. Turkey must recognise the government in Cyprus before any new discussions open. Cyprus has stated clearly that it has a clear understanding from other EU countries that "Turkey cannot use its role in the refugee crisis... to ask for exchanges as regards its EU accession course". Other countries like Italy and Belgium have doubts about making concessions at a time when there are serious concerns about Turkey's political direction, about declining media freedoms, and worries about a shift towards greater authoritarianism in Turkey's politics. Privately, EU sources say agreement even to open any new accession discussions will be "very difficult" and is one of the most important things to clarify if a deal is to be done next week. For all the difficulties, though, there are powerful, political reasons why all sides want a deal. The EU as a whole wants to regain control of events in this refugee crisis. There is a real concern that countries have started going it alone, consensus has broken down, and the EU has to find a plan that reverses that dynamic. There is also a fear that if the refugee crisis remains unresolved, it could affect Britain's EU referendum. Angela Merkel needs a deal as she's come under huge political pressure at home. And the crisis has caused a real rift between the leaders of Germany and Austria that needs to be mended. Other EU leaders want to show their electorates they can protect the EU's borders, fearing that otherwise anti-immigrant parties will seize the political initiative. Closing some border crossings to deal with the refugee crisis has had economic costs too. And a deal suits Turkey as well. It is hosting millions of refugees and is under serious pressure because of the way the war in Syria has shifted with Russia's involvement. Despite their difficulties, the EU and Turkey both benefit if they can make a strategic relationship work, and they need support from each other to deal with the crises they are facing. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.	European leaders are billing their new proposal to deal with the refugee and migrant influx as a "game-changer", but the scheme is not agreed yet and there are doubts about whether it it is practical or even legal.
SKN Heritage Museum is showing the type of belongings brought by African-Caribbean immigrants in the 1940s and 50s. The Windrush generation responded to adverts to work in Britain but were only allowed to bring one suitcase. Organisers said the display gives a unique insight into important part of Nottingham's history. The Windrush was named after the first boat which brought people from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948. The exhibition, called 'From Caribbean Isles to the British Isles -Home to Home', aims to give an insight into people who travelled across the Atlantic to seek a better life in what was still the Empire's "mother country". Item include photographs, clothes, records and games - as well as beauty products designed for black skin and hair when none were commercially available. Catherine Ross, the museum's founder, cameto Nottingham from St Kitts when she was just seven years old. She said: "Our aim is to let everyone know about the contributions that Caribbeans have made to British society and Nottingham and commemorate these achievements. "There'sno better place tostart than Nottingham Carnival, as it's such awell known and celebratory event in Nottingham's calendar." The carnival is taking place for the first time take in two sites - the Forest Recreation Ground on Saturday and the Victoria Embankment on Sunday.	A unique perspective on a landmark social event is to be unveiled as part of Nottingham's Caribbean Carnival.
Surrey County Council leader David Hodge said the government had cut its annual grant by £170m since 2010. The proposed increase would add nearly £200 to a Band D bill, bringing it to about £1,500. The government said if the proposed budget is set, taxpayers would have the final say in a referendum. Any authority wanting to increase council tax by more than 2% must put the plans to a vote. This would take place on 4 May, alongside local elections, and would include a vote in Chancellor Philip Hammond's constituency of Runnymede and Weybridge. Opposition councillors in Surrey said the increase would be unaffordable for many residents and it followed financial failings by the council and the government's failure to fund services properly. Council tax analysis - Pete Sherlock, BBC News data journalist We can't say what the average rises are set to be this year, as not all local authorities have declared their intentions. However, last year the average Band D council tax set by local authorities in England for 2016-17 was £1,530. This was an increase of £46 - or 3.1% on the 2015-16 figure of £1,484 -  and 1.6% of that was the adult social care precept. So Surrey's rise is five times last year's average. This shows how council tax hikes were brought down post 2008, but are now on the rise again. Mr Hodge said the council had to set a budget for 2017-18 that would protect vital services. He said: "The government has cut our annual grant by £170m since 2010, leaving a huge gap in our budget. "Demand for adult social care, learning disabilities and children's services is increasing every year. "So I regret, despite us finding £450m worth of savings from our annual budget, we have no choice but to propose this increase in council tax." Liberal Democrat leader Hazel Watson said a 15% rise would hit the elderly and those on fixed incomes hardest. She said: "It is astonishing that the Conservative administration think Surrey residents should carry the can for their own financial failings and the government's failure to properly fund services." The Conservative council had failed in its negotiations with the government, even though three cabinet ministers were Surrey MPs, she added. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are MPs in the county along with Philip Hammond. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "If the council sets this proposed budget, then the taxpayers of Surrey will have the final say in a referendum in May. We should trust the people. "Our long-term funding settlement means more spending power for Surrey County Council during this parliament, with £3.2 billion to deliver the services that local people want." Analysis: Jack Fiehn, BBC Surrey political reporter For years, senior councillors have spoken out about cuts to the authority's central grant and the impact on adult social care and children's services, as well as school places and road maintenance. There has been huge frustration and we seem to have reached a crunch point. Surrey residents are used to council tax rises. They have gone up every year since 2012 - but never by such a large amount. This will be a test of public support. The Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Green Party all oppose a referendum, but David Hodge has told me he has the support of his fellow Conservatives. So unless something significant happens, it is almost certain to go ahead. He has also denied reports there will be a deal with ministers to abandon the vote, putting the government on course for a row with a council in the Tory heartland. Former care minister and Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said Surrey's decision would be a test for local authorities, which were seeing increasing numbers of older people and younger people not getting the care and support they need. Shadow local government secretary Teresa Pearce said: "Forcing councils to rely on council tax income to fund statutory services, such as social care, is simply unsustainable and unrealistic."	A Conservative-run council wants to raise its tax by 15% in the next financial year, blaming government cuts and increased demand for social care.
As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile. He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football. "I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet," he said. "The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper. "It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence." He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better. "You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march." E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe. "In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz," he said. "Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going. "We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next." But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale. "The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches," he said. "We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question. "We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums. "Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football. "Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up." Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau. "You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us," he said. "Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes. "But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'." "I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through. "Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves." As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs. "We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria." "I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone." Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones. "I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all," he said. "I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late."	A 94-year-old man who survived a prisoner of war camp next door to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp believes a football league which the guards allowed them to set up may have helped save his life.
The Glasgow club said the employee, who is now dead, had worked at Partick for two years. When the alleged abuse was raised in 1992, he was dismissed "with immediate effect", the club said. Police Scotland and the Scottish Football Association have been informed. In a statement, Partick Thistle said: "As far as Thistle's current management can ascertain, no other allegations were made to the club at that time with regard to him or any other employee. "The club has contacted the SFA and Police Scotland to advise them of what they know to date and will fully comply with any investigation." "In the meantime, Partick Thistle would urge anyone who may have been affected to contact Police Scotland, the SFA, the club or the NSPCC helpline (0800 0232642) set up to support and advise victims of abuse. "In the last 24 hours, we have been approached by an anonymous individual asking for advice on who to contact with concerns relating to historic events. No details were given. The club advised he ring the NSPCC hotline in line with SFA guidance." The club added that it regarded the safety and wellbeing of the children and young people who have contact with the club as being of "paramount importance".	Partick Thistle Football Club has said it has identified a historical allegation of abuse made against a former club physiotherapist.
The two children were allegedly snatched off a Beirut street earlier this month at their mother's behest. The operation was being filmed by four Australian journalists with Channel 9's 60 Minutes programme. The mother, Sally Faulkner, was soon arrested, as were the journalists, two British men and two Lebanese men. The children were returned to their father's custody. The judge overseeing the case has warned that he views the "child recovery" operation as a criminal case. Ms Faulkner had said she had not seen the young children since her estranged husband, Ali Elamine, took them from Australia to Beirut on holiday. She flew to Lebanon earlier this month with two employees of the UK-based company Child Abduction Recovery International (CARI) to recover them, accompanied by the 60 Minutes team. CCTV footage broadcast by Lebanese TV appears to show the six-year-old and four-year-old being bundled into a car by several men on a busy street in southern Beirut. They had been heading to school with a domestic worker and their paternal grandmother, who said she was knocked to the ground during the abduction. It was previously reported that the judge was pushing for Ms Faulkner to reach a custody agreement with Mr Elamine. But Mr Elamine has now said he will not drop abduction charges against Ms Faulkner because it could see the others involved released as well. Judge Rami Abdullah said on Monday that the so-called "recovery" operation amounted to a kidnapping attempt. "This is not a custody case, they are involved in kidnapping two kids," he said, according to News Corp Australia. The case has been adjourned until Wednesday to allow both sides to negotiate. Those arrested face kidnapping, assault and association charges, which can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. According to reports, Judge Abdullah interviewed 60 Minutes' prominent reporter Tara Brown and Ms Faulkner briefly on Monday before the handcuffed pair were escorted out a side exit to waiting police cars. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been in contact with her Lebanese counterpart. "The law in Lebanon is quite different to Australian law," she said in an interview with Network Ten. "It's based on a French system, so there have been arrests, then an investigation and then an investigating judge determines whether charges will be laid and I understand we're at that stage of the proceedings," Ms Bishop said. Lebanon is not party to the Hague Convention, a treaty designed to ensure the swift return of children abducted internationally by a parent.	A Lebanese man whose estranged Australian wife has been charged with attempting to kidnap their children has said he will not drop the charges.
Defence ministry spokesman Lt Gen Sergei Rudskoi said the Syrian army was poised to defeat IS militants there. But US officials said Russia staged no air strikes in Syria in the past week. The strikes come days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the withdrawal of most Russian forces from Syria. IS militants captured the ancient city of Palmyra last May. Since then it has blown up monumental temples, arches and statues in the Unesco World Heritage site, bringing global condemnation. Meanwhile, IS claimed on Friday it had killed five Russian soldiers in fighting around Palmyra in recent days. Russia has not commented on the claim and there is no independent verification. In recent months, IS has been losing ground to President Bashar al-Assad's forces, rebel groups, and Kurdish militia fighters. Gen Rudskoi told reporters in Moscow that the Syrian army had also seized key hilltop areas near the city of Aleppo and cut supply routes leading to the IS-held city. US Central Command spokesman Patrick Ryder said there had been some bombardments in the Palmyra region but that they were thought to be made by Russian artillery. Russia had withdrawn most if not all of its strike aircraft and there had been little movement of its ground forces, Col Ryder said. Indirect peace talks aimed at resolving the Syrian conflict have been taking place in Geneva for the past week, but so far shown no progress.	Russia says its warplanes are carrying out up to 25 air strikes a day around the Syrian city of Palmyra in support of Syrian forces trying to oust so-called Islamic State (IS).
She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. "I never get to do stuff like this," marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot "past Ventura and lenses plenty" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year. "I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches," she says. "I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. "I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them." But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind ("may you stand proud and strong"); while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival "whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount". It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with "looking for love in all the wrong places". "I kind of got jolted into the real world again," she says. "Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. "And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening." Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it "never feels like work," she says. "Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. "So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music." On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. "It was really fun!" she says of working with A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd. "I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record." More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems. "I was definitely nervous," says Del Rey of the recording session. "She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. "When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out! "I said to her over the mic, 'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like, 'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' "I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. "That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me." Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. "That song started out really revealing," she says. "I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything." Once the initial version was "out of my system", she says, the recording was "deleted completely then started from scratch". The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: "I want to move out of the black, into the blue". "I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of," she says of the original. "Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record." She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an "underground sect" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, "he hit me and it felt like a kiss". "I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more," she says now. "Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully." On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. "I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords," she explains. "I was leaning in to him and saying, 'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like, 'That is it, trust me'. "I listened for 10 seconds and I was like, 'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. "But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me." She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. "I'm so glad," she says. "Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?" I tell her it was like being in church. "Oh, stop!" she beams, and bursts into laughter. That good mood isn't going anywhere soon.

Phase one of the project will take 10 weeks to complete and will see demolition of the rear function room of the Ship and Anchor pub. An old library building will also be knocked down and a new car park built. Pembrokeshire council also wants to create a one-way system, footways and a public transport hub, with work starting later this year. The master plan includes a new link road, retail units and the demolition of buildings, including the derelict Fishguard Junior School, on 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres) of land. Councillors hope it could encourage further investment in the town.	Work has begun on plans to alleviate traffic congestion and regenerate Fishguard town centre in Pembrokeshire.
The Uefa general secretary has included the plan in his manifesto for the Fifa election on 26 February. His idea follows European football's governing body Uefa's decision to play Euro 2020 in 13 different countries. "Each confederation shall have to wait at least two editions before being able to host the World Cup again," he said. "This will ensure a more equitable rotation, while giving every confederation the opportunity to organise this unique event. "Furthermore, Fifa should investigate the possibility of organising the World Cup not only in one or two countries but in a whole region, so enabling several countries to enjoy the honour and benefits of hosting the World Cup." Infantino is one of five candidates standing for the presidency of world football's governing body, which is in crisis following a series of corruption claims. He is up against Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, the Bahraini head of the Asian football confederation (AFC), Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale and Jerome Champagne, a former Fifa deputy secretary general from France. Current Fifa president Sepp Blatter has been banned for eight years from all football-related activities for breaching ethics rules.	Fifa presidential candidate Gianni Infantino says he would press for the World Cup to be held in a whole region rather than one or two countries.
Yanagihara's novel, the story of four college friends seeking fame and fortune in New York, is tipped to win by bookmakers William Hill and Coral. It is the second year the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall at around 21:45 BST. This year's shortlist features two authors from the UK, two from the US and one each from Jamaica and Nigeria. The shortlist of authors and titles is as follows: Victory for either Yanagihara or Tyler would see the Man Booker have its first American winner. Marlon James is the first Jamaican-born author to be shortlisted for the prize. William Hill said his novel, which explores the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in the late 1970s, had moved up from fifth favourite to second favourite. This year's judges are Michael Wood (chair),  Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, John Burnside, Sam Leith and Frances Osborne.  They considered 156 books for this year's prize. McCarthy is the only shortlisted author to have been nominated before, having been shortlisted for C in 2010. At 28 years old, Obioma is the youngest nominee, the same age as 2013 winner Eleanor Catton. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. The winner will receive a further cheque for £50,000. Australian author Richard Flanagan won last year's prize for his wartime novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North. Coverage from this year's ceremony, where the prize will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall, will be on the BBC News Channel from 21:30 BST.	The winner of the Man Booker Prize is announced shortly with Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life the bookies' favourite to take the £50,000 prize.
The regime said 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's medical condition was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he was given after his trial. But Fred Warmbier said his son had been treated "brutally". He spoke as an Ohio hospital said Otto had suffered a "severe neurological injury" and is in a stable condition. "We went for 15 months without a word from or about Otto," Mr Warmbier said of his son, who fought back tears at Thursday's press conference in Cincinnati, Ohio. "It was only a week ago that the North Korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time. "Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care." Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist. Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases. It's caused by the clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves. Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis. That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles. Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds. The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison). This rarely happens in modern western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier. He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel. Fred Warmbier told reporters his son had been held as a "war criminal'. He said he and his wife, Cindy, had relied "on this false premise that they would treat Otto fairly and let him go". In honour of his son, Fred Warmbier wore the same jacket Otto was wearing when he was paraded before media to tearfully confess to attempting to take the sign as a "trophy" for a US church. Mr Warmbier also appeared to criticise the Obama administration for failing to help secure his son's release. How harsh is prison in North Korea? "When Otto was first taken we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release," he said. "We did so without result. Earlier this year Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over." The university student was freed hours after US basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea, but Fred Warmbier said the professional athlete's visit had nothing to do with his son's release. The US has in the past accused North Korea of detaining Americans as political pawns in negotiations over its nuclear weapons programme. Pyongyang has accused Washington and South Korea of sending spies to overthrow its regime. Three Americans remain in custody in North Korea. The detentions have come at a time of heightened tension between North Korea and the US and its regional neighbours.	The emotional father of a US student freed by North Korea this week says he does not believe the regime's explanation for his son's coma.
They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy "sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as "sexier" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. "There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill," he added.	Woodland bigger than the size of Cardiff needs to be re-planted in Wales to make up for commercial forestry lost over the past 15 years, industry experts have warned.
