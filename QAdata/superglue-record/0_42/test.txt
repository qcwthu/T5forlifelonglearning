The Republican presidential front-runner said in an interview with CNN's Don Lemon Wednesday that Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, had given him notes on what to say when he visited the evangelical university in Lynchburg, Virginia.

It was the diplomatic hurdles that had stressed Team USA out. The wrestlers were caught in the most recent escalation between Tehran and the new Trump administration, and their visas did not come through until the last minute. "It was difficult. There was a period of time where we were like, are we going, are we not going?" US Olympic gold medalist Jordan Burroughs told CNN.

Ms Dugdale, 33, secured the leadership with 72.1 per cent of the vote while veteran MP Ken Mackintosh, got just 27.9 per cent. The election was sparked by the resignation of former MP Jim Murphy shortly after Labour's resounding general election defeat in Scotland. Ms Dugdale worked as Mr Murphy's deputy from December 2014 to June 2015, when he stepped down.

Starz is set to announce that the next season of its historical drama "Spartacus" will mark the show's final outing. The upside: Creator Steven S. DeKnight promises the remaining episodes will be spectacular (see the final season poster and teaser video here). "This season is bigger than anything we've attempted," DeKnight says. "The scope and scale is just amazing. We're dealing with massive battles between thousands of people. We hope to leave people feel satisfied." DeKnight says he's been 90 percent certain for months that the upcoming third season -- subtitled "War of the Damned" -- would be the last for "Spartacus."

Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado introduced Hillary Clinton at a Florida rally Tuesday, blasting Donald Trump. And for once, the billionaire didn't react. No tweets. No attacks from the stump. Nothing. Instead, he stayed on message going after Clinton on her email server while pledging to repeal Obamacare. In the final days of the 2016 campaign, Trump isn't taking Clinton's bait.

Though they both acknowledged deep disagreements on these issues, the two leaders found common ground on the topic of the economic embargo on Cuba, which both want lifted. Obama went so far as to declare that "the embargo's going to end," though he couldn't say when.

Consider this the first harsh lesson of Stuart McCall’s tenure. Back in the chill of mid-December, Ally McCoist led the Ibrox side here on the day it emerged he had handed in his notice of resignation. A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave.

question: A spokeswoman over the weekend rebuked @placeholder for his claims that the election is "rigged," but the speaker himself has yet to speak out. context: (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan has a new strategy to deal with Donald Trump: Ignore him. As Ryan becomes the latest punching bag for his party's presidential nominee, the Wisconsin Republican has made the calculation that he faces little political upside in engaging in a back-and-forth with Trump. So he has gone underground, avoiding questions at all costs about Trump and trying to focus instead on preserving congressional majorities. His strategy is an implicit recognition that the Wisconsin Republican finds himself in a lose-lose situation over his party's nominee. If he attacks Trump, he's only bound to provoke even more conservative furor, something that could come back to haunt him if he finds himself searching for votes in the new Congress to preserve his speakership.

question: In theory that could mean that @placeholder and his aides could find their past lives, as well as their present arrangements, open to investigation. context: Washington (CNN) A bad day for the White House could turn out to be a good day for justice and democratic accountability and institutions. Robert Mueller's appointment Wednesday as special counsel to probe Russian election meddling and any collusion by Trump campaign aides elevates the investigation clear of partisanship and the threat of White House interference. It therefore may offer the best chance for a politically bulletproof accounting of the guilt or innocence of members of the President's inner circle.

And how telling that while these awkward matches used to be scrutinised by the camera of their father and inspiration, Richard, he has rarely been courtside in recent years. It is a measure of the sisters’ longevity that what was once an affair for the whole family is something more grown up these days.

CBD is one of the active ingredients in cannabis, increasingly thought to offer wide-ranging health benefits, with few side effects and little risk of addiction or abuse. "More and more evidence is coming out that CBD can be helpful for a variety of conditions, from anxiety to inflammation to seizures and epilepsy," said Marcel Bonn-Miller, an adjunct assistant professor of psychology in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.

Tim Sherwood has begun reshaping his squad with the probable arrival of Micah Richards on a free transfer and Lowton would like to move to get regular football. The Villa manager is a keen admirer of Trippier, who has a £3.5m buyout clause, and Burnley looked at a part-exchange involving Lowton.

More than 30 veterans flown in from the U.S. island territory of Guam toured the black sand beaches where they invaded the deeply dug-in forces of the island's Japanese defenders in early 1945. They were bused to the top of Mount Suribachi, an active volcano, where an Associated Press photo of the raising of the American flag while the battle was still raging became a potent symbol of hope and valor to a war-weary public back home that was growing increasingly disillusioned with the seemingly unending battle in the Pacific. @highlight More than 30 veterans flew to the island of Iwo Jima, Japan, on Saturday @highlight The 1945 battle was one of the bloodiest of World War 11 @highlight Represents a major invasion and win for the U.S. @highlight The Battle of Iwojima lasted about a month @highlight About 22,000 Japanese soldiers and 7,000 U.S. servicemen died	Japan

The public endorsement comes one day after the Register -- Iowa's largest newspaper -- backed Romney in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and just over two weeks before Iowa's critical presidential caucuses on January 3. In his advertisement, Dole said Romney is the GOP candidate is best suited to defeat President Barack Obama in 2012. "I've known Mitt and his family for decades.

The brief remark from the top Cabinet official appeared to be the latest subtle sign of a gap between Tillerson, a former globe-trotting oil executive, and the freewheeling President, who ran a campaign in large part against how the US interacts with pillars of the international community.

That questioning ended, and the teen was subsequently cleared through customs. Mohamed's family greeted him with balloons and a dozen roses. Mohamed's lawyers argued that as a U.S. citizen, Mohamed had a right to be in the United States, and that the government had provided no reason for including him on the no-fly list.

But before Tuesday's chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, which killed 89 people, Haley had said toppling Assad was not a priority.

"As far as the Comey thing goes, I think he gave him plenty of chances.

Grabbing headlines during recent bird- and swine-flu outbreaks, its proximity to Mainland China as well as its unenviable status as the worst-affected city during the 2003 SARS outbreak, Hong Kong has been central to several global pandemic fears in recent years. It hasn't even escaped fictional outbreaks -- the 2011 movie "Contagion" had patient zero Gwyneth Paltrow bring back an unwelcome souvenir from a business trip to the city.

The stage has been dominated by two franchises. The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers have combined for 33 of the league's 69 championships since 1947, when the Lakers were based in Minneapolis. So perhaps it's not surprising that many Finals records are held by either a Celtic or a Laker. Bill Russell won 11 titles in Boston, more than any other player in league history.

George Ciccariello-Maher, a professor of politics and global studies, had been teaching his class remotely via video conference after being put on administrative leave, a move that Drexel said was for his own safety. The professor said his resignation is effective December 31. "This is not a decision I take lightly; however, after nearly a year of harassment by right-wing, white supremacist media outlets and Internet mobs, after death threats and threats of violence directed against me and my family, my situation has become unsustainable," Ciccariello-Maher wrote on his Facebook account.

It's a mystery that persists more than 70 years after police came to the Amsterdam building where Anne Frank and seven other inhabitants of the secret annex had been hiding. The familiar story is that the police had been tipped off by an anonymous caller in a clear case of betrayal leading to the arrests on August 4, 1944.

Arguing that the two-state solution is dying and that something must be done to keep hope alive, Carter wrote: "I fear for the spirit of Camp David. We must not squander this chance." Yet having spent the better part of my adult professional life working to promote, facilitate and consummate negotiations between Arabs and Israelis, my advice is precisely the opposite of Mr. Carter's. I completely understand the urgent desire on the part of American peacemakers to do something. And in the case of Mr. Carter, that passion is especially strong. Few Israelis and Egyptians I know would take issue with the fact that had it not been for the role played by the US, led by President Jimmy Carter -- building on Anwar Sadat's historic visit and Menachem Begin's strong response -- there would have been no Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979. @highlight Aaron Miller: Jimmy Carter's call for US to recognize the State of Palestine is a mistake @highlight Key to solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict does not rest in President Obama's hands, nor in those of his successor, he says	Palestinian

But the openness was complicated by a shift in the official positions listed on his website. The comments, made in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, signal less of a policy shift for Trump than a change from the rhetoric that helped win him the presidency just three days ago and could set up a fight with conservatives. Trump told the paper he was reconsidering his stance after Thursday's meeting with Obama, who urged him to protect parts of the law. Trump said he would like to keep the provision forbidding discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and to allow young Americans to remain on their parents' healthcare plans. @highlight Trump told the paper he was reconsidering his stance after Thursday's meeting with Obama @highlight It's a far cry from what Trump uttered during the primary to his boisterous fans at rallies	Obama

A terrorist drove a vehicle packed with more than three tonnes of explosives into the busy market area of Khan Bani Saad, north of the capital Baghdad, on what was a scorching Friday afternoon. In what is considered one of deadliest attacks in Iraq this decade, the driver called on hundreds of locals to gather around the vehicle, telling them he was selling ice at a heavily discounted price in celebration of Eid al-Fitr - the feast that ends the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. @highlight Terrorist drove lorry laden with ice into a market in Khan Bani Saad, Iraq @highlight He encouraged locals to gather around, offering discounts for Eid al-Fitr @highlight But beneath the thin layer of ice were three tonnes of deadly explosives @highlight Killer driver waited until truck was surrounded before blowing himself up @highlight 115 people were killed and scores injured as the blast left a massive crater	Fitr

Kirsten Gillibrand's message about helping the public took on a bold tone Friday morning when she told a crowd at a conference on technology and democracy, "If we are not helping people, we should go the f--- home." In an out-of-character move, the New York senator dropped the f-bomb a handful of times during a speech at the Personal Democracy Forum at New York University, which explores technology's impact on politics, government and society. Speaking about President Donald Trump's accomplishments in the White House, Gillibrand said, "Has he kept his promises? No. F--- no." This is not the first time that Gillibrand has used the four-letter word.

question: Jeb Bush, the top vote-getter in recent @placeholder primary polls. context: Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has raised more than $45 million since her campaign launched on April 12, she announced today. That number, the first announced by a major-party 2016 candidate, is nearly half of the $100 million target her political operatives set for themselves to rake in by the end of the year. The Clinton team released the preliminary total on Twitter, with the former secretary of state noting that her bean-counters were 'still running the numbers.' The quick results – just hours after the fundraising quarter ended Tuesday at midnight – paint Clinton as a formidable foe for Vice President Joe Biden or any other Democrat still thinking about a challenge in the primary season. @highlight $45 million haul from start of April to yesterday sets a new record, beating Obama's $41.9 million first-quarter total in 2011 @highlight Campaign says 91 per cent of donors gave $100 or less, combating her image as a high-dollar tree shaker @highlight Other candidates on both sides of the aisle have until July 15 to file their totals with the Federal Election Commission @highlight It's unlikely anyone other than Republican Jeb Bush will top her, but Donald Trump has virtually unlimited personal wealth to draw on	Republican

Although the FCC's new ban on "unreasonable discrimination" for wired ISPs allows certain kinds of traffic discrimination (not all bits need be equal), the agency made clear after Tuesday's meeting that "paid prioritization" deals with Internet companies are unlikely to be allowed. Critics had worried that the new Order would only affect outright website blocking, leaving paid prioritization untouched (or even implicitly sanctioned). "Pay for Priority Unlikely to Satisfy 'No Unreasonable Discrimination' Rule," advises one subheading of the new net neutrality rules.

In a speech Thursday morning, Romney said, "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University."

He admitted theft of the bag and contents, including Mrs Clarke's iPhone which was worth around £350, and will be sentenced at a later date. @highlight Sean Earle stole bag of mother-of-three seconds after she fell from bridge @highlight He 'saw his opportunity' when Linda Clarke, 55, fell to her death, court told @highlight Her husband Gary said the 'despicable' theft had 'added to family's pain' @highlight Earle, 26, admitted he stole handbag, its contents and phone worth £350	Clarke
question: Vardy had been earmarked to play centre forward against @placeholder. context: After three days training amid the bright lights, bingo and all-day breakfasts of Benidorm, Roy Hodgson has decided to stay away from the full English. Not as we have come to know it anyhow. There will be no Wayne Rooney against Spain, with the captain rested, and Hodgson has reframed the nature of these two friendlies amid injuries. They had been billed as the chance to fine-tune his strongest team, but last night the England boss claimed it was more about looking into certain individuals, partnerships and chemistry. This was back to the language which preceded depressing defeats by Germany and Chile in November 2013, when things started to unravel soon after a promising World Cup qualification campaign. @highlight Wayne Rooney is going to be rested by England for the Spain friendly @highlight Harry Kane will lead England's attack, with Jamie Vardy missing injured @highlight Ross Barkley is set to play behind Kane as an attacking midfielder	Spain
question: Hernandez's attorneys countered that @placeholder was a witness to, not a participant in, the killing. context: Former New England Patriots star and newly convicted killer Aaron Hernandez is facing a second murder trial in a 2012 drive-by shooting that left two men dead and a third wounded. Earlier today, the 25-year-old athlete was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 2013 shooting death of semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. A jury panel in Fall River, Massachusetts, spent 36 hours spread over seven days deliberating Hernandez’s fate before returning a guilty verdict.

Because I couldn't decide between paying homage to the Wind God at Tulum's circa-1200 AD Maya ruins or sinking into a Jacuzzi with a view of the Caribbean, I decided to have it all: I toured -- and ranked the pros and cons of -- eight of the region's all-inclusive resorts, each offering its own unique south-of-the-border vacation.

The midfielder, hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson last year as the best English player in the game, has won countless club trophies but struggled for consistency at international level throughout his career. Now 33 years old, he is one of the oldest heads in Roy Hodgson’s squad and is a strong contender for a place at the bottom of the midfield diamond the England manager so often prefers to deploy.

When Neymar did it in the last minutes of the Spanish Cup final against Athletic Bilbao he was accused of excessive showboating. His answer: 'You ain't seen nothing yet.' In Brazil's first game of the Copa America he flicked the ball over Peruvian midfielder Luis Advíncula's head and then did it again – a double sombrero.

A: CNN.com is completely blocked as of today. Because when I use [a privately secured network] the site works ok.

question: @placeholder's dismissal ends a major chapter in a career of the man once seen as the unimpeachable and nonpartisan ideal of how a law enforcement officer should behave. context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump had been thinking about firing FBI Director James Comey since Election Day, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday. "The President has lost confidence in Director Comey and, frankly, he'd been considering letting Director Comey go since the day he was elected," Sanders told reporters, adding that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had raised concerns about the former FBI chief on Monday, prompting Trump to ask him to put his recommendation in writing. Revelations that Trump had been unconvinced by Comey for his entire transition and presidency were surprising given the White House had previously expressed confidence in the ousted FBI chief multiple times. Sanders also said Trump was not the only one to lose confidence in the FBI director, adding there were deep reservations about him inside the FBI. @highlight Trump fired Comey Tuesday @highlight The move sent shockwaves across the nation	Comey

The attacks killed at least 22 people, according to reports. Eight others are missing and presumed dead. Amnesty International said the hospital attacks amounted to war crimes. Critics of the Syrian government warned that the latest violence is yet another troubling sign that a planned "cessation of hostilities" in the war-ravaged country is far from taking hold.

question: Clearing a village of @placeholder is slow, dangerous work that can take months, he said. context: (CNN) Just over a week into the battle for Mosul, and the vast coalition seeking to oust ISIS from Iraq's second city is making swifter than expected progress. But for all its gains -- 78 villages liberated, and nearly 800 ISIS fighters killed as of Monday morning -- the Iraqi coalition is encountering fierce resistance from ISIS, in what is anticipated to be the terror group's last stand in the country. Massively outnumbered by the advancing coalition -- a 90,000-strong force of Iraqi government troops, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and irregular militia soldiers -- ISIS relies on asymmetric warfare tactics to inflict damage on its opponents, and terrorize long-suffering civilian populations. @highlight ISIS is putting up a fierce fight to hold on to Iraq's second city, the largest under its control @highlight Outnumbered by advancing forces, it relies on tunnels, terror tactics and suicide bombs	ISIS

"He's not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want," Trump said in an interview on Sunday with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on "This Week." "Well, he's already there, isn't he?"

"We defeated Daesh (ISIS) through our unity and sacrifice for the nation. Long live Iraq and its people."

Ninety criminal incidents, a quarter of which were sexual assaults, were reported following New Year's Eve celebrations in the city, Cologne police told CNN. Police said victims described the perpetrators as gangs of Arab or North African men.

Rebecca Minnock was a ‘scourge’ on the court system who now ‘owed her liberty’ to her ex-partner, the High Court Judge Stephen Wildblood said. Roger Williams, 39, yesterday dropped proceedings against Miss Minnock, who fled with their three-year-old son Ethan when a court ruled the boy should live with his father. The hunt for the 35-year-old mother ended after 17 days when she handed herself in to police after speaking to the Daily Mail. Judge Wildblood yesterday said Miss Minnock had no excuse for what she did and he would have jailed her for at least 28 days if the case had not been dropped. He said: ‘Her actions were manifestly contrary to the welfare of her child and were a product of her own self focus.

But that isn't exactly what PricewaterhouseCoopers was doing. The firm also took the unusual step of naming the employee responsible for the fiasco: managing partner Brian Cullinan. It also emerged that Cullinan had tweeted a photo of the actress Emma Stone backstage just before the mix-up.

In the 221-201 vote, less than three dozen of the majority House Republicans joined almost all of the chamber's 200 Democrats to pass the proposal increasing the debt ceiling that lacked any deficit-reduction provisions sought by the GOP's conservative wing. The vote followed a reversal in strategy by Republican House Speaker John Boehner after he and other leaders pushed the night before to attach a provision repealing cuts to military pensions to the debt limit measure. @highlight Less than three dozen Republicans join almost all of the Democrats to back bill @highlight GOP Sen.

question: Because, whether @placeholder likes it or not, America seems poised to have its first female presidential candidate. context: (CNN) It's no secret that Donald Trump has a problem with women. So it's no surprise that he has started to attack his main rival for the American presidency, Hillary Clinton, on gender grounds, claiming that she lacks the strength, stamina, and credibility to run the country. Yet Trump should think twice before turning the looming showdown with Clinton into a referendum on whether women are fit to serve in America's highest office. If he takes this tack, he will be revealed for who he is: a weak candidate whose attitudes represent America's past, not its future. Trump may change his political positions frequently, refining his messaging to match his audience, but on women and gender issues he has remained remarkably stable over decades. In situations where he holds the reins of control, he can be pro-woman: he has rewarded and elevated high-performing female employees of his businesses, most of all his daughter Ivanka. @highlight Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Trump's new attempt to cast doubt on Clinton because of her gender shows his weakness @highlight She says he appears to fear women when he is not in charge of them, disparaging them in vulgar terms	Donald Trump
question: Around the same time, @placeholder grabbed the wheel of the hijacked SUV and drove toward the police. context: In the days after last month's Boston marathon bombings, the city was on edge. Residents were holed up in their homes, under strict orders not to leave. Investigators sifted through countless hours of surveillance images trying to determine who might have carried out this heinous attack. Then came a breakthrough. Three days after the April 15 attack, the FBI identified the bombing suspects captured in surveillance images near the finish line, later identified as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Suspect: Boston attack was payback for hits on Muslims And a manhunt was on. Hours after that FBI news conference, Boston and the rest of the country followed as the suspects allegedly shot and killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in a failed attempt to seize his gun, carjacked a black Mercedes SUV whose driver cleverly escaped at a gas station, then fled to the Boston suburb of Watertown, where they were confronted by police. @highlight Three days after the Boston marathon bombings, the FBI showed images of the suspects @highlight Hours later, a massive shootout unfolded in Watertown between police and the suspects @highlight Almost a month after the terror attack, police sources have shed new light on the Watertown shooting	Dzhokhar Tsarnaev

The kingdom, despite signaling rare public dissent with the Obama administration over Iran and the Arab Spring, is a fulcrum of U.S. diplomacy in a region where Washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders, chaotic change and sectarian carnage.

question: Although the marine debris plaguing @placeholder is the most widespread type of trash in our oceans, it is also some of the most preventable waste, according to NOAA. context: (CNN) The Hawaiian archipelago is in trash trouble. Vast amounts of trash have been washing ashore on the state's once-pristine beaches. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been trying to keep critical parts of the ocean clear of marine debris, removing 57 tons of it from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 2014. This area is a part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, the largest conservation site in the United States. Despite the government agency's efforts, Hawaii continues to be plagued by trash, much of it plastic. Originally, there was speculation that Japan's devastating 2011 tsunami had brought a wave of debris to Hawaii's islands, but recent results from an aerial survey suggest otherwise. @highlight The ocean current is carrying vast amounts of marine debris onto Hawaii's shoreline @highlight Previously, many thought Japan's 2011 tsunami caused an uptick in marine debris	Hawaii

The shocking images appear to be a desperate attempt to deflect attention away from yesterday's embarrassing defeat in Tal Abyad that has now cut off their key supply route in Syria. They show a masked, black-clad militant brandishing a hunting knife behind the captive in a sickening echo of the executions meted out by the British ISIS militant known as Jihadi John.

"Thanks to you, we've reached a milestone," she said during a speech in Brooklyn. "Tonight's victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible." After three decades at the center of American politics as a pioneering -- and deeply controversial -- feminist icon, the victory brings Clinton, 68, within reach of finally cracking the "highest, hardest glass ceiling" she lamented eight years ago when she conceded the Democratic race to Barack Obama.

President Barack Obama condemned the unrest that killed 26 people on Tuesday and began spreading Wednesday beyond Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, with reports of protesters taking over government buildings in the nation's western region.

Bush. Four years earlier, in an interview on Fox News following the 2004 presidential election, Trump said the exact opposite: that he did vote Bush despite his opposition to the Iraq War. As recently as January of this year, Trump said he voted for Bush in both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Speaking with Imus in February 2009, Trump said, "You know how I feel about Bush, and I think you got to feel that way, also." @highlight "I just thought that guy was a dimwit," Trump said of Bush in 2009 on Imus. @highlight "I voted for Bush because I think he's got certain things that are excellent," Trump said in 2005.

question: Part of @placeholder's reasoning was to avoid paying U.S. taxes. context: (CNN) Boris Johnson is a Conservative British politician famous for some decidedly undiplomatic utterances. But on Wednesday he became the UK's new foreign secretary, a role in which he oversees the country's diplomats and discusses sensitive matters with his global counterparts. The New York-born Brit is known for his colorful rhetoric over the years and distaste for political correctness. While the former London mayor has expressed considerable admiration for the U.S. over the years, he has also lit into American political leaders President Barack Obama and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. The State Department, however, is welcoming his appointment. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Johnson Thursday, and the two pledged to work closely together as NATO allies, according to the State Department. Kerry also stressed U.S. support for a "sensible and measured approach" to the Brexit process" of the the UK's departure from the EU. @highlight The new British foreign secretary compared Clinton to 'a sadistic nurse in a mental hospital' @highlight He said of Trump: 'I am genuinely worried that he could become president'	Boris Johnson

Celebrities from the Duchess of Cambridge to Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna have been seen in her creations. The designer once known as Her Serene Highness Princess Diane von Furstenberg is now dubbed the ‘Queen Mother of Fashion’, an international philanthropist and business powerhouse estimated to be worth $450 million. In an industry obsessed with novelty, the 68-year-old Diane has managed to stay immensely influential. Time magazine recently included her in its list of the 100 Most Influential People; Forbes has her in its list of the world’s ‘most powerful women’. Proving that she still has great cachet even with the latest wave of fashion figures, clothes designer Victoria Beckham, who became a close friend after they met at a Los Angeles school attended by the Beckham children and von Furstenberg’s grandchildren, has called her an ‘amazingly inspirational person — not just as a designer but as a woman’. @highlight Diane von Furstenberg is now dubbed the 'Queen Mother of Fashion' @highlight She is most famous for the wrap dress, worn by numerous celebrities @highlight A new biography reveals her wild and glamorous route to the top	Diane
question: The third counter-attacking goal came 12 minutes before the break, and seemed to sap the energy from @placeholder. context: Not even London buses can match the barmy irregularity of Alexis Sanchez. Having seemed out of sorts during a run without scoring that extended to eight appearances, this cracker-jack attacker ended the wait with a flurry: a hat-trick to send Arsenal closer to the summit and wipe out the last unbeaten record in the Premier League. Leicester have finally tasted defeat this season, and Claudio Ranieri will not enjoy the irony. The Italian left English football 11 years ago after being sacked by Chelsea, unable to overhaul Arsene Wenger’s Invincibles. But such was the entertainment here, even home supporters applauded their players from the pitch.

question: McCarthy fires in his shot from the edge of the area as Fabricio Coloccini chases, but the effort found the net and eased @placeholder nerves context: Roberto Martinez was unmoved. Chomping on a piece of gum, arms folded tightly, Everton’s manager looked like a man who was feeling the tension of the day. The scene that was unfolding around him, however, was completely at odds with his demeanour. In one corner of Goodison Park, Ross Barkley was being mobbed by a group of ecstatic team-mates, while the stands were abuzz with exultant supporters. Barkley had just gracefully and gleefully ensured Everton had equalled their biggest win of a bewildering Barclays Premier League campaign, a 3-0 slaying of a wretched Newcastle United team who finished with 10 men, but, for a second, Martinez appeared reluctant to embrace the moment. @highlight Everton were just three points above the relegation zone at the start of play after Burnley's win on Saturday @highlight James McCarthy wrong-footed Tim Krul with his low shot from just outside the area to give Everton 20th-minute lead @highlight Romelu Lukaku doubled the lead with a penalty on 56 minutes after Aaron Lennon was fouled by Yoan Gouffran @highlight Fabricio Coloccini was red carded for lunge at Lennon in the 59th minute as Newcastle fell apart @highlight Arouna Kone rounded Newcastle keeper Krul in the closing stages but could not find the net from a tight angle @highlight Ross Barkley capped the win with his second goal of the season during stoppage time with a cool finish	Everton
question: @placeholder’s situation means this is a game for goals, but Ramsey has to be clever — he can’t go forward at every opportunity. context: Alexis Sanchez will be a big loss for Arsenal on Wednesday — the Chilean has been directly involved in seven of their nine Champions League goals — and it’s up to the likes of Joel Campbell to mitigate his absence. The 23-year-old forward said himself that now is the time for the fringe players to step up and show what they’re capable of, and I think this could be his night. He’s somebody I really like watching. I like his pace and technique, and he gives Arsene Wenger options down the left and the right.

Col. Chris Garver said Iraqi security forces destroyed other vehicles. The Iraqi military provided different numbers, saying coalition and Iraqi forces destroyed a total of 750 ISIS vehicles in the two convoys and killed hundreds of ISIS militants. One of the convoys consisted of 700 vehicles, said the commander of the Iraqi Air Force, Lt. Gen. Hamed al-Maliki.

question: I'm roughly fluent in @placeholder, my children are all dual citizens and, for better or for worse, Italy is home. context: Rome (CNN) The world as we know it could come to an end this Sunday. Or it could be just another day. It depends on whom you talk to. This weekend, Italians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should amend its 1948 constitution. The referendum is the brainchild of Matteo Renzi, Italy's energetic, 41-year-old Prime Minister. His intention is to defang the upper house of the Italian Parliament, the Senato, by cutting its numbers from 315 to 100, thus reducing its powers dramatically, making it more of a consultative assembly. Yes, if you read to the end of the previous paragraph, you'll probably agree it sounds dull as dust. But, in the eyes of some, the consequences of a "No" vote could be catastrophic. @highlight Italians prepare to vote in constitutional referendum @highlight Reforms would reduce number of senators in upper house of parliament, making it easier to pass laws @highlight Critics say changes would get rid of an important check on the lower house's power	Italian
question: At the risk of agreeing with @placeholder, I think he's correct that Obama would be considered cool. context: New York (CNN) -- When I was growing up, my friends and I all wanted to be cool -- like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro or, of course, the king of cool at the time: Fonzie. (I should note that I grew up in an Italian neighborhood.) Being "cool" was a good thing. Today it appears that being "cool" could be a bad thing, at least if you are running for president of the United States. That theory surfaced in an ad from a Republican super PAC headed by Karl Rove. The super PAC American Crossroads argues in its campaign ad that Barack Obama is "too cool" to be president. The attack ad shows President Obama "slow jamming" the news on Jimmy Fallon's NBC late-night talk show, singing an Al Green song and chugging a beer.

question: A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the @placeholder government by many of the same plaintiffs in the current Hopkins lawsuit back in 2012. context: The victims of a horrific medical experiment run by the United States in Guatemala that deliberately infected individuals with syphilis in order to test drugs and study the disease are now suing Johns Hopkins University. The lawsuit, which has 750 plantiffs and includes victims and their families, is seeking $1billion, claiming that officials from Hopkins approved the study at the time and even helped to plan and monitor it as it ran from 1945 to 1956. The few victims who are still alive were almost all children when they were unknowingly infected, and many among them were orphans. In the aftermath of the experiment, some of the individuals died of syphilis, with open sores covering their bodies, while those who did survive claim they passed the disease down to their children, ending up with babies that were born blind, severely handicapped, and, in at least one case, without a brain. @highlight Victims and their families of a US study that infected individuals with syphilis in Guatemala without their knowledge are suing Johns Hopkins @highlight In a $1billion lawsuit, 750 plaintiffs claim the college approved and helped to plan the study, which ran from 1945 to 1956 @highlight The victims were mostly orphans, children, prisoners, soldiers, prostitutes and mental patients @highlight Marta Orellana was just 9 years old when one day at the orphanage she was ordered to go to the infirmary and infected with the disease @highlight Federico Mesa was a solider who was forcibly injected with syphilis as a soldier and passed it along to his family @highlight Marta Ruiz's husband was infected, and she gave birth to one child who did not have a brain and another who is severely handicapped @highlight Another woman, Victoria, claims she was born blind because he father was infected @highlight Blindness, deformities, and death are just some of the problems babies born with congenital syphilis face @highlight A lawyer for Johns Hopkins has called the suit 'baseless'	US

Dutch national Nancy Holten, 42, has lived in Switzerland for more than 30 years. There, applications for citizenship are determined by local governments -- sometimes with input from residents. And among the requirements are that a person is integrated in the Swiss way of life and familiar with Swiss customs and traditions.

"The election of Donald Trump has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America," Reid, the Senate minority leader, said in a stinging statement, which is a departure from the strategy of other leading Democrats.

It was the first time that Nasa had launched spaceship a designed to carry astronauts far beyond Earth in nearly half a century. Nasa attempted to find out in today's test flight of an Orion mock-up, which touched down in the Arizona desert after engineers intentionally failed two different parachutes. An image taken by Verge reporter, Loren Grush, shows how the Orion capsule landed 'almost upsidedown'.

Eugene Landy is about to be portrayed as a manipulative monster in John Cusack's new movie Love & Mercy, which is released next week. But today his son Evan tells Daily Mail Online in an exclusive interview that his father should actually be given credit for saving the life of the troubled Good Vibrations star.

question: Guinea-@placeholder failed to deal with the danger after another probing run by Ekambi and the ball eventually fell to Sébastien Siani on the edge of the box. context: (CNN) "Pressure and I are like husband and wife," Gabon coach Jose Antonio Camacho once said. On today's showing, it looks as though the marriage is more likely to end in divorce than happily ever after. After Gabon's opening day draw with minnow Guinea-Bissau, anything other than a win against Burkina Faso would make qualification for the knockout stage unlikely. Despite a spirited second-half effort, Wednesday's 1-1 draw means the host nation will be watching the late match between Cameroon and Guinea-Bissau with a keen eye. With that must-win nature of the match in mind Gabon started brightly.

Derrion Albert, 16, was beaten to death September 24. His death was captured on video. "I'm just happy to be out," Eugene Bailey said, a day after authorities announced they were dismissing the charge against him in the September 24 death of Derrion Albert. Police said Albert, a 16-year-old honors student, was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School.

Tragedy turns the mundane into memorial. Something as simple as a wallet can evoke the immense sadness of a day like September 11, 2001. Objects big and small from the greatest terrorist attack on American soil now make up a museum dedicated to that tragedy and the 2,983 people who perished.

The language tucked into Trump's order on building a border wall instructs the Department of Homeland Security to use an obscure federal law to send land-arriving migrants back to neighboring territory, even as they continue to await court proceedings in the United States. The policy shift would mean that even if they are thought to have a credible claim to asylum, they may be forced to wait years in Mexico for a future court date in the US. @highlight Asylum seekers fleeing violence in Central America often go through Mexico into the United States @highlight The move could affect tens of thousands of people per year, according to government statistics	Mexico

question: Part of the problem for @placeholder is one of recruiting. context: Washington (CNN) The young blood in the Democratic Party is (still) waiting for its moment. Democratic leaders across both the legislative and executive branches are generally older than leadership on the other side of the aisle, leading to some restlessness among the lower ranks who have been patiently awaiting their turn at the top. The most recent blow to those hoping to climb the ranks? Dianne Feinstein, 84, the oldest senator currently serving in the chamber, just announced a bid for re-election to the seat she's held for two and a half decades.

question: Perhaps prompted by rising speculation about Russia, Trump launched a Twitter barrage Monday night, possibly to distract attention from stories damaging to his @placeholder by attacking a familiar target. context: Washington (CNN) The darkening storm over Russia is now looming over President Donald Trump's innermost circle. The intrigue now threatening to swamp Washington politics deepened on Monday when Trump's son-in-law and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner, offered to testify to senators about meetings with senior Kremlin officials -- including the head of a bank closely linked to President Vladimir Putin's government. And more revelations about a secret trip to the White House complex by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes spurred claims by Democrats that he was in league with the President's aides to subvert his own panel's investigation into Moscow's alleged election meddling and ties to the Trump campaign. @highlight On Monday, Kushner volunteered to testify @highlight Later in the week senators will weigh in	White House

The new cardinals come from countries around the world, hailing from as far afield as Brazil, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, South Korea and Haiti. The pope presented them with the traditional biretta, or red cap, and ring at a formal ceremony called a public consistory.

He has every right to do so: After all, he has dual citizenship for both countries. Some observers disagree with Manzano's action. On CNN.com, Ruben Navarrette voiced his concerns that Manzano was showing disloyalty to the United States even while he's wearing the USA jersey. Opinion: U.S. Olympic athlete, Mexican flag? Judging by the volume of comments in response to Navarrette's opinion, one would think that Manzano had committed treason. One reader wrote, "He is pathetic. ... Go back to Mexico.

Walter Shaub, who served as ethics director under the Obama administration, said Conway likely violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits White House officials from advocating for or against candidates, even in media interviews. Speaking to Fox News Monday, Conway addressed the heated Alabama race and Moore's Democratic competitor, saying, "Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don't be fooled. He will be a vote against tax cuts.

The German was welcomed to Anfield with much fanfare having been announced as Brendan Rodgers' successor and he guided the Reds to a 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane. While injuries to Christian Benteke, Danny Ings and now Daniel Sturridge have limited Klopp's attacking options, the former Borussia Dortmund boss saw Liverpool keep their first clean sheet since August.

The magazine Charlie Hebdo, which is known for outrageous humor, published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Mohammed on Wednesday. The issue hit the stands eight days after a video mocking the Muslim prophet triggered angry protests, including one that led to the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya.

EW's Owen Gleiberman calls it "sensitive and eye-opening"; the film has also earned a near-perfect 93 percent "Fresh" rating from the reviews aggregated by Rotten Tomatoes. But in an article posted late last week, Slate's Emily Bazelon alleged that some crucial parts of "Bully" are "utterly one-sided" and "factually questionable." Her piece focused on Tyler Long, one of the doc's featured subjects; when he was just 17, Long took his own life, apparently because he was bullied by his classmates. But according to Bazelon, that isn't the whole story. She wrote that Tyler also suffered from ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Asperger's syndrome; additionally, his girlfriend broke up with him a few weeks before his suicide. It seems likely that these factors contributed to Tyler's decision to commit suicide, Bazelon wrote.

question: Were @placeholder to capture the entire city, it would give the group morale-boosting control of a second provincial capital in Syria, after Raqqa, and improve its supply lines across the border into Iraq. context: (CNN) Fierce battles continue around the strategic city of Deir Ezzor in northern Syria between regime forces and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), according to human rights groups. Hundreds of combatants and civilians have been killed over the past week, and Russian aircraft have been dropping supplies to beleaguered army units. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad is battling to retain a foothold in the area. It still controls the military airport to the south, but ISIS claims to have overrun several regime-held districts at the beginning of the week, taking advantage of a sandstorm that grounded military aircraft. But in the last few days, Russian and possibly Syrian warplanes have carried out airstrikes against ISIS areas, while the already desperate situation of civilians has worsened. @highlight Hundreds of combatants and civilians have been killed over the past week @highlight The regime of President Bashar al-Assad is battling to retain a foothold in the area @highlight Russian aircraft have been dropping supplies to beleaguered army units	ISIS
question: In fact, Reddit may not have had an impact on Ryan's @placeholder decision. context: (Mashable) -- Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) will not support the Stop Online Piracy Act, according to a statement released by his office Monday. In the statement, Ryan calls the Internet "one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history" and says "it should stay that way." According to Ryan, SOPA is an attempted solution to the "legitimate problem" of digital piracy, but the bill "creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse." Congressman Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, became a target of the Reddit community last month. Reddit users considered Ryan's previous stance on SOPA too vague -- and took issue with the $288,600 that the Congressman had accepted from pro-SOPA groups. @highlight Congressman says bill "creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation" @highlight Makes sense that Paul Ryan would oppose a bill giving more authority to federal government @highlight Ryan says Internet is an expression of freedom and should stay that way	SOPA

Such a ban became a rallying cry for victims' families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December. President Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.

Amnesty says it has new evidence abuses persist in a war that has been described as one of the world's worst humanitarian conflicts by the United Nations.

Ray, a barber with a wife and four children, received a life sentence from a judge who initially tried to sentence him to 27 years for arranging a drug sale in 2007 but was ultimately forced to give him the maximum sentence: life behind bars.

But Marty, who's cruised so many times that he's a Platinum VIP in the company's rewards program, was shocked when a representative told him he couldn't go on the inaugural trip because of where he was born: Cuba.

Cook, who accepted an offer to become a Moldovan citizen in April, could face former GB rival Lutalo Muhammad in the -80kg semi-finals at the European Games in Baku on Thursday. Muhammad was controversially preferred to Cook for London and won a bronze medal, prompting the then world number one to quit the national camp and represent the former Soviet Republic.

But there was Trump, just 24 days before the election, composing yet another unhinged tweet as most Americans were still sleeping: "Watched 'Saturday Night Live' hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election!"

Economists and Democrats have already panned the budget as a document that benefits the wealthy and cuts services from the poor. Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget chief, rejected that idea on Tuesday. "We are no longer going to measure compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those programs, but the number of people we help get off of those programs," he said, arguing that it is actually compassionate to cut government spending on inefficient programs. @highlight Economists and Democrats have already panned the budget as a document that benefits the wealthy @highlight The budget assumes that the American economy will begin growing at 3% each year	Donald Trump

The foreign policy face-off on Monday was devoted to a subject on which presidents can speak about decision-making in the first person and challengers can't. As recently as a few weeks ago, coming off a rocky foreign summer tour and a widely panned response to the deadly September 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, Mitt Romney seemed headed for a tough night.

Trimming the active component of the Army from 580,000 to 450,000 would hardly take us back to the interwar Army of 280,000 that gave birth to great wartime leaders like Dwight Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, George A. Patton or Douglass MacArthur, but it still represents a significant reduction in manpower. It undoubtedly will start World War III on the Hill and among other elements of what Ike referred to as our "military-industrial complex," but Hagel should hold the line as the time is ripe for an audacious move on this front.

How can this be happening?" Trump wrote on Twitter. John Noonan, a national security adviser to Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, observed that Trump had incorrectly ascribed "classified" to the "C" markings -- they actually denote a lower security status, "confidential."

question: James Ward turned the tie in @placeholder's favour with his own victory over Isner on Friday context: It was a weekend when Andy Murray was full to bursting with emotion, but he struck a note of pragmatism after leading Great Britain to Davis Cup victory. The din of what is the closest he can get to a home-town crowd was still ringing in his ears as he considered the implications of a 3-2 victory over America - one that has again put Leon Smith’s squad into the last eight of the sport’s premier team competition.

question: @placeholder and Belgian prisons have proven to be universities of jihad. context: (CNN) There have been eight lethal terrorist attacks in Europe since 2014, five of them in France alone, carried out by ISIS or by "lone wolves" inspired by the terror group or by al Qaeda. What do these attacks have in common? The terrorists are almost invariably criminals who have either served time in the French or Belgian prison systems, or they have been convicted for lesser offenses but have avoided jail time. Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, who killed at least 84 people Thursday in Nice, France, had a long record of petty crimes. Bouhlel assaulted a motorist last year for which he received a six-month suspended sentence. @highlight Peter Bergen: Many of those behind terror attacks in Europe shared criminal background @highlight Conditions in French prisons incubated the radicalization of many terrorists, he says	French
question: Former Bradford player @placeholder does not believe the fire was anything other than an accident context: For Stuart McCall, the memories of May 11, 1985 will never fade. As Bradford City celebrated promotion from the old English Third Division, a day of joy quickly became one of devastation as a fire ripped through the timber main stand at Valley Parade towards the end of the first half, claiming 56 helpless victims. Just 21 years of age, McCall returned to his car, only to find the door handle was burning hot because it had been parked so near to the blaze. Upon learning his father, Andy — one of a large group of McCall’s relatives at the game — had been badly burned and was missing, the young midfielder set off frantically through the streets of Bradford. @highlight In 1985 the main stand of Bradford's Valley Parade caught fire, killing 56 @highlight Inquiry found the fire had probably started via stray match or cigarette @highlight McCall was playing that day and his father was badly burned in the blaze @highlight Bradford fan Martin Fletcher claims the fire may not have been an accident @highlight Fletcher's father, uncle, brother and grandfather lost their lives in the fire @highlight Fletcher claims chairman Stafford Heginbotham may have been to blame @highlight But McCall refutes those claims insisting it was just an accident	McCall

The two men have been under house arrest since special counsel Robert Mueller charged them on October 30. Both have pleaded not guilty. Manafort got the exception to be with his family on Thursday.

Stone, a one-time adviser to Trump, issued a combative opening statement Monday evening ahead of his highly anticipated appearance before the House intelligence committee Tuesday morning in a closed session. Following his meeting, Stone said he had a "frank exchange" and described the preceding as "an entirely political exercise."

question: Even @placeholder's staunch ally, Russia, accepts that the deaths were caused by chemical weapons. context: (CNN) Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has dismissed reports of last week's chemical attack as "100% fabrication," an assertion at odds with numerous eyewitness accounts, independent analysis and even the explanation given by its strongest ally, Russia. In an interview with the AFP news agency, conducted under restrictions imposed by the Syrian government at the presidential palace in Damascus, Assad claimed the reported details of what happened were not credible because their source was al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front. He suggested that photographs showing children who had died in the attack on a rebel-held town in Idlib province, which provoked revulsion around the world, were staged.

The Scottish First Minister met staff and pupils at Daniel Hale Williams elementary in Brooklyn, claiming it will help her to drive up standards in Scotland. But the big event of the first day of her tour is a slot on Jon Stewart's ratings hit The Daily Show tonight, which unfortunately billed her as a 'comedian' and not a politician.

The Federation Council had approved Putin's request for a resolution allowing the use of force on March 1. But Tuesday, Putin sent a letter to the speaker of the upper house seeking to cancel the resolution. One lawmaker voted against revoking the powers Wednesday, with 153 in favor.

Rabbitohs sealed a final minute 18-17 victory over the Bulldogs in an absorbing encounter at ANZ Stadium in Sydney during the Good Friday showdown. But fans turned on referee Gerard Sutton and his colleagues after they penalised Bulldogs captain James Graham in the final minute, effectively handing the Rabbitohs the win.

question: In 2014, @placeholder's father secured about €2 million in campaign financing with the help of a Russian oligarch for the elections that year. context: (CNN) On one hand, Donald Trump's praise of France's far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who appears to have received enough votes in Sunday's election to advance to the May 7 runoff, is not surprising. Le Pen, like Trump, ran a campaign that was anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and traded on white supremacist themes. (It's no coincidence that former Klan leader David Duke has publicly praised both Le Pen and Trump.) On the other hand, you would think Trump would be hesitant to publicly praise a candidate like Le Pen, an avid supporter of Vladimir Putin, particularly given that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said just two weeks ago that US-Russian relations had reached an all time low. @highlight Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have praised Marine Le Pen, the pro-Putin French presidential candidate @highlight Dean Obeidallah: Despite recent drama between Trump and Vladimir Putin, they and Le Pen are natural allies	Le Pen

Villa manager Remi Garde is continuing his punishment of the young forward after Sportsmail revealed footage showing him partying after their 4-0 loss to Everton last month. Grealish was sent to train with the development team last Tuesday and was subsequently dropped from last weekend’s 3-2 loss to Watford.

Bryant, slowed by age and past injuries, has looked like a shadow of his former self this year and that was never more apparent than against Golden State who blasted the Lakers to surge to 16-0. The 37-year-old scored four points and managed to make just one of 14 shots to tie the worst shooting night of his 20-year career. 'He's struggling right now to make a shot.

Nearly two months into the job, Klopp has begun outlining where he needs to improve the squad he inherited from Brendan Rodgers. He has been heavily linked with Brazilian striker Pato and confirmed there is no agreement with former club Borussia Dortmund to stop him making approaches for their players.

question: @placeholder's apparent willingness to look at evidence of the plot comes in stark contrast to the response of the country's supreme leader. context: Officials in Washington said Monday they would grant consular access to the U.S.-held suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said officials do not believe the suspect, Manssor Arbabsia, 56, is entitled to consular visits because he is a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen. But the agency has long encouraged authorities to allow consular visits in such cases and would do so this time, he said. Earlier, a senior administration official said Monday the United States will grant access if Iran formally requests it.

Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado introduced Hillary Clinton at a Florida rally Tuesday, blasting Donald Trump. And for once, the billionaire didn't react. No tweets. No attacks from the stump. Nothing. Instead, he stayed on message going after Clinton on her email server while pledging to repeal Obamacare. In the final days of the 2016 campaign, Trump isn't taking Clinton's bait.

Tim Ryan is calling his bid to oust Nancy Pelosi a "David versus Goliath" type clash -- a back bencher competing against the top House Democrat who made history in 2007 when she was sworn in as the first female speaker of the House. "If you're a quarterback and you keep throwing interceptions, you change quarterbacks," the 43-year-old Ryan, a former high school football player, said in a recent interview criticizing the record of Pelosi, 76, and arguing it's time for a younger generation to take the reins.

Many demonstrators voicing their desire for a new government and new political future remained on the streets well into Saturday morning, defying a curfew and revelling in a historic day in a nation whose history dates back millennia. By early Saturday, police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo, with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades.

The last time Leverkusen travelled to the Spanish city, they were thrashed 7-1, with Lionel Messi getting a five goal haul. The Bundesliga outfit are more optimistic this time around, though. Messi is out injured, and Leverkusen have a budding superstar in their own ranks. Free-kick specialist Hakan Calhanoglu has been linked with almost all of Europe's top clubs, so does the youngster have what it takes to shock Barcelona? One of the rising stars of the Bundesliga. The 21-year-old Leverkusen midfielder has made a name for himself as one of Germany's top free kick specialists, able to flummox even the likes of Manuel Neuer with his vicious, dipping dead ball strikes from long range.

Passing through campaign chairman John Podesta's inbox were longtime allies of Clinton and her husband, inner circle aides on whom she relied, and newer members of the team who joined the campaign in its infancy.

Until recently, an off-menu item at the pizza restaurant was cocaine. A six-month joint investigation by the King County Sheriff's Office and the police department in Sammamish, just east of Seattle, resulted in the arrests of five people, two of whom are accused of selling drugs out of a Papa John's.

Germany's foreign minister at EU meetings in Brussels described reaction among leaders as "astonishment and agitation." After months of little detail, Trump has opened up in a joint interview for German newspaper Bild and British newspaper The Times — which sent its columnist Michael Gove, a sitting UK member of Parliament and prominent Brexit campaigner.

Berry, whom police took to safety along with two other women they rescued from a home at 2207 Seymour Ave., could be seen healthy and beaming in a photo snapped Monday at an area hospital. She endured 10 years of confinement, but her life will go on. Carmichael was less fortunate.

De Rossi scored with a twice-taken penalty in the sixth minute but blotted his copybook early in the second half when he was dismissed after clashing with Iliyan Mitsanski, who was also sent off. Buffon, who won his first cap in a World Cup qualifier away to Russia in 1997, rescued Italy with a difficult save from Giorgi Milanov in stoppage time.

The court ruled that all powers vested under the legislative body will be transferred to the Supreme Court, which is stacked with government loyalists. The ruling effectively means the three branches of the Venezuelan government will be controlled by the ruling United Socialist Party. The opposition has been taken out of the picture. Prominent opposition leaders are already calling the government of President Nicolás Maduro "a dictatorship." "Nicolás Maduro has staged a coup d'état," National Assembly President Julio Borges said Thursday.

question: The new, pro-@placeholder assembly will have the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution. context: Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro lashed out at the United States on Monday night after President Trump called him a "dictator" and US officials slapped the leader with sanctions over a controversial election. "You are either with Trump or you are with Venezuela. You are either with Trump or with democracy," Maduro told Venezuelans as he received the first official results from Sunday's election establishing a new legislative body made up entirely of his supporters. Maduro said Trump is "making the biggest mistake of his life in messing" with the country. Earlier, US national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Maduro "joins a very exclusive club," comparing him to leaders such as Syria's Bashar al-Assad and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

For Nadir Ciftci, last seen in Turkey three years ago in the colours of Kayserispor, the chance to shine under the lights of Fenerbahce's Sukru Saracoglu Stadium passed in a blizzard of heavy touches and missed opportunities. Sent clear either side of half time by Nir Bitton and Scott Allan, a lack of acceleration did for his hopes of announcing his return in style. Craig Gordon was directly culpable for Lazar Markovic's opener yet the goal could be traced back to Cifti's fluffed shot at the other end seconds beforehand. @highlight Celtic drew 1-1 with Fenerbahce in Europa League on Thursday night @highlight Nadir Ciftci was selected in Leigh Griffiths' absence for the clash @highlight Cifti's 90-minute contribution summed up his difficult spell with Celtic	Cifti

The results are fascinating – and surprising in some cases too. Legendary Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was selected in only one PL all-star team (1993), as was Dennis Bergkamp (1998) and therefore are well short of being considered for the greatest XI.

The more golf they play, the less time they have to mess with our lives. I'm sure liberals would gladly raise the money to buy Donald Trump a golden golf cart if it kept him out of the White House. In fact, he needs little encouragement. Trump has played his 16th round of golf since becoming President. For this we might be grateful, were it not for two complaints: cost and shameless hypocrisy. There's good reason to defend the role of golf in US politics. It's the presidential game. The sport is kind on the bones of older, powerful men; it's a chance to mix gentle leisure with one-on-one diplomacy.

A majority of Colombians must still approve the landmark deal in a referendum set for October 2.

"When you see the Mississippi River and it's about two miles wide because it's lost its borders, it's sobering," said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. The Coast Guard closed a five-mile stretch of the river at Caruthersville, Missouri, on Friday to prevent waves generated by passing barges from damaging levees and flood gates along the river, Chief Warrant Officer Lionel Bryant said. @highlight Tennessee governor says sight of the Mississippi two miles wide is "sobering" @highlight The Coast Guard is closing part of the Mississippi River to protect levees and flood gates @highlight Authorities urge some Memphis, Tennessee, residents to evacuate	Mississippi
question: Corker said @placeholder told him about his decision after the lunch among Republican senators earlier Tuesday. context: Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will not run for re-election, he said Tuesday in a blistering speech on the Senate floor that bemoaned the "coarsening" tenor of politics in the United States. Flake denounced the "complicity" of his own party in what he called an "alarming and dangerous state of affairs" under Trump, blaming the President for setting the tone. In his speech, Flake assailed a "flagrant disregard for truth or decency" and attacked a "regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms." "When such behavior emanates from the top of our government, it is something else: It is dangerous to a democracy," Flake said. @highlight Sen.

Both men have turned voter disaffection into electoral triumph. Farage did so in the now infamous Brexit -- taking the UK out of the EU; Trump in winning the US presidency. Both men identified the other as a brother in arms along the way. So much so that at one recent rally, Trump told his supporters: "We are going to do something so special. It will be so special.

question: The worst part for @placeholder may be figuring out what to do about it all -- not just the various individual fires, but more generally how to "take control of his own government," CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said. context: (CNN) -- In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House. After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration's nominations.

Kathleen WIlley, now 69, made a splash in 1998 by claiming in a '60 Minutes' interview that Bill Clinton had sexually assaulted her during a Oval Office meeting in 1993.

An animal doesn’t move like that. Someone moved it [the collar]. We get the impression someone was trying to fool us.’ Dentist Walter Palmer – who is said to have joined guides in luring the 13-year-old lion away from Hwange National Park before killing him – remains in hiding more than a month after the incident.

Now Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov is urging Russia to "do the right thing" and admit it. Russia has consistently denied the claims of Rodchenkov -- the former head of Moscow's anti-doping laboratory -- which formed the basis of the 2016 McLaren Report's conclusions that more than 1,000 athletes benefited from a systematic doping program between 2011 and 2015.

question: If @placeholder hacked, if Russia did anything having to do with our election I want to know about it," Trump said. context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is known for his blunt talk -- on everything ranging from trade to immigration and the fight against ISIS. But throughout the 2016 campaign, and now in the White House, there's one topic that he's been less forthcoming about -- Russia's role interfering in the US election. He's answered questions about attempts to hack the 2016 election many different ways throughout the campaign and since ascending to the presidency -- even speculating during a debate last year that it "could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." The unanimous assessment of the US intelligence community is clear: Russia orchestrated a series of hacks and cyberattacks to meddle in the 2016 election and help Trump beat Hillary Clinton. Intelligence agencies have not concluded that Russian efforts made a difference in the election result. @highlight Spicer said Tuesday he hasn't talked to Trump about the hacking @highlight US intelligence agencies agree Russia is to blame	Russia

question: @placeholder has been at the center of a firestorm this week after business partners and associates rounded on him for his anti-Mexican rhetoric. context: Donald Trump has renewed his calls for tougher immigration controls in the wake of an illegal Mexican migrant allegedly murdering a woman in San Francisco. The presidential hopeful branded U.S. border controls an 'absolute disgrace' in light of the revelation that Francisco Sanchez, 45, had already been deported five times - and was recently released from jail by officials who routinely refuse requests to hand over illegal immigrants. Sanchez is accused of gunning down Kathryn Steinle, 32, as she walked along Pier 14 with her father on Thursday evening.

The Premier League broke the current spending record by splashing out £870millon during the summer transfer window with Kevin de Bruyne's £54m move from Wolfsburg to Manchester City the most expensive signing of the summer. Outlays like this have led Heidel, who gave former Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp his first management role, to believe the English market could collapse within 'the next two to three years'.

question: Following the Atlanta turnover, @placeholder found Amendola for a 6-yard touchdown pass with 5:56 left. context: Houston (CNN) For the first time, a Super Bowl needed overtime, and for the fifth time, the New England Patriots are Super Bowl champions. This time, it took the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history to do it, rallying from a 25-point deficit and defeating the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 at NRG Stadium in Houston in Super Bowl LI. Tom Brady became the first quarterback to win five Super Bowl titles. He was named Super Bowl MVP for the fourth time, the most all time. "It was a hell of a football game," Brady said. Atlanta had a 28-3 lead midway through the third quarter. But a costly Atlanta fumble by quarterback Matt Ryan midway through the fourth quarter helped set up the Patriots to come all the way back to tie it at 28. @highlight Win gives Tom Brady the most Super Bowl titles by a quarterback @highlight This was just Atlanta's second appearance in its 51-season history	Brady

question: In this atmosphere, @placeholder says that once members and their staffs are brought up to speed, he expects the bill to attract "overwhelming" support. context: (CNN)Doctors in Macon, Georgia, told Janea Cox that her daughter, Haleigh, might not live another three months. That was the middle of March, when Haleigh's brain was being short-circuited by hundreds of seizures a day, overrunning the array of five potent drugs meant to control them. Worse, the drugs were damaging Haleigh's organs. "She was maxed out," Cox said. "She'd quit breathing several times a day, and the doctors blamed it on the seizure medications." Cox had heard that a form of medical marijuana might help, but it wasn't available in central Georgia.

Some women lose hope. Yet "a hormone level can never tell you that you can or cannot get pregnant," Eyvazzadeh said, adding that there is more to fertility than a patient's FSH and AMH levels.

question: Earlier this week, the US suspended ongoing talks with @placeholder over ways to achieve a lasting cessation of hostilities in Syria. context: Washington (CNN) A top Russian official strongly denied Wednesday a report that Moscow may have been behind the alleged drugging of two US diplomats in St. Petersburg and suggested instead that the pair may simply have been drunk. "We are outraged," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in a statement posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry website, adding the claim may have been the work of the US State Department seeking "revenge" for the collapse of talks between the two counties to address the situation in Syria. Russia's denial came after a report two days ago by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the diplomats -- a man and a woman who were not senior officials -- allegedly had their drinks spiked with a date-rape drug while attending a United Nations convention on corruption last November.

question: "@placeholder is deliberately destroying programs that create jobs and safeguards that protect our air and water, all for the sake of allowing corporate polluters to profit at our expense." context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order Tuesday at the Environmental Protection Agency, which officials said looks to curb the federal government's enforcement of climate regulations by putting American jobs above addressing climate change. The order represents a clear difference between how Trump and former President Barack Obama view the role the United States plays in combating climate change, and dramatically alters the government's approach to rising sea levels and temperatures -- two impacts of climate change.

No military operation of such scale evades detection from U.S. radars. Even if not pre-approved or coordinated, Iran's air and ground operations against the murderous thugs of self-proclaimed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi make the Islamic Republic effectively a U.S. partner in the fight against America's greatest enemy: Islamist fundamentalism.

Fasten your seat belts because we're in for a bumpy ride. Local mosquitoes in the Miami area are carrying the Zika virus, and have infected at least four Floridians. In announcing this alarming news during a press conference Friday morning, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, added a sharp warning: "This is not just a Florida issue. It's a national issue -- we just happen to be at the forefront." Now all the falderal typical of American outbreaks will commence: Political posturing, hysteria versus naysaying, conspiracy theories, demands for safety and care and a daily mounting toll of identified cases.

Netanyahu beamed at his new American counterpart and declared him the best friend Israel could possibly wish for, while Trump offered lofty praise for Israel, denounced the Iranian nuclear deal and declined to back a two-state solution -- a longstanding, bipartisan US policy that the Israeli Prime Minister has questioned. The encounter signaled a warmer chapter in US-Israel relations than Netanyahu had enjoyed with Trump's predecessor.

question: I live in @placeholder, and the bill is not yet law. context: (CNN) Did I move to Indiana? My mailing address still says Atlanta, GA, and I just filed my Georgia state income taxes. So why do I feel like I'm in Indiana? Because the Georgia General Assembly just passed a religious freedom bill, just like Indiana did around this time last year. That bill has cost Indiana at least $60 million in tourist revenue. Unfortunately, what the Georgia legislature passed is worse than Indiana's. The bill, if signed into law, could have significant economic consequences for Atlanta. The NFL has made clear that Atlanta's potential hosting of the Super Bowl is at risk. Many Atlanta-based companies, such as Home Depot and Coca-Cola, have spoken out against the measure. Walt Disney is threatening to no longer film movies in the state .

The signing of Otamendi brings City’s summer outlay close to £100m, with the club still being strongly linked to a £50m deal for Wolfsburg's Kevin De Bruyne.

question: Earlier, NSW Police revealed Ms Pearce-@placeholder was likely murdered at some stage between the December 14 and 15, 2008, during a press conference ahead of the accused's court appearance. context: Police have claimed they found Karlie Pearce-Stevenson's bank card in her accused killer's wallet four years after she was allegedly murdered - but didn't connect him to the crime, according to reports. Daniel Holdom, 41, appeared in court via video link yesterday charged with the 20-year-old Alice Springs mother's death - who he had reportedly been in a relationship with. His ex-girlfriend Hazel Passmore, 33, attended an Adelaide police station for four hours today to assist police with their inquiries into the deaths of Karlie and her two-year-old Khandalyce.

question: He's grasped his chance to become a key member of Arsenal's midfield with both hands, despite his reluctance to return to @placeholder from Charlton fearing he'd simply be warming the bench. context: You can search far and wide for the answer to a problem, but sometimes it is right under your nose. When Arsene Wenger sent Francis Coquelin on loan to Charlton in November it looked to be the final nail in the Frenchman's Arsenal career. The Gunners manager admitted as much recently, revealing he was prepared to let the midfielder leave in December.

question: They had an initial £10m bid for Clyne rejected and Southampton wanted £15m but, with only one year remaining on @placeholder’s contract, the two clubs have agreed on a fee. context: Nathaniel Clyne was pictured leaving a Liverpool hospital after undergoing a medical on Monday ahead of sealing a move from Southampton. The right back is set to secure a £12.5million transfer – £10.5m up front with a further £2m based on add-ons – to become Brendan Rodgers’s sixth signing already since the season ended. Liverpool have been searching for a right-back after allowing Glen Johnson to leave at the end of his contract and Jon Flanagan out long-term with a knee injury.

question: There was also fierce criticism of the press by the @placeholder campaign. context: (CNN) Four weeks after the election, tensions between top operatives at the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns erupted during a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics discussion that was intended to record history by drawing out the internal deliberations of both campaigns. Facing off at long tables on opposite sides of the room during a two-hour panel, raw emotions on both sides exploded as operatives debated how Trump had won the divisive campaign. There were periods of calm, substantive discussion about data, metrics and target states, but many moments where tempers flared, with acrimony mirroring the 2016 race. Advisers on the opposing sides shouted over each other. Accusations of lying flew between them. There was lots of eye-rolling on both sides. Operatives snapped at one another for interrupting, as an air of mutual contempt settled within the room.

question: Moreover, now that Obama has put @placeholder in "check" with his executive action, the only move they have left for "checkmate" is to pass an immigration bill that is more substantial than his executive action. context: San Diego (CNN) -- It can't be. The Republican Party's wise new sage on immigration is ... Mitt Romney? In a recent interview with Univision, the Spanish-language television network, the former presidential candidate -- whom some suspect may be gearing up to run again in 2016 -- criticized President Obama's use of executive action to temporarily re-prioritize deportations. Nothing new here, folks. Most Republicans posed the same criticism, even at the cost of looking like hypocrites for contradicting their George W. Bush-era views in favor of expanding executive power. One minute, Republicans are threatening not to work with Obama on any issue; the next, they're whining that Obama didn't wait around to work with them on immigration. @highlight Ruben Navarrette: In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was a backward voice on immigration @highlight He criticized Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich for ideas that helped immigrants, Navarrette says @highlight Navarrette: This year, Romney is wisely calling on GOP to pass immigration reform @highlight He says it's the one smart way Republicans can respond to Obama's executive action	GOP
question: Aides said they expected Merkel to appeal to @placeholder's sense of businesslike efficiency in an attempt to win over the new US leader. context: Washington (CNN) As German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepared to bid President Barack Obama farewell in November, a reporter asked her to describe her sentiments about watching her American partner of eight years be replaced by Donald Trump. Standing in the German Chancellery on a drizzly Berlin afternoon, the notoriously restrained Merkel -- who became Obama's closest global friend only to see him replaced by a man who lambasted her on the campaign trail -- drew on her stolid pragmatism. "Out goes the president, and a new one comes in," she said. RELATED: Looming snowstorm delays Trump-Merkel meeting On Friday, Merkel presses ahead with the new, arriving in Washington for her first face-to-face encounter with Trump after months of preparation and one postponement due to snow.

One thing is for sure: Deila did not need to be an ardent student of the history of Scottish football to appreciate the gravitas of the situation he had become immersed in earlier this season.

Speaking in front of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday, Army Special Forces Lt Col Jason Amerine said he was under scrutiny from the FBI for his criticism of US hostage rescue protocols. 'Warren Weinstein is dead,' Amerine said, referring to the USAID worker held hostage in Pakistan, whom President Obama announced in April had been accidentally killed in a drone strike.

The Colombia striker touched down in the Spanish capital on Tuesday to join up with his new team-mates, and was mobbed by reporters and fans desperate for a glimpse of their new star man. Martinez is following in the footsteps of now-Chelsea loanee Radamel Falcao, who swapped Porto for Atletico to much success in 2011.

question: During the subsequent civil war between rival mujaheddin commanders in the 1990s, @placeholder was accused of committing atrocities against civilians during the deadly struggle for control of the Afghan capital. context: Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) After months of delays, Afghan government negotiators signed a peace deal Thursday with an insurgent faction led by one of the country's most notorious warlords. The deal was signed at a ceremony attended by negotiators, the President's national security adviser, and representatives of the Hezb-i-Islami faction of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Afghan and US officials applauded the agreement, but a prominent human rights organization strongly criticized the deal. In a statement, the US Embassy called Thursday's accord "a step in bringing the conflict in Afghanistan to a peaceful end." That sentiment was echoed by Afghanistan's chief executive -- who is in a shaky power-sharing agreement with the country's President. @highlight Human Rights Watch says deal compounds "culture of impunity" @highlight Gulbuddin Hekmatyar had a ruthless reputation	Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
question: If sources or individuals were named in the documents, the @placeholder government would be in good position to investigate further. context: (CNN) Donald Trump has called the Christopher Steele dossier "fake news" and "phony stuff," but is it? The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, sent a trusted staff member to London to obtain a copy and deliver it to the FBI for investigation, according to the UK newspaper The Independent. The US intelligence community has made no determination as of yet on the contents, but has deemed the documents sufficiently credible to warrant further investigation and included a summary of the dossier in briefing materials for both  President Obama and President-elect Trump. It is worth noting that these leaders are all career professionals, including two non-political appointees, FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Mike Rogers, who have zero incentive to pick a fight with their future boss. @highlight Donald Trump has called the Christopher Steele dossier "fake news" and "phony stuff," but is it? @highlight Nick Dowling says the material may or may not be true, but we can't dismiss it lightly	UK
question: @placeholder is an activist, columnist and television commentator, and a supporter of Bernie Sanders. context: (CNN) In October 2007, the Gallup polling organization wrote that, "Gallup's 2007 national presidential polling strongly points to [Hillary] Clinton winning the 2008 Democratic nomination. Barring something unusual or otherwise unexpected, she is well positioned for the 2008 Democratic primaries." Gallup was wrong. In June 2008, it wrote, "After winning one of the most competitive nomination battles in U.S. history, Barack Obama faces what looks to be an equally tough general election for the presidency." Gallup's polling had Obama and John McCain neck and neck, with McCain leading by a marginal point.

The reality star and her husband, Joe Giudice, were sentenced Thursday to serve time after pleading guilty in March to numerous federal fraud charges. Teresa Giudice will serve a 15-month sentence. Joe received a 41-month sentence and also faces the possibility of deportation since he's not a U.S. citizen.

On April 6, hours before she and her husband dined with the Chinese President and his family, Ivanka's company secured provisional approval for three new trademarks to sell her brand's jewelry, bags and spa services in the world's second-largest economy. Though there is no direct evidence linking her trademark approval to the dinner or any other meeting with the Chinese government, the story does draw attention to the fine line the Trump White House is walking when it comes to maintaining its family businesses. @highlight Ivanka Trump's company gets provisional OK for 3 trademarks in China hours before she dines with Chinese President @highlight By keeping an ownership interest in her businesses, Ivanka risks an appearance of conflict of interest, Anushay Hossain writes	Ivanka

While the source of the weapons fire was not immediately clear, it came as the ceasefire appeared to be holding, a rare positive sign in a conflict that has ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West.

question: @placeholder has emerged as the face of the group, although many of its members, including the owners of the 3-D printer the group uses, have chosen to remain anonymous. context: (CNN) -- A Texas group run by a self-described anarchist has posted what appears to be the first video of the live firing of a handgun created with a 3-D printer. The 53-second video shows a single shot being fired from The Liberator, a plastic handgun that, with the exception of its metal firing pin, was assembled from parts made with a 3-D printer, according to Defense Distributed. The gun appears unscathed after the test firing, although the brief clip does not reveal anything about its range or accuracy. The nonprofit group, founded by 25-year-old law student Cody Wilson, has posted instructions for the gun online so other people can duplicate it. The gun was created with a Stratasys Dimension SST printer, which can be purchased online for as little as $8,000. @highlight Group showcases test firing of a gun made with a 3-D printer @highlight Self-styled anarchist created "The Liberator," from plastic, with a nail for a firing pin @highlight Blueprints for the gun have been posted online so others can duplicate it @highlight Demo comes as lawmakers are calling for bans on printed handguns	Cody Wilson
question: Despite our extreme precautions, I had my blood drawn for my free @placeholder test just one week later. context: (CNN) I live in Miami. I'm pregnant. I tested positive for the Zika virus. At least that's what I was told, and that's what I believed for six long, painful weeks. They were excruciating weeks of waiting for a special test that only the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can do to confirm whether I had, in fact, contracted Zika during the beginning of my first trimester -- a crucial period of time for a fetus' brain and nervous system development. I endured over 40 anxiety-provoking days carrying my second baby, one that I wasn't sure I would be able to keep, before learning that my test result was -- thankfully -- a false positive. @highlight Lindsay C.

question: They say hundreds of children who appeared before @placeholder didn't have lawyers. context: (CNN) -- At a friend's sleepover more than a year ago, 14-year-old Phillip Swartley pocketed change from unlocked vehicles in the neighborhood to buy chips and soft drinks. The cops caught him. Former Luzerne county President Judge Mark Ciavarella pleaded guilty, faces prison and was disbarred. There was no need for an attorney, said Phillip's mother, Amy Swartley, who thought at most, the judge would slap her son with a fine or community service. But she was shocked to find her eighth-grader handcuffed and shackled in the courtroom and sentenced to a youth detention center.

Luckily, when they've visited the moon or lived on the International Space Station, Earth is literally in sight. And if they had a medical issue or injury, home wouldn't be far away. But for astronauts on future deep-space missions, like one to Mars, even a simple radio message might take up to 20 minutes to reach Earth. So how can they pack light and still bring all of the necessities, especially with an increased risk of injury during a six-month flight?

question: An aide close to @placeholder familiar with the discussions tells CNN that "Ryan spoke out against the amendment and opposed it throughout. context: Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump dramatically strong-armed House Republicans into line Tuesday in his first Washington power play, after they voted to gut an ethics watchdog in a manner that undercut his vow to drain the establishment "swamp." Trump made clear his anger at the move on his Twitter account, and GOP lawmakers hurriedly changed plans to target the independent panel, backing down in a controversy that threatened to overshadow the dawn of a new conservative era in Washington. In an emergency meeting just before noon Tuesday, House Republican lawmakers voted to strip the move on the ethics agency from a package of rules that is due to be voted upon later in the House of Representatives. Their decision to adopt the measure Monday night had opened splits in the GOP and put House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump on opposite sides of a key issue on the first day of the 115th Congress. @highlight The proposal to curb the office's powers was pulled after an outcry from Democrats and ethics watchdogs @highlight Trump also criticized the move via Twitter	Paul Ryan

Back then, bloggers such as Black Girl Long Hair and Afrobella, encouraging women with Afro-textured hair to boycott chemical or heat straightening products, or YouTube videos dedicated to African beauty, didn't exist. And so Oyepitan -- a future Olympic sprint runner for England -- and Okunniwa began creating their own moisturizers from Shea butter, and making African black soap, using plantain, cocoa pods and palm tree leaves.

But there's already one undisputed loser from the ferocious presidential campaign: James Comey. The FBI director cleared Hillary Clinton for a second time Sunday in the probe over her private email server. But the damage to her campaign -- and his own reputation -- is unlikely to quickly heal.

question: In his interview with CNN, Northam praised Trump for calling for an end to the spending cuts know as sequestration and pledged to work with @placeholder. context: (CNN) Whether Ed Gillespie likes it or not, the Republican's fate in the Virginia governor's race is tied to President Donald Trump. In a state that chooses a new governor every four years -- one year after the presidential election -- Trump was always going to be a dominant factor. But with two relatively bland candidates and a hyper-partisan national environment, Gillespie's campaign against Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam has revolved even more than usual around the President. Trump's popularity in Virginia mirrors his low national approval ratings. But Gillespie needs Trump's loyal base to turn out to vote. So he's adopted a strategy of airing ads that don't mention Trump but appeal directly to Trump's voters, warning of the MS-13 gangs and sanctuary cities, of which Virginia has none, and promising to keep up Confederate monuments. @highlight In Virginia, Democratic Lt.

More than 1,200 officers spent the night standing guard around a three-square-mile parameter in Malone, New York, as State Police insisted they had the surviving escapee 'contained'. It was based on their assumption that Sweat was traveling with fellow fugitive Richard Matt, who was shot and killed by law enforcement nearby on Friday afternoon. However, around 24 hours later, the parameter has been expanded to 22 square miles, as Clinton County sheriff David Favro solemnly conceded there is 'not a heck of a lot' of progress in the search.

question: In @placeholder, abortion is illegal, with no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. context: (CNN) During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump famously said that there should be "some form of punishment" for abortion. Although he later tried to walk these remarks back, he and his mostly male fellow Republicans have quietly been making headway since he took office on an agenda to make sure women have as few options as possible for reproductive choice and education, including limited access to birth control and the preventative care offered by Planned Parenthood. This week, the House of Representatives passed the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," a bill criminalizing abortions after 20 weeks. The White House, through a statement of administration policy released on Monday night, backed the measure, meaning President Trump plans to sign it if it passes the Senate. Courts have recently struck down similar bans for violating Roe v. Wade and other rulings about abortion. In 2014, for instance, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case on Arizona's 20-week ban, letting stand a ruling from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which said Arizona's law violated multiple Supreme Court rulings, including Roe v. Wade. @highlight Alice Driver: Passage of a recent bill in the House of Representatives shows that for some Republicans, criminalizing abortion is a priority @highlight If Americans want to know what women's lives are like in a country where abortion is a crime, they should listen to women in El Salvador, she writes	El Salvador

When President Donald Trump was presented the same, he closed the door.

question: Leaning against her white truck, @placeholder offered up a prayer in the hope that something can be done to save those trees from dying. context: (CNN) A decade ago, Ben Ray had hoped to ease into retirement at his two-story wooden house nestled in the heart of the Sequoia National Forest. But the 79-year-old central California general contractor, who built homes for his future neighbors in Sierra Nevada Mountain communities such as Ponderosa and Pierpont, and his wife, Michelle, haven't had the luxury of relaxation. That's because hundreds of once verdant pine and cedar trees, stretching far beyond their 5 acre spread, have perished at a rate so fast he's lost count of the carnage.

Putin can listen as NATO leaders roll out the latest iteration of their bold responses to his annexation of Crimea and his invasion of Ukraine.

"The youngest Trump doesn't have any responsibilities as the president's son, but the least he could do is dress the part when he steps out in public," entertainment reporter Ford Springer wrote in the Daily Caller. The story prompted widespread rebukes from both sides of the political aisle and the media, including a sharp statement from Clinton, who knows firsthand the spotlight of a White House childhood.

Arguing that the two-state solution is dying and that something must be done to keep hope alive, Carter wrote: "I fear for the spirit of Camp David. We must not squander this chance." Yet having spent the better part of my adult professional life working to promote, facilitate and consummate negotiations between Arabs and Israelis, my advice is precisely the opposite of Mr. Carter's. I completely understand the urgent desire on the part of American peacemakers to do something. And in the case of Mr. Carter, that passion is especially strong. Few Israelis and Egyptians I know would take issue with the fact that had it not been for the role played by the US, led by President Jimmy Carter -- building on Anwar Sadat's historic visit and Menachem Begin's strong response -- there would have been no Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979. @highlight Aaron Miller: Jimmy Carter's call for US to recognize the State of Palestine is a mistake @highlight Key to solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict does not rest in President Obama's hands, nor in those of his successor, he says	Menachem Begin

Following the example of Cedarville University's inaugural G92 gathering last fall in Ohio, evangelical Christians gathered in Birmingham to discuss immigration through the prism of the Bible.

There can be no other word for Jo Inge Berget, the newly bearded figure who returned to Glasgow to show a quite different face to his former club. The wing-man's brief spell as a Celtic player was a miserable, godforsaken experience.

They noticed him on Wednesday night.

Passing through campaign chairman John Podesta's inbox were longtime allies of Clinton and her husband, inner circle aides on whom she relied, and newer members of the team who joined the campaign in its infancy.

The disparity of figures is largely caused by interest payments of $67 million and a one-off cost of $107 million relating to the Premier League outfit's bond scheme, launched in January to help restructure the debts accrued by the Glazer family in purchasing the 18-time English champions in 2005. The club produced a record turnover of $455 million for the year ended June 2010, more than double that of local rivals Manchester City, but suffered a big swing from last year's profit of $77 million -- which was largely due to the world-record $130 million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. @highlight Man Utd's owners make record loss of $137 million despite operating profit of $160 million @highlight Glazer family's debts incurred in buying English club in 2005 largely to blame @highlight The 18-time English champions' turnover for year ended June 2010 was $455 million @highlight United's wage bill is only 46 percent of turnover, the lowest ratio in Premier League	Cristiano Ronaldo

Miss Sturgeon's expected victory will trigger furious demands in her own party for a second independence referendum, and one leading MP yesterday said a 'constitutional confrontation' is on the horizon.

A former reporter for Breitbart, Michelle Fields, sought charges against Lewandowski after an incident in March where she said Lewandowski pulled her away from Trump as she was trying to ask him a question.

question: MANCHESTER UNITED: No offer was received for @placeholder until Monday. context: In Real Madrid president Florentino Perez’s detailing of the David de Gea deal that never was there is a sense that relations were already strained between the two biggest football clubs in the world... even before  deadline day passed. Perez never names Ed Woodward but references to ‘their people being inexperienced’ are aimed at him. Agent Jorge Mendes appears to be a necessary middle man without whom there is no contact between the two clubs, and Jose Angel Sanchez, Perez’s trusty lieutenant is, in complete contrast to his opposite number, the embodiment of professional efficiency. Perez told Cadena Ser in an interview on Thursday night: ‘It was the last day of the window and 12 hours before it was due to close they (United) told us, via (Jorge) Mendes, that they would be open to negotiations for (David) De Gea. That is when, Jose Angel Sanchez called them and an agreement was reached in half an hour’. @highlight Real Madrid and Manchester United used to have a respectful relationship @highlight But after tense negotiations for David de Gea, the clubs are back at war @highlight Their relationship was frayed by Cristiano Ronaldo's move in 2008 @highlight Jose Angel Sanchez is the man trusted by Madrid to negotiate transfers	David de Gea
question: In a news conference before Warmbier's death, they said they found no evidence of botulism, casting doubt on @placeholder's claim. context: Wyoming, Ohio (CNN) After the bagpiper led 2,500 mourners out of the high school but before Otto Warmbier was laid to rest Thursday, one of his former counselors stopped to remember the 22-year-old who died last week after 17 months of detention in North Korea. The tight-knit community near Cincinnati had spent nearly a year and a half "holding our breaths, praying for a quick release, rallying around the Warmbiers as much as possible" amid a dearth of information about the college student's fate, said Cynthia Meis, director of college counseling, who joined the Wyoming High School faculty in 2012. @highlight "Everything they say about Otto is very true.

It stands to reason that the 22-year-old's family could have had the gray structure placed behind Peachtree Christian Hospice near Atlanta in order to block photographers from taking pictures of anything coming or going through the door. And the  Houston family has kept largely mum on Bobbi Kristina's condition since her aunt and guardian Pat Houston said 'she's in God's hands' after she was transferred to the end of life facility.

question: The diagnosis, however, turned out to be no more than bruising and Aldo has agreed to go ahead with the fight, although the @placeholder have put a contingency in place in the event that Aldo has to withdraw. context: Conor McGregor's title fight with Jose Aldo was thrown into doubt earlier this week but the Irishman continued with his preparations on Friday as he relaxed with a late-night massage after a 'solid day's work'. The rising UFC star, who has a record of 5-0 since joining Mixed Martial Arts' biggest promotions company, is due to fight Brazilian featherweight champion in Las Vegas on July 11. And McGregor took to Instagram to share a picture of his recovery following a tough workout. 'Late night massage after a solid days work!' he wrote on the social media site. Aldo took a blow to the ribs during sparring on Tuesday and it was first feared that he had suffered a fracture which would have almost certainly ruled him out of the bout with McGregor. @highlight Conor McGregor steps into the octagon with Jose Aldo on July 11 @highlight The Irishman posted a picture online of him receiving a rub down @highlight The bout between McGregor and Aldo was thrown in to doubt this week @highlight Aldo suffered a bruised rib during training but has decided to fight	UFC
question: He added that he is not sure if Couch had a tourist visa when he entered @placeholder. context: Los Angeles (CNN) Tonya Couch, the mother of "affluenza" teen Ethan Couch, is set to be extradited to Texas from Los Angeles. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Sergio Tapia approved an extradition waiver for Couch on Tuesday. She will be returned to Texas, where prosecutors have charged her with hindering the apprehension of a felon. Her bail, which was set in Texas, is set at $1 million and must be paid in that state. The mother and son were found in Mexico on December 28 after going missing a few weeks earlier. Before he went to Mexico, Ethan Couch was on probation for killing four people in a drunken driving accident in 2013, when he was 16. At the time, many were outraged that a judge sentenced him to probation instead of jail time, slamming his now-notorious "affluenza" defense -- that he was too rich and spoiled to understand the consequences of his actions. @highlight A judge has approved Tonya Couch's extradition from California to Texas @highlight Couch is charged with hindering the apprehension of a felon; she and her son, Ethan, were found in Mexico last month @highlight Ethan Couch was charged in 2013 with DUI-manslaughter; his case gained notoriety when the defense said he had "affluenza"	Mexico

The Britain's Got Talent judge has spoken out about the affair that destroyed her marriage to the Family Fortunes host and launched her career. The 44-year-old is now happily married to record producer Chris Hughes and says he wears the trousers in their relationship in an interview with the Notebook.

question: George W. Bush bucked the midterm trend due in large part to the cataclysm of Sept. 11, 2001, which rallied the country behind him and helped @placeholder actually gain two seats in 2002. context: Washington (CNN) Chuck Schumer is not only the leader of Democrats in the Senate. He's also the smartest political mind of that group. Which makes what the New York Senator told MSNBC on Friday sort of perplexing. "If the President continues this way, there is a chance we could take back the Senate," Schumer said. I'm assuming that Schumer was referring to the 2018 midterms. And if he was, then man oh man was he being optimistic. Wildly so, even. Start here: Republicans control 52 seats to 48 for Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independents Angus King (Maine) and Bernie Sanders (Vermont). To retake the majority, they need a net gain of three seats. @highlight Democrats are defending a whopping 25 seats as compared to just eight for Republicans @highlight Of their 25 seats, 10 of them are in states that Donald Trump won in the 2016 presidential election	Republicans
question: The @placeholder survey was taken from August 13-17, 2017 among 795, 773 and 801 registered voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, respectively. context: Washington (CNN) A new poll in Rust Belt states over the weekend had some stark news for President Donald Trump: His job approval was under 40%. Only about a quarter said they were proud of him. Broad majorities said they were embarrassed. But his favorable ratings? They are basically the same as what they were on Election Day. The new numbers from a NBC/Marist survey show that the President's favorable numbers look very, very similar to where they were almost 10 months ago when he was elected. Trump's favorable rating was 39% in Michigan, 35% in Wisconsin and 42% in Pennsylvania on Election Day among those who came out to vote, according to exit polls. Those numbers are now 34% in Michigan, 32% in Wisconsin and 35% in Pennsylvania among all voters. Plus, Trump's unfavorable ratings are within 3 percentage points of his Election Day ratings. @highlight Trump's favorable rating is hovering the mid-30s in the Rust Belt, roughly the same as on Election Day @highlight About one in five Trump voters nationally in 2016 had an unfavorable view of him	NBC

They discuss job opportunities, the need for support and the possibility of a trip out of state. They're relaxing in the lobby of a city agency, one outfitted with a couch and wing chairs to make it feel homey. Anything to provide relief from the hard streets of Richmond, California, once known as one of the most violent cities in America. "What can I do better?" the mentor, Kevin Yarbrough, asks.

Stephen Gleeson, Paul Caddis and Jon Toral goals saw Gary Rowett's men boast a three-goal cushion at half-time on the banks of the Thames. Alex Kacaniklic and Ross McCormack netted for the hosts, reduced to 10 men by James Husband's red card, but efforts from Clayton Donaldson and Viv Solomon-Otabor saw City secure a comfortable win.

question: But in spite of Putin's ambitious goals, Russia's pursuit of AI domination is unlikely to come in the form of generating @placeholder technological breakthroughs. context: (CNN) Last Friday, a million Russian schoolchildren watched a televised address from Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only of Russia, but of all of mankind," Putin said. "Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world." After seeing Putin's comments, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that "competition for AI superiority at national level (is the) most likely cause of WW3." Though never before stated so frankly by a head of state, Putin's views on AI are increasingly shared by national security leaders in the United States, China and around the world. As I wrote in a report published by the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, AI research is likely to deliver a revolution in military technology on par with the invention of aircraft and nuclear weapons. In other words, Musk is correct that each country is pursuing AI superiority and that this pursuit brings new risks. @highlight Gregory C.

question: He added that his family wants @placeholder to next be held responsible for whatever happened to Stacy Peterson. context: An Illinois jury on Thursday found former Chicago-area police sergeant Drew Peterson guilty of murder in the 2004 death of his ex-wife. The jury of seven men and five women deliberated for nearly 14 hours total before delivering its verdict convicting Peterson in the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. "Finally somebody heard Kathleen's cry," her mother, Marcia Savio, told reporters after the verdict. "Twelve people did the right thing, oh thank God."

question: It is true that the fight against ISIS and the civil war in @placeholder are connected, but not in the way neocons infer. context: (CNN) Recently, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham predictably but mistakenly called for greater United States military involvement in the Syrian civil war, proving they have learned nothing from our history in the Middle East. It seems that every dictator and every atrocity in that region is met with a call for action without a thought to consequences. Those who wish to send our soldiers to "take care" of every atrocity in the world might want to take a glance at Maplecroft's Human Rights Risk Atlas, which currently lists 35 countries as extreme risks for committing atrocities.

He was 60. Saunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in June and doctors called it 'treatable and curable.' But he took a leave of absence from the team in September after complications arose during his treatment, which included chemotherapy. He had been hospitalized for more than a month.

question: After its passing game failed to break down a resolute @placeholder-Bissau defense, Cameroon opted to go with the long ball. context: (CNN) "Pressure and I are like husband and wife," Gabon coach Jose Antonio Camacho once said. On today's showing, it looks as though the marriage is more likely to end in divorce than happily ever after. After Gabon's opening day draw with minnow Guinea-Bissau, anything other than a win against Burkina Faso would make qualification for the knockout stage unlikely. Despite a spirited second-half effort, Wednesday's 1-1 draw means the host nation will be watching the late match between Cameroon and Guinea-Bissau with a keen eye. With that must-win nature of the match in mind Gabon started brightly. A mistake in the Burkina Faso defense inside the opening 60 seconds allowed Andre Biyogo Poko space down the right, but he was eventually smothered by a wall of white shirts. @highlight Gabon 1-1 Burkina Faso @highlight Cameroon 2-1 Guinea-Bissau	Guinea

But he did his best to cook dinner each night and to spend quality time with his kids on weekends, and somehow, "they ended up smarter than me," he jokes. Fast forward a few decades and Kizelewicz, now 63, is raising another family. He still makes dinner most nights but now he has a bigger home, a stable job and a wife whose additional income makes things much easier. Some people cautioned him against remarrying at 49, saying he was too old to start a new family. He had two complicated marriages behind him when his now-wife Natalie -- his son's coworker -- agreed to a date. He was 48 and dating for the first time since his children left the home; she was 29 and had just ended what she described as an emotionally abusive marriage to her first husband, with whom she had a daughter.

If you walk past any roadside magazine stand here in New Delhi you may see a reddish-orange face peering out at you, printed prominently on the fronts of Indian publications. Just recently, two of India's top English-language weeklies ran cover stories on the U.S. elections. Outlook magazine's cover "Donald Trump: American Nightmare" had a caricature of a grimacing, enraged Trump dominating the full page. "Loud. Brash. Divisive. Insensitive. Xenophobic." it declared.

For years, activists have pressed the Texas State Board of Education for a more diverse curriculum, and this week The Associated Press reported, the board unveiled its first proposed textbook for Mexican-American studies. The problem? For starters, the "Mexican American Heritage" text asserts that some Mexican-Americans during the civil rights era of the 1960s "opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society." It links Mexican-Americans to the drug trade and illegal immigration and says that Mexican-Americans are ambivalent about assimilating into the United States. The textbook presents a distorted view of Mexican-Americans, in part because it relies on stereotypes and incorrect assumptions. Its editorial content is dubious at best and flat-out racist at worst.

Sunday's strikes turned up the pressure on a fragile ceasefire brokered between Washington and Moscow, now in its sixth day, and make the cloudy situation in war-torn Syria even grayer. It was not known who conducted Sunday's strikes, which the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said were the first in Aleppo since the US-Russia-backed ceasefire took effect last Monday.

question: Given the situation, @placeholder — ranked third in the world and chasing a second successive Six Nations title — were never going to flinch from the task in hand. context: Scotland rugby fans are not, as a rule, the kind of folk who fling Mars bars at directors’ boxes or strike up furious chants demanding a change of leadership. It takes something hugely infuriating to prompt them out of their beery reverie and happily soused sense of match-day bonhomie, a state of mind where every stranger is regarded as just a friend they haven’t met, and where the pain of loss is tempered by the knowledge that their new best pals are enjoying victory. The actions of one poor demented soul at Murrayfield on Saturday evening offered a brief and revelatory glimpse, then, of how deeply the national mood has darkened at the end of an emotionally exhausting Six Nations Championship, a campaign that moved from promising to properly poor without bothering to shift through the gears. @highlight Scotland were thrashed 40-10 by Six Nations winners Ireland on Saturday @highlight Vern Cotter's side lost all their Six Nations games and finished last @highlight Scotland's World Cup campaign starts in September against Japan	Ireland
question: No matter who wins the Ghana-@placeholder match, neither team can end up with more than four points. context: (CNN) -- For about 13 minutes, Team USA sat at the top of its World Cup soccer group, ahead of the mighty Germany and star-powered Portugal. Then Portugal struck back. With seconds left to play, Cristiano Ronaldo set up a header for his teammate Silvestre Varela, leaving the final score tied at 2-2. It was a harsh blow for the Americans, but it does not end their World Cup dreams -- it just makes them harder to achieve. With every team in Brazil now having played two matches, most groups now have clear winners and losers. But not Group G. In theory, any of the four teams in the group of Germany, the United States, Ghana and Portugal could still qualify for the knockout round. @highlight Sunday's tie with Portugal makes it more difficult for USA to achieve its World Cup dreams @highlight The Americans secure a place if they beat or draw with Germany @highlight Netherlands tops Group B with victory over Chile @highlight NEW: Brazil, Mexico advance to the Round of 16 with convincing victories	Portugal

The 20-year-old was immediately loaned back to Lille after starring at the World Cup for Belgium last summer. However, Origi's stock has fallen in the past 12 months and the striker already has a lot to prove ahead of his debut for the Reds.

The comment was made in court papers filed by the actors' attorney in response to a claim by CBS that the case had no merit. "In this lawsuit, plaintiffs seek their share of the money collected by defendants as a result of the use of the actors' names and likenesses in connection with merchandising," the document, filed by attorney Jon Pfeiffer in Los Angeles Superior Court, said.

Dorsey has served as interim CEO for the past three months, after former Dick Costolo stepped down in July. Dorsey will remain the head of fast-growing mobile payments company Square, potentially setting up a conflict of interests for the co-founder of both companies.

question: 'I think to be the new king, the new Pele, is impossible,' @placeholder said of his young pretender in the national team context: Brazil legend Pele has praised his country's current star Neymar as 'an excellent young player' but says he will never replace him as the footballing 'king' even if he matches his goalscoring record. Neymar has scored 42 international goals despite only turning 23 last month, and Pele's Brazilian record of 77 strikes is well within his sights with a long career at the top still ahead of him. But the 74-year-old Brazilian icon feels that even if the young pretender can match his incredible feat, he will still not be considered in the same class as him.

question: If @placeholder-Bissau's players were thought of as rank outsiders going into AFCON 2017, somebody clearly forgot to tell them. context: (CNN) "Pressure and I are like husband and wife," Gabon coach Jose Antonio Camacho once said. On today's showing, it looks as though the marriage is more likely to end in divorce than happily ever after. After Gabon's opening day draw with minnow Guinea-Bissau, anything other than a win against Burkina Faso would make qualification for the knockout stage unlikely. Despite a spirited second-half effort, Wednesday's 1-1 draw means the host nation will be watching the late match between Cameroon and Guinea-Bissau with a keen eye. With that must-win nature of the match in mind Gabon started brightly. A mistake in the Burkina Faso defense inside the opening 60 seconds allowed Andre Biyogo Poko space down the right, but he was eventually smothered by a wall of white shirts. @highlight Gabon 1-1 Burkina Faso @highlight Cameroon 2-1 Guinea-Bissau	Guinea

question: The 34-year-old - who is seven years senior to @placeholder - has developed an aura throughout his career. context: The world's two best openside flankers, Australia's David Pocock and New Zealand's Richie McCaw, go head-to-head in a key battle for the Webb Ellis Cup at Twickenham on Saturday. Sportsmail's Nik Simon compares their strengths ahead of the World Cup final to see which players gives their side the biggest edge. No one has come close to David Pocock as the turnover king at this World Cup. The Wallaby has made 14 steals, eclipsing Richie McCaw’s six. His tree-trunk thighs and huge upper body make him difficult to shift when he jackals over the ball - usually resulting in a penalty or a textbook turnover. McCaw is an expert at protecting his own team’s ball, so the contest is likely to boil down to who reaches the collision area first unless the All Blacks can find a way to smash Pocock off the ball. @highlight Sportsmail compares Australia and New Zealand's superstar flankers @highlight David Pocock has been the World Cup's master at the breakdown @highlight But Richie McCaw has the edge on link play and leadership impact @highlight Wallabies and All Blacks clash for the Webb Ellis Cup on Saturday @highlight Rugby World Cup 2015: Latest RWC news, results and fixtures	David Pocock
question: Over the past month, the Ukrainians have been successful in pushing the rebels into a pocket near the @placeholder border. context: (CNN) -- CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr reported Thursday that the U.S. intelligence community has information that Russian artillery is firing into eastern Ukraine. The artillery pieces shown in the released footage are Russian M-46 130mm field guns with a range of a little over 16 miles. Why would the Russians do this? Simple -- this fits into their plan to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The end game? I believe it is the eventual absorption of that region into the Russian Federation. The area in red on the map is where much of the fighting between the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian rebels has been occurring over the last month. The separatists have downed several Ukrainian military aircraft in this area as the fighting raged. It is also the area in which Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in what most of us believe was a tragic case of mistaken identity and inept use of modern weaponry. @highlight U.S. intelligence officials say they believe Russian artillery is firing into eastern Ukraine @highlight Rick Francona says the artillery firing is a significant escalation by the Russians @highlight He says Vladimir Putin's concern is to protect the pro-Russian rebels @highlight Francona: Ultimately, Putin may claim territory in eastern Ukraine to 'protect' rebels	Russian

Cooper was travelling in a vehicle with two friends and was 'thrown some distance' after the car came off the road in the Victorian town of Yarra Glen at 3am on August 16. The 16-year-old died in an ambulance en route to the hospital. The driver, 17, of the vehicle will front the children's court at a later date.

Liverpool do not have the option of cutting short the 21-year-old's season-long arrangement but new manager Klopp is an admirer of the Serbia international flyer. Markovic was signed last year from Benfica for £20million but largely proved a disappointment in his first season at Anfield making just 23 starts in all competitions and scoring three goals.

question: A glimpse into the still-unfolding @placeholder doctrine may have been offered up here Sunday, as he declared: "We will make decisions based on real-world outcomes, not inflexible ideology." context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (CNN) Few might have expected that four months into his term President Donald Trump would find himself addressing a room of Muslim leaders after a night surrounded by dancing, drumming Saudi men. But there he was Sunday, standing at the front of a vast reception hall, declaring Islam one of the world's great religions while encouraging leaders to disavow terrorists. And there he was Saturday night, swaying to rhythmic lyrics in Arabic, only a year after deriding Islam as a religion based in hatred and vowing to bar all Muslims from entering the United States. Ensconced within the presidential bubble on his first foreign trip, Trump is regularly finding the view from inside is often far different than from out. It's a lesson most presidents learn sooner or later. For Trump, who ran as an outsider promising to explode political norms, the adjustment appears more abrupt. @highlight Trump delivered a major address to Arab leaders Sunday @highlight He used softened rhetoric compared to his campaign	Donald Trump

He arrives from German side Hannover but the 25-year-old comes with impressive pedigree, having previously played for Real Madrid. Sportsmail runs the rule over the Premier League's latest Spanish import. Joselu - full name Jose Luis Sanmartin Mato - is a 6ft 3in striker, a good finisher and he possesses the pace to stretch defences.

question: When we receive this report from the @placeholder campaign, we will make a determination on re-enabling the campaign's access to the system.' context: The Democratic party was sued by its own second-favorite for the White House candidacy tonight over a row about secret voter data. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign filed a lawsuit against the Democratic Party after it was temporarily barred from accessing a trove of information about potential voters as punishment for accessing data compiled by the campaign of rival Hillary Clinton. And his campaign manager issued a public accusation of bias - saying the ban was because the Democratic National Committee is trying to support Clinton.

The Democratic lawmakers decried the Trump administration and Republicans for keeping the caucus out of the meeting after they were canceled on earlier in the week. The topic of the meeting was last week's enforcement actions by ICE.

The lower house Wednesday approved the revised deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The vote was 130-0 and came after about 11 hours of debate. The rebels have 150 days to put down their arms, according to the legislation. Last week marked the second time this year that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Rodrigo Londoño have signed a peace deal aimed at ending Latin America's longest war.

The lawsuit, originally filed in Manhattan federal court, alleges that Massport, United Airlines and security company Huntleigh USA were responsible for the security breaches that led to the death of Mark Bavis, 31, who was aboard United Flight 175 when it crashed into the World Trade Center's South Tower on September 11, 2001. Donald Migliori, an attorney for Bavis' family, said that Wednesday's dismissal of Massport -- the agency that owns and operates Boston Logan International Airport -- from the lawsuit was a disappointment, but that it narrows the case's focus around security on the airplane itself. @highlight The family of a 9/11 victim filed the lawsuit @highlight The suit also names United Airlines and security company Huntleigh USA @highlight It claims security screeners at Boston's airport were unable to detect weapons	United Airlines

More specifically, he was the source of a laminated card of Arabic script that is critical to understanding why nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives on the morning of September 11, 2001. The Arabic on the card reads: "A fatwa [religious ruling] of the captive Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman ... To all Muslims everywhere: Destroy their countries. [The Americans, Jews and Christians].

In a stunning event 90 minutes before the second presidential debate, Trump made a surprise appearance alongside Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Kathy Shelton. The man accused of raping Shelton was convicted of a lesser charge and served 10 months in jail.

question: It’s for @placeholder as an independent body to determine the MP pay element. context: DAVID Cameron’s salary will rise to almost £150,000 after he ditched his threat to block a 10.3 per cent increase in MPs’ pay. The body set up to regulate the salaries of parliamentarians said yesterday it was going ahead with its recommendation that their pay should rise by £6,940, taking MPs’ pay from £67,060 to £74,000. Downing Street said ministers would also reap the benefit despite suggestions last month that they would forego the increase. The 10.3 per cent increase recommended by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) contrasts with the pay rise of public-sector workers, which has been pegged at just 1 per cent.

question: While such tactics helped @placeholder in the circus of a presidential campaign unfolding in a new era of post-truth politics, it's less clear that trading in untruths -- by setting up the press and the intelligence agencies as a foil for his confrontation brand of politics -- is a recipe for a successful presidency. context: (CNN) "Believe Me." Donald Trump wore those words out as a candidate as he beseeched voters to buy into his grand plans and promises on everything from crushing ISIS to building a great border wall. Now, the question of whether Americans can trust Trump is again a dominant political theme after he was caught in a lie over claims that he was wiretapped by his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump's repudiation by FBI Director James Comey in a sensational hearing Monday came exactly two months into an administration unusually prone to obfuscation, blurring facts and peddling falsehoods. From false assessments of the size of his inaugural crowd and claims that millions of illegal voters dealt him defeat in the popular vote in November, the President has often seemed happy to propagate conspiracy theories. @highlight Approval of President Donald Trump has fallen below 40% @highlight "Americans also are impatient," a presidential historian tells CNN regarding Trump's performance	Donald Trump

In a tacit admission that the two countries are engaged in an online war, Mr Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged the end of ‘cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or confidential business information’. The deal – which mirrors a similar agreement between China and the US last month – reflects growing concern about the impact of cyber attacks.

Barring a sudden unannounced buy of television advertising time, Trump's campaign and his allies will be outgunned by a nearly 7.5-to-1 ratio by Hillary Clinton and her allies, according to a CNN analysis of data from the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. That's the largest disparity since Trump began running general election advertisements in mid-August. Before that, Clinton and her super PAC outspent Trump by even larger margins.

Rashid's record after two matches features one five-wicket haul but an overall seven for 418 - an average of almost 60 - against Pakistan. The 27-year-old's early strides in Test cricket are as notable perhaps for his defiant maiden half-century in Dubai as England tried in vain to save the second match of three.

The raid on Istanbul-based IMC TV, an opposition-affiliated, pro-Kurdish channel, came as the station was reporting on the government's closure of another television channel. Turkish authorities cut IMC's transmission in the middle of the broadcast. "Free media will not be silenced," IMC staff chanted as authorities entered the control room, ordering journalists to stop broadcasting scenes from the raid on their social media accounts.

Only a widely accepted political settlement can end the fighting and stitch the country back together. The recent Syrian regime offensive -- supported by Russian and Iranian-backed forces -- to capture the rest of the eastern side of the city has led to the complete fall of the besieged area.

Nadal, a three-time champion at Indian Wells, looked out of sorts in a sloppy opening set slamming an easy overhead into the net to give Young an early break and then later double-faulting to hand over another. But the 47th ranked Young was no better at finding the target saving just two of eight break points as a fist-pumping Nadal walked off Stadium court at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden with the victory. @highlight Rafael Nadal beats Donald Young 6-4, 6-2 at BNP Paribas Open @highlight Straight-sets victory for the Spaniard sees him into fourth round @highlight Nadal looked sloppy in first set before raising his game in the second	Donald Young

Obama's plan centers on Iraqi security forces waging the war against ISIS on the ground. But that strategy has led to a period of 'setback' recently, as the administration likes to say, as Iraqi security forces have failed to keep pace with ISIS fighters, exposing the need for revisions to the joint training program.

Instead lawmakers should adopt a new approach that treats taxpayers more fairly, broadens the nation's philanthropic base and helps defray government spending. Congress and the Trump Administration should consider authorizing "Flexible Giving Accounts" (or "FGAs") that would allow American workers -- whether they itemize deductions on their tax returns or not -- to set aside money for charities of their choice.

But is he the same type of player and is he likely to have the same sort of debut campaign as Sanchez? The statistics suggest it is like-for-like.

Every Muslim who is physically and financially able to do so is expected to make this pilgrimage once in their lifetime. As described in the Hadith of Gabriel, each pillar of Islam acts as a guide to day-to-day conduct for Muslims, outlining proper professions to God, prayer and spiritual mindfulness, not unlike the Book of Common Prayer for Anglicans or Judaism's Siddur.

A long battle of attrition is underway, with some 750,000 civilians caught in the middle. For the Iraqi army and government, the prize is clearing ISIS from the last city it holds in Iraq. What does the battle look like? The battle for western Mosul is likely to be tougher than that for the eastern half of the city, which took well over two months.

Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times, between author Lawrence Wright (who wrote the book the film is based on), filmmaker Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder.

question: "It would be a shame," the newspaper said, "if the unnecessary death of 17-year-old @placeholder produced more paydays for the man who fatally shot the unarmed black teenager in the heart during a scuffle." context: (CNN) -- His trial's over. And now it turns out that George Zimmerman might need the same thing millions of Americans are looking for: a job. As Zimmerman and his legal team mounted their defense, they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him. Living expenses, bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly, they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case. So what's next, now that a jury has acquitted him? For the 29-year-old Florida man, the financial picture is cloudy. Critics have already accused Zimmerman of profiting from the case. Will the donations keep pouring in? Will he win a monetary reward in his defamation lawsuit against NBC?

question: The move comes about eight months after ISIS  beheaded two @placeholder hostages in Syria and amid anxiety at home over impending legislation that critics fear could drag the officially pacifist country into wars overseas. context: Japan has beefed up security at its embassies worldwide following a threat from Islamic State terrorists. In the latest edition of its English language magazine, Dabiq, the terror group urged Muslims unable to make the journey to Syria or Iraq to carry out attacks elsewhere in the world. It suggested targeting 'Japanese diplomatic missions' in Bosnia, Malaysia and Indonesia, prompting a tightening of security. In the latest issue of the magazine, published online earlier this week, ISIS claims that even if a Muslim is not able to travel to the caliphate, he can 'strike out' against its enemies.

question: Giving evidence to the @placeholder’ committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. context: The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘maybe’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of ‘nothing’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. @highlight Abase Hussen said maybe his daughter was influenced by attending a rally @highlight Amira Abase was one of three teenage girls who fled to Syria in February @highlight Mr Hussen attended one rally alongside one of Lee Rigby's killers @highlight He said he moved to Britain in 1999 for freedom and democracy	MPs

Lynne Russell, 68, had stopped for the night in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Tuesday June 30 when she was grabbed by an Tomorio Walton, who demanded valuables from her room. But she was saved from the attack after her husband Chuck de Caro- a former CNN anchor who has served in the special forces - burst out of the shower and gunned the assailant. Now, police are saying Walton entered the room at the behest of Skyy Durrell Barrs, a man who would allegedly give Walton drugs to commit crimes. @highlight Lynne Russell, 68, was attacked by Tomorio Walton at gunpoint in Albuquerque, New Mexico on June 30 at a Motel 6 @highlight Her husband, former CNN anchor Chuck de Caro who served in the special forces, shot Walton during the attack @highlight Walton is now being described by police as a 'street slave' who committed crimes for drugs at the behest of Skyy Durrell Barrs @highlight It is now being alleged that Barrs drove Walton to the motel and told him to rob Russell @highlight When Barrs saw that Walton had been shot inside the room, he fled the scene in his car leaving Walton to die @highlight Barrs has now been charged with murder	Tomorio Walton
question: 'I've lost a son and I couldn't explain it,' Mr @placeholder added. context: The parents of two-year-old Roman Campbell, who was tragically killed in a house fire on his birthday in May, have spoken out about the damage done to a luxury Gold Coast mansion they were gifted by politician Clive Palmer. This week the rental property's owners discovered the once sparkling house abandoned with around $100,000 worth of damage – including blood and faeces in the carpet, holes in the walls and cupboards ripped off their hinges. Speaking to A Current Affair, Belinda Warwick and Jared Campbell said much of the damage done to the home during the six months they lived there rent-free was through the 'pure frustration' of losing a child. @highlight Two-year-old Roman died in house fire in Beenleigh, Queensland, on his birthday in May @highlight Clive Palmer secured a beautiful home for Roman's grief-stricken parents in Helensvale on the Gold Coast @highlight Roman's father tried to save him but the toddler was trapped in the back of the house @highlight On Wednesday the Gold Coast mansion was found completely trashed, with doors ripped of hinges @highlight A car bought for the family of six was also found trashed and abandoned outside the property	Jared Campbell
question: The words from President Trump and candidate @placeholder, particularly on Islam, were vast worlds apart. context: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (CNN) Few might have expected that four months into his term President Donald Trump would find himself addressing a room of Muslim leaders after a night surrounded by dancing, drumming Saudi men. But there he was Sunday, standing at the front of a vast reception hall, declaring Islam one of the world's great religions while encouraging leaders to disavow terrorists. And there he was Saturday night, swaying to rhythmic lyrics in Arabic, only a year after deriding Islam as a religion based in hatred and vowing to bar all Muslims from entering the United States. Ensconced within the presidential bubble on his first foreign trip, Trump is regularly finding the view from inside is often far different than from out. It's a lesson most presidents learn sooner or later. For Trump, who ran as an outsider promising to explode political norms, the adjustment appears more abrupt. @highlight Trump delivered a major address to Arab leaders Sunday @highlight He used softened rhetoric compared to his campaign	Donald Trump
question: One of @placeholder's great achievements with Ireland has been to make them reliable; they win the matches they are expected to and often win the ones they should not as well. context: The challenge is supposedly getting tougher and out of deference to Italy's traditional doughtiness, one must say it is. They are an established tier-one team. They have in the past boasted some world-class players. They beat an Ireland team just two and a half years ago, and in the Six Nations to boot. But that match is as relevant to what happens in the Olympic Stadium on Sunday as the Munster hurling final does. Ireland were a rabble then, reduced to chaos by injury and the Declan Kidney era breaking apart. They have been transformed by an outstanding coach, the development of talents like Jack McGrath, Iain Henderson and Robbie Henshaw, and the renewal of more seasoned campaigners with Paul O'Connell, Jamie Heaslip and Keith Earls playing some of the best rugby of their careers under Joe Schmidt. @highlight Ireland play Italy at London's Olympic Stadium at 4.45pm (BST) on Sunday @highlight Jose Schmidt has turned Ireland into a slick unit compared to the rabble that lost to Italy just two and a half years ago @highlight Italy are not the force of old and excitement about the return of Sergio Parisse confirmed the country's desperation @highlight Rugby World Cup 2015: Click HERE for all the latest RWC news	Joe Schmidt

Stewart opted out of three races after his car hit Kevin Ward Jr., who was walking on the track during an Empire Super Sprints series race August 9 in New York.

question: Manchester City outcast Jovetic has struggled for game-time at the Etihad, and it is believed @placeholder have won the race for his signature. context: Manchester United have asked Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos to publicly declare he wants to leave the Bernabeu in order to force a move away, according to Spanish newspaper Marca. The 29-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, with initial rumours suggesting he would form part of a deal involving United goalkeeper David de Gea. Marca report that Ramos has refused the request by United, and is awaiting a meeting with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to decide his future ahead of the new season. It is thought that Ramos, in his meeting with Perez, will declare his intentions to leave, but that it will stay private rather than a public message from the Spain international. @highlight Friday's Marca carries a story regarding Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos @highlight They claim Man United have asked Ramos to tell Madrid he wants to leave @highlight It is believed Ramos will instead state his intentions privately to Madrid @highlight Rafa Benitez insists Cristiano Ronaldo is 'the best in the world' @highlight Corriere dello Sport say Stevan Jovetic will join Inter Milan, while Mohamed Salah is set for an initial one-year loan move to Roma @highlight Real Madrid vs Man City: Follow the International Champions Cup here	Inter Milan
question: Still clearly seething, @placeholder settled down to take the breaker 8-6 and it was the same margin in the second set tiebreak. context: (CNN) Nick Kyrgios got hot under the collar on a cold and wet first day of the French Open as he picked up a code violation on his way to a straight sets win. The Australian is known for his fiery temperament and fell foul of chair umpire Carlos Ramos after loudly asking a ballboy for a towel during his win Sunday over Italy's Marco Cecchinato. Ramos ruled he had overstepped the mark with his demand but Krygios disagreed in an expletive-filled rant during a first set tiebreaker. He drew attention to an incident involving world number one Novak Djokovic at the Rome Masters last week where the Serbian escaped sanction for an altercation with umpire Carlos Bernardes -- and accused Ramos of "unbelievable bias." @highlight Nick Kygios through on rain-hit first day @highlight Beats Marco Cecchinato but gets code violation @highlight Petra Kvitova also through in women's draw @highlight Bigger names start later in week	Nick Kyrgios
question: The first "exposure" group included 15,596 mothers who purchased @placeholder once or more before or during pregnancy. context: (CNN) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, known as SSRIs, are the most common type of antidepressants prescribed to pregnant women. Yet a new study indicates that when taken during pregnancy, the drugs are associated with a higher risk of language disorders, including dyslexia, in offspring. The children of women who took SSRIs while pregnant have a 37% greater risk of speech or language disorders compared with the children of depressed but unmedicated mothers, the researchers say. In practical terms, if a depressed mother did not take antidepressants, her child's risk of being diagnosed with a speech or language disorder would be about 1%, but if she took an SSRI, it would increase to 1.37%, explained Dr. Alan Brown, lead author of the study and a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center. @highlight Kids of pregnant women who took SSRIs have a higher risk of speech disorders, a study finds @highlight 6% to 10% of pregnant women worldwide are exposed to antidepressants, author says	SSRI

question: But a recent, alarming spike, has seen dozens of new @placeholder cases -- and several deaths reported this week alone -- which could indicate a change in the virus' behavior. context: Hong Kong generally gets a bad rap when it comes to infectious diseases. Grabbing headlines during recent bird- and swine-flu outbreaks, its proximity to Mainland China as well as its unenviable status as the worst-affected city during the 2003 SARS outbreak, Hong Kong has been central to several global pandemic fears in recent years. It hasn't even escaped fictional outbreaks -- the 2011 movie "Contagion" had patient zero Gwyneth Paltrow bring back an unwelcome souvenir from a business trip to the city. But this bad biological baggage may come in handy. The unwelcome distinction of being home to over one fifth of the world's SARS cases, and two fifths of the 774 fatalities from SARS meant Hong Kong quickly developed and implemented a very sophisticated disease control and epidemiology infrastructure. @highlight Expertise gained in Hong Kong during SARS epidemic helpful in battling MERS virus @highlight Over 100 MERS deaths have now been reported as cases spike @highlight Hong Kong and Chinese researchers looking at "promising" antibodies as MERS cure	MERS
question: To be fair, @placeholder dumped government files onto the web without filters or redactions. context: (CNN) President Obama should pardon Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden before President-elect Trump takes office and makes two internationally embarrassing situations worse. In a 2013 article for The National Law Journal, I argued that neither Manning nor Snowden was a hero, and both deserved prosecution. But times have changed, and the leakers deserve pardons before Trump is sworn in. Manning has served more than six years of an excessive thirty-year sentence. Throughout her incarceration, the federal government has proven itself unequipped to humanely incarcerate a transgender woman -- even as the Obama administration has reformed military policies to be more inclusive of transgender people and attempted to advance LGBT rights abroad. @highlight Alagood: Even if Manning and Snowden don't deserve pardons, the US deserves to be free from the international embarrassment caused by the two cases	Chelsea Manning
question: ‘That’s when matches are decided and @placeholder feels it, he smells it, understands it, when you have to go all in. context: After 18 months of coaching Novak Djokovic, Boris Becker has come to understand the essence of what makes the Wimbledon champion increasingly look like one of the greatest players ever. ‘He’s a tough cookie, I’d call him a street fighter. When the going gets tough, he gets better, when he bleeds a little bit he goes forward,’ said Becker, reflecting on his charge’s latest triumph at the All England Club. The 47-year-old German was left having to ‘pinch myself’ at being in the champion’s corner 30 years after he first took Wimbledon by storm.

question: Defense lawyers have said @placeholder was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. context: A former Fortune 500 executive from New Hampshire who caused a highway crash that killed a Vermont couple and their unborn baby was accused of being 'heartless' in court on Wednesday by angry family members. Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing.

question: Yet a return to positive @placeholder will be welcomed as it will allay fears the economy could sink into a damaging spiral of falling prices - delaying spending and investment and making the real cost of fixed-repayment debts such as mortgages more expensive. context: Inflation is expected to have returned to the UK last month with official figures due tomorrow thought likely to show the end of a brief period of falling prices. The Consumer Price Index measure of inflation fell to minus 0.1 per cent in April, the first time it has turned negative in more than 50 years. But figures for May to be published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday are expected to show that it turned positive again, with some experts estimating it will rise to 0.1 per cent. It would mean CPI is still close to record lows but would be the first time that it has turned higher since October last year. @highlight CPI expected to creep into positive territory on Tuesday @highlight Bank of England  said it expects CPI to pick up 'notably' this year	CPI
question: The @placeholder campaign did provide a one-page summary of the billionaire's investment portfolio, which is remarkably modest for a man of his means. context: Donald Trump is officially a $10 billion man. That's the bottom line in his personal financial disclosure, which he filed on Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission. HIs campaign did not immediately make the complete filing available but claimed in a statement that 'as of this date, Mr. Trump's net worth is in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS.' He earned $362 million dollars last year, according to the campaign, not including dividends, interest, capital gains, rents and royalties.

England international Sterling is embroiled in a messy transfer saga with the Reds as he bids to push a move to Manchester City through. Sterling missed Liverpool training for the second day in a row after the wantaway winger  had failed to report for training on Wednesday too - claiming he was sick.

question: These essays were published by @placeholder and reflected her thinking. context: (CNN) -- People don't generally care what politicians read. But Rep. Paul Ryan is different. His fascination with the Russian-born novelist Ayn Rand could spell trouble for the GOP's new vice-presidential candidate. It could put him at odds with the Christian right and the Roman Catholic Church. It all depends how much you believe that he is in the thrall of Ayn Rand. Rand (1905-1982) is controversial because of the extremism of her views. In researching my recent book, I found that Rand's influence on the Republican Party, which dates back as far as her endorsement of Wendell Willkie in 1940, has been sharply growing, largely due to her vise-like hold on the imagination of the tea party and people like Ryan. @highlight Ayn Rand was a Russian-born novelist whose work celebrated selfishness, says Gary Weiss @highlight In April, Paul Ryan called reports of his adherence to Rand's views an "urban legend" @highlight But in 2005 Ryan said she was "the reason I got involved in public service," says Weiss @highlight Weiss: That could put Ryan at odds with the Christian right and the Roman Catholic Church	Ayn Rand
question: PCS members apparently insisted they would not back a new relationship with @placeholder if their union membership fees contributed to Labour Party coffers. context: A left-wing ‘super-union’ with almost 1.8million members could be created by a controversial merger of Labour’s biggest donor Unite and the biggest civil service union after the election, senior Conservatives fear. They warn that a merger between the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and the Unite union would threaten the impartiality of Whitehall. Half of all civil servants are members of the PCS, which is not currently politically affiliated. If the two unions merged, they would effectively be subsumed into a union which is Labour’s biggest financial supporter.

question: @placeholder officials said after the video's release that they had sent troops to try to rescue an unidentified British citizen "some time ago," but failed. context: British aid worker David Haines has been executed by ISIS militants, according to a video posted Saturday to a website associated with the group, making him the third Western captive to be killed by the Islamist extremist group in recent weeks. The ISIS video post showing Haines' beheading called his execution "a message to the allies of America." It is produced very similarly to the videos that showed the executions of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, the last of which included Haines and the threat that he'd be killed next. The new video pictures a masked ISIS militant placing his hand on another captive, whom he identified as Alan Henning, a British citizen. @highlight Brother: Haines is survived by his wife, 2 children; he once was in the UK air force @highlight David Haines found his true calling in humanitarian work, his brother says @highlight The video characterizes Haines' beheading "a message to the allies of America" @highlight British PM: "We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers"	British

A clear example of this can be found in the Chairman's Statement released after the recent meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders in Manila. What's not clear is whether it's a sign of broader deal-making in Asia which may or may not relate to the current push by the US and China to rein in North Korea.

In January, Trump's new party will retool federal and international policies to recalibrate the government's internal and global posture. Then, four or eight years from now, the "other" America will likely retake the White House and reverse those actions.

The Premier League broke the current spending record by splashing out £870millon during the summer transfer window with Kevin de Bruyne's £54m move from Wolfsburg to Manchester City the most expensive signing of the summer.

Three of the earliest success stories in this history were men of Mexican-American heritage from Los Angeles: Solomon Garcia Smith in the 1880s; Joe Salas, the first Latino to medal in boxing in the Olympics, in 1924; and Bert Colima, Pacific Coast champion in three divisions during the 1920s. @highlight Jorge Iber says boxing in U.S. has long been chance for advancement among immigrants @highlight He says it lets Mexican-Americans show mettle, become source of pride in communities @highlight Title IX helped open opportunity to women too; Olympic hopeful Marlen Exparza one example @highlight Iber: For Latinas, especially "new arrivals," a chance in sports helps them join community	Title IX

Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving.

At the hearing two weeks before the scheduled start of the trial, Judge Debra Nelson handed a series of victories to the prosecution when she barred the defense from introducing some information about Martin. Defense attorneys argued that some of the evidence could prove crucial in backing up Zimmerman's claim of self-defense, depending on what the prosecution argues. Certain evidence could ultimately be raised during the trial, however, if it is proven relevant and admissible based on what the prosecution presents, the judge decided. @highlight NEW: Zimmerman's brother calls on the prosecution to drop the murder charge @highlight NEW: A Martin family attorney calls this "a very important day in this case" @highlight Some of the banned information may come up at trial if it's proven relevant @highlight No delay; the trial will begin June 10, the judge rules	Martin

"With regard to Trump, he's saying some things that I just think are ridiculous and would disqualify any other candidate," Johnson told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day." The former New Mexico governor cited immigration as a particular area of disagreement with Trump, arguing that instead of advocating for a wall and mass deportation, the United States should "embrace immigration."

The Breckenridge Resort tweeted the video to highlight something known as Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, which can be found all over the solar system, including in Saturn's atmosphere. This beautiful pattern emerges in clouds when two different layers of air in the atmosphere are moving at different speeds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are everywhere. From Earth's clouds and ocean surfaces to the atmosphere of Jupiter, these waves have a striking pattern - a series of curled hills moving steadily in one direction.

"The replacement bill that we put together, our goal is to insure the most amount of people, give access to the most amount of people, at least the amount of cost."

On Wednesday, Russia's Ministry of Defense announced it killed the terror leader on the ministry's official Facebook page. It said Adnani was one of up to 40 ISIS militants killed by a Russian bomber in Aleppo province. But a US defense official slammed Russia's assertion.

For every candidate in every election campaign, it inevitably becomes a dividing line. And 2016 is no different. At various stages, Donald Trump has held differing positions on the matter, but has been sufficiently in favor of protecting the second amendment to secure the support of the NRA.

question: You will inevitably ask yourself, "Am I a @placeholder or a Bush?" context: Washington (CNN) Following the 2016 election cycle, where a billionaire reality television star took American politics by storm, some words will just never be the same. SAD! From campaign slogans like "Feel the Bern!" and "Make America Great Again," to Donald Trump's favorite political insults, undertones of the 2016 race to the White House will echo for years to come in what were once very ordinary phrases in the English language. How Donald Trump won Here's a look at some of the most notable examples: Low energy Early on in the primary Trump labeled former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as "low energy," and while the dig seems very mild compared to other nicknames Trump had for his opponents like "Crooked Hillary" and "Lyin' Ted," the insult stuck to the mild-mannered Bush like glue. @highlight The 2016 left its mark on the English language	Donald Trump

question: @placeholder's greatest insecurity is whether or not the results of the election were valid given reported collusion between his campaign and Russia to discredit his opponent. context: (CNN) Let's start with what we can all agree on: Leaking is serious and illegal, and leaking classified information can endanger national security. All leaks must therefore be thoroughly investigated. Even former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper acknowledged as much in his Feb. 16 statement. But people diverge over the role the intelligence community has played in recent leaks. Take, for example, the ouster of Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump's short-lived national security advisor. Some have argued recent leaks of classified information, assumedly emanating from inside the intelligence community, resulted in his swift removal from office. The assertion here is that leakers in the executive branch effectively sabotaged the President's pick for the job, and in doing so exercised undue control over the West Wing itself. Even worse, some fear this pattern may continue with other nominees and policies of the Trump administration. @highlight Steven L.

On Saturday, Singapore's Ministry of Health said analysis of two cases found they had likely evolved from a strain of Zika that was already circulating in Southeast Asia. Malaysia confirmed its first case of Zika infection in a 58-year-old woman -- who had visited her daughter in Singapore -- on September 1. The country reported its first locally-transmitted case on September 3, with authorities expecting more to come. @highlight Surge in Zika cases in Singapore has raised concerns in the region @highlight A new study shows that 2.6 billion people across Asia and Africa could be at risk	Zika
question: "There were still freedoms that were stifled under @placeholder," Molavi said. context: (CNN) -- Mir Hossein Moussavi, Iran's former prime minister, has emerged as a serious contender to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was, for months, considered a shoo-in for re-election to the Iranian presidency. Presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi holds up the "V" sign after casting his vote on Friday. A painter and architect who withdrew from the political front for two decades, Moussavi has emerged with a platter of promises. He has said he wants to reform Iran into a global communicator that embraces freedom of speech. He's also taken an usual step in politics in Iran by relying heavily on his wife, a college professor. Her public support of his candidacy has underscored his professed support of women's rights. @highlight Mir Hossein Moussavi, Iran's ex-PM, hasn't worked officially in politics in 20 years @highlight Analysts: He is wooing support by portraying himself as the "anti-Ahmadinejad' @highlight Moussavi says he's a reformer, believes in more freedoms and an open Iran @highlight Author who has interviewed him says she is skeptical that he truly feels that way	Mir Hossein Mousavi
question: @placeholder released the video a week after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  recalled some 1.4 million vehicles after hacking experts demonstrated a more serious vulnerability in the Jeep Cherokee. context: It can be built for $30, and let hackers open dozens of cars and even get into garages. Called RollJam, it can open cars at the click of a button, making auto hacking simple enough for anyone to do. The hacker behind the project says it will open cars from Chrysler, Daewoo, Fiat, GM, Honda, Toyota, Volvo, Volkswagen Group, Clifford, Shurlok, and Jaguar. Electronic car keys use what's known as 'rolling code.' Every time you press the button, a new, randomly generated code is sent over a radio frequency to your car, which has a synchronized code generator that recognizes it and then burns it so it can never be used again. The key and the car then create new codes for the next time around, and the process repeats. @highlight 'White-hat' hacker Samy Kamkar developed device for under $30 @highlight Can intercept and store codes used to open cars and garage doors @highlight Hacker called for car firms to improve security	Samy Kamkar

Chris Christie as chairman of President-elect  Donald Trump's transition team won't be the last power play by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a young businessman who is shaping up as one of the central figures of the new administration. Kushner is far less well known than his wife, Ivanka Trump, but is clearly a force to be reckoned with, wielding tremendous influence behind the scenes. It's widely assumed in political circles that the sacking of Christie was at least partly an act of personal payback by Kushner.

The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.
