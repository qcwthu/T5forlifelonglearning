question: Having a generally older slate of leaders could separate @placeholder from one of their core constituencies. context: Washington (CNN) The young blood in the Democratic Party is (still) waiting for its moment. Democratic leaders across both the legislative and executive branches are generally older than leadership on the other side of the aisle, leading to some restlessness among the lower ranks who have been patiently awaiting their turn at the top. The most recent blow to those hoping to climb the ranks? Dianne Feinstein, 84, the oldest senator currently serving in the chamber, just announced a bid for re-election to the seat she's held for two and a half decades. The presidential field also looks like an uphill climb for young Democrats: apart from a couple of standout young senators, names like Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden still loom large among the potential hopefuls. @highlight The average age of a Democratic member of Congress has topped 61 years old @highlight Nancy Pelosi, who has held her post since 2003, is 77 years old @highlight A CNN poll found that the top Democrats who voters say they think represent their values averages 66 years old	Democratic

question: But just about as many, 68%, say that the @placeholder should take a major role. context: (CNN) Americans have grown increasingly concerned that North Korea poses a very serious threat to the United States, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. Almost two-thirds of those polled, 62%, say Kim Jong Un's isolated dictatorship poses a deep threat to the US, up from 48% who said the same in March and the highest that figure has been in polling dating back to 2000. That shift comes as 77% say they think North Korea is capable of launching a missile that would be able to hit the US. The poll was completed after news reports of North Korean missile tests involving intercontinental ballistic missiles which have the potential to reach the US under the right conditions.

Here's why: There was no category that could safely contain it. It charted No. 1 on the rhythm and blues charts, which was where most black recording artists such as Berry could be found.

question: Even on the final weekend of last season, less than two months ago, Brendan Rodgers proclaimed: '@placeholder has two years left and I expect him to see that two years through and continue to behave as immaculately as he has done.' context: If losing Luis Suarez was a misfortune, the exit of Raheem Sterling looks like carelessness from Liverpool's point of view. And when you take into account Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres and Javier Mascherano, the conclusion is hard to ignore. How can Liverpool convince anyone they are not a selling club? Make no mistake, Liverpool did not want to lose Sterling. Following Steven Gerrard's decision to quit Anfield, the winger was earmarked as the new face of the club. Still only 20, his progress was Rooneyesque - already 127 first-team games under his belt and the best England player at last year's World Cup. @highlight Raheem Sterling is on the brink of joining Manchester City in a £49m deal @highlight Liverpool have also lost Steven Gerrard, while Luis Suarez left last summer @highlight Fernando Torres and Xabi Alonso among other big names sold by the Reds @highlight Club has a special history but they could be left behind by current top four @highlight Talented players now tend to leave Anfield in order to win trophies	Raheem Sterling

Allardyce’s contract expires at the end of the season and his future at the club under co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan remains unsure. West Ham have already beaten their total in the Barclays Premier League season last year by two points with seven games to spare, but a run of poor form in 2015 has led to speculation Allardyce will be shown the exit.

Daniel Sobey-Harker, 27, from London, posted to the social media site Reddit offering to buy a pizza for someone in the US. But instead of purchasing just one pie as he had originally intended the Londoner ended up buying 30 pizzas for strangers. Things took a surreal turn when, after struggling with several different payment options, Daniel bought two digital Bitcoins which, unknowingly to him, were worth $550 (£352).

It felt like a hotel in any global business capital. Yet a stark reminder of my surroundings -- aside from the physical realities of the charm of a boutique hotel in Cuba's Habana Vieja neighborhood -- was the immediate lack of any Internet connection as soon as I stepped outside the confines of the hotel.

The open mockery of the Democratic Party's loss in the midterm elections is likely an attempt to put the President on the defensive before he lands in Beijing on Monday. But it's really little wonder that China is trying to change the subject from its own problems, both foreign and domestic. For a start, Chinese President Xi Jinping will want no trouble from a U.S. president as he executes his anti-corruption campaign, the primary purpose of which many believe is to consolidate and further centralize his power. Meanwhile, Xi is also dealing with a restive empire, including a democracy movement in Hong Kong and unrest in Xinjiang, which has seen terror attacks against Chinese civilians and paramilitary officers. @highlight Dan Blumenthal: Chinese media have openly mocked Democrats' midterm loss @highlight Chinese leader likely wants to distract from domestic problems, he writes @highlight Obama should reinvigorate ties with Japan, he says	U.S.

A dozen years after leading Brazil to the World Cup title in Asia, he resigned in the wake of the Selecao's capitulation in the semifinals and third-place defeat on home soil last week. Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the last four -- it was the first time a team scored seven goals in a World Cup semifinal -- before the host meekly lost to the Netherlands 3-0 on Saturday.

But none so far have yielded proof of criminal connections between the parties. US law enforcement and intelligence officials investigating hacks of Democratic Party organizations view Russian spy agencies as trying to sow chaos and confusion in the US elections, but not necessarily trying to help a particular candidate.

Lawyers for the man now in Mexico say their client was apprehended by Border Patrol and deported on February 18. DHS said Wednesday that never happened. In a lawsuit released Tuesday, lawyers for Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez allege that the 23-year-old was deported from California to Mexico on February 18, despite having active protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Its latest plan is to use a large inflatable 'flying saucer' that will slow a spacecraft down after piercing through the thin Martian atmosphere. Dubbed the density supersonic decelerator (LDSD), the space agency plans to conduct an ambitious test flight of its design on Wednesday at 1:30pm (5:30pm GMT). The LDSD is unique in its design, using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag.

Libya can't afford to lose the likes of Bettamer. A law graduate and civil activist, he helped organize the protest against jihadist groups after the attack on the U.S. Consulate there in September, in which four Americans were killed.

The raid on Istanbul-based IMC TV, an opposition-affiliated, pro-Kurdish channel, came as the station was reporting on the government's closure of another television channel. Turkish authorities cut IMC's transmission in the middle of the broadcast. "Free media will not be silenced," IMC staff chanted as authorities entered the control room, ordering journalists to stop broadcasting scenes from the raid on their social media accounts.

The teenage migrants were  trying to reach the Gulf countries via Yemen on Wednesday. In a statement, the International Organization for Migration described the drownings in the Arabian Sea as "shocking and inhumane." "The survivors told our colleagues on the beach that the smuggler pushed them to the sea when he saw some 'authority types' near the coast," said Laurent de Boeck, the Yemen mission chief  for the International Organization for Migration.

question: As dawn rose the following morning, @placeholder may have felt confident, but as an experienced sailor, he knew that anything could happen at sea. context: The English fleet came to anchor off the French port of Harfleur in the afternoon of August 14, 1416. With 250 to 300 ships, carrying around 6,500 fighting men, the force was commanded by no less a figure than King Henry V’s brother — John, Duke of Bedford. Bedford’s mission was vital. Since the spring of that year, the French, assisted by the Genoese and the Spanish, had been blockading an English garrison in Harfleur, and mounting regular cross-Channel raids from Normandy on the English coast. The king wanted his brother to put a stop to it — swiftly and mercilessly.

There was disgust too among frontline NHS staff and patients. The head of the Royal College of Nursing said nurses who had faced five years of pay freezes would struggle to comprehend the six per cent pay rise for their bosses. Patient groups said the packages were indefensible when patients were seeing spiralling waiting times and cuts to routine procedures.

Whether the debate centres on cocktails or overhead kicks, agreeing to disagree is the only thing these two rivals will concede to one another. And the clash  - the most important in almost 20 years - will re-open old wounds in what is one of football's fiercest yet little-known rivalries. The animosity dates back to the four-year War of the Pacific at the end of the nineteenth century, hence its tag as the 'Pacific Clasico'.

In a statement released to the news media, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, alleged the Pakistani government hadn't responded positively to the cease-fire, which began as a monthlong observance on March 1 and eventually was extended to April 10. One of the militant group's leaders, Umer Khalid Khurrsani, said Wednesday that the government wasn't serious about peace and that the only way to implement Sharia, Islamic law, was jihad.

In an exclusive interview with CNN, Erdogan said that a constitutional reform package -- backed by a narrow majority of Turkey's voters in a referendum on Sunday -- was not about him. "I am a mortal really, I could die at any time," he told Becky Anderson inside Ankara's presidential palace Tuesday, in his first interview since the vote. Turkish voters on Sunday passed an 18-article constitutional reform package that will transform the country's parliamentary system into a powerful executive presidency.

Not pleasant for MS-13 -- get them the hell out of here, right? Get them out."

"It is much easier to act presidential than what we are doing here tonight, believe me," Trump assured his audience. "With the exception of the late, great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president that's ever held this office." Well then. Lincoln has frequently been singled out for praise by Trump and used as a point of reference when he is when pondering the impact of his own presidency. "Great president," Trump said of Lincoln in March of this year. "Most people don't even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don't know that.

question: @placeholder’s defence will be of a calibre England have not experienced since the World Cup. context: England’s seven-game winning streak does not include Italy. Lithuania, but not Italy. Slovenia, but not Italy. San Marino and Estonia, but not Italy. So the idea that the heat has been taken out of Harry Kane’s full debut for his country by a string of victories since last summer’s World Cup does rather overlook a salient fact. That England’s seven wins, as welcome as they may be, are against the also-rans of European football. Only Slovenia are on course to qualify automatically for the European Championship at the halfway stage — by coming a distant second to England — while Norway, Switzerland and Scotland are in third place in their respective groups, Lithuania lie fourth, Estonia fifth and San Marino where they always are.

Instead, they were inspired by a beloved Memey McMemeface: Boaty McBoatface, the almost-name of a research vessel that charmed UK citizens last year.

In a two-hour town hall, the Nevada Republican was pressed to defend his positions on Planned Parenthood, his hesitancy to reject the GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and even his Easter Sunday post on Facebook in which Heller quoted Ronald Reagan Heller was drowned out by chants of "yes or no!" and "answer the question!" when hundreds of crowd members saw his answers as evasive. Vivian Leal, a 51-year-old Reno mother who said she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999, pressed Heller the hardest -- interrupting and demanding specifics when he talked around her question about whether he will oppose any legislation that revokes Obamacare's protections for those with pre-existing conditions and that directs those people into high-risk insurance pools. @highlight Dean Heller took questions from angry constituents Monday @highlight The Nevada Republican senator was grilled on health care and President Donald Trump @highlight He is the GOP senator facing what's likely to be the most difficult re-election race in the midterms	Dean Heller

As Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan dominated the news agenda, Mexico's drug wars claimed 23,000 lives during 2016 -- second only to Syria, where 50,000 people died as a result of the civil war. "This is all the more surprising, considering that the conflict deaths [in Mexico] are nearly all attributable to small arms," said John Chipman, chief executive and director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), which issued its annual survey of armed conflict on Tuesday. "The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan claimed 17,000 and 16,000 lives respectively in 2016, although in lethality they were surpassed by conflicts in Mexico and Central America, which have received much less attention from the media and the international community," said Anastasia Voronkova, the editor of the survey. @highlight Mexican government disputes death toll, methodology @highlight Clashes between drug cartels killed more people than conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan	Afghanistan

Described by the Indian government as a "significant change of status quo with serious security implications for India," the controversial road runs through the disputed Doklam Plateau, on the unmarked border between China and Bhutan. Though not a part of Indian territory, the plateau holds immense strategic importance for Delhi and is vital to its geopolitical interests.

Schiff's bill would repeal the 2001 and 2002 war authorizations still used to fight terrorism across the globe with a measure that expires after three years and makes it easier for Congress to put a check on the Executive Branch's use of ground combat forces in the terror fight.

question: It is not written by Mexican-American studies experts, of which there are many in @placeholder. context: (CNN) Be careful what you wish for. For years, activists have pressed the Texas State Board of Education for a more diverse curriculum, and this week The Associated Press reported, the board unveiled its first proposed textbook for Mexican-American studies. The problem? For starters, the "Mexican American Heritage" text asserts that some Mexican-Americans during the civil rights era of the 1960s "opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society." It links Mexican-Americans to the drug trade and illegal immigration and says that Mexican-Americans are ambivalent about assimilating into the United States. The textbook presents a distorted view of Mexican-Americans, in part because it relies on stereotypes and incorrect assumptions. Its editorial content is dubious at best and flat-out racist at worst.

question: Enrique would be happier with @placeholder but for around £2.2m, Van Persie is being pushed as a better short-term solution. context: Robin van Persie’s career could be set for an unexpected Nou Camp swansong with Barcelona considering signing the 32-year-old Dutch forward in January. Van Persie's role would be to act as back-up for Neymar, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi, a similar job to the one Henrik Larsson did  when he moved to Barca in 2004 after seven years at Celtic. Barcelona have Messi out injured and Suarez is also a doubt for Saturday’s game against Rayo Vallecano. That leaves Neymar up front alongside youngsters Sandro and Munir El Haddadi.

He complained that the Saudis appeared to be funding an opposition candidate, Anwar Ibrahim, in upcoming elections. What's more, the Malaysian authorities suspected two senior Saudi princes of involvement. The Saudis launched an investigation, and uncovered something very different -- and more alarming. A secret report seen by CNN concludes: "There is no evidence any Saudi official ever supported Anwar Ibrahim" and "claims of support from the Saudi royals named in the initial report [names redacted] were found to be without basis." @highlight Secret report found hundreds of millions of dollars of Saudi money had been funneled to leading Islamist politicians and political activists overseas @highlight Report says al Qaeda and the Taliban were still able to use Saudi Arabia for fund-raising @highlight A complex web of Islamic charities and banks as well as the Muslim Brotherhood have been sources of cash, report says	Saudi

But his campaign against the criminal and extremist groups that plague the city has put his life at risk, and he says that if he receives more threats, he will have to leave Libya. Libya can't afford to lose the likes of Bettamer. A law graduate and civil activist, he helped organize the protest against jihadist groups after the attack on the U.S. Consulate there in September, in which four Americans were killed.

Friends and descendants of islanders who insist they saw the American aviator and her navigator Fred Noonan after their Lockheed Electra plane crashed in the Marshall Islands have told what they have learned about the adventurous pair who vanished during a round-the-world flight.

question: "I believe that health care in this country should be a right of all people, not a privilege," @placeholder has said routinely at events in Iowa this week. context: Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) Hillary Clinton on Friday cast Bernie Sanders' plan for single-payer health insurance as an "idea that will never, ever come to pass." The swipe builds on Clinton's repeated rhetoric against the Vermont senator's proposed single-payer, Medicare-for-all health care plan that he proposed earlier this month. The plan would provide health coverage to all Americans but would be paid for by raising taxes on most Americans. Clinton has sought to cast Sanders' plan as going backwards by repealing Obamacare -- President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement -- in order to pass single-payer.

Facebook on Thursday launched a photo-sharing app called Facebook Camera, which aims to make it simpler for the social network's users to upload and browse photos on smartphones. The news comes only weeks after Facebook spent $1 billion on a similar photo-sharing app called Instagram. And only days after the company's initial public offering got a lukewarm reception from Wall Street and raised the eyebrows of financial regulators. The company says the app, which will be available late Thursday for Apple iOS devices, makes Facebook photos more fun and accessible.

Ollie, from Portrush, Northern Ireland, tricked his unnamed friend after the pal left with the woman he met in Kelly's nightclub but didn't get her number. Mischievous Ollie then texted his Army-worker friend, from Lisburn, the next day pretending to be the mystery woman and even arranged to meet up with her for a date.

Brett Robinson, 33, a civilian staffer at Washington County Jail's maximum-security unit, repeatedly sneaked convicted gang member Jang-Li Delgado-Galban, 25, out of his cell for sex last summer.

question: In the past, @placeholder has come under fire for saying, as he did in May, that US foreign policy should sometimes separate values such as freedom, human dignity and "the way people are treated" from policies it pursues around the world. context: Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that President Donald Trump "speaks for himself" when asked whether the President's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, raised questions about Trump's values. The brief remark from the top Cabinet official appeared to be the latest subtle sign of a gap between Tillerson, a former globe-trotting oil executive, and the freewheeling President, who ran a campaign in large part against how the US interacts with pillars of the international community. It also points to a distance between Trump and some of his team on Charlottesville.

His mood, during the two-hour journey from Dingwall, where the count had taken place, was one of sadness and reflection. It was, after all, the end of a distinguished 32-year Commons career which had spanned almost his entire adult life. That the development came three weeks after the death of Kennedy’s beloved father, Ian, who had lived next door, only added to his melancholy. Yet if the former Liberal Democrat leader expected to spend the ensuing hours grieving in peace, he would be sorely mistaken. For as he pulled up outside the tidy cottage, built a stone’s throw from the river Lochy by his late grand-father, Donald, he came across what appeared to be a nasty ‘welcome home’ present. ‘It was a Friday morning, when the rubbish gets taken out in and around Fort William,’ recalls Kennedy’s campaign manager, Conn O’Neill. @highlight Kennedy was the victim of extensive personal attacks from SNP loyalist @highlight Waged on cyberspace and on the streets of his Highland constituency @highlight On social networking sites, trolls called him a traitor and a drunkard	SNP
question: Instead of retreating out of harm's way, @placeholder have doubled down. context: (CNN) All hurricanes are brutal, but geology, geography and good old-fashioned capitalism have conspired to make Florida hurricanes particularly damaging events. South Florida, in particular, is a kind of paradise for many people who live there, but as far as Mother Nature is concerned, it's a fragile kind of paradise. Historically, more hurricanes have hit Florida than any other state in the US. And that's no surprise: Florida sticks out from the North American continent like a hitchhiker's thumb. Hurricanes spiraling across the Atlantic are driven to it by winds and currents. The narrowness of the state only increases its vulnerability: it's the only state that is vulnerable on both sides, east and west. A big storm like Irma can swallow the whole southern part of the state. @highlight Jeff Goodell: Florida's shape and low-lying lands make it particularly susceptible to hurricanes and extreme flooding @highlight And while Floridians used to rebuild in the wake of hurricanes, climate change is now complicating matters, he writes	Florida

While most of the country settled in for a Columbus Day holiday break, Trump orchestrated a cacophony of threats, offered dark warnings of military action and waged bitter political feuds on multiple fronts. No one, not his estranged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, his chief of staff John Kelly, European leaders, North Korean dictators, Democrats or despairing GOP senators can temper his shock and awe leadership style.

question: The tension between @placeholder and Romney has filtered down to their aides, too. context: Salt Lake City (CNN) President Donald Trump has taken an intense interest in whether Utah Republican Orrin Hatch runs for Senate re-election in 2018, sources tell CNN, a fact that has some in Washington thinking the concern is part of an effort to keep former Republican presidential nominee and on-again-off-again Trump critic Mitt Romney from the legislative body. The renewed focus comes as Trump visits Utah for the first time as president. He made the trip as part of a Hatch-requested event at the Utah Capitol, where the President announced significant reductions to Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.

The campaign group said the sculpture, which depicts an idyllic family beach scene interrupted by birds choking on plastic, was intended to highlight  what it claimed were failings by the company.

But his tact with the Asian superpower has run the gamut: He has thanked the Chinese for their support, argued they aren't helping defuse the situation and then written them off as willing partners -- all in the span of a few months. On Saturday here in Germany for the G20, Trump urged action on North Korea as he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

question: "A similarity with SARS is that both @placeholder and MERS are zoonotic (when the virus can jump from animal to human) viruses. context: Hong Kong generally gets a bad rap when it comes to infectious diseases. Grabbing headlines during recent bird- and swine-flu outbreaks, its proximity to Mainland China as well as its unenviable status as the worst-affected city during the 2003 SARS outbreak, Hong Kong has been central to several global pandemic fears in recent years. It hasn't even escaped fictional outbreaks -- the 2011 movie "Contagion" had patient zero Gwyneth Paltrow bring back an unwelcome souvenir from a business trip to the city.

question: She's effectively an incumbent with dynastic baggage facing an outsider candidate in @placeholder who built a campaign on voter mistrust of establishment politicians. context: (CNN) Hillary Clinton has advantages heading into the final stretch of the campaign that any presidential candidate would envy: a fleet of popular surrogates, a mountain of cash and an opponent who is often sidetracked by self-inflicted wounds. Yet the Democratic nominee enters this home stretch in a dead heat against Donald Trump, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. The close contest heading into the fall underscores Clinton's vulnerabilities on trust and honesty -- and her need to summon a relentless and efficient ground game, even if many of her voters are fueled more by revulsion toward Trump than excitement about her. @highlight The 2016 race remains within the margin of error in the latest CNN/ORC poll @highlight Clinton has started to be more aggressive against Donald Trump this week	Donald Trump
question: Colbert also styled himself differently than he usually does on the "@placeholder," further distinguishing between that show and his next late-night act. context: (CNN) -- CBS began to introduce the next host of the "Late Show," Stephen Colbert, by having current host David Letterman interview him and take a selfie together on Tuesday night. Letterman called Colbert "always entertaining," "the new kid" and "my friend." What Letterman was saying, implicitly, was that he supported CBS's pick for his successor. CBS announced that it had signed Colbert to a multiyear deal back on April 10, one week after Letterman revealed that he intends to retire in 2015. The unspecified timing of the transition came up during the chat between the two comedians. When Letterman asked about family matters, Colbert, who has three kids, said, "They're getting ready for me to hang around too much." He pointed out that he'll be signing off his Comedy Central show "The Colbert Report" at the end of the year, "and then there's -- I don't know -- when are you leaving?

question: Protests rocked Ferguson that day, hours after @placeholder shot Brown. context: To some, they're the gut-wrenching emotional cries of a man whose stepson's life was taken. Others say they were dangerous words that sparked a powder keg as violent protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri last week. But did Michael Brown's stepfather intend to incite rioting in the St. Louis suburb? That's a question Ferguson police say they're looking into. Brown's stepfather didn't hold back as news of a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson reached Ferguson. As throngs in front of the Ferguson Police Department listened to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch's announcement on cell phones and radios, Louis Head stepped onto a platform above the crowd and embraced his wife, Brown's mother. He then turned to the demonstrators -- some of them shouting "F--- the police!" -- and yelled, "Burn this motherf---er down!" and "Burn this bitch down!" @highlight Multiple agencies investigating whether Louis Head intended to incite riot last week @highlight Head's attorney and wife say he was hurt and angry when he spoke to crowds @highlight After announcement that Wilson would not be indicted, Ferguson erupted in chaos @highlight Head shouted to crowd, "Burn this motherf---er down!" and "Burn this bitch down!"

More than 450 migrants desperate for a new life in Europe were crammed on board the former fishing vessel when it went down just 20 miles off the northern coast of Libya. Only the lucky few seen in the photographs - which were taken from a passing aircraft - were able to survive the disaster, clinging to the tiny tip of the hull that remained above the water after hundreds of their friends and family members sunk to their tragic deaths. @highlight More than 450 migrants desperate for a new life in Europe were crammed on board the former fishing vessel @highlight The boat bound for the Italian mainland went down just 20 miles off the northern coast of Libya @highlight Only a lucky few seen in the photographs were able to survive the disaster - with hundreds of others dying @highlight Passengers on board a passing plane were able to alert the Italian Coast Guard who sent a rubber dinghy @highlight But that craft was overwhelmed by the desperate migrants and also started to sink in the merciless sea	Libya

Since September 1 we have seen eight tropical cyclones, five of which became typhoons, two reaching Super Typhoon status, the strongest classification of tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific. A Philippines scientist points to a screen monitoring Tropical Storm Parma and Typhoon Melor. But when we look at the numbers, 2009 has actually been slightly below average.

Netanyahu beamed at his new American counterpart and declared him the best friend Israel could possibly wish for, while Trump offered lofty praise for Israel, denounced the Iranian nuclear deal and declined to back a two-state solution -- a longstanding, bipartisan US policy that the Israeli Prime Minister has questioned. The encounter signaled a warmer chapter in US-Israel relations than Netanyahu had enjoyed with Trump's predecessor.

The first funeral was for 70-year-old Ethel Lance, a Charleston native who had been a member of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where the shooting occurred June 17, for most of her life.

Rabbitohs sealed a final minute 18-17 victory over the Bulldogs in an absorbing encounter at ANZ Stadium in Sydney during the Good Friday showdown. But fans turned on referee Gerard Sutton and his colleagues after they penalised Bulldogs captain James Graham in the final minute, effectively handing the Rabbitohs the win.

But two long-time friends from Canada, who took their two sets of sons on a journey to the original home of Kentucky Fried Chicken in Corbin, Kentucky, said it's a trip they'll never forget. The group of six completed the drive in three days crossing two Canadian provinces including Quebec and Ontario, as well as five U.S. states - New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, according to The Times Tribune.

question: @placeholder and the town of Frejus had to suspend their bans after court rulings Tuesday. context: Cannes, France (CNN) Twenty-two towns in France are maintaining a ban on the burkini despite court rulings that have said mayors have no legal right to dictate what women wear on the beach. More than 30 towns initially had imposed a ban on the swimwear, which covers the body from head to toe, leaving only the face, hands and feet exposed. French courts have already ruled that mayors in Villeneuve-Loubet and Cannes, among others, had no legal right to impose such dress codes. Bans in other cities also face challenges in court, one by one. The burkini is worn mostly by Muslim women, and officials say the bans are a response to growing terror concerns after a series of attacks, including one last month in Nice that left 86 dead when a man drove a truck through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. @highlight French courts have ruled mayors don't have legal right to impose such dress codes @highlight After ruling in Villeneuve-Loubet, other French towns face court challenges over ban	Cannes

"A new era of justice begins. And it begins right now," Trump said. "This is a new era. This is the Trump era," Sessions told border patrol agents on Tuesday, echoing a similar recognition that change is afoot. In just over two months, Sessions has proved to be a central figure in effectuating Trump's vision for America in tangible ways on immigration, crime, police reform and civil rights. And while the White House searches for new messaging to frame what Trump has accomplished in the first 100 days in office, Sessions has single-handedly managed to make several significant domestic policy changes -- from pressing pause on implementing police reforms to withdrawing Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. @highlight "We have a crime problem," Sessions said at his swearing-in ceremony @highlight "This is a new era.

It was his latest attack on a key body he will rely on as commander in chief and again put him at odds with the agencies' unanimous conclusion that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals to interfere in the US presidential election. Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an " 'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking' " that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time "to build a case."

question: His ascent in Obama's world began in 2007 when the future president visited Google's @placeholder headquarters for a one-on-one interview, staged for the benefit of the company's employees, then 16,000 strong. context: When President Barack Obama dined with a dozen technology business leaders in California four years ago, it was Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt who sat at the head of the table. Obama sat on one side, between the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook pioneer Mark Zuckerberg, but the place of honor was no accident. Google executives and employees donated more than $1.6 million to Obama's two White House campaigns, and the online search giant parachuted top talent into both. One result has been a coziness with the U.S. government's executive branch that few other companies can match – marked by access for lobbyists, mentions in nearly half of Obama's State of the Union addresses, and a personnel feeder trough serving the White House with new senior hires. @highlight Google employees donated $1.6 million to President Barack Obama's two White House bids @highlight The company told Daily Mail Online that it has spoken with the Federal Trade Commission about antitrust concerns; it was investigated in 2011 but later let off the hook @highlight In the 2012 election, the company’s search algorithm customized results for Obama but not for Republican Mitt Romney @highlight Google execs who have left to work in the White House include Obama's chief technology officer @highlight Hillary Clinton also poached her new tech chief from Google this week	California

The agreement, says the Norwegian FA, will mean a pay rise of 2.5 million Norwegian kroner ($302,750) in 2018 for the women's team, with both national teams receiving six million kroner ($726,900) each next year. @highlight Norwegian FA will pay women's team and men's team the same @highlight Agreement signed in London on December 13	Norway
question: And his gut told him to punch back at a former @placeholder whom he allegedly once called "Miss Piggy" after she gained weight by calling her disgusting for starring in a sex tape. context: (CNN) What does the Republican nominee for president do when he can't sleep? Awake at 3 a.m. ET, Donald Trump picked up his phone and began tweeting about "made up lies" in the media. Just two hours later, he opened up Twitter again and quickly went from venting to slandering a former beauty queen -- shaming her for a sex tape for which the campaign has not provided evidence. Trump's conduct since the first debate has been astonishing for a major party nominee just 39 days away from the election. Instead of zeroing in on his strongest points from Monday night on jobs and trade, he's cited fake polls, resurfaced Bill Clinton's marital scandals from the 1990s, floated a conspiracy theory about Google searches and attacked 1996's Miss Universe. @highlight At 3 a.m., Donald Trump began tweeting about "made up lies" in the media @highlight Two hours later, he again took to Twitter to slander a former beauty queen	Miss Universe
question: In an episode in March that focused on the need to rebuild America’s infrastructure, Oliver described it as something politicians, labor, business and ‘even a total idiot’ like @placeholder agree must be replaced. context: Donald Trump has become the subject of ridicule once again, this time from HBO talk-show host John Oliver. The British comedian and presenter is well known for pulling no punches when it comes to straight talking on his show ‘Last Week Tonight’, and Sunday night’s show was no exception. But he turned his attention from politics to food waste, in an 18-minute investigation segment on food waste in America. The investigations followed a report released by the Natural Resources Defense Council, revealing that Americans waste about 40 per cent of the food produced every year. The waste – which cost the U.S. around $165billion - would be able to fill 730 football stadiums. @highlight Last Week Tonight host attacked Donald Trump in his latest show @highlight It featured an investigation into why Americans waste 40 per cent of food @highlight Oliver claimed Trump didn't care about hungry families in the U.S. or  the long-term viability of life on Earth @highlight He has previously called Trump an 'upside-down piece of candy corn in a wig made of used medical gauze'	Donald Trump
question: @placeholder will leave behind a legacy of having stretched the boundaries of series television, between expanding the use of green-screen technology (the show has never shot one frame outdoors) and proving hard-R sex and violence can draw an audience when mixed with compelling storytelling. context: (EW.com) -- After stabbing, slashing and pummeling countless enemies, Spartacus will slay his final Roman next year. Starz is set to announce that the next season of its historical drama "Spartacus" will mark the show's final outing. The upside: Creator Steven S. DeKnight promises the remaining episodes will be spectacular (see the final season poster and teaser video here). "This season is bigger than anything we've attempted," DeKnight says. "The scope and scale is just amazing. We're dealing with massive battles between thousands of people. We hope to leave people feel satisfied." DeKnight says he's been 90 percent certain for months that the upcoming third season -- subtitled "War of the Damned" -- would be the last for "Spartacus." Creatively, the writer-producer assures that the timing will result in a strong tale. The historical foundation for the rebel leader's journey, he says, lends itself to wrapping up the show sooner rather than later. @highlight The next season of Starz' historical drama "Spartacus" will mark the show's final outing @highlight "This season is bigger than anything we've attempted," creator Steven S.

She is tired and gaunt. Her three-year-old daughter Shankaron sits on her lap, eyes blank and scared. It is a look that is far too common in these parts. The past days have been cruel on Fatumata and her two young children -- forced to walk over 100 miles in search of food, water and sanctuary. Only now, in Baidoa, home to a camp for displaced Somalis, does she find the smallest of solace. "Shankaron had a fever, she cried the whole way," Fatumata says.

Farooqui was called in for questioning on Saturday and, after appearing in court, was sent to jail until July 6.

question: In the quarter-final, Dortmund were paired with Pellegrini's @placeholder and it was certainly a dramatic encounter. context: Jurgen Klopp arrived in English football on Friday with a heart-warming smile and an insistence that he was the 'Normal One.' But the charismatic German will have to do something extraordinary if he is to restore Liverpool to their former glories. In order to win the title - indeed, just to break back into the top four - Klopp will have to take on and outwit some of the world's best managers.

Coneygree didn’t know he was a novice, didn’t know he was fragile, didn’t know he wasn’t worth anything at all. He didn’t know a first-timer hadn’t won the Gold Cup since 1974, or that winners of blue riband races are rarely so gauche that they lead from start to finish. And what he didn’t know couldn’t hurt him. It is different for humans.

question: "Even if @placeholder does not have official diplomatic ties with those countries, a lot more can and should be done to revitalize Taiwan's economy." context: Taipei, Taiwan (CNN) Eclipsed for years by a rising China, Taiwan is standing taller after a thrilling and historic exercise in democracy. In a landslide win January 16, Tsai Ing-wen became Taiwan's first female president. Known as "Dr. Tsai" after completing a doctorate at the London School of Economics, she's also the first woman in Asia to be elected head of state without being part of a political legacy.

question: Yet for almost a week, @placeholder has shown he is in fact capable of being disciplined. context: Washington (CNN) One of the most remarkable moments on the campaign trail this week was one that didn't happen. Former Miss Universe Alicia Machado introduced Hillary Clinton at a Florida rally Tuesday, blasting Donald Trump. And for once, the billionaire didn't react. No tweets. No attacks from the stump. Nothing. Instead, he stayed on message going after Clinton on her email server while pledging to repeal Obamacare. In the final days of the 2016 campaign, Trump isn't taking Clinton's bait. The new self-discipline comes as the election tightens and polls indicate a razor-close race in battleground states such as Florida, New Hampshire and Colorado. On the stump Wednesday night in Florida, Trump revealed how he is focused on staying disciplined and how hard it is for him. @highlight Trump isn't taking Clinton's bait @highlight Trump at Wednesday rally: 'We've got to be nice and cool, nice and cool, right?'

question: The thrust of @placeholder's speech lines up with the message many on the right flank of the House GOP conference have been pushing. context: Washington (CNN) -- Some conservatives unhappy with House Speaker John Boehner's leadership are looking for a replacement, and recent moves by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling are fueling speculation he wants Boehner's job in the next Congress. Hensarling, who was part of Boehner's leadership team two years ago but left to chair the House Financial Services Committee, gave an expansive speech last week hosted by Heritage Action for America, a group that frequently and publicly clashes with Boehner. Asked afterward if he was interested in running for speaker, Hensarling initially said he was "flattered," and said, "It's not something I've aspired to. It's not something I'm thinking about." @highlight Boehner has been speaker since 2011 and has said he's not going anywhere @highlight Hensarling says he's flattered by the attention, but is not thinking about being speaker @highlight But he's leaving the door open as some conservatives have been unhappy with Boehner's leadership	Hensarling

Back home in Tehran, Ahmadinejad was immediately bashed by newspapers and by conservative politicians who cited a religious prohibition against touching a woman who is not your wife or a relative. While theology is a factor, there may have been a deeper message to this backlash from Tehran: that it's no longer cool to be supporting Chávez, his family and political allies, and that this alliance, like others cultivated by Chávez, may be in jeopardy. @highlight Eduardo J.

Investigators are examining Abdul Razak Ali Artan's Facebook page to determine whether the attack was terrorism, though law enforcement officials said it will take time to ascertain motive. In a Facebook post shortly before the Monday morning rampage, the Somali immigrant urged America "to stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah," a term for Muslim people at large.

And how telling that while these awkward matches used to be scrutinised by the camera of their father and inspiration, Richard, he has rarely been courtside in recent years. It is a measure of the sisters’ longevity that what was once an affair for the whole family is something more grown up these days.

Trump said he took Putin at his word that Russia did not seek to interfere in the US presidential election last year, despite a finding from US intelligence agencies that it did. The fraught relations between the two leaders was underscored anew when Putin's spokesman initially said election meddling did not come up when they spoke, even though Trump said it did.

Is it a sign Pyongyang wants better relations with Washington? Is it sending a message to its closest ally, China? Or is it a bid to shift the focus off its human rights record amid talk Kim could be charged with crimes against humanity?

"We have joined the Libyan people in demanding that Gadhafi must go -- now, without further violence or delay -- and we are working to translate the world's outrage into action and results," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

When it comes to energy, Ernst, a Republican state senator, and Braley, a Democratic congressman, both have controversial positions to defend to voters. Ernst elaborated on her position to shutter the Environmental Protection Agency, a move that critics say will make Iowa more polluted. Braley, meanwhile, explained his flip-flopping on the Keystone Pipeline that has left some Iowans skeptical about his commitment to create jobs.

Catalan President Carles Puigdemont had been expected to make a formal declaration at a specially convened session of the Catalan parliament on Tuesday. But there was intense speculation on Monday about whether Puigdemont would go ahead with such a provocative move -- particularly in the light of a huge rally against independence in Barcelona at the weekend that exposed deep misgivings about his tactics among some sections of Catalan society. @highlight Barcelona mayor says, "Escalation will not benefit anyone" @highlight Deep divisions over the issue of Catalan independence	Catalan

Millionaire chief executive Gerry Ford blanked inquiries about his decision to cave in to threats from animal rights activists and stop buying milk from Gloucestershire and Somerset, where a badger cull pilot scheme is taking place. MPs have accused ‘spineless’ executives at Caffe Nero of ‘kicking people when they are down’ by punishing dairy farmers already suffering from the loss of their cattle.

But late Thursday, reports surfaced that a $3.2 billion deal was in the works for Apple to scoop up Beats Electronics, the world's most popular maker of headphones and, more recently, the company behind a highly regarded music-streaming service. Neither side has confirmed the deal, though Dre came dangerously close in a new video in which he declared himself "the first billionaire in hip-hop."

The move  has turned on its head the controversial practice of heavily promoting new-build London developments to wealthy overseas buyers - particularly in the Far East. The first residential offering from Canary Wharf Group, which has previously specialised in commercial property, goes on sale on Thursday 9 July 2015.

As Brady attended last-minute settlement talks between the NFL and its players union Monday, Jane Rosenberg again sketched the quarterback's famous face. The result? Not quite as ghoulish as last time and this go-round she got the thumbs up from Brady himself. However, after practicing for weeks, Rosenberg admitted it's not her best work and blamed a time crunch.

question: But @placeholder officials admitted that due to a soft policy on undocumented immigrants, they do not always comply with the requests - which in Sanchez's case left him out on the streets on the night of the murder. context: Donald Trump has renewed his calls for tougher immigration controls in the wake of an illegal Mexican migrant allegedly murdering a woman in San Francisco. The presidential hopeful branded U.S. border controls an 'absolute disgrace' in light of the revelation that Francisco Sanchez, 45, had already been deported five times - and was recently released from jail by officials who routinely refuse requests to hand over illegal immigrants.

question: In another boost for Strauss-@placeholder, two ex-prostitutes who attended the orgies dropped a civil lawsuit against him, with lawyers saying they lacked enough proof to win the case. context: Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been cleared of 'aggravated pimping' over orgies held during the global financial crisis. Strauss-Kahn, who was once widely expected to become French president, was accused of procuring seven prostitutes for 'beast-like' sex parties that took place between 2008 and 2011, while he was married. He admitted that the orgies took place, but denied knowing the women were paid to be there, saying he believed they were simply 'libertine'. Strauss-Kahn, known as DSK in France, had been facing 10 years behind bars until his acquittal today. The verdict draws to a close four years of legal drama for Strauss-Kahn which saw his presidential ambitions implode, and his 20-year marriage collapse. @highlight Dominique Strauss-Kahn admitted to taking part in group sex parties @highlight Said they were 'recreational sessions' away from his job 'saving the world' @highlight However he denied knowing that the women involved were prostitutes @highlight Verdict ends four years of legal battles than ended his presidential hopes	Kahn

question: More @placeholder are dying from drug-resistant infections -- the garden variety staph and strep bugs that used to be swiftly cured with a course of routine antibiotics. context: (CNN) As House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the Republican health care bill from voting, I could almost hear the giant sigh of relief from Atlanta and across the nation's health care establishment. Hidden in the nooks and crannies of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was a provision to eliminate $1 billion in disease prevention funds from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Those cheers I imagine I hear right now in Atlanta are huzzahs from the CDC headquarters. According to the GOP plan, "Our Step-by-Step Approach," the first of three steps towards reshaping the American health care market was thwarted on Friday when the White House, recognizing that splits within the Republican Party could not be resolved to allow passage of the AHCA, instructed Ryan to pull the bill.

Kim has progressively gained weight since taking power, filling out his already chubby frame considerably over the last three-and-a-half years. @highlight State media pictures this week showed despot at heaviest yet and on verge of bursting out of pinstripe suit inspecting farm outside capital Pyongyang @highlight Kenji Fujimoto was sushi chef to ruler's father Kim Jong-il for 13 years @highlight Claims Jong-un 'drank a lot', and would put away two bottles of Cristal in a sitting - exclusive champagne costing £175 a bottle in UK @highlight Other favourites include calorific Swiss Emmental cheese, Kobe steak, shark fin soup and French cognac - all while his people face hunger	Kim
question: 'Sources added that there is likely to be some shake-up of the board too, most immediately the departure of @placeholder as a director,' it claims. context: Twitter may be about to hire co-founder Jack Dorsey as its permanent CEO three months after he took over the job on a temporary basis. The technology news site Re/Code says Dorsey's appointment could be announced as early as Thursday morning. The report posted Wednesday cited unnamed people. Dorsey is also CEO of mobile payment service Square, a job he has repeatedly said he intends to keep as he prepares to take that San Francisco company public too.

question: At @placeholder, these have been big problems because the electricity needed to keep them cool was lost, allowing radiation levels to rise, after the earthquake and tsunami. context: (CNN) -- The future of earthquake-ravaged nuclear power plant Fukushima Daiichi is still anyone's guess, but it's already triggered fears of subsequent nuclear disasters elsewhere. As efforts continue to get radiation levels under control in the damaged facilities in Japan, several countries have expressed doubts about their own nuclear programs. And seven in 10 Americans say they're more concerned about a nuclear disaster happening in the United States than they were before, according to a recent USA Today/Gallup poll. Are these fears justified? What are the real risks of nuclear power, both globally and in the United States? And what do we do with all of that nuclear waste? @highlight Nuclear and hydropower have lower greenhouse gas releases than coal @highlight Fukushima Daiichi is further from Los Angeles than Chernobyl is from New York @highlight Countries have expressed skepticism about nuclear power @highlight Yucca Mountain in Nevada is a proposed site to store used nuclear fuel in U.S.	Fukushima Daiichi
question: I'm definitely in the right place,' @placeholder told a friend immediate after the game. context: It's the morning of July 12, 2015, and Raheem Sterling's in his Range Rover driving to Liverpool's training ground. His phone rings. 'Morning gaffer,' Sterling replies as he takes the call. 'Just on the way into training,' the youngster continues. 'Okay, come into training but you're not coming on tour; we've accepted a bid,' Brendan Rodgers informed Sterling - who faces Liverpool for the first time this weekend following his summer departure. It's a moment he'll always remember. Having missed two days of training that week, the hype over whether Sterling would board the plane for Liverpool's tour of the Far East was at fever pitch. @highlight Raheem Sterling felt he would stay before Brendan Rodgers sparked a seismic shift in proceedings in February @highlight Sterling viewed Rodgers' comments as a ploy to paint him as the bad-boy @highlight Forward is adamant he would have travelled on Reds' pre-season tour @highlight Reaction from Liverpool fans to him at Stoke was the final nail in the coffin @highlight Europe's elite were making discreet overtures and were willing to pay double what Liverpool were offering	Raheem Sterling
question: The implants have since been removed at @placeholder hospital where Sabillon is being treated for an infection. context: A woman has been arrested at a Colombian airport after 1.5kg of liquid cocaine, stuffed in two tied-up latex gloves, was discovered inside her breasts. Paola Deyanira Sabillon confessed that an 'unknown substance' was implanted inside her and she was ordered to transport it to Barcelona. The 22-year-old Honduran aroused suspicion because she was acting strangely in the security line at El Dorado airport in the country's capital Bogota, according to  airport police. X-rays revealed that surgery had recently been carried out on her breasts and round £150,000-worth of cocaine had been planted inside. Authorities believe the surgery took place at a 'clandestine clinic' in the city of Pereira, western Colombia. @highlight The 22-year-old Honduran was caught trying to board a flight to Barcelona @highlight Paola Sabillon confessed an 'unknown substance' was planted inside her @highlight Police say surgery carried out recently at 'clandestine clinic' in Colombia @highlight Hidden stash was worth around £150,000 based on previous police busts	Bogota
question: Some protesters also attacked two fellow @placeholder whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police. context: Part of Jerusalem is seeing its worst flare-up in years. Here's a look at some of the key questions about the fighting. What started this new wave of violence? The violence certainly had not gone away, with rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli military incursions in the West Bank regular occurrences. But last month's abduction of three Israeli teens who were on their way home from school in the West Bank brought the tensions to a fever pitch. Israelis waited with bated breath, hoping for word that they were alive. When the bodies of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel -- a dual Israeli-American citizen -- were found on June 30, the country was grief-stricken. The Israeli government blamed Hamas, which denied responsibility but praised the abductions. Israel carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the West Bank, and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to lob rockets into Israel. Palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with Israeli troops. @highlight The killings of three Israeli teens sparked national grief @highlight The killing of a Palestinian teen sparked grief and clashes in a usually quiet area @highlight Israel announced a confession in the killing of another Israeli teen @highlight An American teen visiting Palestinian relatives was beaten	Palestinian

The Stoke manager has kept the club's chequebook largely in his pocket since taking over in May 2013 but said he would splash out when the right player became available. Signing Begovic to a new contract is a priority given the Bosnia goalkeeper will be entering the final year of his current deal.

question: Instead, it broke an important and legitimate news story -- that four of America's top intelligence chiefs last week informed President Obama, @placeholder and congressional leaders that the memos were in wide circulation. context: (CNN) Once upon a time, America's new presidents enjoyed a honeymoon upon taking office -- think Eisenhower, Kennedy, Reagan and Obama. But after a wide ranging and often combative press conference Wednesday, it is obvious that the opening weeks of the Donald Trump presidency will be the stormiest of modern times. Trump had good reason to be angry coming into the press arena. Over the past 24 hours, salacious, damning memos written by a former officer of the British MI 6 have flooded the Internet. The 35 pages published by BuzzFeed are full of unverified allegations that the Russians have compromising information about Trump and that Trump advisers have been in cahoots with Putin's men.

The superstar penned an open letter on Sunday morning, shaming the tech giant for its 'shocking' decision not to pay artists during a three-month free trial offered to subscribers. After hours of negotiations, the firm made a U-turn and will now pay every musician whose work is featured during the trial, which starts on June 30.

question: Xi must at all costs head off a destabilizing trade war -- one possibility if Trump follows through on his threats to impose tariffs on @placeholder goods. context: (CNN) It's a blind date with global ramifications. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping meet for the first time Thursday and will seek to forge a connection and to stabilize the world's most important diplomatic relationship, despite a gulf between them in experience, temperament and global outlook. Both have a long way to come to meet in the middle. Trump, the brash, outspoken, political novice who seems to give little mind to policy details, anchored his campaign on China bashing. He once warned that China had committed "rape" against the US economy and tweeted that global warming was a Chinese ruse to damage US manufacturing. @highlight Trump and Xi meet Thursday @highlight The two-day summit takes place in Mar-a-Lago	China
question: Unite, which is appealing the judgment, claimed it did not employ Mr @placeholder, who had a series of short-term contracts from colleges, which did not guarantee any minimum hours. context: The militant Unite union was facing embarrassment last night over claims it ‘sacked’ an activist for complaining about being hired on a zero-hours contract. Former lecturer Martyn Reuby won the first round in his legal battle against Unite, after a tribunal ruled that he had been employed to teach its courses. The employment tribunal ruling is a major embarrassment to the union, which has led the campaign against the use of zero-hours contracts, which it says amount to ‘exploitation’. Ed Miliband was left embarrassed today after Labour's biggest backer was accused of employing workers on zero-hours contracts It is also a blow to Ed Miliband, who has received more than £13million from Unite since becoming leader in 2010. @highlight Unite accused of employing workers on contracts 'effectively zero hours' @highlight Union, which has given millions to Labour, lost a key employment tribunal @highlight Lecturer Martyn Reuby says he was sacked after complaining about issue @highlight Comes after Labour was accused of hypocrisy over zero-hours contracts	Martyn Reuby

The officer, identified as Lee Coel, shot Mary Knowlton on Tuesday night during a "shoot/don't shoot" role-play scenario in which officers make decisions on using simulated lethal force, Punta Gorda Police Chief Tom Lewis said at a news conference. The retired librarian was playing an officer in the scenario, which was held just outside the police complex, officials said.

Shelley Daley was dropping her child off at school when she spotted Zulu, and 18-year-old, 80-pound tortoise slowly walking in front of her on Tuesday. At first she thought it was a lawn ornament but later realized it was a living and breathing reptile. 'I looked at it, it looked at us and I was like, "No, it’s real,"' she said.

question: The new dinosaur has been named @placeholder, after the Sesotho word 'sefapano', meaning 'cross', as one of its most discinctive features is a cross-shaped ankle bone. context: Palaeontologists have announced the discovery of a 200-million-year-old dinosaur from South Africa after discovering its bones 'hidden' in a university storeroom. The previously unknown species, christened Sefapanosaurus, had been excavated in the 1930s in the Zastron area of South Africa's Free State province. Its bones then ended up among thousands of other fossils at Wits University in Johannesburg, and remained there for some 80 years. The fossil collection at the Evolutionary Studies Institute (ESI) at Wits University is the largest in South Africa. The remains of the Sefapanosaurus had been thought to be those of another South African dinosaur, Aardonyx, but when palaeontologists examined them closer, they realised that it was a completely new species. @highlight New dinosaur species found among university  bone collection @highlight The Sefapanosaurus's bones had been excavated in the 1930s @highlight Bones had since been 'hidden' in South Africa's largest fossil collection	Sefapanosaurus
question: But @placeholder will remain a key power-broker in the security, military and religious fields, according to the draft. context: Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Some protesters not satisfied with the Moroccan king's proposed constitutional reforms have called for a peaceful demonstration Sunday. "The national coordinators (of the movement) have called for a demonstration Sunday for a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy," a member of the Rabat wing said Saturday. "The plan as proposed by the king yesterday, does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers," he said Saturday. King Mohammed VI of Morocco declared sweeping reforms that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own. Morocco's revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable, the parliament in Rabat more dynamic and will give the government greater powers, the 47-year-old king said in a nationally televised address. @highlight Some protesters will gather Sunday; others oppose idea @highlight Moroccans will vote for the constitution in a referendum slated for July 1 @highlight King Mohammed's role would be that of "citizen king" @highlight Mohammed says the constitution will guarantee independence of the judiciary	King Mohammed

Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, according to news reports, is announcing plans Wednesday to leave Alexander Hamilton on the front of the $10 bill and put a woman's portrait on the face of the $20, booting Andrew Jackson instead. But we aren't celebrating yet. In news reports, government sources also reveal that we won't be seeing that $20 with a female portrait in circulation until 2030 or beyond.

Erie, Pennsylvania, experienced the latter on Monday, when a total of 34 inches of snow fell on Christmas Day, blanketing the city and shattering the city's previous records for snowfall in a single day. The snowfall total was more than four times the city's previous all-time Christmas record of 8.1 inches, and it also broke the record for most snowfall in one day in the city's history, which was 20 inches on November 22, 1956. The snow didn't stop overnight, either. Erie picked up another 24.5 inches of snow on Tuesday, bringing the two-day tally to 58.5 inches.

Perez never names Ed Woodward but references to ‘their people being inexperienced’ are aimed at him. Agent Jorge Mendes appears to be a necessary middle man without whom there is no contact between the two clubs, and Jose Angel Sanchez, Perez’s trusty lieutenant is, in complete contrast to his opposite number, the embodiment of professional efficiency. Perez told Cadena Ser in an interview on Thursday night: ‘It was the last day of the window and 12 hours before it was due to close they (United) told us, via (Jorge) Mendes, that they would be open to negotiations for (David) De Gea.

question: But in practice, @placeholder's State Department has found itself on occasion grappling with both the President's words and aides seeking to steer foreign policy. context: Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that President Donald Trump "speaks for himself" when asked whether the President's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, raised questions about Trump's values. The brief remark from the top Cabinet official appeared to be the latest subtle sign of a gap between Tillerson, a former globe-trotting oil executive, and the freewheeling President, who ran a campaign in large part against how the US interacts with pillars of the international community. It also points to a distance between Trump and some of his team on Charlottesville.

But sexually explicit video clips almost immediately began appearing within the app, including one mistakenly showcased in its "Editor's Picks" section, drawing outrage from some users.

Two years had passed since the ‘trauma’ of Morgan Schneiderlin’s departure for Southampton but, unannounced, Keller’s golden boy was back in Strasbourg with a bag of meat and a group of former team-mates. ‘I heard this singing in the street and I was thinking, “What is this?” But then I thought, “I know these voices”,’ says Keller, once Schneiderlin’s coach at Strasbourg.

question: I think it would be great if we got along with @placeholder because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is known for his blunt talk -- on everything ranging from trade to immigration and the fight against ISIS. But throughout the 2016 campaign, and now in the White House, there's one topic that he's been less forthcoming about -- Russia's role interfering in the US election. He's answered questions about attempts to hack the 2016 election many different ways throughout the campaign and since ascending to the presidency -- even speculating during a debate last year that it "could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." The unanimous assessment of the US intelligence community is clear: Russia orchestrated a series of hacks and cyberattacks to meddle in the 2016 election and help Trump beat Hillary Clinton.

question: "It's important for Google and Microsoft to be reminded that sponsorship of a Trump-led convention helps legitimize and normalize @placeholder's hate," reads the Credo petition. context: (CNN) If there is one thing we can count on Donald Trump to deliver, it is controversy. From the day his campaign began, the Republican front-runner has been blunt, outspoken and frequently offensive. Now, just as Trump is attempting to present a more presidential image, the GOP has a new Trump-related headache. Activist groups, particularly those representing minorities and women, are pressing major corporations not to sponsor the Republican convention in July. They hope to persuade companies like Microsoft and Google to drop out of sponsoring what is sure to be a contentious event. These groups have the right idea by speaking out against corporate backing for Cleveland. By sponsoring the GOP convention, companies would be providing a platform for Trump's ugly rhetoric. It is bad messaging and poor business strategy for corporations to be seen as promoting the increasingly toxic Trump brand.

Republicans in the chamber used a procedure to end debate on the legislation and pass Senate Joint Resolution 39, an action that Democrats said broke Senate rules. If it someday becomes law, Missouri's Constitution would be amended to include language about the "protection of certain religious organizations and individuals from being penalized by the state because of their sincere religious beliefs or practices concerning marriage between two persons of the same sex." @highlight Republicans use a procedure to force a vote, end a 39-hour filibuster; Democrats object @highlight The bill goes to the House of Representatives; citizens could have the final say in a statewide vote	Missouri Senate
question: And regardless of which of the many scenarios materialize after @placeholder's current (and final) presidential term ends, one thing is clear: he will remain a major power broker in Afghanistan. context: (CNN) -- "Can I have a Blackhawk magazine vest?" the young man, in his mid twenties sporting a scruffy beard and cargo pants, asked. "With four magazine pouches, or six?" the shopkeeper responded. A six-pouch vest was sold for $27. In this market in the center of Kabul with over 50 shops, you can find anything from used U.S. army fatigues to Campbell's New England clam chowder and Uncle Ben's classic cornbread stuffing mix. Some of it is gear thrown away from the largest U.S. military base in Bagram, just a 45-minute drive north of Kabul, and some of it is stolen goods from the massive convoys supplying U.S. soldiers around the country. In recent years, the market has also been corrupted -- like many other things in Afghanistan -- and flooded with Chinese bootlegged goods. @highlight Many in Kabul fear the Afghanistan war is no longer a U.S. priority @highlight Afghans are concerned with Romney and Obama's stance on Pakistan @highlight Mashal: Hamid Karzai feels the Obama administration has tried to undermine him	Hamid Karzai
question: They want Prieto to return to @placeholder, where they believe he can receive a 'full and fair' assessment of his intellectual disability. context: Virginia is poised to execute a convicted serial killer who claims he's intellectually disabled using lethal injection drugs from Texas because the state's supply of another controversial drug will expire the day before the execution is supposed to take place. Unless Gov. Terry McAuliffe or the U.S. Supreme Court steps in this week, Alfredo Prieto will be executed Thursday - the first Virginia inmate to be receive the death penalty in nearly three years.

Ian Salter-Bromley, 55, filled his mouth with dominoes before shouting 'Exterminate! Exterminate!' in a row which led to him being Tasered twice by police. The court heard how Salter-Bromley, who is 4ft tall, had initially been 'quite jolly' while talking with the carers during a visit to his sheltered housing complex in Hull. But he then threatened to kill one of the members of staff, chanting: 'I'm a Dalek!

Vicky Brennan, 34, was horrified when she heard the toy her children had been given in their McDonald's meals uttering profanities. Stay at home mum Vicky, from Glossop, Derbyshire, immediately confiscated the toys from her children Jack, 11, Aydan, 7, and Tia, 4, but says the children had already picked up on the obscene language and were repeating the phrase.

Sportsmail also understands that relations between the two clubs are now difficult in the aftermath of West Ham chairman David Sullivan questioning the fitness of QPR striker Charlie Austin. The Hammers host Bournemouth on Saturday, with No 1 Adrian beginning his three-game suspension after seeing red against Leicester last week.

In an age of hard men, the stockily built midfield man was one of the toughest, a symbol of passion and fiery commitment.

David Luiz went to Paris Saint-Germain for £50million, Juan Mata moved to Manchester United for £37.1m and Kevin De Bruyne, after barely playing for the Portuguese, was sent to Wolfsburg for £18m.

question: @placeholder, whose former manager at Inter Milan Jose Mourinho said had the 'attitude of a child' spent full-time squabbling with Fabian Delph before resuming his celebrations. context: You could have been forgiven for mixing up which line-up cost £230million. Long-time Premier League title favourites Manchester City were comprehensively undone by the Stoke City pair of Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri, whose combined price tag of £15million was half what Manuel Pellegrini paid for holding midfielder Fernandinho alone. Arnautovic scored twice inside the first 15 minutes, both brilliantly assisted by Shaqiri, as Pellegrini's side drifted badly in the swirling Britannia cross-wind. Without Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Yaya Toure and Sergio Aguero – all injured – the richest club in England looked bereft of leadership.

"It was right during a huge storm, so it was raining, and I was trying to figure out where they would be," she said. "And then I saw Zach was bent over somebody on the ground, so I ran over." Zach Forcade, a 27-year-old medical student, hovered above a man beside a bus stop outside the hospital.

"He was one of the giants. He was very special," said Ayala Weisel, who said she grew up learning of Sharon as a widely admired soldier who fought for his country. She was one of many mourners who shared memories with CNN on Sunday of Sharon, the towering military and political leader who died Saturday after eight years in a coma. Chaim Friedman, a tour guide, described Sharon as a great leader. "He was known as the bulldozer because he got his way and he made things happen. He's well respected for that," Friedman said.

Eight other firefighters were injured in the fire, which was expected to be contained by 4:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET), said Ron Haralson, an inspector with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

In the 221-201 vote, less than three dozen of the majority House Republicans joined almost all of the chamber's 200 Democrats to pass the proposal increasing the debt ceiling that lacked any deficit-reduction provisions sought by the GOP's conservative wing. The vote followed a reversal in strategy by Republican House Speaker John Boehner after he and other leaders pushed the night before to attach a provision repealing cuts to military pensions to the debt limit measure. @highlight Less than three dozen Republicans join almost all of the Democrats to back bill @highlight GOP Sen.

question: A question about @placeholder's role in the world drew an answer about the U.S. unemployment rate. context: Long before the candidates set foot on stage in Florida, President Barack Obama headed into the final debate of the 2012 campaign with the biggest advantage of all: he's already commander-in-chief. The foreign policy face-off on Monday was devoted to a subject on which presidents can speak about decision-making in the first person and challengers can't. As recently as a few weeks ago, coming off a rocky foreign summer tour and a widely panned response to the deadly September 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, Mitt Romney seemed headed for a tough night. But that was before the administration faced its own politically charged questions on the Libya assault over security and its response to what actually occurred and who may have been behind it. @highlight Barack Obama as president had a certain advantage on foreign policy in debate @highlight Winning debate key, but projecting strong leadership might be more important @highlight Last chance for both candidates to make impression before captive audience	U.S.
question: "They wish they had a leader who looked like them -- the way @placeholder looks." context: Havana (CNN) President Barack Obama this week nominated the first US ambassador to Cuba in more than 50 years, capping a multi-year process to open a new diplomatic relationship with Havana. Jeffrey DeLaurentis, Obama's nominee, currently serves as the US charge d'affaires in Cuba. Despite his qualifications, DeLaurentis is unlikely to receive the promotion because senators opposed to Obama's Cuba opening are unlikely to approve his nomination. It is the latest example of American moves laden with symbolism that don't always translate into on-the-ground changes for the island just 90 miles from the Florida Keys, though the US president and his policy remains popular even so. @highlight The first commercial flights from US to Cuba started last month @highlight The US president and his opening to Havana remain popular	Barack Obama

question: "If the President has made up his mind against talks with @placeholder, that should be the end of the conversation," Denmark said. context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Wednesday that "talking is not the answer" when it comes to reining in North Korea -- seeming to contradict some of his top Cabinet officials who insist the US will continue to seek a peaceful resolution to tensions with Pyongyang, despite its provocative missile tests. "The U.S. has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!" Trump tweeted, just days after North Korea launched a missile that flew over northern Japan. It was not immediately clear what Trump meant by "extortion money," though previous administrations have tried to defuse nuclear tensions by offering the North Korean regime food and aid packages, some of it in exchange for Pyongyang's commitment to curb its nuclear programs -- promises that have always been broken. @highlight Trump's suggestion seems to break with comments made by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson @highlight North Korea successfully launched a missile over Japan earlier this week	North Korea

"I saw tens of people laying down in blood around me and hundreds of people running away from the scene," said Fatima Faizi, an Afghan freelance journalist. So far, 80 bodies and more than 260 wounded people were taken to hospitals in Kabul, according to Ismail Kawoosi, a spokesman for the Afghan Health Ministry.

question: Iran fired a ballistic missile two days after @placeholder's travel ban was announced and vowed to implement "reciprocal measures." context: (CNN) US Defense Secretary James Mattis called Iran "the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world" in his first comments on the country Saturday, a day after the Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions over an Iranian ballistic missile test. Iran and the United States have engaged in tit-for-tat exchanges since US President Donald Trump signed an executive order January 27 banning nationals temporarily from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Iran was among those countries.

The terrorist organisation  released shocking footage at the end of February purportedly showing jihadis destroying 3,000-year-old artworks with sledgehammers in their northern Iraqi stronghold. But now Baghdad museum director Fawzye al-Mahdi has ridiculed ISIS' propaganda exercise, claiming the genuine priceless Assyrian and Akkadian statues and sculptures are still safely in his possession in the Iraqi capital, adding that those in Mosul were plaster cast replicas.

It is evident everywhere, from the popularity of Coca-Cola and Levi's to the prevalence of American music and movies. But for all they like about American culture, it's fair to say Italians are getting a little weary of the American attitude -- especially when it comes to justice.

The heptathlete is the favourite of many to win the award, having won world championships gold barely a year after giving birth to her first child, Reggie. But her achievements and those of fellow Olympic champions Greg Rutherford and Mo Farah, also on the SPOTY shortlist, have been eclipsed by damaging revelations of widespread cheating and corruption in the sport.

A jury in Jacksonville on Saturday found Michael Dunn guilty of attempted second-degree murder for opening fire on three other teens in the same SUV as Jordan Davis -- but deadlocked on the murder charge against him in Davis' death.

The charges were brought Friday after the incident was filmed by YouTube's JohnTV vigilante Brian Bates, who has long recorded prostitutes getting it on with their johns in public. Bates recorded the video in early March, and it's the first time he's done so with a drone - which he used because he suspected a 'dangerous' pimp might be lurking nearby. @highlight Brian Bates, who runs JohnTV, recorded the pair in their illegal act with a drone @highlight Bates has long filmed johns and prostitutes but this is the first time he used a drone @highlight The pair were charged after the footage was turned over to police	Amanda Zolicoffer
question: But @placeholder's willingness to round the suspects up, to root out corruption, to seek appropriate penalties for drug crimes and to get the community involved in the effort to clean up the country is inspiring. context: (CNN) It's so typical of the West to sneer at the actions of what they see as "small brown folk on the other side of the world." The latest example of this racist and colonial mentality is the outrage and virtue-signaling criticism of the Philippines' hardline approach to drug crime under President Rodrigo Duterte. Yet the Philippines has a problem. The scourge of drugs -- particularly crystal methamphetamine, known in the country as shabu -- has taken its toll on families and relationships and on communities and barangays (small neighborhood-based local governments) right around the nation. It's a problem that has led to theft, violence and death over many years. And it's a problem that has helped keep so many Filipinos further entrenched in a poverty so deep it is hard for Westerners to imagine. @highlight Australian politician: 'We need strength to tackle our drug problem here in the West' @highlight West needs to stop 'sneering' at Duterte and listen to him, Christensen says	Duterte

The answer: When you have to travel through half of Syria and the concert is held in a newly liberated area with ISIS nearby. The Russian military put around 100 journalists on five buses, sent a convoy of armored vehicles and fighting vehicles and drove the reporters from Latakia in northwestern Syria to Palmyra, the ancient heritage site in the central desert. As our convoy slowly made its way down the Syrian coast and then made an eastward turn toward Homs and then Palmyra, Russian attack helicopters circled overhead, looking out for any threats. @highlight Fred Pleitgen and other journalists attended under Russian military escort @highlight The orchestra performed in a Roman ampitheater, the scene of an ISIS massacre	Syria

Pakistan's economy is in free fall, and its major cities are wracked by political violence, while Pakistani attitudes toward the United States have never been worse -- a legacy of the CIA contractor who shot and killed two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore this year, the campaign of drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal regions and the unilateral American raid to kill Osama bin Laden in northern Pakistan in May. On the U.S. side, there is considerable anger about Pakistan's unwillingness or inability to constrain Taliban groups based on its territory that are killing American soldiers in Afghanistan and a perception that while U.S. aid flows in large amounts to Pakistan, it continues to harbor enemies of America. @highlight Pakistani-U.S. relations are at their lowest ebb, authors say @highlight Some argue that there needs to be a cooling-off period to calm tempers @highlight Authors: Both nations should craft a new plan to change the game @highlight Joint anti-terror operations and new trade policies would help, they say	Pakistan

Following the first three races of the new Formula One season it is clear Mercedes will not have it all their own way as Ferrari appear poised to push them all the way.

Pope Francis delivered the formula for the canonization of the Albanian-born nun -- known as the "saint of the gutters" -- before huge crowds of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City on Sunday morning. Applause broke out before he completed the formula of canonization, in which he declared "Blessed Teresa of Calcutta to be a saint."

But Tuesday, Putin sent a letter to the speaker of the upper house seeking to cancel the resolution. One lawmaker voted against revoking the powers Wednesday, with 153 in favor.

"All but one gunshot wound were to the lower extremities," Graham said. "The one fatal wound was to the head." Police Chief Sam Dotson said the killing happened Wednesday evening when a suspect shot a pistol three times at the St. Louis officer, who was off-duty but wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company.

Presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi holds up the "V" sign after casting his vote on Friday. A painter and architect who withdrew from the political front for two decades, Moussavi has emerged with a platter of promises. He has said he wants to reform Iran into a global communicator that embraces freedom of speech. He's also taken an usual step in politics in Iran by relying heavily on his wife, a college professor.

After all, there was Stephen Colbert, the man who -- with Jon Stewart -- put "fake news" on the map long before the Trump Administration was a twinkle in Vladimir Putin's eye. And there were Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon, accepting golden trophies for their cutting and hilarious depictions of President Trump and his chief 2016 campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, on "Saturday Night Live."

question: Wherever you decide to deploy a system like @placeholder, you are by default making a decision about somewhere else you won't be able to deploy one. context: (CNN) In President Donald Trump's book "The Art of the Deal," he writes about how important it is to know one's market, to study hard. He wrote that he likes to gather as many disparate opinions and views about a potential real estate deal as he can before making any final decisions about how it will affect a given area or neighborhood.

The Kazakh warrior is on the brink of becoming boxing's next superstar after causing a trail of destruction. In his 32-fight career, Golovkin has 29 knockouts, meaning his 90.6 per cent KO rate is the highest in the history of the middleweight division. Golovkin's next opponent will be Willie Monroe Jnr on May 16 in Inglewood, California - just three months after his latest brutal KO, of Britain's Martin Murray in Monaco.

Both men have turned voter disaffection into electoral triumph. Farage did so in the now infamous Brexit -- taking the UK out of the EU; Trump in winning the US presidency. Both men identified the other as a brother in arms along the way. So much so that at one recent rally, Trump told his supporters: "We are going to do something so special. It will be so special.

ISIS on its media affiliates claimed that Abu-Zakariya al-Britani -- a British citizen who initially went by Ronald Fiddler and later took the name Jamal Udeen al-Harith -- detonated a car bomb at an Iraqi army base southwest of Mosul this week.

question: This means you have a better chance of hitting a curveball by realising that our brains, like @placeholder, can lead us to 'see' changes in speed or direction that don't actually occur. context: The average curveball travels at 75mph (120km/h) in a smooth arc. While there's no sudden change in motion throughout its journey, this isn't what the batter sees as it nears the home plate. Instead, the ball creates an optical illusion that tricks the mind into thinking there is a 'break' in movement. And scientists say knowing this, could help the mind counteract the effect.

Scorching heat, gale-force winds, suicidal taxi drivers and an architectural swirl of ostentatious skyscrapers, Islamic elegance and old Soviet apartment blocks served perfectly to encapsulate the fiery forces which continue to tug this city between east and west.

(The one inaccuracy is that the tax cut, while large, would not be the "biggest" ever. There have been a number of bigger tax cuts under presidents, from Lyndon Johnson to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama.) Still, Trump is correct that the GOP Senate passed this budget Thursday to pave the way for massive tax cuts.

"It was a national shame, a disgrace that should have never happened. That's why here today, we resolve that it will not happen again."

In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in Moscow, Lavrov said it was "flattering" that American officials think Russia is meddling in the election, but the accusations were baseless. The US last week accused Russia of being behind a series of email hacks, including communications from the Democratic National Committee.

question: New concerns have also surfaced over reports that Russia and @placeholder are discussing an oil-for-goods deal, which could violate the terms of the interim agreement, circumvent sanctions and derail the fate of the talks. context: Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will defend his foreign policy Wednesday in a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and lay out an interventionist, but not over-reaching plan, White House officials say. The speech comes amid stinging criticism of the President's foreign policy following a trip to Asia last month. Obama, who has carefully avoided mentioning any sort of military confrontation in his responses to the challenges in Syria and Ukraine, hit back at his critics, saying his goal is to avoid costly "errors" on the world stage.

question: In 2014, Le Pen's father secured about €2 million in campaign financing with the help of a @placeholder oligarch for the elections that year. context: (CNN) On one hand, Donald Trump's praise of France's far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who appears to have received enough votes in Sunday's election to advance to the May 7 runoff, is not surprising. Le Pen, like Trump, ran a campaign that was anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and traded on white supremacist themes. (It's no coincidence that former Klan leader David Duke has publicly praised both Le Pen and Trump.) On the other hand, you would think Trump would be hesitant to publicly praise a candidate like Le Pen, an avid supporter of Vladimir Putin, particularly given that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said just two weeks ago that US-Russian relations had reached an all time low. @highlight Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have praised Marine Le Pen, the pro-Putin French presidential candidate @highlight Dean Obeidallah: Despite recent drama between Trump and Vladimir Putin, they and Le Pen are natural allies	Russian

Just a few years ago, CNN was invited to the same room to interview Park Geun-hye -- now the first South Korean president to be impeached. Today, we're here to meet her successor, President Moon Jae-in. In stark contrast to Park, who was perceived as "disconnected," Moon is known as the approachable and humble president.

The latest crisis began when federal police took former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in for questioning as part of a long-running corruption investigation. A few days later, his handpicked successor and protege, President Dilma Rousseff, named him chief of staff, a move that largely protects him from prosecution. This prompted massive street protests.

Kipchoge, 32, joined fellow world-class runners Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia and Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea in Nike's Breaking2 project, an attempt to cover the 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers) of a marathon in under two hours. Guided by a platoon of pacing runners, the three started together, but Kipchoge -- the 2016 Olympic champion and the 2016 London Marathon winner -- came closest in the end.

It was based on their assumption that Sweat was traveling with fellow fugitive Richard Matt, who was shot and killed by law enforcement nearby on Friday afternoon.

"Say her name!" one man shouted. The crowd roared back: "Charleena!" They marched through downtown yelling, "Hey, hey, ho, ho. Racism has got to go." Police say two officers opened fire after Lyles, 30, confronted them with two knives on Sunday. Her family and community members blasted their decision to use deadly force on the mother of four and questioned why other alternatives weren't used. "We continue to have black men and women being shot and killed by police," Michelle Sarju who attended the march told CNN affiliate KOMO. "At some point, we have to do police reform.

The announcement also follows the sale of more shares in Lloyds Banking Group last night, which took the Government’s holding in the lender down to just under 18 per cent.

The meetings, led by the US Special Representative for North Korea Policy Joseph Yun and reported on by CNN, have focused on Americans detained in North Korea, but have also touched on the relationship between the two countries. The US has been in contact with North Korea since at least February at an official level and there have been lower-level talks between Americans -- though none who represent the US government -- and North Korean officials. @highlight Contacts between Pyongyang and the US picked up again after Trump took office @highlight They follow a deep freeze between North Korea and the Obama administration	Americans

question: @placeholder-Coble: Cancer's a very isolating experience, so the wonderful thing about a retreat week is that everybody "gets it." context: Ocean City, Maryland (CNN) Jeanine Patten-Coble was blindsided by her breast cancer diagnosis eight years ago. "When the cancer bomb goes off in your house, it's devastating," she said. At 39, a life-threatening disease had never been on her radar. Stunned, she asked her doctor if she could still leave for her family vacation the next day. He agreed. "We had so much fun that week. We got a chance to rest and relax," Patten-Coble said. "I felt like a mom; I didn't feel like a cancer patient." During the trip, she had to break the news to her young son. To clear her head and prepare herself, she went for a run.

question: The @placeholder coast may also experience flooding and beach erosion as well as a storm surge. context: (CNN) The East Coast braced for high winds and treacherous surf from Hurricane Maria, which was still churning in the Atlantic days after the storm caused widespread devastation in the Caribbean. Maria will weaken to a tropical storm by Tuesday night, according to the National Hurricane Center. The dangerous core of the storm is expected to move well east of the southeast coast of the United States during the next day or so. Maria maintained Category 1 status, with sustained winds of 80 mph on Monday, forecasters said. "The good news is it is expected to stay weak, we don't expect any more intensification as it goes north," said CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar. "Then as it starts to veer out toward the east it's going to come into blocking mechanisms. This is good news. This prevents it from getting too close to the US to actually have a direct landfall." @highlight Current forecasts show Maria brushing North Carolina's coast late Tuesday into Wednesday morning @highlight Maria has maintained Category 1 status, with sustained winds of 80 mph	North Carolina

question: A universal @placeholder, the authors say, will be an inevitable outcome of a world that's increasingly being driven by technology. context: (CNN) -- Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has been thinking a lot about our digital future. Maybe that's not a big surprise for a man whose company has played a major role in shaping our 21st-century lives, from how we find information to how we use our phones. It's that role, perhaps, that has made Schmidt's new book, "The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business," so widely anticipated. The book, out Tuesday, is co-written with Jared Cohen, a former U.S. State Department terrorism adviser who now heads up Google Ideas, the company's think tank.

Wexler said that it could have been one of the greatest scandals in the history of the FBI - but now we may never know what happened.

Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes previously told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an exclusive interview that the Zika test, though it's not one that would be as common as a test to check general health, was a priority for the company because it was a "really important area of blood work."

That was by design. The top-secret program they joined wouldn't even be declassified until more than two decades later -- long after the secret Navajo code language had played a vital role in the American war effort. All they knew at the time was that the Marines were recruiting and needed help from the Navajo people. "So we all volunteered.

That is, unless the Obama administration itself was only joking when it promised to push for greater transparency and accountability at the United Nations. In a 50-page "end-of-mission" report, the widely respected former auditor of Sweden -- who was originally brought in to help the UN fix the spectacular accountability gap exposed during the excruciatingly painful "oil-for-food" scandal -- paints a detailed, well-documented tableau of Ban's managerial incompetence. @highlight Michael Soussan: Leaked report shows Ban Ki-moon not managing UN staff effectively @highlight He says US, other democracies should push to replace Ban when his term is up @highlight The UN Secretariat is in danger of becoming irrelevant, the report says	UN

question: Sexton’s conversion made it 19-3 after 53 minutes and it was impossible to see a way back for @placeholder. context: England's hopes of landing their first Grand Slam of Stuart Lancaster’s reign have been dashed again as Ireland deservedly earned a victory that leaves them red-hot favourites to retain their Six Nations title. Lancaster’s men rarely threatened reproduce the form that saw them open the Championship with wins over Wales and Italy as Robbie Henshaw’s second-half try, allied to 14 points from the boot of Jonny Sexton, inflicted a demoralising defeat on the visitors. England travelled across the Irish Sea with high hopes of making it three wins from three but were persistently penalised at the breakdown by referee Craig Joubert as they struggled to gain a foothold in the match. @highlight Jonny Sexton led the way for Ireland with four penalties and Robbie Henshaw scored a try @highlight The victory for Ireland leaves them in the strongest position to win the Six Nations with two games remaining @highlight England hopes of winning the competition are now out of their hands	England
question: By road enter through @placeholder and Djibouti, although it's cheaper to fly than drive. context: With mile upon mile of untouched golden beaches, corals reefs ripe for divers, ancient artifacts and a population desperate to impress. Somaliland is a country with plenty to offer tourists and it is actively encouraging visitors. But unfortunately, the much-desired tourists are not flocking to the east African outpost, neighbouring Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia. For starters, the country doesn't exist at all according to the international community, which recognises it only as part of Somalia, the troubled nation where piracy is rife and terrorist organisation Al-Shabaab is based.

question: @placeholder have insisted that their decision was based solely on the official rules before confirming that it would be happy to make an exception and continue treating Mr Baldwin. context: A British army double amputee was told that he wouldn't be able to receive anymore NHS treatment because he had travelled to Australia for a new surgical procedure. Jay Baldwin lost both of his legs in a bomb blast whilst fighting for his country in Afghanistan. The former sergeant was informed by staff at the Sussex rehabilitation centre that his treatment would be stopped because he had osseointegration surgery, not available on the NHS. Recalling the day he was informed the shocking news, Jay said: 'They said to me, 'Look, under the NHS we can't deal with you, we can't touch you at all,' @highlight Jay Baldwin was told by hospital staff that he could no longer receive NHS treatment following his operation @highlight He lost both of his legs whilst fighting for his country in Afghanistan @highlight Former army sergeant travelled to Australia for osseointegration surgery	NHS
question: A veritable firestorm is engulfing the Middle East, and Israel's @placeholder is just a short commute from its flash points. context: (CNN) -- Like Americans, Israelis begin their day by watching one of several television news shows. These highlight the pressing issues facing the country. But Israel, of course, is not just any country, but a contested and often controversial Jewish state situated in the epicenter of an overwhelmingly Muslim and constantly roiling Middle East. One would expect, then, to hear commentators on these shows discussing the latest glitch in the peace talks with the Palestinians, the recent terrorist bombing just beyond Israel's southern border with Egypt, or the revelation of more advanced rockets in the arsenal of Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the topic on Israel's leading morning show this week was none of these. The top issue, rather, was the percentage of Tel Aviv streets named for women. @highlight Michael Oren: Israel sits in a region bristling with conflict and hostile to its presence @highlight He says one topic stirring attention is number of streets named for women in Tel Aviv @highlight Israelis have always lived with the threat of war, and put it in perspective, he says @highlight Support for a two-state solution is strong in Israel today, he says	Tel Aviv
question: That's when @placeholder, who "never really used social media," had an idea: Make a Facebook video go viral. context: (CNN) A Colorado man used a heartfelt Facebook video to find his first responders after collapsing at a half-marathon in Florida. Amy Smythe, 39, of Newark, Delaware, could not stop thinking about the man who had collapsed nearby, mere feet from the finish line of the Key West Half Marathon last week. She had just set a personal record, beating her previous best by 20 minutes. "It was fate that I had finished early," she said. Bill Amirault, 44, of Colorado Springs went into cardiac arrest as he was rounding the final corner of the race.

Moore had refused to concede in the wake of the election result, and on Wednesday, he had set off a new swirl of controversy by filing an election complaint alleging voter fraud may have occurred, calling for a delay in the certification of the results that declared Jones officially the winner and asking for "a new special election." Alabama Circuit Judge Johnny Hardwick, however, denied Moore's attempt Thursday afternoon just as the certification was due to take place. @highlight Moore had refused to concede in the wake of the election result @highlight Merrill said his office had received more than 100 reports of voter fraud and had adjudicated more than 60	Moore

Sporting a claret and blue scarf in the press box at Villa Park, the former striker could not contain himself  as Christian Benteke fired home to make it 2-1 to the home side and was pictured leaping out of his seat. That lead wouldn't last though, as goals from QPR's Clint Hill and Charlie Austin turned the game on its head and made it 3-2 in the visitors' favour. @highlight TalkSPORT commentator Stan Collymore grew up supporting Aston Villa @highlight Covering Villa's 3-3 draw with QPR on Tuesday, he could not hide his delight when Christian Benteke scored @highlight He was pictured leaping from his seat in the Villa Park press box	Christian Benteke
question: "The time has come for Russia to do the right thing and admit its past transgressions for the benefit of @placeholder sport. context: (CNN) He's the eccentric doctor immortalized in the Netflix documentary Icarus, the whistleblower who exposed what a leading report called a doping "cover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale" in Russia. Now Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov is urging Russia to "do the right thing" and admit it. Russia has consistently denied the claims of Rodchenkov -- the former head of Moscow's anti-doping laboratory -- which formed the basis of the 2016 McLaren Report's conclusions that more than 1,000 athletes benefited from a systematic doping program between 2011 and 2015.

The Algerian forward was the catalyst for beating Premier League champions Chelsea 2-1 on Monday night, assisting Jamie Vardy’s opener before whipping in a delightful second for Claudio Ranieri’s side. Mahrez’s 11 league goals and seven assists have helped propel Leicester top of the table. The 24-year-old hopes his confidence can help his team maintain their magnificent start to the season. ‘I don't know if anyone can stop me, but I need to do my best for the team," Mahrez told Sky Sports after being awarded ‘Man of the match’ at the King Power. @highlight Leicester surged back top of the Premier League after beating Chelsea @highlight Riyhad Mahrez scored his 11th goal of the season on Monday @highlight The Algerian also provided a stunning assist for Jamie Vardy's opener @highlight Claudio Ranieri warns Premier League big boys off of his star players	Mahrez

But Short's knee buckled. "I just got shot, I can't run," she cried out. The shooter firing from the window of a room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip had shot her in the leg. It hurt. Blood gushed from the wound.

question: Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, @placeholder's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market. context: (CNN) -- Verizon pulled a rabbit out of its corporate hat earlier this month. The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway. Verizon purchased these rights from Comcast and Time Warner, two large cable-TV companies, and the smaller Bright House Networks. Sound familiar? AT&T made a similarly surprising move in March, declaring its intention to buy T-Mobile, in large part to get access to T-Mobile's underused spectrum. The AT&T deal drew the wrath of the Justice Department and the FCC. Indeed, it appears the current incarnation of the AT&T proposed merger is dying a slow death. U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle agreed on Monday to a request from both sides to delay the merger hearing, and asked AT&T to supply information on whether it will pursue a different deal with T-Mobile. @highlight Writers: Verizon, AT&T deals are attempts to get more spectrum for wireless services @highlight Spectrum, or bandwidth, is getting scarce because it is badly used, they maintain @highlight Washington could sell spectrum for billions of dollars, they say, still minimize monopolies @highlight Writers: Until then, regulators should look more kindly on telecom mergers	Verizon

question: We have £165 million (£260 million) in the bank, but in some ways we would prefer to have £80 million in the bank and @placeholder on the pitch." context: (CNN) -- Manchester United's financial state was thrown into stark relief on Thursday after the English club's American owners revealed a record loss of $137 million despite making an unprecedented operating profit of $160 million. The disparity of figures is largely caused by interest payments of $67 million and a one-off cost of $107 million relating to the Premier League outfit's bond scheme, launched in January to help restructure the debts accrued by the Glazer family in purchasing the 18-time English champions in 2005. The club produced a record turnover of $455 million for the year ended June 2010, more than double that of local rivals Manchester City, but suffered a big swing from last year's profit of $77 million -- which was largely due to the world-record $130 million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid. @highlight Man Utd's owners make record loss of $137 million despite operating profit of $160 million @highlight Glazer family's debts incurred in buying English club in 2005 largely to blame @highlight The 18-time English champions' turnover for year ended June 2010 was $455 million @highlight United's wage bill is only 46 percent of turnover, the lowest ratio in Premier League	Cristiano Ronaldo

Carson, new Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a handful of other federal officials managing disaster response were visiting the island for a one-day trip. "You know, interestingly enough from the reports that I had gotten, I had no idea that we had moved this far along," Carson said, speaking to staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Joint Field Operations Center near San Juan. @highlight It was Carson and Nielsen's first trips to the island as secretaries @highlight Recovery has been slow since the September hurricane	San Juan

Three decades after these happy photos were taken she was murdered in cold blood - a crime for which her University of California pal Durst has now been charged. These never-before-seen student photos of Susan obtained exclusively by Daily Mail Online were taken at UCLA, where the pair met.

Aid agencies call it "the berm" -- essentially a rocky, largely uninhabitable no-man's land on Jordan's northeastern frontier with Syria. As Jordan tightened border controls late last year and restricted access, Syrian refugees, mostly from the besieged cities of Homs and Aleppo began accumulating in a makeshift settlement in this remote region -- known as Rukban.

question: While Washington had 101 delegates up for grabs, and both candidates spent a significant amount of time there, @placeholder and Alaska were relatively small prizes -- with just 25 and 16 delegates at stake respectively. context: (CNN) Saturday was a big day for Bernie Sanders' quest for the Democratic presidential nomination as he swept to resounding victories in the caucus states of Hawaii, Washington and Alaska. But the delegate math is still in Hillary Clinton's favor. "We knew things were going to improve as we headed West," Sanders said at a jubilant rally before 8,000 people in Madison, Wisconsin -- a state that will hold the next major contest in 10 days. "We have a path toward victory." Takeaways from Western Saturday Clinton built up her delegate lead on the back of a strong run in the South, and Sanders argued Saturday his campaign always knew those states would be tough. In Madison, he said the map now offers more opportunities for his campaign as the contest progressed, largely because his wins are being powered by huge turnout among younger voters. @highlight Sanders hopes wins Saturday will help build momentum for larger states later on @highlight Clinton has a commanding overall lead in delegates	Hawaii

A new amnesty law introduced by Putin allowed two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot to leave prison on Monday, two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of the President. In addition, 30 Greenpeace demonstrators could go free under the amnesty law passed by Russian lawmakers last week that could affect 25,000 prisoners.

The news, which came late Friday evening, was widely expected in the West Wing, which has now seen high-profile departures on successive Fridays for several weeks. Gorka was one of Trump's most prominent cheerleaders, frequently hitting the airwaves to defend the President's policies and public statements. But his role outside of television hits was unclear.

Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas introduced an Article of Impeachment against Trump Wednesday, arguing that Trump's alleged attempts to influence former FBI Director James Comey and Comey's subsequent firing equal high crimes and misdemeanors, one of the bars for impeachment. @highlight A long way to go before comparing Mueller and Starr or Trump and Clinton @highlight Only two Democrats are officially using the word at this point	Mueller

Everyone who knows him says he is wise beyond his 17 years, that he is destined to lead others in his restive homeland of Iraq. He set foot on U.S. soil for the first time in June, part of a group of young Iraqis chosen for a State Department-sponsored leadership program. But the hopes in his heart vanished as fast as they had blossomed.

question: At long last, @placeholder has found a manager prepared to go the extra mile to get the very best out of a player. context: You have to feel for Andy Carroll. In terms of matches missed, his injuries have bitten a huge three-season chunk out of his career so far. In real time, he’s missed nearly two-and-a-half years. He’s still only 26. He’s scored in an FA Cup final, he powered in a wonderful header at a major tournament for England, and in his first full season in the Premier League at the age of 21, he bagged 11 goals in 19 appearances for Newcastle. At times he looked clunky and clumsy at Liverpool but he still had a few moments that suggested there was a special player in there: a brace against Manchester City in a 3-0 win, a semi-final winner against Everton at Wembley, and a 30-minute substitute appearance in the FA Cup final that showcased how brilliant he can be. @highlight Andy Carroll has lost nearly three years of his career to injury problems @highlight Striker has been put on a tailored training programme at Slaven Bilic @highlight West Ham manager could be set to reap rewards if Carroll finds form @highlight He scored their winner in Saturday's 2-1 victory over Chelsea @highlight Bilic is the first manager in a while to recognise problems with Carroll	Andy Carroll

The 22-year-old signed for Juventus from Real Madrid last year and helped knock his former employers out of the Champions League by scoring a crucial goal at the Bernabeu. Morata, who could potentially move back to Spain as Real have a buy-back clause, reiterated how important playing in Serie A has been to him.

The slinky, long-necked blonde, who was scouted by her mother's agency at the tender age of 15, leads a cast of 12 young British actors, musicians and models, marking the first Burberry campaign for the majority of the cast. Ella looks right at home posing alongside the likes of Cara Delevingne's best friend, Clara Paget, and BRIT award-winning musician Tom Odell. And so she should, given her impressive lineage.

Ms Sturgeon said she was criticised over her appearance far more than male politicians and claimed the attacks were often 'hideous and cruel'. The SNP leader made the remarks during an interview for next month's issue of Vogue, in which she is pictured in a sophisticated outfit designed in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, who was named Britain's most powerful woman by the magazine this summer, admitted that former Labour leader Ed Miliband had also suffered because of his image. @highlight Scotland's First Minister says she was 'inured' to criticism of her looks but complained that it was often 'vicious' @highlight But the SNP leader also criticised the constant scrutiny of her appearance which she said male politicians escaped @highlight She said she had been 'held back' because she was a woman, despite being crowned UK's most powerful woman	Sturgeon

question: "And @placeholder has been effective at it, they can put their votes together, and we need to do that from time to time, (though) we need to pick our fights carefully." context: Washington (CNN) As year-end funding decisions loom, a familiar pattern is repeating, with House conservative Republicans playing hardball to pull their colleagues to the right. And moderates are increasingly tiring of it -- especially after Tuesday's repudiation of a candidate seen as emblematic of the GOP's right flank in the Alabama special election. Government funding and efforts to abolish Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a popular program for young undocumented immigrants, have some moderates increasingly wondering: Why can't we play hardball, too? Moderate Republicans and House members in districts that are either generally competitive or which Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 presidential election are starting to grow frustrated with the effectiveness of groups like the House Freedom Caucus in influencing legislation, often by withholding their votes as a bloc until demands are met. @highlight Some moderates are increasingly wondering: Why can't we play hardball, too? @highlight The effectiveness of the House Freedom Caucus is a source of frustration for vulnerable members	House Freedom Caucus

Gerrard was on the substitutes' bench until half-time at Anfield on Sunday, and was sent off after just 38 seconds of coming on for stamping on Ander Herrera. Scholes feels it could have been a different game had Gerrard started, and that being a substitute only added to his frustration leading up to his red card.

question: Intelligence heads briefed @placeholder on Russian hacking and the dossier, CNN reported, and Trump again declined to say clearly that Russia was behind the election-related hacks context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is known for his blunt talk -- on everything ranging from trade to immigration and the fight against ISIS. But throughout the 2016 campaign, and now in the White House, there's one topic that he's been less forthcoming about -- Russia's role interfering in the US election. He's answered questions about attempts to hack the 2016 election many different ways throughout the campaign and since ascending to the presidency -- even speculating during a debate last year that it "could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." The unanimous assessment of the US intelligence community is clear: Russia orchestrated a series of hacks and cyberattacks to meddle in the 2016 election and help Trump beat Hillary Clinton. Intelligence agencies have not concluded that Russian efforts made a difference in the election result. @highlight Spicer said Tuesday he hasn't talked to Trump about the hacking @highlight US intelligence agencies agree Russia is to blame	Donald Trump

Even rapper T.I., who has a role in the series as a slave named "Cyrus," told the Huffington Post that he was initially leery. "I will admit that I was one of the ones to say, 'Man, I don't know if that needs to be remade,'" he said.

Facing off at long tables on opposite sides of the room during a two-hour panel, raw emotions on both sides exploded as operatives debated how Trump had won the divisive campaign. There were periods of calm, substantive discussion about data, metrics and target states, but many moments where tempers flared, with acrimony mirroring the 2016 race. Advisers on the opposing sides shouted over each other. Accusations of lying flew between them. There was lots of eye-rolling on both sides. Operatives snapped at one another for interrupting, as an air of mutual contempt settled within the room.

Twelve of the committee's 33 members voted to pull Avandia off the market altogether, while only three supported leaving it on the market with its current labeling. Seven voted to add stiffer warnings to the current label, and 10 wanted both stiffer language and restrictions on its use.

question: My attitude toward Syria and @placeholder has changed very much." context: (CNN) President Donald Trump's decision to authorize a missile strike against a Syrian air base Thursday night signals a major break not only with the Obama administration but also with past statements made by the President himself. Fifty Tomahawk missiles were fired at the air base from which the chemical attacks against Syrian civilians were launched earlier this week and left more than 70 people dead. "It is in the vital national security interests of America to prevent and deter the the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons," Trump said in a statement from his Mar-a-Lago estate. The decision to use military force against Syria marks a remarkable reversal for Trump. In 2013, he was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's contemplation of strikes in Syria following President Bashar al-Assad's initial use of chemical weapons against his own people.

Jonny Howson's close-range, second-half header secured victory on Saturday after the manager had reorganised his team into a more defensive shape to attack Swansea on the counter. Norwich allowed their visitors the majority of the possession - as Arsenal had done in their 3-0 away victory a week previous - to successfully end of a run of six games without a win, but Neil also acknowledged that such negativity represented a risk in front of a home crowd when the Canaries were not hosting a top-four team. @highlight Norwich ended Premier League losing streak with 1-0 win over Swansea @highlight Alex Neil admits using Arsenal's counter attacking blueprint for victory @highlight Canaries boss knows he cannot use negative tactics in every game	Arsenal

Facebook agreed last week to turn the ads over to the House and Senate intelligence committees. Warner's burning question involves not just the content of the ads but how they were deployed.

question: @placeholder surely won't be taking his group rivals lightly: Stan Wawrinka has beaten Murray in three of their past four meetings, with Cilic and Kei Nishikori getting the better of Murray in August and September, respectively. context: (CNN) Andy Murray this week ended Novak Djokovic's two-year reign atop the rankings in men's tennis but the Scot's stay at No. 1 could be a short one -- and he knows it. "I might as well try and enjoy it because I could lose it at the tour finals and never be there again," Murray told reporters, referring to the year-end championships, which start Sunday in London. Indeed, Djokovic can regain the top position on Nov. 21 and finish the season as No. 1 for the third straight time with a strong showing at the World Tour Finals. The 29-year-old has certainly fared well at the O2 Arena, winning a record four consecutive titles and if he makes it five in a row while winning at least two of his round-robin matches, Djokovic is guaranteed to seize back the No. 1 ranking from Murray. @highlight World Tour Finals start Sunday in London @highlight Djokovic can return to No. 1 @highlight Murray has never reached the final at the event @highlight Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal absent	Andy Murray
question: @placeholder himself did little to assuage concerns about his administration's approach to Russia during a press conference Thursday, held in a week during which questions over his aide's ties to Russia dominated the headlines. context: Moscow (CNN) Outspoken Russian Senator Alexey Pushkov claimed Friday on Twitter that US President Donald Trump and senior figures in his administration are not on the same page on Russia. The tweets from Pushkov, chairman of the Information Policy Committee in Russia's upper house of parliament, came a day after US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson commented on Russia while attending summits in Europe. Pushkov tweeted early Friday: "Trump hopes to make a deal with Russia. Mattis thinks (in vain) that he can put pressure 'from a position of strength'. Tillerson is playing a 2nd Kerry.

question: @placeholder struck from a tight angle in the 88th minute to earn his West Ham side all three points against Sunderland context: Well, they want continuity and stability at Sunderland. It was perhaps fitting, then, that Dick Advocaat marked his first game in charge with a defeat, a fourth in six matches to leave the Black Cats perilously perched one point above the drop zone. Not even the re-introduction of top goalscorer Adam Johnson – on as a second-half substitute after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl – could inspire a side who have won just once in 2015. Gus Poyet paid for that run with his job this week, but Advocaat must repair those ruins if his own CV is not to be stained with a first relegation in 28 years in the dugout. @highlight Diafra Sakho scores late winner as West Ham win for the first time since January 18 @highlight Senegalese striker's goal ended a three-game losing streak for Sam Allardyce's side @highlight Dick Advocaat took charge of Sunderland for the first time since taking over from Gus Poyet @highlight Adam Johnson returned to the Sunderland side after the club lifted his suspension	Diafra Sakho

And Tara, of course, the 60-year-old pachyderm and second great love of his life after Ayesha. At this very moment, in the violet-tinged gloaming, Tara is attempting to eat the wreath of flowers hanging from her mighty neck. Mark’s ashes came with Annabel, via plane and car.

question: But @placeholder' new approach to immigration will not only increase the number of federal cases against undocumented immigrants -- it also raises the prospect of using more privately owned prisons to detain people. context: Washington (CNN) When Jeff Sessions was sworn in as the 84th attorney general in February, President Donald Trump foreshadowed that the Justice Department was at a turning point. "A new era of justice begins. And it begins right now," Trump said. "This is a new era. This is the Trump era," Sessions told border patrol agents on Tuesday, echoing a similar recognition that change is afoot. In just over two months, Sessions has proved to be a central figure in effectuating Trump's vision for America in tangible ways on immigration, crime, police reform and civil rights. And while the White House searches for new messaging to frame what Trump has accomplished in the first 100 days in office, Sessions has single-handedly managed to make several significant domestic policy changes -- from pressing pause on implementing police reforms to withdrawing Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. @highlight "We have a crime problem," Sessions said at his swearing-in ceremony @highlight "This is a new era.

question: While the woman shouted anti-@placeholder slurs, Singh asked the audience, "What do we believe in?" context: (CNN) "When is your Shariah going to end? ... We know you are in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood!" an irate white woman screamed in the face of a brown-skinned politician at his town hall meeting on Wednesday night. Sixteen years after 9/11, bigoted remarks like these against Muslims -- or even those perceived to be Muslim -- have become disturbingly commonplace. And our President, who during his campaign openly attacked Muslims with false claims -- that "thousands" of Muslim Americans cheered in New Jersey on 9/11, for example -- isn't helping matters. In the case of this incident, the politician who was subject to this barrage of anti-Muslim comments, Jagmeet Singh, is not even Muslim. Singh, who is running to be the head of the New Democratic Party, one of Canada's political parties, could've simply told the heckler, "I'm not a Muslim. I'm a Sikh." But he didn't. Nor did he respond by screaming at the heckler or publicly dismissing her as a bigot. @highlight Dean Obeidallah: Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh taught us an important lesson about love this past week @highlight In the face of hate, he chose kindness and acceptance -- an approach all of us could benefit from, Obeidallah writes	Muslim

The 16-year-old from Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, used school computers to look up Isis killer Jihadi John and a chemical recipe. She intended to hack into the White House and became obsessed with suicide bombings after becoming radicalised online, it was said. The girl was arrested by anti-terror police in April and pleaded guilty to two offences of downloading terrorist information at an earlier hearing.

After enduring the routine — in which celebrities read hostile Twitter comments about themselves — Obama told Kimmel: 'You should see what the Senate says about me.' The president also joked about the perks and restrictions he faces, revealing that he's not allowed to use cellphones that have recorders in them. (Hence his ever-present BlackBerry.)

Tony Romo might be out for good with the same injury that sidelined him for seven games. Newton got a big boost from a defense that returned two of Romo's three interceptions for touchdowns, and the Panthers ran their NFL-best winning streak to 15 regular-season games with a 33-14 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday. Romo injured the same left collarbone that sidelined him for all seven games of a losing streak that damaged the playoff hopes for the defending NFC East champion Cowboys (3-8). The 35-year-old with a surgically repaired back said he would have to wait for more test results before knowing if he broke the collarbone again.

Key defense witness Stuart GraBois recounted how, once ruling out family members as suspects, he located Jose Ramos in prison in the late 1980s after learning the Ramos had ties to a woman who was once used by the family to walk Etan home from school during a bus driver strike.

National Bar Association officials said that Officer Clarence Habersham, 37, who was the second policeman to arrive at the dead man's body after shooter Michael Slager, should be fired and prosecuted for filing a false report.

question: Lowen responded to the allegations with an exclusive statement to @placeholder: context: (EW.com) -- Critics everywhere have hailed "Bully" as an important, engaging documentary. EW's Owen Gleiberman calls it "sensitive and eye-opening"; the film has also earned a near-perfect 93 percent "Fresh" rating from the reviews aggregated by Rotten Tomatoes. But in an article posted late last week, Slate's Emily Bazelon alleged that some crucial parts of "Bully" are "utterly one-sided" and "factually questionable." Her piece focused on Tyler Long, one of the doc's featured subjects; when he was just 17, Long took his own life, apparently because he was bullied by his classmates. But according to Bazelon, that isn't the whole story. She wrote that Tyler also suffered from ADHD, bipolar disorder, and Asperger's syndrome; additionally, his girlfriend broke up with him a few weeks before his suicide. It seems likely that these factors contributed to Tyler's decision to commit suicide, Bazelon wrote. She asserted that by not mentioning them -- and by possibly exaggerating the treatment Tyler received in school â€” director Lee Hirsch and producer Cynthia Lowen oversimplified and distorted the facts to create a smoother narrative. @highlight Slate's Emily Bazelon alleged that some crucial parts of "Bully" are "utterly one-sided" @highlight "We are deeply disappointed by the author's neglect to gain a clear picture," a "Bully" producer said @highlight Slate deputy editor said, "The movie includes no mention of the mental health issues Tyler faced"	EW

This is what it’s like to watch England wake up to the realities of the modern game. Shout it from the rooftops: the penny has dropped. And how. Rightly ridiculed at the World Cup, England outplayed New Zealand so comprehensively that the record books could hardly keep up. Less than four months ago, the New Zealanders were humiliating Eoin Morgan’s team in Wellington, where England cemented their status as the tournament’s laughing-stock. Now, amid talk of a new era that could have been made to look premature, and even downright foolish, England thrashed 408 for nine after being put in to bat by Brendon McCullum, then romped to victory by a scarcely believable 210 runs.

Murray was a 2-0 novice when he was part of Ricky Hatton's entourage which travelled to Sin City for the Hitman's memorable fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr in December 2008. He says the trip left him with a burning desire to one day box beneath the lights in the fight capital – but teenage misdemeanours have so far prevented him from ever competing in America, let alone Vegas.

Wednesday marks the 15th anniversary of Viagra's FDA approval in the United States. Viagra currently holds 45% of the sexual dysfunction market share, with competitor Cialis in close second, according to industry researcher IMS Health.

In a landslide win January 16, Tsai Ing-wen became Taiwan's first female president. Known as "Dr. Tsai" after completing a doctorate at the London School of Economics, she's also the first woman in Asia to be elected head of state without being part of a political legacy.

The Council of State, as it is known, is stipulated in the Venezuelan Constitution as the highest circle of advisers to the president, but has never actually been formed. Now in a battle with cancer, Chavez announced in January that it was time to constitute the council, and Wednesday named his appointments. Venezuelans and international observers alike are likely to scrutinize his choices for any signs of transition or succession should Chavez become incapacitated.

question: Kushner, who owns the Observer newspaper, may also be planning to build a pro-@placeholder media empire, reportedly talking with industry experts about what it would take to set up "Trump TV" or a similar platform. context: (CNN) The unceremonious removal of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as chairman of President-elect  Donald Trump's transition team won't be the last power play by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a young businessman who is shaping up as one of the central figures of the new administration. Kushner is far less well known than his wife, Ivanka Trump, but is clearly a force to be reckoned with, wielding tremendous influence behind the scenes. It's widely assumed in political circles that the sacking of Christie was at least partly an act of personal payback by Kushner. Back in 2004, then-U.S. Attorney Christie convicted Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, on a variety of charges including tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions. @highlight Donald Trump's son-in-law is shaping up as one of the central figures of the new administration, writes Errol Louis @highlight Jared Kushner could be powerful behind the scenes -- or could start a Trump media venture, Louis says	Donald Trump

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday he has seen no reason to fire Mueller thus far. "If there were good cause, I would act. If there were no good cause, I would not," Rosenstein told the committee. When asked by the committee's top Democrat, Rep.

Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva was joined on the field by his teammates this time. And many San Francisco 49ers knelt during the National Anthem, although some put their hands over their hearts. For the second consecutive Sunday, NFL players around the country and in London demonstrated in a variety of ways in response to President Trump's call for NFL owners to fire any "son of a bitch" who "disrespects our flag." Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick pioneered the protests last year when he took a knee during the anthem over what he said was social and racial injustice. @highlight Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch wears an "EVERYBODY VS.

"The citizens are outraged," Police Guild President Richard O'Neill said in an interview with CNN affiliate KIRO. "This does not happen in Seattle." Law enforcement officials are vowing to catch whoever is responsible for fatally shooting Officer Timothy Brenton and injuring a student officer as they sat in a parked patrol car.

The department's chief has requested a letter be sent to Lochte explaining the legal process related to the charges, according to a statement. The 12-time Olympic medalist  will now be summoned to Rio, according to Tourist Support Special Precinct officials. Lochte can opt to send a lawyer and does not need to appear in court. If convicted,  Lochte, 32, could face between one to six months in jail, although the judge could choose to levy a fine instead.

question: @placeholder is going into this marriage and this bizarre life with her eyes wide open. context: (CNN) -- For anyone around 30 or older, this week's royal engagement left one with an uneasy feeling of déjà vu. The photographs of Prince William and Kate Middleton, facing the flashing cameras of the world's press, were uncannily like those of William's parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, when they announced their plans to marry in 1981. The color of the dress, the pose, the linked arms, the looks -- they were almost identical. Kate was even wearing Diana's ring. The rapturous response from the media was a rerun of 1981, too -- the special supplements, the pages and pages of photographs, the speculation about who will design the dress, where they will honeymoon, where and how they first met, who their friends are and from whom their families are descended. @highlight Penny Junor: Déjà vu seeing Prince William and Kate Middleton announce engagement @highlight Unlike his parents, they've known each other for eight years, she observes @highlight Kate won't eclipse Prince William; she will compliment him, says Junor @highlight Junor: Charles-Diana marriage almost destroyed the monarchy; this could secure it	Kate

Captain Ronald Raldes gave Bolivia the lead after just four minutes before Martin Smedberg-Dalence increased the advantage shortly after. Enner Valencia missed the chance to make it 2-1 when the West Ham striker saw his penalty saved by goalkeeper Romel Quinonez.

question: Most likely, Putin's offer is pot stirring, an effort to create drama and news by demonstrating that @placeholder might be a peace mediator too. context: (CNN) Earlier this week, Russia's Vladimir Putin reportedly told Egypt's President Abdul Fattah Sisi  that he would be willing to host direct talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Moscow. Putin did speak to Netanyahu by phone Tuesday, and according to press reports, they did discuss the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Having pushed Russia into the middle of Syria's civil war with great effect last September, is Vladimir Putin now making a serious bid to become a Middle East peacemaker too?

question: Its southern entry was in the kitchen of a stucco @placeholder, Mexico, home, which had a garage attached big enough for tractor-trailer trucks. context: (CNN) -- The discovery of a "sophisticated" tunnel between a Mexican eat-in kitchen and two Southern California warehouses led authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border to arrest at least nine suspects and seize between 20 and 30 tons of marijuana. The Thanksgiving Day find followed an eight-month investigation and came about three weeks after authorities discovered a similar drug tunnel in another warehouse in the Otay Mesa area of San Diego. Between the two incidents, agents in the United States and Mexico seized roughly the equivalent of one marijuana cigarette for each of California's nearly 37 million residents, Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Ralph Partridge said Friday. @highlight NEW: Authorities describe a "very sophisticated" drug smuggling tunnel @highlight NEW: The tunnel was between a Tijuana eat-in kitchen and two San Diego warehouses @highlight NEW: Two people have been arrested in the United States, and at least seven in Mexico @highlight The tunnel is in the same area where agents found another this month	Tijuana
question: At the same time, she said @placeholder must improve the process for repatriation of migrants whose asylum applications had been rejected. context: (CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday described recent attacks in the country and across Europe as "shocking, depressing and terrifying," but she refused to back down from an open-door refugee policy that has attracted fierce criticism following recent assaults in the country. What are the rules for asylum seekers in Germany? Germany has been rattled by four attacks in the past two weeks, three of which authorities say have been carried out by asylum seekers or refugees inspired by Islamist extremism. The attacks have given way to mockery by some Germans as well as foreigners, who have dubbed the recent weeks of bloodshed on social media as #MerkelSommer, or even "Merkel's summer of slaughter." @highlight Merkel defends Germany's decision to accept 1 million refugees in 2015 @highlight Chancellor confirms ISIS can infiltrate the refugee route	German
question: As a recent CNN poll shows, white working-class and rural voters without a college degree are not the poorest of @placeholder, but they are the most pessimistic about their future prospects. context: (CNN) Since the presidential election, pundits have struggled to explain Donald Trump's upset win. Liberal columnists are united in shock that so many people voted for a man who inflamed racial, ethnic and religious tensions, insulted and mistreated women, and was deemed temperamentally unfit to be president, even by many of his supporters. Conservatives are divided. Conservative columnist Ross Douthat bemoans the "crude genius" that has brought America to the brink of "catastrophe." House Speaker Paul Ryan, who repeatedly denounced Trump during the campaign, now hails Trump's election as a sign that Americans have repudiated "failed liberal progressive policies." But the biggest debates swirl around Trump's appeal to working-class whites. And this appeal represents something far more complicated than either side admits. @highlight This was Hillary Clinton's election to lose, says Stephanie Coontz @highlight Democrat was unable to convince voters she was a defender of those left behind, Coontz says	America
question: She faces a particular challenge in appealing to @placeholder, however. context: Washington (CNN) As German Chancellor Angela Merkel prepared to bid President Barack Obama farewell in November, a reporter asked her to describe her sentiments about watching her American partner of eight years be replaced by Donald Trump. Standing in the German Chancellery on a drizzly Berlin afternoon, the notoriously restrained Merkel -- who became Obama's closest global friend only to see him replaced by a man who lambasted her on the campaign trail -- drew on her stolid pragmatism. "Out goes the president, and a new one comes in," she said. RELATED: Looming snowstorm delays Trump-Merkel meeting On Friday, Merkel presses ahead with the new, arriving in Washington for her first face-to-face encounter with Trump after months of preparation and one postponement due to snow.

The former Scottish First Minister said the SNP would hold all 'the power' if a Labour government needed its votes to survive – and even claimed the party's surge in support showed it had been the real winner of last year's independence referendum.

question: "@placeholder will do whatever it takes to protect the nation and people from any harm and I will leave it at that," he replied. context: (CNN) In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister expressed cautious optimism about the Iran nuclear deal and defended his country's execution of a Shiite cleric beloved by Iran. Tension between the countries has been pointed for a long time, but events lately -- including Nimr al-Nimr's execution -- have strained that relationship even further. "Nimr al-Nimr is a terrorist, not a religious scholar," Adel al-Jubeir told Blitzer. Speaking with some sarcasm, Jubeir added, "He's as much of a religious scholar as" Osama bin Laden was.

Rashid, 27, has yet to make his Test debut despite being included in the squad for all five Ashes Tests this summer and the three-match series in the West Indies earlier this year. But the Yorkshire leg-spinner is set to come into the team for the three-Test series against Pakistan that starts in the United Arab Emirates in October. That would see him team up with close friend Moeen and England, looking for an edge on the dry, turning surfaces of the Middle East, going with a leg-spin/off-spin partnership for the first time since Ian Salisbury and Robert Croft played against Pakistan in the 1996 Oval Test. @highlight Adil Rashid wants to show England coach Trevor Bayliss he's Test ready @highlight The Yorkshire leg-spinner is set to come into the team against Pakistan @highlight Rashid wants to develop a 'special' partnership with Moeen Ali	Yorkshire

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced the new deal in a TV address Saturday evening, saying it will build a "broader, deeper peace." A peace deal negotiated earlier this year with FARC rebels was unexpectedly defeated by Colombian voters in October.

What I mean is that if you Google 'honeymoon', 'paradise' or 'islands', you are bound to end up with the Maldives. Which brings with it a pressure all of its own. So here we are (me and my wife Lauren) on the first day of our honeymoon on the 150m by 200m Kandolhu Island, a comparative freckle atop the coral that is Ari Atoll to the west of the capital Male.

question: But @placeholder is changing, and gender has been an important barometer of that recently. context: (CNN) It's no secret that Donald Trump has a problem with women. So it's no surprise that he has started to attack his main rival for the American presidency, Hillary Clinton, on gender grounds, claiming that she lacks the strength, stamina, and credibility to run the country. Yet Trump should think twice before turning the looming showdown with Clinton into a referendum on whether women are fit to serve in America's highest office. If he takes this tack, he will be revealed for who he is: a weak candidate whose attitudes represent America's past, not its future. Trump may change his political positions frequently, refining his messaging to match his audience, but on women and gender issues he has remained remarkably stable over decades. In situations where he holds the reins of control, he can be pro-woman: he has rewarded and elevated high-performing female employees of his businesses, most of all his daughter Ivanka. @highlight Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Trump's new attempt to cast doubt on Clinton because of her gender shows his weakness @highlight She says he appears to fear women when he is not in charge of them, disparaging them in vulgar terms	America

The campaign group said the sculpture, which depicts an idyllic family beach scene interrupted by birds choking on plastic, was intended to highlight  what it claimed were failings by the company. In a report released on Monday, Greenpeace claimed that Coca-Cola -- the world's largest soft drinks company -- sells more than 100 billion plastic bottles every year.

Lionel Messi was the standout player as he scored twice and Barcelona dominated despite having Javier Mascherano sent off and playing the whole of the second half with ten men.

question: But only long enough for Mrs @placeholder to tell me not to enter their property again. context: For the athletes who represent the Nike Oregon Project it has been an uncomfortable few weeks to say the least. If they race they have to face questions, and not just about the doping allegations levelled against their coach, but more probing, personal inquiries. Which prescription drugs are they taking? How many therapeutic use exemptions (TUE) have they had? Angry Mo Farah had to issue a statement on Friday, not just to answer to the revelations about those two missed dope tests but to fill the vacuum created by Alberto Salazar’s silence. Salazar has promised proof of his innocence in response to the testimonies provided by 17 witnesses but so far nothing has materialised. It is nearly three weeks since he said he would expose his accusers as liars; nearly seven since he was first alerted by the BBC to the nature of their claims.

For 80 torturous minutes, Chile tied Uruguay in knots without being able to pin them down. But, as the prospect of penalties loomed large on the smoggy Santiago horizon, the Copa America hosts kept alive their hopes of finally winning major silverware. Uruguay were already down to 10 men when Mauricio Isla split the sides, Edinson Cavani receiving a second booking on 63 minutes for reacting to Gonzalo Jara after the Chilean appeared to stick a finger in the striker's bum.

"I had gestational diabetes for all three of my pregnancies. After my third, my A1C (blood sugar measurement) kept rising, and the doctor told me for the first time to be careful, because I was on track for diabetes." Pessah-Bloom knew that she had to shed her pregnancy pounds and get her blood sugar under control.

Speaking in Doral, Florida, Trump said, "I think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying." It's a position that Trump has stated several times before, saying he believes that the US is getting "ripped off" and that some NATO members are getting an unfair "free ride."

In his United Nations General Assembly debut, Trump applied the disruptive, bellicose, nationalistic persona that shattered US political norms and signaled an attempt to transform America's role in the world and the international system itself. "We must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror," Trump said in a survey of global geopolitics that paralleled his stark inaugural address eight months ago. It was dark, desolate, had a whiff of authoritarianism and pulsated with threats: None of his predecessors, for instance, stood in the well of the UN chamber and threatened to wipe a country -- in this case, North Korea -- off the face of the planet. It was the "axis of evil" on steroids as the President blasted "rogue states" and trumped George W.

The neighboring Central American countries are in a dispute over a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast, along the San Juan River, known as Calero Island. Costa Rica claims that Nicaraguan troops are camped out on the Costa Rican side of the border and it has asked the Organization of American States to intercede.

The intrigue now threatening to swamp Washington politics deepened on Monday when Trump's son-in-law and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner, offered to testify to senators about meetings with senior Kremlin officials -- including the head of a bank closely linked to President Vladimir Putin's government. And more revelations about a secret trip to the White House complex by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes spurred claims by Democrats that he was in league with the President's aides to subvert his own panel's investigation into Moscow's alleged election meddling and ties to the Trump campaign. @highlight On Monday, Kushner volunteered to testify @highlight Later in the week senators will weigh in	White House

question: Obama is on a week-long, three-stop foreign swing that has taken new urgency following @placeholder's election. context: Athens, Greece (CNN) President Barack Obama issued a warning Tuesday against "crude nationalism" in the wake of Donald Trump's victory, saying during a news conference on his final overseas trip that the President-elect had tapped into a "troubling" strain of rhetoric playing on Americans' fears of globalization to win the presidency. Speaking in Athens, Obama said he recognized an "anger and fear in the American population" over threats of mechanization and globalization, but that Republican officials didn't use facts when making their case about the US economy. "You've seen some of the rhetoric among Republican elected officials and activists and media. Some of it pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts, but being used effectively to mobilize people," Obama said at a news conference alongside Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.

question: @placeholder hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. context: Almost 20,000 years ago a woman was buried deep within a cave on the Iberian peninsula, stained in sparkling red paint and adorned in yellow flowers. Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El Mirón' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mirón Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago.

"After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations." Based in Texas, Lavabit attracted attention last month when NSA leaker Edward Snowden used an e-mail account with the service to invite human rights workers and lawyers to a press conference in the Moscow airport where he was then confined.

question: 'When the @placeholder took his hand off him, he had a bit smile on his face. context: Pope Francis made a thinly-veiled swipe at Donald Trump as the Pontiff defended Latino immigrants who came to America at 'great personal cost' during a moving speech to 40,000 followers in Philadelphia. Francis called on migrants from Mexico and the rest of the world to 'not feel discouraged by all the challenges and hardships' they face, saying they should never feel ashamed of their own traditions. The Pope's words come in direct contrast to Trump's calls for a wall to be built along the Mexican border and for stricter controls on who can enter the US.

Afterwards, he decided to leave an honest, albeit negative, review on the restaurant's Facebook page - only to have director Monica Shaw respond by telling him to 'grow a set'.

The President told the leaders Wednesday he was not immediately planning to end the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact which he railed against as a candidate and as recently as last week declared was harmful to US workers.

The club were initially disqualified for fielding the ineligible Denis Cheryshev, who should have been suspended for the game against Cadiz. But, despite numerous appeals, the Spanish government's Disciplinary Committee for Sport (TAD) said it would not suspend the football federation's ban, while it waits to make a final decision.

Unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, have proven remarkably useful in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan, but are difficult to integrate into U.S. skies, the most complex airspace in the world, FAA official Nancy Kalinowski said in testimony before a House Homeland Security subcommittee. Kalinowski said the accident rates for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aircraft are based on a relatively limited use of the planes -- only 5,688 flight hours. But because of the limited data, "the FAA must make conservative decisions" concerning integrating UAVs into U.S. skies, Kalinowski said. @highlight Unmanned aircraft have higher accident rates than regular aircraft @highlight The  FAA urges caution in expanding the use of pilotless planes in the United States @highlight An FAA official told a House subcommittee that the agency must make conservative decisions on the issue	FAA

Almost 2,000 years later, researchers may be on the brink of reading some of the charred scrolls damaged in the eruption. The scrolls, which were buried in a Herculaneum library and excavated 260 years ago, are easily damaged or destroyed by unwrapping, so researchers have been unable to read them without risk. But by using X-ray phase contrast tomography -- a 3-D technique used in medicine for soft biological tissue -- they have been able to reveal writing on the tightly wrapped scrolls without unrolling them, wrote a team led by Vito Mocella of the Naples-based Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems of the National Council of Research. @highlight X-ray technique used in medicine helps reveal ancient writing @highlight Work on Herculaneum scrolls has promise for scholars	Herculaneum
question: While such tactics helped @placeholder in the circus of a presidential campaign unfolding in a new era of post-truth politics, it's less clear that trading in untruths -- by setting up the press and the intelligence agencies as a foil for his confrontation brand of politics -- is a recipe for a successful presidency. context: (CNN) "Believe Me." Donald Trump wore those words out as a candidate as he beseeched voters to buy into his grand plans and promises on everything from crushing ISIS to building a great border wall. Now, the question of whether Americans can trust Trump is again a dominant political theme after he was caught in a lie over claims that he was wiretapped by his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump's repudiation by FBI Director James Comey in a sensational hearing Monday came exactly two months into an administration unusually prone to obfuscation, blurring facts and peddling falsehoods. From false assessments of the size of his inaugural crowd and claims that millions of illegal voters dealt him defeat in the popular vote in November, the President has often seemed happy to propagate conspiracy theories. @highlight Approval of President Donald Trump has fallen below 40% @highlight "Americans also are impatient," a presidential historian tells CNN regarding Trump's performance	Donald Trump
question: Even though @placeholder is not a Scalia clone, things are likely to be pretty bad on these key issues, because Gorsuch is likely to vote like Scalia, and the court with Scalia already was moving in a very bad direction. context: (CNN) It's no big deal, the thinking goes, that the Senate seems likely to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, as President Trump urged in his speech Tuesday night. The President encouraged this line of thought -- that elevating the judge from the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit "fills [Justice Antonin] Scalia's seat" with another conservative and just returns the court to a five-justice conservative majority that it had before Scalia passed away last February. Nothing to see here, supposedly; the real action will come when swing Justice Anthony Kennedy or one of the liberal justices leaves, moving the court further to the right.

Richard Wagner, a professor of psychology, and Horton were in London, where he taught a summer session for the university. The couple had planned to return to Tallahassee on Thursday.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labeled the allegations "meaningless and absurd." "They (the U.S.) want to isolate Iran," Khamenei said over chants of "down with America" in a speech before thousands in the western Iranian city of Gilangharb. Also, an Iranian official said claims by the United States that a high-level U.S. diplomat had met Wednesday with an Iranian counterpart over the plot were untrue.

Yet even as White House officials stressed that the leaders made progress, a prominent member of the Saudi royal family told CNN "a recalibration" of the U.S.-Saudi relationship was needed amid regional upheaval, dropping oil prices and ongoing strains between the two longtime allies. Obama landed in Riyadh earlier Wednesday for a summit with Gulf leaders and spent two-and-a-half hours meeting with the 80-year-old monarch on issues that have recently strained the alliance, including the conflict in Yemen, the role of Iran, Lebanon's instability and the fight against ISIS, U.S. officials said. @highlight The U.S and Saudi Arabia aren't at the end of a love affair, so much as in an unhappy marriage @highlight The two countries are bound by military links and a shared fight against terrorism	Barack Obama

After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration's nominations.

When searchers got close to debris found in the Mediterranean Sea they realized it didn't come from the missing airliner, EgyptAir's Vice Chairman Ahmed Adel told CNN. The Airbus A320, which had 66 people on board, disappeared early Thursday as it flew from Paris to Cairo. Earlier, Adel told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the plane's wreckage had been found.

"You came home and sometimes were denigrated when you should have been celebrated," Obama said beneath a scorching sun at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. "It was a national shame, a disgrace that should have never happened. That's why here today, we resolve that it will not happen again."

Macron has shaken up French politics with his meteoric rise to the presidency, winning his campaign as an independent, with the backing of a fledgling political party he founded less than a year ago.

"This is all the more surprising, considering that the conflict deaths [in Mexico] are nearly all attributable to small arms," said John Chipman, chief executive and director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), which issued its annual survey of armed conflict on Tuesday. "The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan claimed 17,000 and 16,000 lives respectively in 2016, although in lethality they were surpassed by conflicts in Mexico and Central America, which have received much less attention from the media and the international community," said Anastasia Voronkova, the editor of the survey. @highlight Mexican government disputes death toll, methodology @highlight Clashes between drug cartels killed more people than conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan	Mexican

The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleges the police officers fired at Paul O'Neal "without lawful justification or excuse." It's the latest shooting to highlight the already tenuous relationship between some communities and police, and it touches on broader issues that have time and again racked the Windy City: body cameras, police accountability and seemingly unstemmable violence. Many in the nation's third-largest city are still reeling from the 2014 Laquan McDonald shooting, which left a Chicago officer facing a murder charge after more than a yearlong delay in releasing dashboard camera footage.

In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (£59) and $99.99 (£66) to watch the fight while in Britain, Sky Box Office is offering the bout for £19.99, but those figures will equate to a small fraction of the earnings for Mayweather and Pacquiao.

"The United States holds Maduro ... personally responsible for the health and safety of Mr. Lopez, Mr. Ledezma, and any others seized." Both men had been under house arrest for prior convictions.

question: Kerry described @placeholder to reporters this weekend as a "clearly reckless and dangerous, evolving security threat in the hands of somebody who is questionable in terms of judgment and has proven thus to China." context: (CNN) Secretary of State John Kerry's diplomatic hot streak faced a major reality check Wednesday. He landed in Beijing aiming to convince a reluctant China to ratchet up pressure and punishments on its recalcitrant nuclear-armed ally North Korea. But the limits of American influence with a rising regional giant, questions over just how much influence even China has over North Korea's unpredictable behavior and the administration's own ebbing time and political capital make the chance of meaningful progress on one of the word's most vexing security threats a long shot. That doesn't mean Kerry, who has made a habit of what some see as solitary, quixotic diplomatic endeavors, isn't trying. @highlight Washington has long seen Beijing as holding the most meaningful card when it comes to changing Pyongyang's behavior @highlight But China, despite its increasing annoyance with North Korea, is apparently unsure of how to control Kim's erratic regime	North Korea

question: During the show, Mr @placeholder also used a bizarre analogy to justify people having guns. context: A Fox News host has claimed Australians have 'no freedom', during a live discussion about gun control in America. During a Fox and Friends broadcast, co-host Clayton Morris pointed out Australia's low gun violence while discussing the October 1 Oregon college shooting in which a 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer killed nine people and then himself. His comment prompted fellow presenter Tucker Carlson's outburst. 'They also have no freedom. You can go to prison for expressing unpopular views in Australia and people do... no one ever says that,' Carlson said. Mr Carlson's comments followed a suggestion by Mr Morris that Australia's gun control laws were used as an argument for gun control in the United States. @highlight Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed Australians have 'no freedom' @highlight He made the claims while discussing gun control @highlight Australian gun laws were used as a comparison to those in America @highlight Western Europeans and Canadians also had 'no freedom', he said	Carlson

Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders both fared about twice as well as Clinton, but still failed to elicit excitement from a majority of respondents. @highlight A survey of Democrats and independents found low levels of enthusiasm for another Clinton attempt @highlight Other familiar Democratic faces did not excite majorities either	Democratic
