question: The Trump administration refutes the notion that it has downgraded American leadership, arguing that @placeholder's foreign trips, flurry of meetings and frequent calls with foreign presidents and prime ministers shows intense engagement. context: (CNN) Foreign policy, increasingly, is what is happening around the world while the United States is making other plans. More than five months into Donald Trump's presidency, American adversaries and allies alike are adjusting to a new era in which Washington seeks its own idiosyncratic and unpredictable "America First" path. In Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, governments are assessing shifting US priorities and in some cases seeking alternative sources of leadership and partnership in the belief that America has stepped back. Trump's unpopularity abroad is forcing leaders to consider their own political positions, before getting too close to the American President -- even if they seek to preserve Washington's still vital global role as the guarantor of liberal market economics and democracy. @highlight American adversaries and allies alike are adjusting to a new era @highlight Trump's unpopularity abroad is forcing leaders to consider their own political positions	Donald Trump

"I'm willing to accept the judgment of the chamber, but I will do so with pain and a broken heart," Mahdi told the court Monday. Mahdi, also known as "Abou Tourab," was charged in March in the attacks between June and July 2012.

The high court did not immediately throw out the first-degree murder conviction of Smith, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2010. But in concluding the trial judge erred upon learning of the juror's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness, state justices unanimously decided a new trial may be necessary unless the state proves the juror shouldn't have been disqualified. "If, for any reason, the trial court is unable to conduct a full and fair hearing with regard to juror (Glenn Scott) Mitchell's improper extrajudicial communication with Dr. Lewis, then the trial court shall grant Mr. Smith a new trial," the Supreme Court ruled, referring to the juror by name, as well as Dr. Adele Lewis, the medical examiner who testified. @highlight William Darelle Smith went on trial in 2010 for first-degree murder @highlight A doctor who did the victim's autopsy testified, then was contacted by a juror @highlight The trial judge didn't order a hearing into that interaction; high court says he erred @highlight State Supreme Court orders such a hearing, which could lead to a new trial	Facebook

In an interview with the AFP news agency, conducted under restrictions imposed by the Syrian government at the presidential palace in Damascus, Assad claimed the reported details of what happened were not credible because their source was al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, Nusra Front.

Walt Peters is often among the last people soldiers see as they deploy and the first they see upon their return. That's why the retired Vietnam veteran has stood outside at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia, for the past four years as a beacon of pride and support, welcoming home returning soldiers and wishing "Godspeed" to those deploying.

For the first recorded time, a white player took a knee. As the anthem sounded, several Browns players knelt in what they later said was prayer. Among them was Seth DeValve, who is white and whose wife is African-American. "I wanted to support my African-American teammates today who wanted to take a knee," he said in a post-game interview.

Can Manchester United really afford to let Manchester City land him unopposed? It seems madness that United are going to let their bitterest rivals recruit the world's most in-demand coach, and that man is Guardiola. I know Jose Mourinho is on the market but it won't happen. United could have got him in 2013 when Sir Alex Ferguson retired but, instead, they chose David Moyes.

question: Ironically, @placeholder is known for its tolerance toward homosexuality and other faiths. context: (CNN) A pastor with a long history of inflammatory remarks about Muslims, Mormons, Catholics and gays preached at a private service for President-elect Trump and his family on Friday, shortly before Trump took the oath of office. The pastor, the Rev. Robert Jeffress, is a Southern Baptist who vigorously campaigned for Trump during the final months of the presidential election and is a member of his evangelical advisory board. "I love this guy!" Trump has said of Jeffress. Before the campaign, Trump, a Presbyterian, had no apparent connection to the pastor, who leads First Baptist Church in Dallas. Friday morning's worship service, held at St. John's Episcopal Church across the street from the White House, continued a modern Inauguration Day ritual. With the exception of Richard Nixon in 1973, every president since Franklin Roosevelt has attended spiritual services on Inauguration Day, many at St. John's. The event is separate from both the inauguration itself and an interfaith service to be held Saturday at Washington National Cathedral, where an imam is among those who will offer prayers. @highlight The Rev.

Those are the words of former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke. We're not reaching way back here: this is from just three months ago when he lashed out at Jewish members of the media who he claimed were "absolutely zeroing in now on Donald Trump." Duke, who is publicly supporting Trump, has since declared that voting against Trump is "treason to your heritage." It really doesn't get too much more deplorable than that type of anti-Semitic rherotic. But when Trump's running mate was asked Monday night by CNN's Wolf Blitzer whether he would call it that, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence refused.

The neighboring Central American countries are in a dispute over a parcel of land on the Atlantic coast, along the San Juan River, known as Calero Island. Costa Rica claims that Nicaraguan troops are camped out on the Costa Rican side of the border and it has asked the Organization of American States to intercede.

question: The increased plastic waste on @placeholder's shoreline is a big deal because it's affecting the state's wildlife. context: (CNN) The Hawaiian archipelago is in trash trouble. Vast amounts of trash have been washing ashore on the state's once-pristine beaches. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been trying to keep critical parts of the ocean clear of marine debris, removing 57 tons of it from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in 2014. This area is a part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, the largest conservation site in the United States. Despite the government agency's efforts, Hawaii continues to be plagued by trash, much of it plastic.

Trump's order bars citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the U.S. for the next 90 days. "There were further travel restrictions already in place from those seven countries," Spicer said on ABC's "This Week." "What the president did was take the first step through this executive order of ensuring that we're looking at the entire system of who's coming in, refugees that are coming in, people who are coming in from places that have a history or that our intelligence suggests that we need to have further extreme vetting for." @highlight Seven affected countries were identified as "countries of concern" under Obama administration @highlight Trump's order bars citizens from seven countries from the US for 90 days	Trump

It's become a big tourist draw, with 2012 game attendee numbers in Florida expected to surpass 1.5 million as the spring training season winds down this week.

Relief is palpable in Washington over the well-planned and seamlessly executed transfer of Saudi Arabia's throne to King Salman bin Abdulaziz, 79, following the death of his 90-year-old half brother King Abdullah. The kingdom, despite signaling rare public dissent with the Obama administration over Iran and the Arab Spring, is a fulcrum of U.S. diplomacy in a region where Washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders, chaotic change and sectarian carnage.

But it will be celebrated not just by the Hindu nationalist supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but also by many other Indians who believe that their country has remained passive for too long in the face of repeated terror attacks by groups assisted and sheltered by the Pakistan army's powerful intelligence services. In truth, the strike itself does not represent a radical new policy. India conducted local cross-border raids through the 1990s and 2000s, usually as reprisals for particular attacks. But this high-altitude, tit-for-tat war on the Line of Control, which divides Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir, was largely unknown to the Indian public, who grew frustrated at their government's apparent inaction. @highlight Shashank Joshi: India's decision to go public about a strike into Pakistan-controlled territory is a break with the past @highlight But the more Narendra Modi gloats, the more Pakistan will be compelled to show it remains unbowed	Pakistan

In the leaders' telling, though, the calls never happened -- and the White House has belatedly agreed. It was an unusual pattern of pushback against the President of the United States, a frequent and expansive telephoner who sometimes hands out his personal cell number to the people he meets.

As Le Pen continued to celebrate the highest-ever voting tally for her National Front party, French President François Hollande joined candidates knocked out in the first round in endorsing Macron, who ended his insurgent campaign with a result that confounded expectations.

question: And Bolger's memo makes no doubts about the difficult environment for @placeholder. context: Washington (CNN) One Republican pollster has figured out the only way his party can win next fall: Destroy every Democratic candidate in sight. In a memo, obtained by CNN's Chris Cillizza, pollster Glen Bolger outlines nine ways Republicans can strengthen their odds of winning in 2018 -- and it is seemingly not going to be easy. "Make no mistake about it. Tuesday (Election Day) was not just a bad night for Republicans in Virginia," Bolger writes. "The GOP lost three state legislative seats in Georgia special elections held in wealthy suburban districts, two seats on the Delaware County Council in suburban Philadelphia, the Westchester and Nassau County Executive races in New York, and a state senate special election in Washington state that tipped the balance in that chamber back to the Democrats, as well as other races around the country." @highlight Pollster to Republicans: "Raise money.

Colombian Duque-Marino triumphed 7-6 (7/5) 6-3, to deny Broady siblings Naomi and Liam a family one-two triumph after Liam toppled Marinko Matosevic in a five-set thriller. While brother Liam turned a two-set deficit on its head to set up a second-round meeting with 16th seed David Goffin, Naomi was unable to produce a similar turnaround. Broady conceded 82 ranking places to the world number 126 from South America, and in the end that gap took its toll.

United could have got him in 2013 when Sir Alex Ferguson retired but, instead, they chose David Moyes.

Donald Trump wore those words out as a candidate as he beseeched voters to buy into his grand plans and promises on everything from crushing ISIS to building a great border wall. Now, the question of whether Americans can trust Trump is again a dominant political theme after he was caught in a lie over claims that he was wiretapped by his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump's repudiation by FBI Director James Comey in a sensational hearing Monday came exactly two months into an administration unusually prone to obfuscation, blurring facts and peddling falsehoods. From false assessments of the size of his inaugural crowd and claims that millions of illegal voters dealt him defeat in the popular vote in November, the President has often seemed happy to propagate conspiracy theories. @highlight Approval of President Donald Trump has fallen below 40% @highlight "Americans also are impatient," a presidential historian tells CNN regarding Trump's performance	Donald Trump

Facing off at long tables on opposite sides of the room during a two-hour panel, raw emotions on both sides exploded as operatives debated how Trump had won the divisive campaign. There were periods of calm, substantive discussion about data, metrics and target states, but many moments where tempers flared, with acrimony mirroring the 2016 race. Advisers on the opposing sides shouted over each other. Accusations of lying flew between them. There was lots of eye-rolling on both sides.

In a speech Thursday morning, Romney said, "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University."

question: This means you have a better chance of hitting a curveball by realising that our brains, like @placeholder, can lead us to 'see' changes in speed or direction that don't actually occur. context: The average curveball travels at 75mph (120km/h) in a smooth arc. While there's no sudden change in motion throughout its journey, this isn't what the batter sees as it nears the home plate. Instead, the ball creates an optical illusion that tricks the mind into thinking there is a 'break' in movement. And scientists say knowing this, could help the mind counteract the effect. Scientists at the University of Rochester say that our brains apply an algorithm, known as a Kalman filter, when tracking a baseball.

Yet the reasons Celtic suffered a second successive Champions League exit under Ronny Deila were not hard to find. On a night when they needed discipline, calm and composure, Scotland's champions contrived to make a pig's ear of it. Malmo not only had the mouth. They also had the trousers. Over two games against a modest team, Celtic's defending was dismal. Shipping three goals from corner kicks, the zonal marking was wretched.

"The President wanted to go a different direction," Priebus told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" Friday evening. "A president has a right to hit a reset button. I think it's a good time to hit the reset button. I think he was right to hit the reset button." "I'm always going to be a Trump fan," Priebus said.

question: Trump alleges that @placeholder had improper motives for approving the deal, but he raised that exact argument during the campaign and it was labeled by nonpartisan fact checkers as "mostly false." context: (CNN) This week we saw Donald Trump, Fox News and even GOP members of Congress, in a seemingly coordinated strategy, ratchet up allegations that Hillary Clinton had "colluded" with Russia. So why did this all take place now? Well it appears likely we all learned the reason Friday night. That's when CNN broke the story that, according to sources briefed on the matter, a federal grand jury had issued the first indictments arising out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign's possible conspiring with Russia to illegally influence the 2016 presidential election. It's reasonable to believe that Trump knew that this was coming. As CNN reported, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is Attorney General Jeff Sessions second in command, "would have been made aware of any charges before they were taken before the grand jury for approval." While Sessions had recused himself from the Russian investigation, did Rosenstein inform his boss who in turn told Trump? Or did someone leak this info to Trump? It's unclear, but common sense says the multi-pronged attack on Clinton wasn't just happenstance. @highlight Dean Obeidallah: As the probe into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russia heats up, his team wants to deflect attention @highlight Attacks on Clinton indicate the lengths Team Trump is willing to go to protect their boss	Clinton

Xi Jinping's visit to the United States in February 2012 included expected stops in Washington and trade meetings in California. Even an NBA game. But the part Xi, 59, looked most forward to was an evening in Muscatine, Iowa. He wanted to visit "old friends" he'd met on a trip to Iowa almost 30 years ago. Rewind to a time when Mikhail Gorbachev was ascending to the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, Terry Anderson was taken hostage in Lebanon and Tiananmen Square was just another place in Beijing.

"They did nothing until the last second," one official said. "A slew of things went wrong." A second official said the crash "will wind up being our (the US Navy's) fault."

And, as talks concluded on November 10, U.S. Secretary of John Kerry announced that negotiations will start again on November 20. Despite the concerns of regional U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also a significant number of legislators in the U.S. Congress, it is clear that the Obama administration is pushing strongly for deal as part of its wider Middle Eastern strategy.

He vowed not to reinstate enhanced interrogation techniques -- even if ordered to do so by Trump -- and took a harder line on Russia than Trump has displayed.

The order might also be called illegal. In fairness, a President's authority to fire some cruise missiles into another country without checking with Congress has become a hazy area of Constitutional law in modern times. It's true that under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the power to declare war, tax and spend for defense, and provide for our armed forces. On the executive side, however, the Constitution simultaneously names the President as the "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States," who must, to the best of his ability "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." @highlight Danny Cevallos: Some Democrat lawmakers are criticizing Trump's Syria missile strike for not following the protocol outlined in the Constitution @highlight During the Clinton and Obama administrations, Congress and the courts set a new precedent for how they are likely to react to his orders, Cevallos says	Constitution

question: Today's rejoinders to criticism of these policies from many establishment @placeholder underscore how tone deaf the party elites have become. context: (CNN) Many observers may scratch their heads wondering how a crass billionaire can make inroads with working-class voters, but their confusion misses a critical point: The political revolt that benefited Donald Trump is not limited to the Republican Party, but is also in full fury inside the Democratic Party. Democrats, by embracing in the 1990s a series of bipartisan policies geared toward corporations at the expense of American jobs, have since failed to adequately defend America's working class, and those voters are making their presence felt at the ballot box as a result. Recent polls show the frustrations they feel toward the Democrats pose a real danger in the race for the White House, depending on who ends up winning the nomination.

question: RELATED: @placeholder's move to the $20 has fans rejoicing context: Washington (CNN) Former presidential candidate Ben Carson disagrees with the plan to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, and on Wednesday suggested another note for her: the $2 bill. "I love Harriet Tubman," the former GOP White House hopeful told Fox Business Network's Neil Cavuto. "I love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her. Maybe a $2 bill."

question: This leads us to the second factor driving the exodus of @placeholder — money. context: There is a picture-postcard quality to Frinton-on-Sea, with its golden sands, Victorian-style beach huts and famous esplanade, where crowds of day-trippers spend the summer months laying out picnic blankets and licking ice creams. The genteel Essex town (population 5,500) has a station, six schools, seven churches, 27 restaurants and cafes and, to the delight of many residents of its comfortable retirement chalets, the UK’s 11th best golf club. Yet something has recently been missing — something very important. Because for most of the past year, Frinton has not had a single full-time GP. There are more than 8,000 men, women and children registered at the Caradoc Surgery, the only NHS facility in town.

question: One thing of which Chambers is assured is regular games with @placeholder's Under 21s. context: Calum Chambers has no regrets about being denied a loan move and insists Arsenal is the best place to learn – even if he isn’t playing. When Chambers arrived at Arsenal in July 2014, he was pitched straight into the action and made an impressive debut in the Community Shield victory over Manchester City. He never looked back and was named the club's first player of the month. By this point of last season, Chambers had made 20 appearances – which totalled 1346 minutes – and been capped three times by England. This season, however, has presented some challenges. Arsene Wenger is turning him from a right-back into a central defender but he wants that transition to take place at the Emirates Stadium. The Arsenal manager would not let Chambers seek a loan in the window but he is not giving him much game time, either.

The seven-time world champion has struggled to challenge for a podium place in three races since returning to motorsport's elite class, and has been outperformed by young teammate Nico Rosberg. But Brawn, whose team won the world title last year after a scintillating start to the campaign, believes that the 41-year-old Schumacher has suffered from problems not within his control.

Kala Brown says he calmly shot her boyfriend three times in the chest. Brown didn't know Kohlhepp well, but she felt she had no reason to fear him when he asked her and her boyfriend, Charlie Carver, 32, to meet him at his farm near Woodruff, South Carolina. Brown, 31, had cleaned houses for Kohlhepp's real estate listings, normally bringing along Carver.

question: @placeholder did not claim responsibility for Tuesday's killings, but a spokesman for the group linked it to the discovery Sunday of a Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from the synagogue. context: A Palestinian man has admitted to deliberately ramming a vehicle into three Israeli soldiers in the West Bank two weeks ago -- one of several recent cases of violence in the Palestinian territory or Jerusalem -- Israeli police said Thursday. Jamal Hamam Mesalmeh, 23,  turned himself in to Israeli authorities shortly after the November 5 incident near the village of al-Aroub and claimed it was an accident, police said. The soldiers suffered moderate injuries, officials said at the time. Israeli police said Mesalmeh is an activist associated with the Islamist Hamas movement. Police said he claimed he was inspired in part by an attack in eastern Jerusalem earlier November 5 -- one in which Israeli authorities said a Palestinian drove into pedestrians at a rail station, killing two Israelis and at least 12 other people before police shot and killed the driver. @highlight Jamal Hamam Mesalmeh, 23, claims he drove into soldiers on purpose, police say @highlight Attack happened November 5 in the West Bank; three soldiers were injured @highlight Violent incident was one of several in recent weeks in the West Bank and Jerusalem	Hamas

Mendes stepped in for the injured champion Jose Aldo at less than three weeks' notice but weighed in half a pound under the 145lb featherweight limit in Las Vegas. McGregor, who was roared on by the large contingent of Irish fans among the record 11,000 who attended the weigh-in, made the weight exactly.

Marco Rubio, a longtime hawk on Syria, praised the US airstrike on a Syrian airfield days after a chemical attack on innocents attributed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Following news that President Donald Trump had green-lit the US action, Rubio said Thursday on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that Russia could not fairly criticize the military strike because Russia backed Assad -- who is accused of perpetrating the attack on his own people. "They have no standing to say anything about this," Rubio said of the Russians.

Clinton joined Obama on stage after his speech, and the President and his 2008 primary rival clung together in a shared moment of symbolism: the nation's first African-American leader entrusting its future to the woman who could become its first female commander-in-chief. Obama was in Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention 12 years to the day after he shook politics with a convention speech in Boston that encouraged Americans to look at the common threads that unite them.

Asked about anti-American rhetoric in Chinese state-run media which accused the United States of backing recent democracy protests in Hong Kong, Obama brushed off the criticism as "part of being a public official." "The United States had no involvement in fostering the protests that took place there," Obama insisted.

This is because it is listed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a non-profit organization that 'promotes social welfare'.

But none so far have yielded proof of criminal connections between the parties. US law enforcement and intelligence officials investigating hacks of Democratic Party organizations view Russian spy agencies as trying to sow chaos and confusion in the US elections, but not necessarily trying to help a particular candidate.

The decision was made at a meeting of the Imperial House Council and announced by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday. Crown Prince Naruhito, who has already assumed some of his father's duties, will take on the role on May 1, 2019, becoming the 126th Emperor to ascend to Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne.

Now, though, things look different. For the first time, a member state has decided to leave. And the particularly toxic blend of complex problems and decreased room for compromise make it impossible to see how all of the issues confronting the bloc can be resolved without undermining the principle of union.

Speaking at a libertarian-leaning conference, Ron Paul slammed the "bipartisan support" among congressional lawmakers for "rubber-stamping what President Obama wants" in the fight against the militant group. More broadly, he suggested that Senate Republicans aren't that different from their Democratic counterparts.

But he continued to present the threat of strikes as an option, if not the most desirable one. "Each day, new equipment is delivered; new and beautiful equipment, the best in the world -- the best anywhere in the world, by far," he said of US military capacity. "Hopefully, we're not going to have to use it on North Korea." "Military action would certainly be an option," he added during a White House news conference.

His arrest, in a joint operation by the Australian Federal Police and Melbourne Joint Counter Terrorism Team, came after searches at seven addresses in Melbourne suburbs.

Gianluigi Buffon is 37 now but time has not taken the edge from his talents. When his Juventus team shocked Europe and the bookmakers who wrote them off after five minutes by equalising and forcing Barcelona momentarily back on to their heels early in the second half, it was testimony to the courage and sheer will of the Italian team. The truth of the matter was, however, that they had their goalkeeper to thank. Had it not been for Buffon the night would have been over for the Italian champions after 15 minutes.

Early in the Obama administration, Holder said that we are "a nation of cowards" when it comes to issues of race. The conservative chattering class erupted. Holder is at it again. He has fired up the right with his comments about the Trayvon Martin case, blaming "mistaken beliefs and stereotypes" for the shooting of the Florida teenager. And now he is going after Texas' voting laws. @highlight NEW: Eric Holder says Justice Department will go after Texas voting law after high court ruling @highlight Attorney general also has recently talked about race after George Zimmerman verdict @highlight Some conservatives have accused Holder of "race baiting" @highlight Obama has not backed away from Holder or his comments	Trayvon Martin

The 46-year old French national is claiming that Saudi Embassy officials were involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One to assassinate Bill Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton during a trip to the United Kingdom. Moussaoui says he met with a Secret Service agent several months ago and told him what he knew. CNN has reached out to the Secret Service for comment.

"As state attorney I have made the decision that this office will not be filing charges against Corey Lewandowski for battery," Aronberg said at a news conference. A former reporter for Breitbart, Michelle Fields, sought charges against Lewandowski after an incident in March where she said Lewandowski pulled her away from Trump as she was trying to ask him a question. Aronberg said police were within their right to charge Lewandowski, but prosecutors are held to a higher standard and thus didn't find enough to bring the case. @highlight The state attorney said Thursday he will not prosecute Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump's campaign manager @highlight Lewandowski shared an apology letter draft with prosecutors but it has not been sent	Corey Lewandowski
question: The @placeholder administration refutes the notion that it has downgraded American leadership, arguing that Trump's foreign trips, flurry of meetings and frequent calls with foreign presidents and prime ministers shows intense engagement. context: (CNN) Foreign policy, increasingly, is what is happening around the world while the United States is making other plans. More than five months into Donald Trump's presidency, American adversaries and allies alike are adjusting to a new era in which Washington seeks its own idiosyncratic and unpredictable "America First" path. In Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, governments are assessing shifting US priorities and in some cases seeking alternative sources of leadership and partnership in the belief that America has stepped back. Trump's unpopularity abroad is forcing leaders to consider their own political positions, before getting too close to the American President -- even if they seek to preserve Washington's still vital global role as the guarantor of liberal market economics and democracy. @highlight American adversaries and allies alike are adjusting to a new era @highlight Trump's unpopularity abroad is forcing leaders to consider their own political positions	Donald Trump

He has every right to do so: After all, he has dual citizenship for both countries. Some observers disagree with Manzano's action. On CNN.com, Ruben Navarrette voiced his concerns that Manzano was showing disloyalty to the United States even while he's wearing the USA jersey. Opinion: U.S. Olympic athlete, Mexican flag? Judging by the volume of comments in response to Navarrette's opinion, one would think that Manzano had committed treason. One reader wrote, "He is pathetic. ... Go back to Mexico.

The two countries, though enemies, are tied together by history, by family and by language - but only to a point. South Koreans have incorporated many English words and phrases into their language while isolated communist North Korea has eliminated words with foreign origins and created homegrown substitutes. North Korean defector Pak Mi-ok ended up going without water during a meal in the South because she was too shy to admit she didn't understand the term 'self-service' For those south of the divide, English-based words like 'shampoo,' 'juice' and 'self-service' are common. @highlight Two countries are tied together by history, by family and by language @highlight But a third of everyday words used in the two countries are different @highlight South Koreans incorporate English words and phrases into their language @highlight But in communist North Korea, words with foreign origins are eliminated	North Korea

The raid on Istanbul-based IMC TV, an opposition-affiliated, pro-Kurdish channel, came as the station was reporting on the government's closure of another television channel. Turkish authorities cut IMC's transmission in the middle of the broadcast. "Free media will not be silenced," IMC staff chanted as authorities entered the control room, ordering journalists to stop broadcasting scenes from the raid on their social media accounts.

question: @placeholder has built his presidency on his unpredictability and unorthodoxy. context: (CNN) Donald Trump's week started with Sally Yates' damning testimony about Michael Flynn and ended with a series of wild tweets and an ever-changing story about exactly why he chose to fire FBI Director James Comey. Even by Trumpian standards, the wild swings, erratic messaging and general chaos was beyond the pale -- raising real concerns about whether Trump was losing control of the ship of state. Start with the testimony of Yates, the one-time acting attorney general, to a Senate subcommittee Monday. She made clear that on two occasions -- once on January 26 and then again on January 27 -- she sought out White House counsel Don McGahn to warn him that national security adviser Michael Flynn had been compromised by the Russians and was a blackmail risk.

question: The President's assault on @placeholder's conduct on Monday dismayed some former senior military officers. context: (CNN) President Donald Trump, though often acting as a champion of the military, has at times politicized the sacrifice of those who paid a terrible price in the nation's wars in a way that few of his predecessors would have countenanced. He clearly reveres America's fighting men and women. He often boasts about their prowess, has surrounded himself with hard charging generals and has vowed to reinvent veterans' health care. But he's also been happy to use the military for his own political ends when it suits him. The latest episode -- in which Trump falsely claimed Barack Obama didn't call the families of dead soldiers -- is revealing because it shows how Trump lashes out whenever he believes his conduct or character is under attack. It's another case of him citing information that is either incorrect of unverified when he is on the defensive, a trait that often leads him into deeper political trouble. @highlight Controversy over Obama calls not the first time Trump has politicized sacrifice @highlight President facing questions over ISIS ambush that killed four soldiers in Niger	Barack Obama

question: On June 25, 1950, a surprise attack by North Korean soldiers who crossed the 38th parallel easily overwhelmed @placeholder forces. context: It's the war that never really ended -- leaving the Korean peninsula splintered in 1953. The brutal war that raged 60 years ago killed more than two million Koreans, separated thousands of families, and created the world's most heavily fortified border. It also drew the alliances that exist today. The armistice agreement that ended the war is a truce, rather than a peace treaty. Starting on Tuesday, North Korea threatened to dismantle the armistice, as it has done so in the past. In 2009, North Korea said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because South Korea was joining a U.S.-led anti-proliferation plan. In 2003, Pyonyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that it may have "no option" but to stop honoring the armistice because of the United State's "persistent war moves." @highlight A brutal civil war 60 years ago drew the alliances that exist today @highlight North Korea has threatened to end armistice in the past @highlight War killed more than 2 million Koreans, separated thousands of families	South Korea

As hope from Jill Stein's recount fades for Hillary Clinton's supporters, another Hail Mary chance to thwart Donald Trump's presidency has taken its place: that enough members of the Electoral College sworn to vote for Trump will break their pledge and vote to elect an alternate candidate.

"It is in the vital national security interests of America to prevent and deter the the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons," Trump said in a statement from his Mar-a-Lago estate. The decision to use military force against Syria marks a remarkable reversal for Trump. In 2013, he was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's contemplation of strikes in Syria following President Bashar al-Assad's initial use of chemical weapons against his own people.

After the match the Bayern players returned to the pitch and held a banner up to the supporters that read: 'Thank you for Everything.' This was Bayern's final game at the Allianz Arena in 2015 with German clubs set for a winter break after this weekend's Bundesliga fixtures and the players were clearly in the festive spirit as they donned Christmas hats. Bayern, as expected, controlled the game but laboured at the Allianz Arena to overcome a well-organised Darmstadt, and did not create many chances against the top flight newcomers. @highlight Bayern Munich beat Darmstadt 1-0 to reach German Cup quarter-finals @highlight Xabi Alonso opened the scoring with a thunderous volley after 40 minutes @highlight This was Bayern's last home game before German clubs take winter break @highlight The players emerged after the game wearing Santa hats and thanked fans	Xabi Alonso

In an escalating struggle to seize the advantage on the contentious Medicare issue, the Romney campaign counterpunched with a new ad accusing Obama of cutting more than $700 billion from the government-run health care plan for senior citizens.

question: In February, @placeholder tapped Scavino, now in his 40s, to direct the rapidly growing social media operation for his presidential campaign, putting him at the tip of the spear of Trump's unwieldy—and controversial--communication strategy. context: (CNN) Daniel Scavino was working a high school job cleaning golf clubs at the Briar Hall Country Club in New York's Hudson Valley when a man who would change his life pulled into the parking lot in a stretch limousine. The visitor was business mogul Donald Trump, who, at that time in 1990, was famous as a flashy real estate developer, not a politician. The course where Scavino worked was heading into foreclosure, and Trump was in the market for expanding his golf business. Scavino, a lucky 16-year-old who happened to be in the right place at the right time, was selected caddie for Trump's party. He was instantly smitten.

But Scotland’s result in Italy was different — mainly because we had not won a game this calendar year. Having been whitewashed in the Six Nations and beaten by Ireland last week, the game in Turin was one the Scots had to win. Losing six on the trot is not good and it is very easy to forget how to win games, how to make the right decisions to close out tight matches.

The question arose Thursday as part of the international focus on last month's abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the jihadist group in northeast Nigeria that threatens to sell them into slavery. A Daily Beast article raised the issue.

When asked if he meant his remarks about Putin sarcastically, Trump told reporters, "Absolutely. I think you know that I think you know that." Trump's remarks echo White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' characterization of his comments. "He was being sarcastic," Sanders said earlier Friday.

Ponce, who was featured on CNN's "The Hunt with John Walsh" in 2014, was charged with DUI manslaughter after a fatal 2012 car crash in Tampa, Florida. "Extradition is in motion," Gaskins wrote on Twitter. Ponce is accused of driving drunk in the wrong direction on I-275, slamming head-on into another car. The crash killed 20-year-old William Angel and seriously injured two of his friends. @highlight Ponce is accused of driving drunk in the wrong direction on I-275, slamming head-on into another car @highlight The crash killed 20-year-old William Angel and seriously injured two of his friends	Christopher Ponce
question: The @placeholder aides added Thursday that the new policy would apply to officials looking to work for overseas governments, too, for their entire lives. context: Washington (CNN) Reformers elated by President-elect Donald Trump's new tough ban on lobbying after serving in his administration can just as quickly find a reason to be disappointed. That's because they've heard and seen this before. "I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over," then-Sen. Barack Obama said in November 2007. His administration put a two-year ban on lobbying post-service. In 2016, Trump channeled the same anger against Washington and is proposing to build on the same policies Obama instituted. "Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose the Trump campaign. That's because I don't need them. I don't want them. I'm going to do what's good for you," Trump said in Akron, Ohio, in August. "Or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose Donald Trump's campaign. Because I don't want the lobbyists. I've had plenty of lobbyists. They do a good job. They give you whatever you want. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor." @highlight Trump has proposed a five-year ban on lobbying after leaving his administration @highlight Washington has plenty of ways to get around being called a "lobbyist"	Donald Trump
question: Trump won enough states to give him 56.9% or 306 @placeholder votes. context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump again overstated the size of his Electoral College win on Thursday, only to quickly fold and blame the claim on bad information. Trump claimed at a news conference that he had the largest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. When told later in the news conference by NBC's Peter Alexander that information was false, Trump did not defend the argument, which he has made repeatedly in recent days, but said he was "talking about Republicans." "I was given that information," Trump said, before quickly moving onto another questioner. "Actually, I've seen that information around. It was a very substantial victory. Would you agree with that?" @highlight "I was given that information," Trump said. @highlight Trump lost the popular vote by several million ballots to Hillary Clinton.	Electoral College
question: @placeholder can also be found in human urine, semen and saliva, and Florida authorities are now collecting urine samples from family members and neighbors of the four identified cases, hoping to determine how widespread infection may already be in the area. context: (CNN) Zika is here, in the USA. Fasten your seat belts because we're in for a bumpy ride. Local mosquitoes in the Miami area are carrying the Zika virus, and have infected at least four Floridians. In announcing this alarming news during a press conference Friday morning, Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, added a sharp warning: "This is not just a Florida issue. It's a national issue -- we just happen to be at the forefront." Now all the falderal typical of American outbreaks will commence: Political posturing, hysteria versus naysaying, conspiracy theories, demands for safety and care and a daily mounting toll of identified cases. And this year the hoopla will unfold against the background of one of the ugliest, most deeply divided election years in modern history. @highlight Four individuals in Miami-Dade and Broward counties have been infected with the Zika virus by local mosquitoes @highlight Laurie Garrett:  Yes, we all know Washington is dysfunctional these days, but this is about the nation's babies	Zika

Jo Bertram, the UK general manager of the private hire company, has been victimised by the drivers on social media as tensions between the company and taxi drivers step up. In May, one London cabbie even made comments about the boss being aroused by rape in a conversation thread about passenger safety in the cars.

Information Minister Marie Laurence Lassegue's announcement came shortly after the five men and five women left a hearing at the prosecutor's office. Under Haitian law, anyone accused of kidnapping a child is not eligible for bail, the attorney general's office said.

question: I feel very much like (Knightley's character) @placeholder in that sense, where I try to live my life to the fullest. context: (CNN) -- In "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World," the plot is simple: An asteroid headed for Earth is ready to wipe out life as we know it. But the film isn't just a rehashing of the doomsday plots you might be familiar with from movies like "Deep Impact" or "Armageddon." Instead, the film follows Dodge (Steve Carell) on a last-minute road-trip with his neighbor, Penny (Keira Knightley), as they drive from New York to Delaware in search of Dodge's high school girlfriend -- "the one that got away." Along with Carell and Knightley, the film has a stellar supporting cast, including Connie Britton, Adam Brody, Rob Corddry and Patton Oswalt, to name a few. The story mixes a range of emotions -- regret, spite, fear and love -- through this backdrop of pending doom, balancing humor and sadness with dread. @highlight Screenwriter Lorene Scafaria makes directorial debut with 'Seeking a Friend' @highlight The film follows two neighbors as they prepare for an asteroid to wipe out life on Earth @highlight Scafaria saw the film as a way to explore human emotions	Penny

Even more so since, as we have learnt this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has bestowed the actor Russian citizenship. Read more: Depardieu's puzzling love for Russia Back in mid-December, the French media operated along political lines: the left-wing press such as Libération couldn't find strong enough words to describe Depardieu's "desertion" while right-wing publications such as Le Figaro, slightly uneasy at the news, preferred to focus on President François Hollande's punishing taxes which allegedly drove throngs of millionaires to seek tax asylum in more fiscally lenient countries such as Belgium or Britain. Le Figaro stopped short of passing moral judgement though. Others like satirical weekly Charlie hebdo, preferred irony.

question: She almost causes a shaman to disgrace himself in @placeholder after a ceremony in which he whirls himself into a trance and then, seizing a burning brand from a log fire, licks the flames. context: A journey of 6,000 miles across China, Mongolia and Russia on some of the greatest railways of the world is bound to be the trip of a lifetime. But for Joanna Lumley it was an odyssey through her early life, as she began by retracing her childhood in Hong Kong, and ended by re-creating iconic fashion pictures that she defied the Iron Curtain to shoot in Moscow as a 20-year-old model. The journey in between is an extraordinary train trek, captured in a three-part ITV documentary called Joanna Lumley's Trans-Siberian Adventure. Her personal memories, along with a wickedly straight-faced sense of humour, lift this series far above the ordinary TV travelogue. Exhausted by travel and steeped in vodka, the actress sometimes breaks into surreal monologues – such as an imaginary audition for a KGB agent in a Bond movie. 'Why should I be a good person?' she growls at her reflection in the train window, as the Siberian steppes roll past. @highlight Journey captured in a three-part ITV documentary @highlight Called Joanna Lumley's Trans-Siberian Adventure	Mongolia
question: "@placeholder can tend to be a little overdramatic sometimes, I think that's part of his persona." context: Washington (CNN) Did President Donald Trump live up to his promise to end the "war on Christmas"? Depends on who you ask. While some would quibble with the very idea that a war on the holiday exists, recent polling does suggest that the Christian nature of Christmas is less culturally prevalent than in the past. A Pew Research Center survey, published last week, found that most US adults believe the religious aspects of the holiday are emphasized less now than they used to be. But overall, just 31% of adults said "they are bothered at least 'some' by the declining emphasis on religion in the way the U.S. commemorates Christmas." @highlight A recent Pew poll found 9 in 10 U.S. adults say they celebrate Christmas.

Batty, the 37-year-old Surrey captain, finished the game in style by dismissing Tony Palladino, Mark Footitt and number 11 Ben Cotton in his 17th over to claim figures of six for 51. Palladino was caught at the wicket for two and Batty then bowled both Footitt and Cotton as Derbyshire we all out for 149 in the second innings.

question: However, Dr. Brendan Flannery of the @placeholder presented data indicating that FluMist had zero effectiveness against one strain of flu. context: (CNN) Flu vaccines are about to get more painful. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee recommended on Wednesday that FluMist, the nasal spray influenza vaccine, should not be used during the upcoming flu season. "To everyone's surprise and increasing consternation, this vaccine has performed quite poorly compared to the injectable vaccine," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist. An alternative to the standard flu shot, FluMist had been approved for people between the ages of 2 and 49 years old by the Food and Drug Administration. The CDC committee, which includes 15 immunization experts, reviewed data from previous flu seasons, including the most recent season, comparing FluMist with the standard flu shot. @highlight The CDC recommends that FluMist vaccine not be used during the upcoming flu season @highlight The nasal spray vaccination is widely used by pediatricians	CDC

The report lays out 206 declined "detainers" that were registered in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement databases during the week of January 28 to February 3. Detainers are requests by ICE to local law enforcement agencies to hold certain individuals ICE believes could be deported for up to an extra 48 hours beyond the criminal process so they can be picked up by ICE.

Day lifted the Wanamaker Trophy after becoming the first player to win a major with a score of 20-under par on the Whistling Straits course. He was three shots clear of Jordan Spieth in second. And after six top-10 finishes in majors since coming third in the Masters at Augusta in 2013, questions have been posed as to whether Day had the nerve to ever land one of the big four tournaments.

question: And ahead of the next presidential debate on Sunday, there's no sign Trump will do something to address the lack of focus, preparation and impulse control that helped contribute to @placeholder's win at last week's showdown. context: Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's tax controversy and his self-destructive lack of discipline threaten to drain the Republican nominee of something he can't afford: time. With 36 days remaining before Election Day, the real estate mogul's campaign is consumed with the fallout from a New York Times story published over the weekend that found Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995. That loss could mean Trump went 18 years without paying federal income taxes. Those findings -- which Trump's campaign isn't disputing but haven't been independently confirmed by CNN -- would be daunting for any presidential candidate to overcome. But they're especially challenging for Trump, who is losing control of the campaign's narrative after a strong September in which he narrowed the race with Hillary Clinton. @highlight Trump is losing control of the campaign's narrative after a strong September @highlight Time is dwindling for Trump to regain his grip on the campaign's message	Hillary Clinton

Cain, the one-time GOP frontrunner and former Godfather's Pizza CEO, will speak at Trump's rally tonight in Georgia. Audiences can expect to hear Cain bash Jeb Bush – as Bush has used Cain's climb in the polls and subsequent flame-out as a lesson to voters for why they shouldn't count the low-polling former Florida governor out.

Hamp tendered her resignation through her attorneys on Tuesday, and Toyota Motor Corp. accepted it because of 'the concerns and inconvenience that recent events have caused our stakeholders,' the company said. Hamp, a 55-year-old American who was Toyota's newly appointed head of public relations, was arrested on June 18 on suspicion of importing oxycodone, a narcotic pain killer, into Japan.

Security forces had been tracking the insurgents when a shootout erupted in Chhattisgarh state's Dantewada region, police spokesman Rajesh Mishra told CNN. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but reinforcements were rushed to the scene, Mishra added. India regards Maoist rebels as its gravest internal security threat. Until June this year, authorities blamed 1,103 violent attacks in the country on left-wing extremists. More than 200 officers and 97 rebels were killed during that period, federal home minister P.

question: It describes, truthfully, what has happened to the working class in @placeholder. context: (CNN) Many observers may scratch their heads wondering how a crass billionaire can make inroads with working-class voters, but their confusion misses a critical point: The political revolt that benefited Donald Trump is not limited to the Republican Party, but is also in full fury inside the Democratic Party. Democrats, by embracing in the 1990s a series of bipartisan policies geared toward corporations at the expense of American jobs, have since failed to adequately defend America's working class, and those voters are making their presence felt at the ballot box as a result. Recent polls show the frustrations they feel toward the Democrats pose a real danger in the race for the White House, depending on who ends up winning the nomination. Quinnipiac found a battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to be an essential tossup in three key swing states: Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.

She spoke with righteous anger, painting her rival Donald Trump as a hate-monger beholden to white nationalist causes. Her voice was firm, her body rooted and steady, her message freighted with urgency: This is a moment of reckoning for America. She combined civic education in her explanation of the alt-right movement, bipartisan outreach (appealing to Republicans by citing noble behavior of their past presidential nominees), and lawyerly dissection of the misguided reasons some conservatives continue to support Trump. It ranks among her strongest speeches. Why? Clinton depicted Trump as the rogue politician he is, one who qualitatively differs from all previous GOP nominees.

The USS Coronado was on its way back to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after suffering an "engineering casualty," a Navy statement said. It said it expected to reveal more about what happened after an inspection once the ship returned to port.

Gorsuch now becomes part of Trump's legacy as president. And someone who, with his lifetime appointment, will outlast the President in the upper echelons of government.

question: @placeholder struck from a tight angle in the 88th minute to earn his West Ham side all three points against Sunderland context: Well, they want continuity and stability at Sunderland. It was perhaps fitting, then, that Dick Advocaat marked his first game in charge with a defeat, a fourth in six matches to leave the Black Cats perilously perched one point above the drop zone. Not even the re-introduction of top goalscorer Adam Johnson – on as a second-half substitute after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl – could inspire a side who have won just once in 2015. Gus Poyet paid for that run with his job this week, but Advocaat must repair those ruins if his own CV is not to be stained with a first relegation in 28 years in the dugout. @highlight Diafra Sakho scores late winner as West Ham win for the first time since January 18 @highlight Senegalese striker's goal ended a three-game losing streak for Sam Allardyce's side @highlight Dick Advocaat took charge of Sunderland for the first time since taking over from Gus Poyet @highlight Adam Johnson returned to the Sunderland side after the club lifted his suspension	Diafra Sakho

Marco Rubio, a longtime hawk on Syria, praised the US airstrike on a Syrian airfield days after a chemical attack on innocents attributed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Following news that President Donald Trump had green-lit the US action, Rubio said Thursday on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that Russia could not fairly criticize the military strike because Russia backed Assad -- who is accused of perpetrating the attack on his own people. "They have no standing to say anything about this," Rubio said of the Russians.

But that's far from the case with the people of Palm Beach -- now the location of his so-called Winter White House -- the long spit of land off Florida's East Coast that the real estate mogul has been frequenting for decades. Since he purchased the Mar-a-Lago property in 1985 for $5 million, Trump's relationship with the tony city and its residents has ebbed and flowed. He's sued the city, fought with the town leadership and turned local issues into nattional controversies.

'Barnaby was told this tonight and apologised to Q&A that he would not be able to appear.' The Prime Minister's call for frontbenchers to snub the program was first reported by the Sydney Morning Herald. Joyce's withdrawal was a backflip from comments Mr Joyce made earlier in the day on the ABC's Insiders, when committed to appearing on Monday night.

Notre Dame senior Emily Toates says she will not attend her school's main graduation ceremony. She's doing something about it: skipping the event. "I do not feel comfortable going and celebrating him as the university hands him an honorary degree -- in a sense honoring his policies," Toates said.

The 53-second video shows a single shot being fired from The Liberator, a plastic handgun that, with the exception of its metal firing pin, was assembled from parts made with a 3-D printer, according to Defense Distributed. The gun appears unscathed after the test firing, although the brief clip does not reveal anything about its range or accuracy. The nonprofit group, founded by 25-year-old law student Cody Wilson, has posted instructions for the gun online so other people can duplicate it.

Mitsubishi Materials Corp is sending one of its senior executives to the States to make a personal apology to James Murphy, of Santa Maria, and relatives of other former POWs who toiled at plants its predecessor company operated in Japan during the conflict. About 12,000 American prisoners were forced to work at more than 50 sites to support imperial Japan's war effort during the 1940s, with about 10 percent dying,  Kinue Tokudome, director of the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on POWs, said. @highlight James Murphy, 94, accepting apology for 900 POW used as slave labor @highlight Murphy was forced to work in a copper mine by predecessor company @highlight Says he forgave his captors after the war - but just wanted an apology @highlight Mitsubishi Materials Corp thought to be first Japanese company to make such a statement	American

But the Republican presidential nominee apparently doesn't know what it means either. "Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the 'C' marking on documents stood for classified. How can this be happening?" Trump wrote on Twitter. John Noonan, a national security adviser to Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, observed that Trump had incorrectly ascribed "classified" to the "C" markings -- they actually denote a lower security status, "confidential."

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature resorted to "unusual state action" and agreed to pay the operational costs of the Statue of Liberty until the federal government reopens, citing economic interests in a news conference Sunday. New York state will pay $61,600 a day over the next several days from its tourism budget. "Just on the economics of the matter, it makes obvious sense for us to pay for the costs of operation, which pales in comparison to the amount of money we are now losing," Cuomo said. @highlight The Statue of Liberty reopens after New York state agrees to pay to run it @highlight The landmark had been closed as a result of the partial government shutdown @highlight About 400 jobs had been lost in the shutdown, ticketing operator says @highlight Arizona and South Dakota also agreed to pay to keep their landmarks open	Andrew Cuomo

A young Brazilian soccer player who came to Europe to seek fame and fortune is offered ludicrous sums to abandon a world-famous club for a Qatari-bankrolled upstart. The deal speaks volumes about the almost insane sums of money being thrown at players and clubs in Europe as the continent's transfer market goes into hyper-drive.

Years before Zika virus first appeared in Latin America, it spread from Africa and Asia to Pacific islands. From 2013 to 2014, French Polynesia had 32,000 suspected cases of Zika virus. During this same period, there was also an uptick in cases of Guillain-Barre. Researchers in French Polynesia and Europe looked at those 42 cases of Guillain-Barre in the Pacific Island nation between October 2013 and April 2014.

Burgess was heavily criticised following England's pool-stage exit at the Rugby World Cup and is thought to be considering his future in the 15-man code. He made replacement appearances against Fiji and Australia and one start in the loss to Wales, which led to a brutal assessment from ex-Ireland centre Gordon D'Arcy, who claimed Burgess' 'naivety embarrassed those around him'.

This is the first reported case of a child controlling their HIV infection without drugs in Africa and the third known case globally. Soon after diagnosis, the child was placed on antiretroviral treatment, or ART, for 40 weeks, at which point treatment was stopped and the child's health was monitored. Blood tests in late 2015 revealed the child is in HIV remission, meaning levels of the virus in the blood are undetectable using standard tests.

When they warned him against lashing Arizona's Republican senators by name, he made snide allusions to them instead. And when they insisted his statements about white supremacist violence required a re-do, he declared he was right the first time.

There has been international interest in his bid to make wine in one of Europe's wettest countries, and the first bottles of 'Chateau Largo' have been keenly awaited.

It was interesting to hear him talk about a whole range of subjects, including the fact that Newcastle United had 'vetoed' a move away from Tyneside in the summer. When asked about whether he had an agreement with Newcastle that he could leave next summer, the French international was evasive and just said that he wanted to do his best for Newcastle this season and then hopefully do the same for his country at Euro 2016, which is being held in France. @highlight Moussa Sissoko spoke about his opportunities with France last week @highlight Midfielder appeared to claim that Crystal Palace are bigger than Newcastle @highlight Other questions in the interview put Sissoko's answers in context @highlight Mark Jensen of the themag.co.uk says Newcastle are a much bigger club	Moussa Sissoko

Trump said Wednesday that plans were nearly final for a health care measure that would replace the Affordable Care Act, and for the tax reform package that he promised on the campaign trail. The White House said Trump was aiming to release his budget blueprint by mid-March, though officials acknowledged the document would amount to only a framework, and not a full plan, since key members of the White House team have just begun work.

A video of a man wearing a turban and fake beard attempting a crude impression of an Indian was posted Wednesday on several verified social media channels operated by official Chinese news agency Xinhua News. Entitled "7 Sins of India," the 3 minute 20 second clip appears intended to attack India's actions in an ongoing border dispute between the two neighboring countries.

question: Although Spicer apologized for the comment, Davis insisted that @placeholder was still fundamentally ill-suited for the job. context: (CNN) What do United Airlines, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Fox News host Bill O'Reilly have in common? They all bungled responses to public relations crises this week, says Lanny Davis, a lawyer and crisis management specialist. Speaking with CNN's Michael Smerconish on Saturday, Davis said United Airlines' response to a viral video of a passenger being dragged off a flight was a "textbook case of how to do everything wrong." Davis, whose past clients include Martha Stewart and the NFL's Washington Redskins, was particularly critical of United CEO Oscar Munoz. In his initial statement about the incident on Monday, Munoz only apologized for "having to re-accommodate ... customers."

question: @placeholder claimed the couple asked her to terminate the Down Syndrome child when she was seven months pregnant. context: (CNN) -- What was supposed to be a straightforward cash deal to carry a child for desperate parents has turned into an international spat over who said what, and exposed the darker side of a business credited with creating happiness for many couples. At the center of the debate is Gammy, a seven-month-old Down Syndrome baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in Thailand.

"We need either a change in direction from this speaker, or we need a new speaker," Amash said while answering a question about the perpetual gridlock in Washington.

These two Americas are deeply divided by mistrust and misunderstanding. One America is rejoicing, while another grieves in disbelief. In January, Trump's new party will retool federal and international policies to recalibrate the government's internal and global posture. Then, four or eight years from now, the "other" America will likely retake the White House and reverse those actions. I believe we can do better than whipsaw between two angry, divisive extremes every presidential term or two.

As a family physician, I often have patients ask me about e-cigarettes. Some have seen advertisements and are wondering what they are; some have simply heard that e-cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes and want to know if this is true. E-cigarettes are included in the category of ENDS -- Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems -- products that use a liquid containing nicotine and varying amounts of flavor, glycerin, propylene glycol and other ingredients.

"My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer," he said alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the ornate Élysée Palace. "It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast."

Gregory Robert Knight started his teaching career in South Australia where he was found to have touched the penises of at least three teenage boys during school camps in 1977. He then moved to Queensland and worked at Brisbane Boys' College, where he was again subject to allegations of abuse.

question: The @placeholder transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about what federal help his administration might offer Chicago to combat homicide. context: Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump said Monday that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel should seek federal assistance to combat homicides in the nation's third-largest city. "Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!" Trump tweeted. Trump's tweet accurately relayed Chicago's homicide numbers. And while they are not "record setting," The Chicago Tribune reports that homicides were up 60% from 2015 to the highest levels in 20 years. Emanuel, who was President Barack Obama's chief of staff from January 2009 to October 2010, met with Trump in New York last month, urging the President-elect to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program until a modernized immigration system can be decided by Congress. @highlight Trump has talked about Chicago crime before @highlight Emanuel's office responded that they are taking the issue seriously	Donald Trump

question: @placeholder continued to back Mourinho over the weekend, but it has become clear that he is now managing the club on a game-by-game basis as they wait for owner Roman Abramovich to make his next move. context: Jose Mourinho has been stunned by allegations that morale is so low in the Chelsea dressing room that one of his players would ‘rather lose than win’. The incredible claim was made by respected BBC 5 Live presenter Garry Richardson during his long-established Sportsweek programme on Sunday morning. Chelsea sources claim that the pressure on Mourinho to turn results around following their sixth defeat of the season in the Barclays Premier League — 3-1 at home by Liverpool on Saturday — has left him close to breaking point.

Last Saturday, four generations of Darcy Shepard's family went skydiving for her 18th birthday. The oldest jumper was Shepard's 94-year-old great-grandmother, Harriett Shepard.

question: While Washington had 101 delegates up for grabs, and both candidates spent a significant amount of time there, @placeholder and Alaska were relatively small prizes -- with just 25 and 16 delegates at stake respectively. context: (CNN) Saturday was a big day for Bernie Sanders' quest for the Democratic presidential nomination as he swept to resounding victories in the caucus states of Hawaii, Washington and Alaska. But the delegate math is still in Hillary Clinton's favor. "We knew things were going to improve as we headed West," Sanders said at a jubilant rally before 8,000 people in Madison, Wisconsin -- a state that will hold the next major contest in 10 days. "We have a path toward victory." Takeaways from Western Saturday Clinton built up her delegate lead on the back of a strong run in the South, and Sanders argued Saturday his campaign always knew those states would be tough. In Madison, he said the map now offers more opportunities for his campaign as the contest progressed, largely because his wins are being powered by huge turnout among younger voters. @highlight Sanders hopes wins Saturday will help build momentum for larger states later on @highlight Clinton has a commanding overall lead in delegates	Hawaii
question: In @placeholder, abortion is illegal, with no exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother. context: (CNN) During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump famously said that there should be "some form of punishment" for abortion. Although he later tried to walk these remarks back, he and his mostly male fellow Republicans have quietly been making headway since he took office on an agenda to make sure women have as few options as possible for reproductive choice and education, including limited access to birth control and the preventative care offered by Planned Parenthood. This week, the House of Representatives passed the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," a bill criminalizing abortions after 20 weeks. The White House, through a statement of administration policy released on Monday night, backed the measure, meaning President Trump plans to sign it if it passes the Senate. Courts have recently struck down similar bans for violating Roe v. Wade and other rulings about abortion. In 2014, for instance, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case on Arizona's 20-week ban, letting stand a ruling from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which said Arizona's law violated multiple Supreme Court rulings, including Roe v. Wade. @highlight Alice Driver: Passage of a recent bill in the House of Representatives shows that for some Republicans, criminalizing abortion is a priority @highlight If Americans want to know what women's lives are like in a country where abortion is a crime, they should listen to women in El Salvador, she writes	El Salvador

They have good reason to be concerned. The Amazon-Whole Foods merger is not about improving customer service, products or choice, it is about destroying Whole Foods jobs through Amazon-style automation. Amazon's very business model is to remove as many humans from all facets of production and service as possible. Just as Walmart's big-box model destroyed small businesses when it spread across the country, Amazon's automation model, if widely adopted, potentially poses a huge threat to America's 16-million-strong service and retail workforce. @highlight Marc Perrone: The Amazon-Whole Foods merger will jeopardize thousands of grocery store jobs @highlight Amazon capitalizes on minimal human interaction, so Whole Foods employees face an uncertain future, he writes	Amazon
question: That was not the end of the drama as Modibo Maiga reduced the arrears late on, but @placeholder held on for a famous 4-3 win, with Wilson aware that similar lapses will not go unpunished in the future. context: Callum Wilson sounded a warning to his Bournemouth team-mates about maintaining their focus over the course of a game after his hat-trick sealed a narrow win over West Ham. The 23-year-old struck twice in the first-half and completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot to lead the Cherries to their first-ever Premier League win at the expense of the Hammers - who again ended the game with 10 men. Wilson's first-half brace looked set to send Bournemouth coasting to their maiden victory, only for West Ham to hit back through a Mark Noble penalty and a Cheikhou Kouyate strike. Eddie Howe's side regained the upper hand and wrapped up the points with Marc Pugh's goal and Wilson's penalty - for which Carl Jenkinson was dismissed having pulled back Max Gradel. @highlight Callum Wilson scored a hat-trick as Bournemouth beat West Ham 4-3 @highlight But the striker has urged the Cherries to maintain focus for 90 minutes @highlight West Ham rallied late on and could have snatched a point @highlight History was made as Bournemouth hung on for first top-flight win	Bournemouth

The comparisons with Messi have long gone but Stoke City fans may be looking at their version of Craig Bellamy, a quick, exciting forward whose pace caused injury problems and who responded best to an arm-round-the-shoulder manager like Mark Hughes rather than intense bosses.

Steven Gerrard knows the feeling. His MLS debut for LA Galaxy during the early hours of Saturday morning couldn't have gone any better. It was a vintage night for the Liverpool legend: a goal and two assists - one indirectly from a penalty. Even for Hollywood, the script of Gerrard's dream bow stretched the boundaries of reality. But even then, the 35-year-old's mind would wander 5,620 miles away.

President Trump decided to fire the FBI director heading an investigation into the President's campaign and its potential connections to Russia. Historians and political pundits instantly invoked the Saturday Night Massacre, when Nixon ordered the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who was investigating the Watergate break-in scandal, and the attorney general and his deputy resigned rather than follow orders. Then, as if President Trump wanted to underline a point, he moved forward with an Oval Office meeting and photo-op with Henry Kissinger, best known as Nixon's national security adviser. @highlight Julian Zelizer: As he moves forward, President Trump might want to think about the way he talks about "tapes" @highlight Trump should remember how the revelation of tapes in 1973 damaged President Nixon, Zelizer says	Nixon

The 41-year-old New Yorker exited a subway train, walked up a flight of concrete stairs to the bustling city street, and suddenly felt her tongue and throat swell. She started to sweat. She felt nauseous, short of breath and couldn't swallow. If Levin let any more time pass, she knew she wouldn't be able to breathe.

Asplund's defiant act only lasted for a couple of seconds -- just enough for Swedish photographer David Lagerlöf to capture the image. But Lagerlöf's photo, which he posted to Twitter, has rocketed around the Internet and heaped praise on the slender woman with the close-cropped hair who has inspired others by showing courage in the face of hatred.

US officials told CNN last week that the Justice Department has prepared charges to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a news conference on Thursday that Assange's arrest is a "priority" of the administration. But no Trump administration official went further in condemning the group than CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who, in a speech two weeks ago, called WikiLeaks a "hostile intelligence service."

The web of financial ties could offer a more concrete path toward potential prosecution than the broader and murkier questions of collusion in the 2016 campaign, these sources said. One year after the FBI opened an investigation, the probe is now managed by special counsel Robert Mueller. Sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 elections, alongside the ongoing scrutiny of possible illegal coordination with Russian spy agencies and alleged attempts by President Donald Trump and others to obstruct the FBI investigation. Even investigative leads that have nothing to do with Russia but involve Trump associates are being referred to the special counsel to encourage subjects of the investigation to cooperate, according to two law enforcement sources. @highlight Sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes @highlight The increased financial focus hasn't gone unnoticed by President Donald Trump	Russia

It was also very hot, and the contorted exertions he had undergone to remove his jacket had made him hotter still. A kidnap victim? No. Unlikely as it may seem, the man shut in the boot had chosen to be there. He had met neither the people driving him, nor their colleagues in the accompanying car in front, but they represented his only hope of escaping death. If they failed, he would be taken back to Moscow, interrogated and then shot in a killing-room deep in the dark heart of the headquarters of his employer, the dreaded KGB.

Whereas Wright suggested that a quintessential holding role would 'be the best place for him in the future,' Scholes suggested that due to his creativity, he needs a player sitting behind him in the middle of the park. Former Arsenal striker, Wright, added that 23-year-old Wilshere no longer has the pace he once did as a teenager and will therefore continue to 'get into trouble' making marauding runs forward.

question: One of the persistent weaknesses across the @placeholder system has been the biased and ugly approach to issues that relate to Israel. context: Washington (CNN) South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to be UN ambassador, questioned Wednesday at her Senate confirmation hearing whether the US's funding of the world body is worth it. And she diverged sharply from many of the foreign policy views Trump has expressed, telling senators that she expected the President-elect's views to evolve under the counsel of his national security team.

question: They’re not express but they’ve got good, solid actions and they wouldn’t let @placeholder down. context: David Lloyd reviews a stunning victory for England on day three of the third Ashes Test against Australia at Edgbaston. It would have been a difficult decision for England one-day coach Ashley Giles to send Steven Finn home from the last Ashes tour but it was the right one and I’m sure Finn understood it. Giles needed to get him out of that environment and back to the UK to sort out his problems and he has done that wonderfully well here after the meltdown he had with his action. It’s a lovely story. Masterclass before play yesterday on Sky with Ian Healy was sensational. If any young wicketkeeper missed it, it’s well worth catching up with.

The Black Cats took a fourth-minute lead through Jack Rodwell but this was cancelled out by Ariel Nahuelpan on the quarter-hour. Nahuelpan gave the Mexican top-flight side the lead after 25 minutes and Hirving Lozano added a third midway through the second-half. Pachuca had an opportunity to extend their lead but goalkeeper Jordan Pickford saved a penalty from Ruben Botta.

President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping meet for the first time Thursday and will seek to forge a connection and to stabilize the world's most important diplomatic relationship, despite a gulf between them in experience, temperament and global outlook. Both have a long way to come to meet in the middle. Trump, the brash, outspoken, political novice who seems to give little mind to policy details, anchored his campaign on China bashing.

question: The @placeholder would need to finish its work this week to leave a realistic chance of meeting that schedule. context: Washington (CNN) -- President Obama met Tuesday with Senate Democrats and emerged to say Congress was "on the precipice" of passing a sweeping health care reform bill. "There are some differences that still have to be worked on," Obama said after talks with Democrats trying to push their bill through the Senate. But "there is broad consensus around [a set of] reforms." Obama spoke after Connecticut Sen.

Republicans in the chamber used a procedure to end debate on the legislation and pass Senate Joint Resolution 39, an action that Democrats said broke Senate rules.

Admittedly the war of words bore little resemblance to the strife which has torn apart this often restive corner of Europe down the centuries. The Kingdom of Enclava had claimed a patch of territory by the Serbian border - unaware the land had already been staked out a month before by the Principality of Celestinia.

Arsenal’s French boss Arsene Wenger, whose side play at West Brom on Saturday, said: ‘I think it’s a nice gesture of solidarity. It’s not an obvious one for the fans, just like it would not be an obvious one for fans in France to sing God Save The Queen, because they don’t know the words. Symbolically it’s a very nice gesture.’ There are 72 French players at top-flight clubs, the biggest number from a single nationality after England, and a choral version of La Marseillaise will be played after the coin toss, with players from both teams joining officials in the centre circle facing the main stand. @highlight La Marseillaise will be heard across Premier League grounds this weekend @highlight French national anthem will be played in tribute to victims of Paris attacks @highlight Arsene Wenger, Roberto Martinez and Ronald Koeman welcomed gesture @highlight Football League has also given teams the option to do so this weekend too @highlight See full coverage of news and results from the Premier League	England

Vettel had high hopes of pushing for a fifth Formula One title after winning the second race of the season in Malaysia, but he has failed to finish on the podium in the past two races and trails championship leader Lewis Hamilton by 49 points. Vettel looked well set for third place at the Red Bull Ring circuit, until he pitted for new tires midway through the race. The change took far too long, with one of the mechanics struggling to fit the rear right wheel.

However, the World Heritage Committee opted not to include it during its annual meeting in Poland, a move praised by the Australian government as a "big win," but condemned by campaigners as "farcical." UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger has 55 entries, which include natural wonders and man-made sites. Jerusalem's Old City was added in 1982, and Aleppo, the Syrian city bombarded by air strikes, made the list in 2013. In a draft document later adopted without debate, the World Heritage Committee noted with "serious concern" coral bleaching along the Great Barrier Reef, and asked for an overall report on the state of conservation by December 2019. @highlight UNESCO leaves World Heritage Site off list of endangered sites @highlight Government calls decision a "win"; environmentalists disagree	Australia

question: Democrats' longtime backing for corporate-friendly policies has, unsurprisingly, created fertile ground for the appeal of a huckster who pledges to "make @placeholder great again." context: (CNN) Many observers may scratch their heads wondering how a crass billionaire can make inroads with working-class voters, but their confusion misses a critical point: The political revolt that benefited Donald Trump is not limited to the Republican Party, but is also in full fury inside the Democratic Party. Democrats, by embracing in the 1990s a series of bipartisan policies geared toward corporations at the expense of American jobs, have since failed to adequately defend America's working class, and those voters are making their presence felt at the ballot box as a result. Recent polls show the frustrations they feel toward the Democrats pose a real danger in the race for the White House, depending on who ends up winning the nomination. Quinnipiac found a battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to be an essential tossup in three key swing states: Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida.

After all, as a wealthy island nation with abundant natural resources and a relatively small population, Australia is never going to face the challenges destination nations in other parts of the world must confront. But despite criticisms from the United Nations and various international aid agencies, there is little prospect of a change in policy.

The comment was quickly decried by Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the Granite State, including the state's Republican governor who endorsed Trump during the 2016 campaign. During the call, according to the Post, Trump lashed out at Peña Nieto for the quantity of illegal drugs that come into the United States from Mexico.

The new threat came after the North Koreans locked South Korean workers out of a joint factory complex and announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor it shut down five years ago. Meanwhile, the United States announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to Guam, a Pacific territory that's home to U.S. naval and air bases. "The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow," North Korea's state news agency KCNA declared in its latest broadside.

Yet the President is fast losing the few friends he did have in the capital, following a wild period in which he offered cover to white supremacists and ignited a war of words with North Korea, leaving GOP allies in the crossfire. Thursday brought rebukes from two prominent Republican senators and a member of the highly influential Murdoch family, staunch supporters of the President.

"(The) agreement isn't a silver bullet, but part of EU's comprehensive strategy on migration," European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted Friday. The deal came after talks involving Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, Tusk and a handful of other key European officials. The final language was then put up for a vote before representatives from the 28 European Union member states, who approved it unanimously, according to the European Council president. The talks were held to address the largest influx of refugees into Europe since World War II, though the more than 1 million people who have fled to there pale compared to the more than 2.7 million registered in Turkey alone.

Same-sex marriage advocates had taken the government to court over the postal vote which they argued was both unnecessary and an illegal use of public funds. But in decision Thursday, the High Court ruled the national survey could go ahead.

Daniela Vargas, 22, was arrested Wednesday after sharing her family's story -- including her father and brother's arrest last month by ICE officers -- during a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi. Moments before her arrest by ICE, Vargas had advocated for young people who, like herself, were brought to the US illegally as children, then qualified for a temporary reprieve from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA.

I've written about McMullin's strategy before, and how he could play an unlikely spoiler to Trump and Clinton. But when he reached out to me last week, it wasn't to discuss his chances or his ground game. It was to talk about Syria. After noticing one of my so-called tweet-storms on the plight of the Syrian children, he thought we could have an important conversation on a topic that has been, over the course of this election, politicized, overshadowed or ignored altogether.

question: After its passing game failed to break down a resolute @placeholder-Bissau defense, Cameroon opted to go with the long ball. context: (CNN) "Pressure and I are like husband and wife," Gabon coach Jose Antonio Camacho once said. On today's showing, it looks as though the marriage is more likely to end in divorce than happily ever after. After Gabon's opening day draw with minnow Guinea-Bissau, anything other than a win against Burkina Faso would make qualification for the knockout stage unlikely. Despite a spirited second-half effort, Wednesday's 1-1 draw means the host nation will be watching the late match between Cameroon and Guinea-Bissau with a keen eye. With that must-win nature of the match in mind Gabon started brightly.

question: The share of the white vote was smaller -- 72% -- and @placeholder crushed Romney with non-white voters. context: Washington (CNN) Barack Obama was catapulted into office eight years ago by what was, at the time, the most diverse electorate in history. The Americans who head to the polls to cast ballots for his successor are even more diverse. Thirty-one percent of eligible voters will be racial or ethnic minorities, up from 29% in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. And the share of non-Hispanic white voters eligible to vote will be the lowest in history, the continuation of a steady decline in white voters over the past three decades. It's a stark reminder of the shifting demographics of the country: The Census Bureau projects that no one racial group will be a majority of the country by the year 2044.

Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's biggest atom smasher, have greatly increased what physicists know about the Higgs boson, which is responsible for giving other elementary particles mass. The results show with a new level of precision the way the particle is generated and decays, and how it interacts with other particles. CERN's Large Hadron Collider, located in a 27-kilometer (16.8-mile) tunnel beneath the Swiss-French border, was instrumental in the discovery of the Higgs boson.

question: Juelg began her career at @placeholder more than 20 years ago as an organoleptic scientist -- a job title even her own father struggled to pronounce -- working on the science of the senses. context: (CNN) Who says being "vanilla" is a bad thing? It's one of the most popular flavors in the world. Whether it's in cookies, cakes or ice cream, we just can't seem to get enough. The vast majority of bona fide vanilla bean is produced in Indonesia and Madagascar, but there's simply not enough supply to meet the global demand. That's where "flavor houses" come in. Their flavor chemists are responsible for formulating the flavoring in virtually every product you eat and drink that is processed, preserved or packaged before it gets to you. Case in point: Toward the end of the ingredient label on many packaged foods and drinks is the phrase "Contains natural and artificial flavoring."

After all, as noted widely in the media, Trump had offered zero evidence for his bizarre claim. Soon, the jokes were flying at Trump's expense. That evening, on "Saturday Night Live," the show's "Weekend Update" co-anchor Michael Che said it best -- with a bonus reference to Ivanka Trump:  "Well, this Saturday morning, while his nurse was at temple, Grandpa shuffled out of his room and got into his Twitter again."

question: Because those groups listed the same address, they claimed it was proof that the anti-@placeholder forces were operating from the same source. context: (CNN) This is the story of a little PO box in Northern Virginia and the conspiracy that wasn't. When the Republican presidential primary was still in full swing in March, officials from Donald Trump's campaign promoted a conspiracy theory -- one of many -- insisting there was a nefarious link between his political opponents and an anti-Trump super PAC. It began this spring when a group called Make America Awesome, an anti-Trump group, posted a photo of Trump's wife, Melania, that criticized her for posing semi-nude in a magazine photo shoot. Trump responded by crudely lambasting the physical appearance of Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi, and he justified it by claiming that Cruz was behind the attack on his own wife. @highlight Why do many campaigns and Super PACs share the same PO box? @highlight The reason is a lot less interesting than the conspiracy that has been alleged	Donald Trump
question: Farmers like @placeholder just hope these changes will mean a chance to earn a better living. context: HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- President Raúl Castro has moved quickly since taking the reins of power from his ailing brother, Fidel, last year to boost food production by putting more land into the hands of profit-earning farmers. Government officials hope that, with more land into production, the nation would need to import less food. Just east of the capital, Jose Luis Silva grows cabbage, corn and plantains on a small plot, one that he would like to see expanded. "I'd work it, and I'd work it well," he said. "It would solve their problem, and it would solve mine." When he says "their problem," he is referring to Cuba's disastrous state-run agriculture industry. Cuba imports about 80 percent of the food it rations to the public.

It's open to everyone and allows all people to communicate. Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches. But, so far, there have been several hitches in that plan. Not everyone has access to a computer and a broadband connection. Some governments still censor the Internet.

question: @placeholder's doctor revealed later that day that Clinton had just been diagnosed with pneumonia and "overheated" at the ceremony. context: Manheim, Pennsylvania (CNN) Donald Trump on Saturday evening offered up the surest sign yet that he is returning to the bombastic, bare-knuckle style that defined his primary run as he wrapped up a week that raised fresh concerns about his presidential campaign's viability. Straying from the prepared remarks on his teleprompter, the Republican nominee reignited his attacks on Hillary Clinton's physical and mental health, arguing that the former secretary of state "could be crazy" and lacks the "stamina" to be president -- even imitating Clinton stumbling into her car while leaving a 9/11 ceremony last month. And just as he is once again drawing attention to former President Bill Clinton's sex scandals, Trump took his political attacks a step further, questioning, with no evidence, whether the Democratic nominee is "loyal" to her husband. The attacks came as The New York Times raised fresh questions about his payment of taxes and business success. @highlight Trump's personally charged rhetoric comes as he continues to defend his debate performance @highlight GOP nominee also hit Clinton over her newly surfaced comments about Bernie Sanders' supporters	Bill Clinton

After a London leg packed with royal events and multi-billion pound business deals, Mr Xi and his wife were in Manchester as Mr Cameron sought to promote his Northern Powerhouse agenda.

Welcome to Race Across America (RAAM) -- 12 days of hell spent pedalling from the west coast to the east. The route stretches 3,000 miles across 12 states, taking in the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, Monument Valley as well as the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts, and demands 170,000 feet worth of vertical climbs. It's a third longer than the Tour de France and has to be completed in half the time, without stopping.

question: But recently Wenger has subverted that theory, letting @placeholder repeatedly run in behind the backline then introducing Giroud to give their wary opponents a physical challenge to deal with. context: OIivier Giroud and Theo Walcott's battle for Arsenal's striking berth is emerging as one of the most intriguing rivalries of the season. There have been great player rivalries over the years – Cesc Fabregas and Frank Lampard, Diego Costa and Martin Skrtel, Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira, Alan Shearer and Alf-Inge Haaland – but they are generally found between players from opposing sides (Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer aside). But manager Arsene Wenger has made it clear that Giroud and Walcott are being pitted against each other to lead the line and the players are well-aware of their situation. The England forward has started the last five games, scoring twice, but Giroud has come from the bench to replace him each time and scored twice in the previous two matches. @highlight Arsene Wenger has been opting between Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud @highlight Walcott has impressed for Arsenal in a more central berth this season @highlight Giroud has been effective coming on as a substitute in the last two games @highlight Wenger admits the pair are in competition with one another to start up front @highlight Giroud says he has never experienced a situation in his career such as this @highlight Arsenal's Plan B: Arsene Wenger has swallowed his pride and let top teams have possession... and it's reaping big rewards	Theo Walcott
question: @placeholder was 4-2 down when he saved three break points. context: Top-seeded Rafael Nadal opened his grass-court season with a hard-earned three-set victory over Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus at the Mercedes Cup on Thursday. The Spaniard needed 2 hours, 40 minutes to win 7-6 (5), 6-7 (5), 6-2 and book a place in the quarterfinals. 'The first match on grass is always tough,' Nadal said. 'He's a very good player and he'd already played a match.' Nadal had a bye into the second round. He will next face fifth-seeded Bernard Tomic, who cut short the comeback of German veteran Tommy Haas with a 7-6 (6), 6-2 victory. 'I need to be more aggressive, to return better, and to move better,' Nadal said after his first match since losing in the French Open quarterfinals to Novak Djokovic. @highlight No 1 seed Rafa Nadal defeated Marcos Baghdatis 7-6 (5), 6-7 (5), 6-2 @highlight Spaniard was playing his first match on grass this year at Mercedes Cup @highlight Nadal will play Bernard Tomic in next round as he prepares for Wimbledon	Nadal

In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu vowed in an historic U-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. But now President Barack Obama is contemplating using the United Nations as a trump card to force the issue.

question: @placeholder will approach unfamiliar objects and creatures to learn about them and may swim up to boats and submarines as they are unusual. context: A new attack submarine being tested by United States Navy has been given a special guard of honour - by a pod of dolphins. The nuclear powered, deep ocean sub was put through its paces off the coast of Newport, Virginia, on May 26 when the playful mammals were spotted leaping out of the water just a few feet from the front of it. The incredible footage of the dolphins - leaping in front of the new Virginia-class attack sub completing its sea trials - has been seen by hundreds of thousands of people since it went viral. Attack submarines are designed to seek and destroy enemy submarines and surface ships and carry Tomahawk cruise missiles to project ashore.

question: Dier patrolled in front of the back four while @placeholder and Ross Barkley helped out defensively but repeatedly made runs from deep. context: He said it with a big grin on his face and the sentence was followed by a laugh, but there was a twinkle in Dele Alli’s eye which indicated he was on to something nobody else was quite yet. Fourteen months ago away in Dusseldorf with England Under 19s, an 18-year-old Alli joked with Sportsmail that his style of play was a cross between Steven Gerrard and Yaya Toure. He discussed, outwardly showing signs of nerves but inwardly steeling them, how he wanted to replicate his Kop hero Gerrard and make his first England goal one to remember. Alli did not make that happen in the Under 19s match against Germany he would play the next day – the same opposition Gerrard struck a beauty against in 2001 for his first for England – nor for England Under 21s, but in his fourth match for the senior team on Tuesday night he hit one on a par against France for his debut goal. @highlight Dele Alli scored in England's 2-0 win against France on Tuesday night @highlight Alli drew a large portion of the plaudits on a difficult night at Wembley @highlight Eric Dier quietly played himself into contention for defensive midfielder @highlight Spurs team-mates Alli and Dier are flourishing for club and country @highlight Read: Dele Alli keen to remain grounded despite man-of-the-match display	Alli
question: @placeholder could have no complaints although halfway through their innings they looked on course for a total of 200 plus after being put in to bat on a slow pitch. context: England all-rounder David Willey powered Northamptonshire Steelbacks into the finals of the NatWest T20 Blast with the fastest century in the format by an English batsman against Sussex Sharks at Hove. The left-handed all-rounder hit 10 sixes - including five in an over from Mike Yardy - and seven fours in a 40-ball 100 that was also the second fastest in England in T20. Willey's sensational hitting ensured the Steelbacks made light work of a target of 166, reaching it with four overs and seven wickets in hand after they had restricted Sussex to 165 for seven. Willey launched his onslaught in the third over when he took 18 off England team-mate Chris Jordan, who was playing his first competitive game after two months out with a side strain. @highlight David Willey hit the fastest century in the format by an English batsman @highlight The Steelbacks all-rounder hit 10 sixes and seven fours in a 40-ball 100 @highlight Northamptonshire reached victory target of 166 with four overs to spare	Sussex

question: As @placeholder lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle, the physio tended to him as best he could, while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital. context: It was the sort of training ground accident that can happen to anyone, but it had far-reaching consequences for Philipp Lahm. So too, indirectly, for Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. Lahm's tackle on a team-mate at Bayern Munich's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough, until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble. As players milled round him, and a physio inspected the damage, the call went out for expert medical help. There wasn't any. To the dismay of Pep Guardiola, there wasn't a single qualified doctor on site. @highlight Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt quit this week @highlight His resignation came after Pep Guardiola blamed defeat by Porto on injuries @highlight The pair fell out as early as November over the treatment of Philipp Lahm @highlight Guardiola now has even more power and could stay at Bayern for a long time @highlight Manchester City want to bring him in as manager but he is unlikely to leave @highlight Guardiola, who is impatient with injuries, could even agree a new deal @highlight Former Barcelona boss has denied a rift with his medical staff this week	Lahm
question: @placeholder took the last round to make that even more likely, and it proved to be the case. context: Poor, suffering, heroic Martin Murray's fourth and probably best chance of winning the world title which has eluded him for so long ended in yet another heartbreak on foreign soil. This defeat to Arthur Abraham was not quite the most contentious of Murray's failed bids for a stardom but it is likely to become the most devastating. There were cries of 'cheats, cheats' from the knot of English fans in the TUI Arena but the fight was so close that it could not be classed as an out-and-out robbery.

question: After its passing game failed to break down a resolute Guinea-@placeholder defense, Cameroon opted to go with the long ball. context: (CNN) "Pressure and I are like husband and wife," Gabon coach Jose Antonio Camacho once said. On today's showing, it looks as though the marriage is more likely to end in divorce than happily ever after. After Gabon's opening day draw with minnow Guinea-Bissau, anything other than a win against Burkina Faso would make qualification for the knockout stage unlikely. Despite a spirited second-half effort, Wednesday's 1-1 draw means the host nation will be watching the late match between Cameroon and Guinea-Bissau with a keen eye. With that must-win nature of the match in mind Gabon started brightly. A mistake in the Burkina Faso defense inside the opening 60 seconds allowed Andre Biyogo Poko space down the right, but he was eventually smothered by a wall of white shirts. @highlight Gabon 1-1 Burkina Faso @highlight Cameroon 2-1 Guinea-Bissau	Bissau

question: @placeholder's recent speech at Heritage may be a way to ensure his name gets in the mix. context: Washington (CNN) -- Some conservatives unhappy with House Speaker John Boehner's leadership are looking for a replacement, and recent moves by Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling are fueling speculation he wants Boehner's job in the next Congress. Hensarling, who was part of Boehner's leadership team two years ago but left to chair the House Financial Services Committee, gave an expansive speech last week hosted by Heritage Action for America, a group that frequently and publicly clashes with Boehner. Asked afterward if he was interested in running for speaker, Hensarling initially said he was "flattered," and said, "It's not something I've aspired to. It's not something I'm thinking about." @highlight Boehner has been speaker since 2011 and has said he's not going anywhere @highlight Hensarling says he's flattered by the attention, but is not thinking about being speaker @highlight But he's leaving the door open as some conservatives have been unhappy with Boehner's leadership	Hensarling

Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva was joined on the field by his teammates this time. And many San Francisco 49ers knelt during the National Anthem, although some put their hands over their hearts. For the second consecutive Sunday, NFL players around the country and in London demonstrated in a variety of ways in response to President Trump's call for NFL owners to fire any "son of a bitch" who "disrespects our flag." Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick pioneered the protests last year when he took a knee during the anthem over what he said was social and racial injustice. @highlight Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch wears an "EVERYBODY VS.

question: In other words, refugees are already thoroughly vetted but, like so much else with @placeholder, the facts do not seem to matter. context: (CNN) President Donald Trump is commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day by slamming America's door on refugees. This is a ghastly repeat of the tragic mistake America made in 1921, when President Warren Harding signed the Emergency Quota Act, severely limiting the numbers of refugees and immigrants admitted to the country. Even at the height of Holocaust, as millions of Jews, homosexuals, political dissidents and others were exterminated, the US kept its doors shut. The Refugee Convention of 1951 arose from the ashes of the Holocaust to ensure that never again would the world turn refugees over to their executioners. How ironically tragic that Trump has chosen to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day by once again derailing America's commitment to refugee protection. @highlight On International Holocaust Remembrance Day, President Trump issues an order demanding "extreme vetting" of refugees @highlight Mark Hetfield: This is a tragic case of history repeating itself	Donald Trump

Fatah members are led handcuffed and blindfolded through a Gaza City checkpoint into Israel on Saturday. They were let in at the request of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas took control of a neighborhood in eastern Gaza City on Saturday.

"Sr Trump,the intelligence report is devastating. Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this.Are you a legitimate president?" Fox tweeted Friday night.

So for picture day, the team - which goes by the name 'Freeze', inspired by Elsa's ability to control ice and snow - temporarily traded in their regular uniforms for Elsa's signature icy-blue dress and pretty side braid.

The Dutch international has found himself partnering Chris Smalling so far this season because United missed out on Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos and Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels, not to mention Nicolas Otamendi joining rivals Manchester City.

"Part of your responsibility in these debates is to be tougher so the candidate you are helping is ready for the worst of it -- so you have to be mean. You need to get under their skin.

The fossils first caught the attention of paleontologists with the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science during a trek through the badlands of the Bisti Wilderness in northwestern New Mexico in 2011.

question: Such rhetoric not only calls into question Trump's strategy, it lets @placeholder slide on some of her most significant vulnerabilities, such as her email server and questions of trust and honesty. context: Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's tax controversy and his self-destructive lack of discipline threaten to drain the Republican nominee of something he can't afford: time. With 36 days remaining before Election Day, the real estate mogul's campaign is consumed with the fallout from a New York Times story published over the weekend that found Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995. That loss could mean Trump went 18 years without paying federal income taxes. Those findings -- which Trump's campaign isn't disputing but haven't been independently confirmed by CNN -- would be daunting for any presidential candidate to overcome.

Pious warriors would travel from across the Caliphate to fight on its northern frontier against the garrisons of Christian Byzantium. The men who died there for Islam were hailed by their fellow Muslims as the bravest of the brave. 'How pleasant to us,' one of them declared, 'is the fragrance of dust, and dirt, and blood flowing down our necks.' Today, young men are once again flocking to Syria to die as martyrs.

question: "Why should @placeholder be deprived of that sovereign right, since the principle of open doors is the basic principle for NATO?" context: KIEV, Ukraine (CNN) -- A planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia, President George Bush said Tuesday, responding to concerns that the U.S. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes. President Bush, with President Viktor Yushchenko, praised Ukraine's democratic and military reforms. "The missile defense system is not aimed at Russia," Bush said at a news conference in Kiev following talks with the Ukrainian president. "It's viewed as an anti-Russian device. Well, it's not."

The support for tougher gun laws rose to 55% in the newest poll -- the highest number since just one month after the shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in January 2013. But support for specific gun control measures was very strong, with 92% saying they wanted expanded background checks, 87% supporting a ban for felons or people with mental health problems and 85% saying they would ban people on federal watchlists from buying guns.

During a check-up, on his 43rd birthday, his doctor named summertime flu the most likely culprit. Then the same thing happened again, and it settled into a disturbing pattern: midweek chills and an escalating fever that would break on Sunday. By Monday, Chris would feel fine, only to have the sequence repeat itself. He joked about it with colleagues at T-Mobile, where he works in software development, "Well, I hope it's not cancer!"

About three months after Owens' final sale -- a 5-bedroom house with a jacuzzi -- the Boiling Springs, South Carolina, resident and his family learned that his realtor had confessed to killing four people and is a suspected serial killer. "We were like 'wow, we know this guy,'" said Owens, 49, "This feels kind of strange having that kind of person sitting at your kitchen table, walking through your house, and the idea that during that whole time, he's got keys to our house and could've gotten in at any time is just very nerve-racking." @highlight Todd Kohlhepp is well known in the Spartanburg area because of his robust real estate business @highlight Many residents express shock, disgust and surprise that he may be responsible for seven homicides	Owens

question: But Warren -- perhaps foreshadowing a fault line for @placeholder in 2020 -- told the Guardian she would "probably not" endorse a candidate who opposed abortion rights. context: Washington (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren delivered an unsubtle criticism of former President Barack Obama in an interview published Monday, saying the former president and other politicians are out of touch with "the lived experiences of most Americans." Warren was interviewed by The Guardian while promoting her new book, "This Fight Is Our Fight," amid heavy speculation about her plans for the 2020 presidential election. That speculation was only fanned over the weekend when President Donald Trump, at a rally in Pennsylvania, suggested that Warren would likely be his 2020 opponent.

Mikki Willis, of Ojai, California, was exchanging a duplicate birthday gift with his son at a toy store last month when four-year-old  Azai decided he wanted a Princess Ariel doll from the Disney film The Little Mermaid.

For others, it was about settling back into roles that were once familiar. Something old, something new. And something surprisingly blue, in the hue of Northern Ireland’s jerseys. Thankfully for Scotland, there was no off-colour outcome. A win is a win. Even when it comes after the typical drudgery that international friendlies can bring.

But Mark Rolfe, a professor in politics and rhetoric at the University of New South Wales, described what was perhaps Mr Shorten's most important speech as Opposition leader as being 'disorganised', 'distracting' and in some places 'incoherent'.

question: My friends, mostly Mexican-Americans and @placeholder, looked at Manzano's victory lap in a positive light. context: Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- When Leo Manzano won second place in the 1,500-meters final at the Olympics, he celebrated his well-deserved victory by waving two flags, that of the United States and Mexico. He has every right to do so: After all, he has dual citizenship for both countries. Some observers disagree with Manzano's action. On CNN.com, Ruben Navarrette voiced his concerns that Manzano was showing disloyalty to the United States even while he's wearing the USA jersey. Opinion: U.S. Olympic athlete, Mexican flag? Judging by the volume of comments in response to Navarrette's opinion, one would think that Manzano had committed treason. One reader wrote, "He is pathetic. ... Go back to Mexico.

But the Cherry Blossoms boss is refusing to rule out the possibility that the Japanese underdogs can slay the two-time champions when they kick off their World Cup campaign in Brighton. Toppling the world's number three-ranked nation looks a challenge of giant proportions, though. Springboks head coach Heyneke Meyer has named a starting XV boasting 880 caps as he looks to make the most of his star-studded squad.

Queenslander Ashleigh Dargush, 23, died in hospital after she lost her footing while on holiday with her New Zealand-born boyfriend Jared Wilford and his friends on December 27 last year. After a few drinks, the couple and three friends were walking along Kaueranga Valley Track, south-east of Auckland, to see a watering hole and go swimming when she plummeted six to seven metres, reported the New Zealand Herald.

question: Bill Clinton campaigned across the state for his wife, allowing the Clinton campaign to capitalize on the sort of surrogate @placeholder could never possibly match. context: (CNN) Hillary Clinton saw Bernie Sanders' New Hampshire blowout and raised him one in South Carolina. Riding the strength of her support among African-Americans to a resounding victory in the Palmetto State, Clinton seized the momentum in the Democratic presidential race -- winning her third of four early-state contests just three days before the race goes national on Super Tuesday. Here are five takeaways from South Carolina's Democratic primary: Clinton's going national It was a bumpy ride through the early states -- but Clinton's firewall of minority support held, helping her seal a close contest in Nevada and then turn South Carolina into her first dominant win of the 2016 race.

The dying request of Brando's first wife Anna Kashfi to be buried next to their son Christian has been blocked, according to reports. Christian's first wife Mary, who is still alive, had already bought the plot and refused to give it up even after Kashfi's death. Kashfi, who was born to a British father, has instead been buried in the plot above Christian, meaning they are head to head.

question: What really matters, we tell ourselves, is the deeper meaning that his words don't precisely say: he will work harder for the @placeholder people, he will get things done. context: (CNN) Presidents should be encouraged to play golf. The more golf they play, the less time they have to mess with our lives. I'm sure liberals would gladly raise the money to buy Donald Trump a golden golf cart if it kept him out of the White House. In fact, he needs little encouragement. Trump has played his 16th round of golf since becoming President. For this we might be grateful, were it not for two complaints: cost and shameless hypocrisy. There's good reason to defend the role of golf in US politics. It's the presidential game. The sport is kind on the bones of older, powerful men; it's a chance to mix gentle leisure with one-on-one diplomacy. And the symbolism of a man or a woman whacking a ball across a luxurious green is 100% American: individualism, abundance, good humor. @highlight Tim Stanley: Trump's expenses on golf outings and security for his wife and son remaining in New York are shocking @highlight GOP says it hates big government, but watch how it cuts programs to save money while bankrolling the self indulgence of the President, Stanley notes	American

question: Obama on Saturday accused McCain and vice presidential candidate @placeholder of avoiding the issues to "distort" his record. context: (CNN) -- Former Bush adviser Karl Rove said Sunday that Sen. John McCain had gone "one step too far" in some of his recent ads attacking Sen. Barack Obama. Karl Rove said both candidates are guilty of going too far in their attacks. Rove has leveled similar criticism against Obama. "McCain has gone in some of his ads -- similarly gone one step too far," he told Fox News, "and sort of attributing to Obama things that are, you know, beyond the '100 percent truth' test." The Obama campaign immediately leaped on the quote. "In case anyone was still wondering whether John McCain is running the sleaziest, most dishonest campaign in history, today Karl Rove -- the man who held the previous record -- said McCain's ads have gone too far," said campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor, in a statement sent to reporters minutes after Rove's on-air comments.

Here are seven key takeaways: 1. The governor isn't resigning Calls for Snyder to resign or be recalled are growing, from protests on the streets of Flint to mounting criticism on social media over the way the state has handled the crisis.

He also escalated his attacks on the press, pitting the news media against conservative values and suggesting he was going to take action soon to end what he described as a scourge of "fake news." Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump vowed an economic revival spurred by new jobs and scaled back regulation.

In scenes reminiscent of the  war film Apocalypse Now, the aircraft are shown against a backdrop of red skies opposite the port of Ashdod in Israel. In the 1979 classic, US helicopters are filmed roaring across the skies in a similar setting in war-torn Vietnam.

He did not apologize or speak to his own role in spreading the falsehood, which many people see as an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of America's first black president. Instead, Trump offered a curt admission tainted by yet another demonstrably false charge: that Hillary Clinton and her 2008 primary campaign "started" the racially charged smear. Both FactCheck.org (working with CNN's Jake Tapper) and PolitiFact have refuted the suggestion on multiple occasions. But the revisionist telling that Clinton was somehow involved persists, thanks in large part to Trump.

Depay could have been spared a few blushes if the shirt he wore, designated for Holland’s game against Iceland, had already brought the side luck, but the Dutch also ended up losing that match.

Kate Steinle's shooting death in 2015 sparked national debate over so-called sanctuary cities and became a rallying cry for Donald Trump on the campaign trail. Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant and repeat felon from Mexico who'd been deported five times, is accused of shooting Steinle, a 32-year-old medical device sales rep, as she walked on a San Francisco pier.

And no, he's not rocking the diamond-encrusted prize on his finger, either. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman denied that the leader kept a Super Bowl ring that New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft wanted back. Both sides agree that the ring, with its 124 diamonds, changed hands during Kraft's visit to St. Petersburg, Russia, in 2005. The New York Post reported on remarks made by Kraft, 72, at a New York awards gala Thursday. "I took out the ring and showed it to (Putin).

Leonardo Ulloa was not supposed to be starting this match, left out in favour of Andrej Kramaric. But when David Nugent suffered injury in the warm-up, Ulloa was sent on. Inside 15 minutes he scored a goal that provided the platform for a victory that looks increasingly like being part of a truly great escape.

question: @placeholder suffered from severe insomnia and would go for days with a few hours of sleep and in 1970, the worst year of his first term, he 'dealt with it at night by drinking'. context: Richard Nixon was a booze-ridden insomniac who told the new director of the FBI to be as ruthless as if he were a Nazi storm-trooper in a bid to win his loyalty. A new book reveals that the former President demanded that L. Patrick Gray be 'brutal, tough and respected' so that he could cover up his secrets.

Paul van Dyk witnessed the birth of electronic music "as a sub-culture" in his hometown of Berlin. Twice voted the world's top DJ, van Dyk has also earned a reputation as a freethinker and social activist, working for children's charities and speaking out against drug use in dance culture.

question: But this event is completely compatible with our declared policy, a policy which we carry out as the Prime Minister has said, at any moment that we receive intelligence that shows the intent to pass advanced weapons to @placeholder." context: (CNN) Syria is blaming Israel for alleged missile strikes Thursday near Damascus International Airport. Israel won't confirm nor deny responsibility for the explosion. But an Israeli government minister said "the incident in Syria" fits Israel's policy of trying to stop weapons from being shipped from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Here's what happened, and what the regional implications are: The explosion at dawn Two Damascus residents heard a massive explosion near the airport in the Syrian capital, the pair told CNN. The blast was so severe "a thud could be heard in Damascus city and surrounding areas," said Rami Abdulrahman, founder of the UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. @highlight Israel says the incident fits with its "policy" -- but doesn't claim responsibility @highlight Official: Israel wants to prevent the smuggling of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon	Hezbollah
question: "He's us, and in many ways, that's @placeholder's greatest triumph." context: (CNN) Sometimes a historic moment arrives like an IMAX movie: a big, loud, jarring event that bends the arc of history. Other times, though, it sneaks up on people. It seems modest at the time, but only later do Americans realize it marked a turning point -- that something new had burst onto the national stage and the old rules no longer applied. Did President Barack Obama have such a moment this week when he wept openly about children killed by gun violence? Some say yes, and that Obama's tears were more radical than people realize. Most people know the backdrop: While announcing executive orders Tuesday to strengthen gun control laws, Obama halted as the cameras clicked. He tried to regain his composure, but then the tears flowed as he talked about 20 schoolchildren murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. @highlight Obama's tears during his gun control speech were revolutionary, several historians and political scientists say @highlight He became the "father-in-chief," shedding tears over the deaths of white children, they say @highlight He also showed it was OK for men -- and political leaders -- to cry in public	Barack Obama

Fear in Kiev. And jeers from the West. When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region Tuesday and signed a formal decree, he made a major European crisis almost irreversible. His nation's lawmakers wept and gave him a standing ovation in parliament as he barraged the West for what he described as its numerous betrayals. But in Western capitals, there was no applause.

But some Phoenix immigration attorneys said employees of the motel chain also have been shining a light on undocumented guests, providing guest information directly to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Motel 6, in response to a report this week in the Phoenix New Times, said employees will no longer work with immigration agents.

The suspect, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot dead by other officers at the scene in Boston on Friday evening after he opened fire. A female bystander was shot in the arm.

The recalled products contain varying levels of belladonna extract, which can be dangerous or fatal when consumed in large doses, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. The recalled Raritan products include CVS Homeopathic Infants' Teething Tablets, Kids Relief Homeopathic Ear Relief Oral Liquid and CVS Homeopathic Kids' Ear Relief Liquid, which are sold nationwide.

question: As they go head to head with ISIS in @placeholder, coalition forces are pushing from other directions in an attempt to squeeze the militants out. context: Near Mosul, Iraq (CNN) Iraqi forces entered ISIS-held Mosul on Thursday for the first time in more than two years, and are in a head-to-head battle with militants on the front line, defense officials said. Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Tahsin Ibrahim told CNN that units of the 9th Armored Division had entered the key city and that troops had stormed the neighborhood of al Intisar in the east. Penetrating the eastern border has been the most significant breakthrough in the offensive, which was launched two weeks ago to free Mosul from the militant group's brutal rule. Officials had warned that entering the city would likely trigger the fiercest fighting yet, and that the battle is expected to be fought "street to street," or even "house to house." @highlight Iraqi security forces kill two ISIS suicide bombers in eastern Mosul @highlight Entering the city is a significant breakthrough, but troops face enormous challenges	Mosul
question: @placeholder also styled himself differently than he usually does on the "Colbert Report," further distinguishing between that show and his next late-night act. context: (CNN) -- CBS began to introduce the next host of the "Late Show," Stephen Colbert, by having current host David Letterman interview him and take a selfie together on Tuesday night. Letterman called Colbert "always entertaining," "the new kid" and "my friend." What Letterman was saying, implicitly, was that he supported CBS's pick for his successor. CBS announced that it had signed Colbert to a multiyear deal back on April 10, one week after Letterman revealed that he intends to retire in 2015. The unspecified timing of the transition came up during the chat between the two comedians. When Letterman asked about family matters, Colbert, who has three kids, said, "They're getting ready for me to hang around too much." He pointed out that he'll be signing off his Comedy Central show "The Colbert Report" at the end of the year, "and then there's -- I don't know -- when are you leaving?

question: "It didn't work out too well," @placeholder said of that bid. context: (CNN)Mitt Romney sparked a firestorm of criticism from Republicans when he announced his interest in running for president again, and now he's taking further friendly fire — from within his own circle of former aides. Two former top Romney campaign aides panned another Romney run, with one, Romney's former Florida campaign manager Brett Doster, backing Jeb Bush instead. Vin Weber, a co-chair for Romney's 2012 bid, told Bloomberg Politics in an interview that aired Thursday afternoon that he's not decided on who he'll support in 2016 and he's "not happy" about the former Massachusetts governor's reemergence onto the presidential politics scene. @highlight Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign co-chair is "not happy" about his interest in 2016 @highlight "There's not a lot of good precedent" for someone running successfully a third time, he said @highlight Romney's expressed interest has prompted criticism from all quarters	Vin Weber
question: When Morgan gave Jackson a ring that once belonged to Monroe, @placeholder returned the favor by teaching him his trademark dance step. context: Los Angeles (CNN) -- Keya Morgan sometimes sleeps with Abraham Lincoln's pocket watch clutched in his hand or with Marilyn Monroe's dress next to him. It makes for amazing dreams, he says. It also puts Morgan -- owner of a vast array of historical photos, documents and objects -- at the nexus of celebrity, conspiracy and collectibles. He's friends with an unusual array of famous people, many of whom he met while gathering his artifacts and information. Michael Jackson was among them. Marina Oswald still is.

question: To justify the premature support for @placeholder’s candidacy extended by FA chairman Greg Dyke, when the presidential race was in its infancy. context: Retreating, too late, from their unequivocal backing for Michel Platini, the FA noted the local difficulty he was having finding a contract to explain the £1.35million of Sepp Blatter’s largesse that arrived in his bank account four years ago. They concluded with a message of sincere goodwill. ‘The FA wishes Mr Platini every success in fighting these charges and clearing his name,’ a statement read. And this means? That they still don’t get it. How can the FA take sides in what is now a criminal investigation? How can the governing body of English football hope for a specific outcome on FIFA corruption?

In private testimony Thursday, Prince informed the House Intelligence Committee that he met in the Seychelles with Kirill Dmitriev, who is the chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, at the request of the United Arab Emirates to discuss business opportunities.

question: Yes, @placeholder appeared a little short of his best (though he denied he was rusty). context: It was a job for a code-breaker as much as a reporter. But I did my best by turning the binoculars on the familiar, full figure of Boris Becker sitting in the players’ box. We suspicious types in the press seats were focusing on the triple Wimbledon winner to see if he was conveying any semaphoric coaching advice to the defending champion, Novak Djokovic. What, for example, were we to make of Becker ruffling his hair with his left hand? What did fiddling with his wedding ring mean? Such thoughts taxed us in light of Becker’s pre-Wimbledon admission that he and Djokovic have ‘ways of communicating’ mid-match. This sort of chatter contravenes the laws of tennis, but is hardly cheating of the first order. Taking tetrahydrogestrinone, it is not. @highlight Novak Djokovic moved into the second round of Wimbledon on Monday @highlight World No 1 beat Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets on Centre Court @highlight Dojokovic edged out opponent 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to book his place in round two @highlight Wimbledon 2015 live!

French troops on patrol with the Afghan army as part of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The National Assembly voted in favor of Sarkozy's plan, 329-238. Socialist Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, told Prime Minister Francois Fillon: "You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence. It would probably mean less independence and less influence." The move did not technically require parliamentary approval, but the president's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it. @highlight French National Assembly backs president's plan to rejoin NATO @highlight President Nicolas Sarkozy's plan is politically sensitive @highlight France was a founding member of NATO but left in 1966 @highlight President Charles de Gaulle said in 1966 membership meant losing independence	Charles de Gaulle

Craig McDermott and Fiona Warzywoda were together for 18 years before they separated in February last year, the Supreme Court of Victoria was told on Tuesday. Both attended Sunshine Magistrates Court on April 16 last year before they headed separately to a nearby shopping centre.

question: So maybe it would be easy to say this is just @placeholder being Trump, and he should get on with the business of governing. context: (CNN) Doublethink is, of course, a construct made famous by George Orwell's classic and newly popular novel, "1984." It is the ability -- for all who engage -- to believe two apparently contradictory things at the same time, no matter what the facts actually state. So, for instance, President Donald Trump might be able to believe that 3 million people voted fraudulently in this country while also believing that his win was historic in nature. Never mind that the studies he cites as evidence do not provide any evidence. (One study, by the Brennan Center for Justice, concluded that the rate of voter fraud was minuscule --between 0.00004% and 0.0009%.) @highlight Gloria Borger writes that Trump might be able to believe that 3 million people voted fraudulently while also believing that his win was historic in nature. @highlight The studies he cites as evidence do not provide any evidence, she notes	Donald Trump

The young, insurgent candidate was so impressive, talk of a presidential future quickly ensued. He entered the Senate with high expectations, having won his race with the support of the new tea party movement while simultaneously appealing to mainstream conservatives. But his journey has not been without roadblocks. Leadership on controversial topics has slowed his rise.

The HMAS Choules, which has previously been used to provide offshore accommodation to Manus Island detainees, has been employed by the navy to hand the Vietnamese nationals back to their Communist government in an operation which could cost $2.8 million of tax payers money.

question: Netanyahu thinks @placeholder is bloodless and cold when it comes to understanding Israel's fears and its security challenges; Obama thinks Netanyahu is a conman who thinks only of himself with little sense of respect or sensitivity for American interests. context: (CNN) -- Without firing a shot, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has achieved remarkable results in his efforts to counter Iran's nuclear program. In little more than a year, the prime minister has managed to move the Iran nuclear issue to the top of the international agenda, to toughen sanctions, and in an extraordinary move, to push U.S. President Barack Obama to strengthen American policy so that preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons became the focus, rather than just containing Iran and its nuclear program. Indeed, if you throw in Republican challenger Mitt Romney's unwillingness to accept Iran even having the capacity to produce a nuke, Netanyahu's record is even better. @highlight Aaron Miller: Israeli PM Netanyahu has scored some victories on Iran nuclear program @highlight But he says Netanyahu's new emphasis on drawing a red line is counterproductive @highlight Israeli politicians are crying wolf, threatening an attack that isn't happening, Miller says @highlight Miller: Injecting the issue into U.S. election campaign further alienates President Obama	Barack Obama

The Iranian men risked the potentially deadly 31-mile journey after a mob stormed the French entrance to the tunnel. French police caught most of the migrants after the mass ‘invasion’ on Saturday but two of them made it to Folkestone more than 12 hours later, where they were arrested by British police. The pair risked their lives dodging high-speed trains and potentially lethal electrical currents inside the tunnel.

"Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with!" Corker is relatively short in stature -- he's 5'7" -- while Trump is right around 6'3". Corker's height was, according to the Daily Caller, one of the big reasons the Tennessee Republican didn't make the cut to be Trump's secretary of state.

Years before Zika virus first appeared in Latin America, it spread from Africa and Asia to Pacific islands. From 2013 to 2014, French Polynesia had 32,000 suspected cases of Zika virus. During this same period, there was also an uptick in cases of Guillain-Barre. Researchers in French Polynesia and Europe looked at those 42 cases of Guillain-Barre in the Pacific Island nation between October 2013 and April 2014.

EPA released the documents following weeks of prodding from The Associated Press and other media organizations. EPA and contract workers accidentally unleashed 3 million gallons of contaminated wastewater on August 5 as they inspected the idled Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado.

The image of Ceyda Sungur, dubbed the 'lady in red', her hair billowing upwards as officer Fatih Zengin sprayed tear gas in her face, was endlessly shared on social media. It was also replicated as a cartoon on posters, mugs and stickers during the protests in Istanbul.

Jerry Brown on Friday declared a drought emergency for the state, saying it is facing "perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago." The governor's announcement, made in San Francisco, came as a wildfire burned Friday with only 30% containment in 1,700 acres of foothills of Los Angeles County near Glendora. An illegal campfire apparently ignited the wildfire, and fire officials cited drought conditions as contributing to the blaze. In his declaration, the governor called for voluntary "20% conservation of our water use" statewide.

It's hard to come to terms with events like Fort Hood, Sandy Hook or San Bernardino. The recent massacre of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando was the worst terrorist attack on the United States since September 11, 2001. Because the gunman Omar Mateen targeted LGBT citizens, the event doubled as an anti-gay hate crime. It's even been said that President Barack Obama has become the nation's grief counselor. On 15 different occasions he has flown Air Force One to the killing zone du jour, delivered words of faith and frustration, hugged victims' families, and then gone back to other White House work.

With 36 days remaining before Election Day, the real estate mogul's campaign is consumed with the fallout from a New York Times story published over the weekend that found Trump reported a $916 million loss in 1995. That loss could mean Trump went 18 years without paying federal income taxes. Those findings -- which Trump's campaign isn't disputing but haven't been independently confirmed by CNN -- would be daunting for any presidential candidate to overcome.

But to hear the families of Nero and of Freddie Gray, the young black man who Nero was accused of assaulting, both lauding the judge who handed down the decision? Surely no one saw that coming. While Nero released a statement saying he and his family were "elated" with the ruling, Gray family attorney Billy Murphy, too, applauded the decision, saying, "You can't convict people unless you know the evidence," and that Judge Barry Williams had followed the law as he saw it.

Mane's 10 goals in 30 appearances for Southampton last season compares favourably with the six in 35 managed by Pedro.

Lewis had commented Friday that he didn't view Trump as a "legitimate" president since in his view "the Russians participated in helping this man [Trump] get elected." Well, Trump used Twitter to go after Lewis:  "Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart." In a second tweet Trump added,  "All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!"

Or it could be just another day. It depends on whom you talk to. This weekend, Italians go to the polls to vote in a referendum on whether or not the country should amend its 1948 constitution. The referendum is the brainchild of Matteo Renzi, Italy's energetic, 41-year-old Prime Minister. His intention is to defang the upper house of the Italian Parliament, the Senato, by cutting its numbers from 315 to 100, thus reducing its powers dramatically, making it more of a consultative assembly.

question: The goal energised @placeholder and they were a different proposition after taking the lead. context: Wolves striker Benik Afobe grabbed two goals to help seal a 3-0 Sky Bet Championship win over Huddersfield at Molineux. Afobe ended his four-game goal drought with a second-half double after Kevin McDonald, who had rescued a point with an injury time strike at Preston last weekend, gave Wolves a 23rd minute lead. The win saw Wolves extend their unbeaten run in the league to four games. They have also put together back-to-back wins since owner Steve Morgan announced on Monday that he was selling the club.

A final decision on declassifying the information now rests with the White House, and it was unclear how long such a process would take. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said the panel she leads voted 11-3 in a closed-door session to declassify the 480-page executive summary and 20 findings and conclusions of the five-year study. Feinstein called the report's findings "shocking," saying it "exposes brutality that stands in stark contrast to our values as a nation." @highlight The panel voted 11-3 for declassification of some of  the report @highlight Intelligence Committee report covers CIA interrogation programs during the Bush era @highlight Panel will submit entire report to the White House, which has final say on declassification @highlight This is the report that triggered allegations of CIA spying on the Intelligence Committee	Intelligence Committee
question: It could include cutting US assistance to @placeholder and a bolstering of security relationships with India, Pakistan's longtime adversary. context: (CNN) President Donald Trump and his national security team are scheduled to meet next week to discuss US strategy for Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, according to two administration officials familiar with the latest thinking. While the meetings could be delayed or rescheduled, the officials told CNN that the ongoing review appears to be drawing to a close. On Friday the Pentagon announced that the US killed Abu Sayed, the leader of ISIS-Khorasan, the terror group's Afghanistan affiliate in a drone strike on Tuesday. But there are major challenges ahead, and Defense Secretary James Mattis has been framing the internal discussions inside the administration as a "South Asia strategy." It encompasses a way ahead in Afghanistan, including the possibility of sending more troops, but also a look at new ideas for dealing with Pakistan, which the US believes is supporting or turning a blind eye to a number of terror groups operating inside the country. @highlight Mattis has been framing the internal discussions inside the administration as a "South Asia strategy" @highlight It is not clear if the Trump administration still plans to unveil an entirely new ISIS strategy as promised during the campaign	Pakistan

What are the rules for asylum seekers in Germany? Germany has been rattled by four attacks in the past two weeks, three of which authorities say have been carried out by asylum seekers or refugees inspired by Islamist extremism. The attacks have given way to mockery by some Germans as well as foreigners, who have dubbed the recent weeks of bloodshed on social media as #MerkelSommer, or even "Merkel's summer of slaughter." @highlight Merkel defends Germany's decision to accept 1 million refugees in 2015 @highlight Chancellor confirms ISIS can infiltrate the refugee route	German
question: The controversial pay-as-you drive @placeholder has a history of high-speed incidents as drivers tear along the rarely used carriageways. context: A speeding motorist was stopped by police after being caught driving at 149mph on the M6 motorway. Officers were carrying out routine patrols on the M6 toll between junctions T7 and T5 in Staffordshire when they spotted the Ford travelling at more than double the speed limit. The police's on-board speed detection cameras recorded the driver travelling at 149mph, which equates to nearly two-and-a-half miles in a minute. They pulled the driver over between Cannock and Shenstone on Sunday evening and reported the motorist for speeding offences. Officers working for the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) then tweeted a picture which showed the shocking 149mph speed on their on-board surveillance camera. @highlight Driver caught travelling at 149mph on M6 in Staffordshire on Sunday night @highlight Police clocked his Ford doing double the speed limit with on-board camera @highlight Motorist believed to one of fastest drivers caught in UK in last 12 months @highlight Two drivers caught doing 146mph earlier this year and another 145mph	M6

Abu Usman al-Hassan - the  top ISIS commander in its Mosul stronghold and a member of the terror group's advisory board - is believed to have been killed some time last week. According to local reports, al-Hassan was sentenced to death following a short trial, at which he was formally accused of conspiracy.

Many of the slaves had been forgotten to the world until the Virginia Historical Society received a $100,000 grant to pore over some of its 8 million unpublished manuscripts -- letters, diaries, ledgers, books and farm documents from Virginians dating to the 1600s -- and began discovering the long-lost identities of the slaves, said society president and CEO Paul Levengood. @highlight The Virginia Historical Society finds 3,200 slaves named in private documents @highlight The unpublished documents are from Virginians' attics, basements and desk drawers @highlight "We sold all the negros 43 in number at astonishingly large prices," an 1858 letter says @highlight One user of the society's free database of slaves finds the owner of his great-great-great-grandfather	Virginia

Nicola Sturgeon's SNP government has insisted that £2.1million in revenue which traditionally finances the head of state stays north of the border. Asked if the Scottish leadership had offered to find an alternative way to meet their contribution towards the cost of funding the sovereign, which came to £37.9million last year, a senior palace source candidly admitted: 'No, not that we are aware of.'

Kevin O'Leary, the business man-turned-reality TV star, announced Wednesday that he will stand in the now 14-person race to lead Canada's Conservative party. The winner will likely challenge current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the country's 2019 federal elections. "Canadians need a Prime Minister with a smart plan to kick start the economy; a Prime Minister who supports small businesses, who will fight for hard working Canadians and will stop wasting our money," O'Leary said in a statement on why he's running.

question: Horowitz believes as more users "upgrade" to @placeholder — which essentially just means letting Google know who you are — it'll become clear to them that Google's many services become much more useful. context: (CNN) -- Google+ has a problem. It's not engagement or the lack of a clear way to monetize itself. It's not those sometimes-unwieldy friend-organizing circles, or even the perception that no one other than nerds uses the service. The problem, its creators believe, is that many people keep comparing it to Facebook -- or, more broadly, social networks. While social interaction is a key part of Google+, the project is much more ambitious. Google+ is nothing short of a wholesale upgrade to all of Google's products and services, but with the identity of the user incorporated. Mashable sat down with Vic Gundotra, Google's senior vice president of social business, and Bradley Horowitz, Google+'s vice president of product, at the Google I/O developer conference.

With the score at 1-0 following Jeremy Mathieu's 73rd minute header, tempers flared between Celta striker Fabian Orellana and Sergio Busquets as the Barcelona midfielder attempted to waste time during the closing stages. Orellana remonstrated angrily with the match officials before grabbing a lump of grass from the floor and throwing it in the direction of Busquets.

As Moody, whose death at the age of 91 was announced yesterday, recalled in his autobiography, there were 17 curtain calls that night, including ‘a great cheer establishing me, in all humility, as the star of the show’. Without Bart, Moody would never have got to sing such memorable numbers as Reviewing The Situation and Pick A Pocket Or Two.

question: In @placeholder, the freedom of expression is enshrined in law. context: (CNN) A vegan woman has twice had her application for Swiss citizenship rejected because annoyed locals object to her "loud" opinions about animal rights. Dutch national Nancy Holten, 42, has lived in Switzerland for more than 30 years. There, applications for citizenship are determined by local governments -- sometimes with input from residents. And among the requirements are that a person is integrated in the Swiss way of life and familiar with Swiss customs and traditions. And therein lies the issue the residents of Gipf-Oberfrick have with Holten.

question: @placeholder tonight insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders' debates context: Nick Clegg launched a bizarre class-war attack on David Cameron yesterday as plans for election TV debates descended into acrimony and farce. The Deputy Prime Minister accused his boss of a ‘Downton Abbey attitude’ after he brought an end to years of negotiations on the terms of debates. Mr Cameron claimed he was ‘unblocking the logjam’ by agreeing to take part in one contest featuring seven party leaders but ruling out two further debates. He attacked broadcasters for ‘the mess’ they had made of plans for debates and accused them of wanting to talk about no other issues. However, even the single seven-way debate is in doubt after the BBC said Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party – the fourth largest in Parliament – would not be allowed to take part. @highlight Downing Street has rejected broadcasters' proposals for three TV debates @highlight Made a 'final offer' of single 90-minute show featuring  seven party leaders @highlight The debate would also have to take place before the start of the campaign @highlight Nick Clegg said he was 'bemused' by 'lofty pomposity of the Conservatives' @highlight Ed Miliband said that the Prime Minister was 'cowering from the public'	Cameron

The incident -- called an "organized and premeditated" terror attack -- occurred Monday in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Police officers at the scene shot dead dozens of people in the mob. Thirty-one cars were vandalized, including six that were set ablaze. It was not immediately known how many people were killed and injured.

In the letter, obtained by CNN, Mexico asks the de facto Honduran government to guarantee Zelaya's safety from the embassy to the airport, where a Mexican Gulfstream III jet would fly his family to Mexico.

question: It may be asking too much to judge the @placeholder-Obama summit through deliverables alone. context: New Delhi (CNN)India and the United States, the two largest democracies, seem like natural allies. The kinship between their leaders, however, has been a bit of a surprise. There are, of course, the obvious perceptual differences: President Barack Obama studied law at Harvard, relishes golf and prefers his suits sober, in dark gray or navy blue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a modest education, swears by yoga and readily wears flamboyant hats depicting India's diverse heritage. And then there's the small matter of paperwork: Modi was a pariah in the United States just one year ago, his visa revoked over his handling of riots in 2002, when he was chief minister of the state of Gujarat. @highlight U.S. President Barack Obama travels to India this weekend @highlight Ravi Agrawal: Kinship between leaders has been a surprise	Modi

He was due to travel to Morocco to see his grandparents, but never arrived. Instead, Hagaoui went to Istanbul, called his family from somewhere in Turkey, and then vanished into Syria. His family and friends were stunned. One friend told the local newspaper SudInfo: "He doesn't even speak Arabic very well." On Friday, the day after Belgian police killed two extremists during a raid in Verviers, a CNN crew met Hagaoui's mother and sister at her home, just a few hundred yards from the scene of the shoot-out.

CNN has obtained sections of that 300-page appeal, including the defense argument that the trial judge erred by not allowing the testimony of Dr. Arnold Klein, a dermatologist the defense contended addicted Jackson to Demerol in his last weeks. Murray's appeal, which will be filed Monday, also argues that prosecutors never proved Jackson was hooked up to an IV drip of the drug that killed him.

Authorities say Lane was shot in the back while he was jogging in Duncan. Defense attorneys say Luna, who riding in a friend's car, fired the shot, but only meant to scare Lane. Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot. @highlight Oklahoma judge sentenced 18-year-old Chancey Allen Luna to life in prison without parole @highlight He was found guilty in April of first-degree murder in the killing of Christopher Lane @highlight Oklahoma teen shot Lane, an Australian baseball player, in the back from moving car as victim was jogging in Duncan on August 16, 2013 @highlight Defense claimed Luna only meant to scare Lane, not kill him	Duncan

After all, as a wealthy island nation with abundant natural resources and a relatively small population, Australia is never going to face the challenges destination nations in other parts of the world must confront. But despite criticisms from the United Nations and various international aid agencies, there is little prospect of a change in policy.

Starting their season just 39 days after the curtain fell on 2014/15, the Hammers could have played six competitive games by the time Bilic takes his squad to the Emirates Stadium.

It was 1965 and she was on the cusp of her singing career, crooning with Lucy in a glamorous double act called the Simon Sisters. Connery, with four James Bond films under his belt, was a major star.

That's the takeaway of a series of four studies of committed couples in both the United States and Switzerland. "Sex makes you feel good, not just because it releases more hormones or endorphins but also because you will feel more affection with your partner," said clinical psychologist Anik Debrot of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, lead author of one of the studies.

Yakubu Kabu confirmed to CNN that he saw his daughter speaking in the new video, which demands the release of Boko Haram fighters in exchange for the kidnapped girls. The Nigerian government has said it is still "in touch" with Boko Haram and "working for the girls' release," the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture said on their official Facebook page. "We are being extremely careful because the situation has been compounded by the split in the leadership of Boko Haram," said Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information of Culture, according to the statement. @highlight A Boko Haram militant tells Nigeria to release jailed fighters in exchange for abducted girls @highlight The man says at least 40 of the girls have been married off	Boko Haram
question: And while the last few weeks have posed challenges to the @placeholder-Putin alliance, they are likely not reflective of the larger scale support the two leaders have for each other. context: (CNN) On one hand, Donald Trump's praise of France's far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who appears to have received enough votes in Sunday's election to advance to the May 7 runoff, is not surprising. Le Pen, like Trump, ran a campaign that was anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and traded on white supremacist themes. (It's no coincidence that former Klan leader David Duke has publicly praised both Le Pen and Trump.) On the other hand, you would think Trump would be hesitant to publicly praise a candidate like Le Pen, an avid supporter of Vladimir Putin, particularly given that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said just two weeks ago that US-Russian relations had reached an all time low. @highlight Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have praised Marine Le Pen, the pro-Putin French presidential candidate @highlight Dean Obeidallah: Despite recent drama between Trump and Vladimir Putin, they and Le Pen are natural allies	Donald Trump

Dubbed the 'battle trannies' by the Moscow media, the two suspects Alexei T. and Viktor E - who prefers to be known as Viktoria and dresses as a woman - are accused of maintaining contacts with armed extremist groups. Another police source Alexander Vinogradov said: 'We would always be interested in stopping people from joining a terrorist organisation but in this case there is a double motive, as our information is that this would not be accepted if they managed to get all the way to Syria, and it is unlikely that they would live very long once their sexual orientation was revealed.' @highlight Viktor E. and her friend Aleksey T left their home village of Kamchatka Krai @highlight 22-year-olds were fed up with being 'persecuted' by friends and neighbours @highlight Pair are said to have watched ISIS recruitment videos before going to Syria @highlight Viktor reportedly believed she would be accepted as a woman by ISIS @highlight But the terror group regularly throws gay men to their deaths from the roofs of tall buildings or stones them in front of bloodthirsty crowds	Viktor
question: The role required that @placeholder un-learn the societal disciplines of being an adult. context: (CNN) -- The movie "Big" is celebrating its 25th anniversary, but the 1988 blockbuster almost didn't become the movie beloved by audiences today. For starters, Tom Hanks originally turned down the lead, writers were seriously considering the title "When I Grow Up," and producers had trouble attaching a director to the picture. "Tom Hanks was my first choice but he said 'no,' " director Penny Marshall told CNN, "and so did everyone else because there were other movies with the same premise. So I decided to go with someone who's a behavioral actor -- Bob DeNiro."

Cyclospora infections or cyclosporiasis are caused by ingestion of the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis in food or water. Cyclospora infect the small intestine and most commonly cause watery diarrhea; other symptoms include abdominal cramping, nausea and weight loss. Those with cyclospora infections start to experience symptoms about seven days after ingesting the parasite and usually need to be treated with an antibiotic. If untreated, the illness may last over a month and could continue over a recurring cycle.

question: Burr says he wants to have a public hearing with @placeholder and other social media companies as early as next month. context: (CNN) Sen. Mark Warner says the "million-dollar question" still unanswered about the Facebook election ads sold to Russian-linked accounts was how the Russians knew whom to target on Facebook. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told CNN the committee expects this week to begin viewing the 3,000 Russian-linked Facebook ads, which Facebook earlier this month disclosed were connected to more than 450 inauthentic accounts. Facebook agreed last week to turn the ads over to the House and Senate intelligence committees. Warner's burning question involves not just the content of the ads but how they were deployed. "Did they know this just by following political news in America? Did they geo-target both geography and by demographics in ways that at least at first blush appear pretty sophisticated? These are the kind of questions that we need to get answered and that's why we need them in a public hearing," Warner said. @highlight The Senate intelligence committee has met with Facebook officials in a closed session @highlight Twitter officials are coming to talk to the panel Thursday in a closed session	Facebook

Six months on and Hazard is the nadir of a shambolic Chelsea side, the defending champions sitting at an embarrassing 15th in the table with just 11 points in as many matches.

It is believed to be the first deal  American sportwear giant's kind, with the 30-year-old's contract worth up to $500million (£333m). Sportsmail assesses what does the enormity of the four-time MVP's deal with Nike now means for those concerned. Nike's eye-watering deal to James' is based on the assumption that he will stay scandal-free throughout the rest of his career, as well as have staying power in the many years of his life when he is no longer an active player.

The recent climate event -- characterized by warming waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean -- has been one of the strongest ever recorded, and its impact has been felt far and wide. Record smashing temperatures hit Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. In Malaysia, lakes dried up and vegetables withered. Weak monsoons and killer heatwaves left India barren and praying for rain.

question: Republicans certainly aren't rushing to embrace @placeholder now that Trump is proposing it, but some lawmakers are opening the door to consider reducing Pentagon infrastructure, even if it isn't a full-blown BRAC round. context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's vow to massively rebuild the US armed forces comes with an interesting wrinkle in his first budget request: a call to close military bases. Trump's Pentagon is asking for a new commission to study closing or revamping bases in its budget request, as the Defense Department says it has upwards of 20% excess infrastructure capacity and slimming down would save money. But the request to close bases, which would not occur until 2021, is an uphill climb on Capitol Hill. Republicans are already unhappy that Trump did not propose a bigger military budget after his pledge to massively add ships, planes and troops. GOP lawmakers say going through another round of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process is another step in the wrong direction when the military has been constrained for years by the so-called "sequestration" budget caps. @highlight Trump budget calls for new round of BRAC study of possible base closures @highlight Congress is unlikely to adopt the plan	BRAC

In the latest edition of its English language magazine, Dabiq, the terror group urged Muslims unable to make the journey to Syria or Iraq to carry out attacks elsewhere in the world. It suggested targeting 'Japanese diplomatic missions' in Bosnia, Malaysia and Indonesia, prompting a tightening of security.

question: Autocrats around the world watching @placeholder will no doubt find some comfort in the turmoil. context: (CNN) Let's face it: This century, this millennium, has not been good for democracy. From this bizarre American election campaign to the pulverized wreckage of a pro-democracy movement in Syria; from the increasingly bloated jails in Egypt to the disappearing free press in Turkey; from the remnants of a demoralized opposition in Russia to the never ending re-election of some African presidents, there is ample evidence of the tough times this much-vaunted system of government is facing. Of course, the notion that democracy -- letting the people choose the leaders who govern them -- is the best way, the only legitimate way, to ensure the well-being of a country, remains a source of inspiration for millions around the world. But the sad truth is that its march of late has proven erratic, halting. And in too many cases, it has ended up crushed in a pool of blood.

Widely expected to be a front-runner in France's presidential elections next year, Le Pen says Trump's victory boosts her chances of winning because it "makes the French realize that what the people want, they can get, if they mobilize themselves."

But it will be celebrated not just by the Hindu nationalist supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but also by many other Indians who believe that their country has remained passive for too long in the face of repeated terror attacks by groups assisted and sheltered by the Pakistan army's powerful intelligence services. In truth, the strike itself does not represent a radical new policy. India conducted local cross-border raids through the 1990s and 2000s, usually as reprisals for particular attacks. But this high-altitude, tit-for-tat war on the Line of Control, which divides Indian and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir, was largely unknown to the Indian public, who grew frustrated at their government's apparent inaction. @highlight Shashank Joshi: India's decision to go public about a strike into Pakistan-controlled territory is a break with the past @highlight But the more Narendra Modi gloats, the more Pakistan will be compelled to show it remains unbowed	Pakistan

One year after the FBI opened an investigation, the probe is now managed by special counsel Robert Mueller. Sources described an investigation that has widened to focus on possible financial crimes, some unconnected to the 2016 elections, alongside the ongoing scrutiny of possible illegal coordination with Russian spy agencies and alleged attempts by President Donald Trump and others to obstruct the FBI investigation.

question: Alongside the Paris prosecutor's investigation, several complaints have been announced in @placeholder by an environmental association and the French owners of Volkswagen diesel cars as well as shareholders in the VW auto group. context: Adding to a raft of investigations worldwide, Paris prosecutors have launched a preliminary probe into possible fraud over the pollution-cheating software installed in diesel engines by Volkswagen. The French investigation opened following information received from an elected official in the Paris region and also from public statements about the scandal that has engulfed VW, a judicial source said today. Volkswagen has admitted 11million vehicles worldwide are equipped with the software that dupes pollution emission testing. The French probe into suspected 'aggravated' deception will only concern cars sold in France. Nearly one million diesel cars of Volkswagen brands – VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat – have been sold in France in recent years fitted with the pollution-cheating software, according to VW's French unit. @highlight Nearly one million VW brands fitted with cheat devices were sold in France @highlight French minister branded VW's deception 'a form of theft from the taxpayer'	France

Just hours after a parent of an abducted girl claimed the Defense Ministry lied Wednesday about all but eight girls finding freedom, the director of defense said the initial report was "not intended to deceive the public." Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade's statement didn't indicate how many of the girls were still unaccounted for.

And now it turns out that George Zimmerman might need the same thing millions of Americans are looking for: a job. As Zimmerman and his legal team mounted their defense, they convinced people across the country to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to help him. Living expenses, bodyguards and expert witnesses were costly, they argued on websites set up to raise money in the case. So what's next, now that a jury has acquitted him? For the 29-year-old Florida man, the financial picture is cloudy. Critics have already accused Zimmerman of profiting from the case. Will the donations keep pouring in?

Nokia is attempting to woo app developers with such incentives as pre-installing their software on the forthcoming phone, prominent promotion for their products and funding development of an app, according to three people involved in the negotiations. A vibrant app store has become a major selling point to smartphone customers. In the past, Nokia, which sells the highest volume of mobile phones worldwide, has made efforts to work with some creators of apps for its platforms.

question: @placeholder's practices, which have vastly harmed our democracy, have been brilliantly exposed and savaged through comedy. context: (CNN) You could be excused for mistaking last night's 69th annual Emmy Awards for a Comedy Central election-night special. After all, there was Stephen Colbert, the man who -- with Jon Stewart -- put "fake news" on the map long before the Trump Administration was a twinkle in Vladimir Putin's eye. And there were Alec Baldwin and Kate McKinnon, accepting golden trophies for their cutting and hilarious depictions of President Trump and his chief 2016 campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, on "Saturday Night Live."

question: More @placeholder are dying from drug-resistant infections -- the garden variety staph and strep bugs that used to be swiftly cured with a course of routine antibiotics. context: (CNN) As House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled the Republican health care bill from voting, I could almost hear the giant sigh of relief from Atlanta and across the nation's health care establishment. Hidden in the nooks and crannies of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was a provision to eliminate $1 billion in disease prevention funds from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Those cheers I imagine I hear right now in Atlanta are huzzahs from the CDC headquarters. According to the GOP plan, "Our Step-by-Step Approach," the first of three steps towards reshaping the American health care market was thwarted on Friday when the White House, recognizing that splits within the Republican Party could not be resolved to allow passage of the AHCA, instructed Ryan to pull the bill. Step two, led by Secretary Tom Price and his team at the Department of Health and Human Services, may still proceed: "going through every page of regulations and guidance related to the Affordable Care Act to determine whether or not they work for patients," with an eye to eliminating the rules laid out by the Obama administration. @highlight Laurie Garrett: The life expectancy of Americans is lower than those living in some third-world countries @highlight The GOP health care bill would have decreased it even more by cutting funding to life-saving preventative care, she writes	American
question: The question for @placeholder, though, has been, "Is he crazy or is he smart and strategic?" context: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump believes the "greatest immediate threat" to the US is North Korea and its nuclear program, a senior administration official told reporters. Trump has already called on China to take action to rein in North Korea, over which China has considerable influence and leverage, the official said. "You gotta work on North Korea," Trump told a Chinese official on February 27, the senior administration official said, apparently pointing to a brief meeting at the White House between Trump and Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, the highest-ranking Chinese official Trump has met with since taking office.

Joe W. Gordon, whose Thai name is Lerpong Wichaicommart, cooperated during the investigation of his case and pleaded guilty, resulting in a lenient sentence, his lawyer said. But the charge of writing and posting articles insulting the monarchy under the Southeast Asian country's lese majeste laws can yield a sentence as high as 20 years in prison in the Buddhist country, where the king is highly revered. @highlight NEW: State Department spokesman says U.S. "troubled" by case outcome @highlight Gordon was arrested in May for posting a link on his blog to a banned book @highlight Gordon's guilty plea leads to his lenient sentence, his lawyer says @highlight The king has pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past	Thai
question: Sometimes, @placeholder will have his own ideas about a shot. context: (CNN) Aaron Sheldon has never particularly enjoyed riding the bus. But to his young son, Harrison, it is an adventure. "One day we're on the bus downtown, and I'm just sitting there looking at him and he's just in awe of such a mundane and pedestrian task," said Sheldon, a photographer who lives in Columbus, Ohio. It reminded him that even the most ordinary acts can seem extraordinary to someone experiencing it for the first time. "I wanted to try to capture that sense of wonderment that kids have just in our everyday world," Sheldon said.

question: Talking about changing liberal laws is another ominous sign of @placeholder's aspiration to strongman status. context: (CNN) Sometimes political change happens suddenly. You wake up, and a military junta has taken over your country, or some other kind of revolution has happened. But other times, the climate shifts little by little. A few big gestures of aggression, and then things settle down. Then the cycle repeats, until one day the tipping point is reached and you find your democracy has been transformed into an autocracy. We're at serious risk of this happening in America. Trump's first 100 days have been a lesson for him in what he can and cannot easily do. He's followed the authoritarian playbook in attacking those sectors of society that uphold the value of evidence (the judiciary, the press, researchers). He's purged the bureaucracy; hired family members (who thumb their noses at conflicts of interest); bullied critics on Twitter; and incited a climate of hatred toward targeted groups (Muslims, Latinos, immigrants, and more). @highlight Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Authoritarians are often ungenerous people, but they do give us one gift @highlight They tell us what they are going to do before they do it, both as an intimidation and as a challenge, she writes	Trump
question: Mosques urged @placeholder residents to donate blood for the wounded. context: Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A suicide bomber wearing an explosives-packed vest attacked a police recruitment center in northern Iraq Tuesday, a bloody strike that killed at least 65 people and wounded 160 others. The attacker -- who blew himself up when he was among hundreds of recruits -- staged the assault at a checkpoint where people usually wait their turn to enter the center. The explosion caused a fire at a fuel station nearby, police in Tikrit said, and most of those killed and wounded were young men who came to join police forces. Tikrit's general hospital was overwhelmed with wounded people, some of whom had to be sent to hospitals in nearby towns of the Salaheddin province and to other locations, such as Irbil and Kirkuk. @highlight Police say the attacker targeted police recruits @highlight Tikrit is nearly 100 miles north of Baghdad @highlight Recruitment centers have been frequently attacked	Tikrit

The intrigue now threatening to swamp Washington politics deepened on Monday when Trump's son-in-law and trusted adviser, Jared Kushner, offered to testify to senators about meetings with senior Kremlin officials -- including the head of a bank closely linked to President Vladimir Putin's government. And more revelations about a secret trip to the White House complex by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes spurred claims by Democrats that he was in league with the President's aides to subvert his own panel's investigation into Moscow's alleged election meddling and ties to the Trump campaign. @highlight On Monday, Kushner volunteered to testify @highlight Later in the week senators will weigh in	Donald Trump
