Census controversy An upcoming census planned by the central government has triggered further unrest amid fears it could exacerbate tensions between the state's majority Buddhist population and the Rohingya -- a stateless Muslim minority not recognized as citizens or one of the country's 135 "official" ethnic groups.

Here's a look at how ISIS has made (and taken) millions: ISIS makes between $1 million and $2 million each day from oil sales, numerous sources tell CNN. The oil comes mostly from refineries and wells that ISIS controls in northern Iraq and northern Syria. The militants smuggle oil into southern Turkey, for example, and sell it to people who desperately need it just to carry on some semblance of everyday life. @highlight ISIS makes money by looting and selling antiquities, stealing from banks, extorting locals @highlight It is believed to make between $1 million and $2 million a day in oil revenue, experts say	Syria
