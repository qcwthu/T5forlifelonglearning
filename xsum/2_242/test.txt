He said that Mrs Clinton would put liberal justices on the Supreme Court if she wins the presidency in November, threatening gun ownership rights. Speaking at a rally in North Carolina, Mr Trump hinted that gun rights advocates could stop her taking power. That sparked an online backlash, many accusing him of inciting violence. He replied that he was only urging gun rights supporters to vote in large numbers. The remarks that sparked the firestorm were made at a rally in Wilmington on Tuesday afternoon. The Republican presidential nominee said of his Democratic opponent: "Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish the Second Amendment. By the way, and if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. "But the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know." The Second Amendment enshrines the right to bear arms in the US Constitution. A man sitting behind Mr Trump as he made the remarks assumed a look of disbelief as he heard them. Once again, Donald Trump's off-the-cuff style of speaking during his rallies has set the presidential campaign ablaze. The Republican nominee said that gun rights advocates could do something about Mrs Clinton after she gets elected and tries to appoint judges. What could that be? His campaign's explanation that they would organise and vote simply doesn't track. In a political environment where Trump supporters chant "lock her up", say Mrs Clinton should face a firing squad or worse, the Republican candidate's open-to-interpretation remarks likely throw gasoline onto a smouldering fire. Americans often complain about the programmed nature of their politicians. Trump's faithful, in particular, deride polished candidates with their considered answers. There's a reason why those seeking the presidency are exceedingly cautious about what they say. Every word is closely parsed, both in the US and around the world. A verbal misstep can be devastating. Mr Trump ignores these rules. And as his poll numbers sink, he and his campaign are taking on a bunker mentality. The media are biased, the elections could be rigged, the polls are skewed, and Mrs Clinton is an unstable menace. It's Trump v the world. And it's only August. Twitter users were quick to respond to Mr Trump's comments, criticising the Republican nominee for appearing to encourage gun violence. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said that "unstable people" who hate Mrs Clinton could respond. Robby Mook, Mrs Clinton's campaign manager, said "what Trump is saying is dangerous". But Mr Trump was quick to respond, tweeting that he was referring to the political power of gun rights advocates. His campaign said: "Second Amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified, which gives them great political power." "And this year, they will be voting in record numbers, and it won't be for Hillary Clinton, it will be for Donald Trump." And former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani backed Mr Trump, saying it clearly was not a threat but the press was involved in a "conspiracy to elect Hillary Clinton". Some Trump supporters leaving the rally in Wilmington told CNN they were not concerned by the remarks because they were clearly a joke and they liked the fact he spoke off-the-cuff. The National Rifle Association also backed Mr Trump and warned Mrs Clinton would pick judges that would not uphold the Second Amendment. Mrs Clinton has made tightening some gun laws part of her campaign but there is no evidence that she wants to abolish the right to bear arms. A spokeswoman for the Secret Service said the agency was aware of Mr Trump's comments but refused to answer additional questions. Mr Trump's remarks come after eight days of negative headlines, controversial remarks and some leading Republicans saying they cannot vote for him in November's presidential election.

The Port of Grangemouth container terminal is being resurfaced under a Â£1.5m investment programme by owners Forth Ports. The project will create additional storage lanes for laden containers and improve equipment access to landside and shipside operations. Forth Ports said the surface upgrade would increase the terminal's total capacity to 12,000 containers. That represents a 50% increase since 2005. The work is expected to be completed in October. A feasibility study has also been launched on deepening the port's shipping channel to enable it to handle larger, heavier container ships and bulk vessels. Both projects are being undertaken in response to changes in the container shipping market, where there is a trend towards larger capacity vessels which require deeper water. Forth Ports group chief executive Charles Hammond said: "This is an important investment for the business which will further secure Grangemouth's position as Scotland's largest container terminal. "We have analysed the shipping trends and identified the growing demand to accommodate larger vessels from around the world. "Through this investment, we will ensure that the Port of Grangemouth remains front and centre for Scotland's importers and exporters." Grangemouth currently handles more than 150,000 containers annually, with daily sailings to Rotterdam, Antwerp, Felixstowe and Hamburg.	Works are under way to expand capacity at Scotland's largest container port.
The 76-year-old, who received the Â£25,000 prize for Squint (19) at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery, was one of the shortlisted artists in 1991. Simpson, who has also made the prize longlist on three other occasions, said finally winning was "very nice indeed". Judge Ansel Krut said Squint (19) was "quite extraordinary", even though it was a "difficult painting to look at". The work depicts a leper squint, which Simpson said were "holes made in the sides of medieval churches so the undesirables could look through to the service and somehow take part". He said it was one of a series of paintings he has been working on, some of which were "much bigger". The relatively small size of Squint (19) - which is about 7ft (2.1m) in height - was one of the reasons Simpson entered it into the competition, though he also admitted that it "seemed to be a good idea to send one that I was conversant with and was working with". He said the prize money would be spent on "stretches, canvas and - particularly - good quality paints". "I spend a lot of money on materials, so this money is going to go to a good cause." Krut said Simpson's piece was "a little bit like a tone poem - when you spend some time with it, it gradually starts to build a picture". "Technically, it's very subtle and his language is very minimal, very reduced, but when you enter into it, you get into this broad field of great sympathy, because of the subject matter. "We couldn't have asked for a better painting." Established in 1957, the biennial John Moores Painting Prize is one of Britain's oldest art awards. Previous winners include David Hockney and Peter Doig. Sir Peter Blake, who is now the prize's patron, won the junior title in 1961.	Michael Simpson has won the John Moores Painting Prize, 25 years after he first came close to taking the title.
The Norwegian,  who also won the sixth stage of the race in Lisieux, proved the strongest of a breakaway group of 14 riders over the stage's final climb. Frenchman Thomas Voeckler ended an eighth day in yellow, but conceded 27 seconds to his main rivals. Australian Cadel Evans is his nearest challenger - one minute 18 seconds behind with four stages to go. Manx sprinter Mark Cavendish put in another solid shift, picking up a point at the intermediate checkpoint and retaining his green jersey. Team Sky's strong showing in the absence of team leader Bradley Wiggins, who suffered a broken collarbone on stage seven, has also made it a successful Tour for the only British team in the race. Rigoberto Uran and Geraint Thomas have both held the jersey for the race's best young rider, while Boasson Hagen is emerging as a consistent threat at the end of each stage. The 24-year-old played his part in a 14-strong breakaway that established an advantage of more than seven minutes over the peloton as they climbed the category-two Col de Montgenevre. Irishman Nicolas Roche attempted in vain to lead a group of three across the gap as the field climbed over the border and up to the Italian resort of Sestriere. But, with any gains immediately at risk on a subsequent 48km descent, the general classification contenders were content to save their aggression for Pramartino - the stage's final ascent. After breaking free at the head of the field, Spaniard Ruben Perez Moreno reached Sestriere with a clear lead and raced solo downhill in a bold attempt to win from the front. With 20km to go, the lone leader's lead of over a minute was still intact but he was absorbed back into the chasing pack as they climbed for the final time. French champion Sylvain Chavanel initially took on the pace but he could not shake Boasson Hagen who powered away before nervelessly navigating the winding downhill roads to Pinerolo for his victory. "If I'd taken fewer risks, I would have finished with Contador, Evans and the Schlecks Back in the field, Alberto Contador tested Andy Schleck and Voeckler with a burst of acceleration. But the descent proved more profitable for the Spaniard as Voeckler lost crucial time running wide on the corner as he struggled to keep with the downhill pace. Contador, a three-time winner, and his compatriot Samuel Sanchez looked as if they may make inroads into the rest of their rivals as they pressed in the final kilometres. But Andy Schleck, who had looked nervous in wet weather on the way down to La Rochette on Tuesday, brother Frank and Evans stuck doggedly to their tail to record the same time. Contador confirmed that, after getting caught up in a pile-up on the first stage and suffering a knee injury earlier in the race, he had to take some risks in a bid to win a fourth Tour de France. "It was a very dangerous descent," he said. "I was off the front, I saw I could attack and the important thing is to pull back time every day." And Voeckler revealed that Contador's approach was at least a partial success, convincing him to ride unnecessarily aggressively in the closing stages. "It's a pity, because I saw that Contador, Evans and the Schlecks finished together," reflected Voeckler. "If I'd taken fewer risks, I would have finished with them."

He called for more sobriety in a world obsessed by "consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance". The Pope was celebrating a Christmas eve Mass in St Peter's Basilica in front of about 10,000 people. Later on Friday he will deliver his traditional Christmas message from the central balcony of St Peter's Square. Celebrating Mass, the Pope said Christmas was the time to "once more discover who we are". He called on believers to show the same simplicity as the child Jesus, "born into poverty in a manger despite his divinity" to inspire their lives. "In a society so often intoxicated by consumerism and hedonism, wealth and extravagance, appearances and narcissism, this child calls us to act soberly, in other words, in a way that is simple, balanced, consistent, capable of seeing and doing what is essential," he said. World's Christians celebrate Christmas Welby: Islamic State is Herod of today "Amid a culture of indifference which not infrequently turns ruthless, our style of life should instead be devout, filled with empathy, compassion and mercy." Security was tight at the service with police carrying out spot checks in the area surrounding the Vatican. Everyone who went into the basilica, the largest church in Christendom, had to pass through metal detectors. Correspondents say the Pope, 79, used his homily to reflect the key themes of three years in office - mercy, compassion, empathy and justice. "In a world which all too often is merciless to the sinner and lenient to the sin, we need to cultivate a strong sense of justice, to discern and to do God's will," he said. His voice was occasionally hoarse - the effect of a slight flu earlier this week.	Pope Francis has warned the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics not to be "intoxicated" by possessions in his annual Christmas homily.
Lachie Stewart, 30, from Easter Ross, was thought to have been travelling to Delhi when he lost touch with his family earlier this month. However, a Facebook page set up as part of efforts to find him, said he had been found on Saturday. Mr Stewart had been working on a contract in Bhogpur in India before his disappearance. His family and friends had made contact with the Foreign Office after becoming increasingly concerned when he failed to make contact by his  birthday on Thursday. Details about his whereabouts have not been released.	A Scottish architect who had been reported missing in India is understood to have been found.
A review for the Commission on Local Tax Reform said there was no "magic bullet" to cure defects in the system. It said the council tax had built-in problems "from day one" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers. The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year. Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world. He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a "good tax" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets. But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection. Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income. Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer. But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities. He said:  "It is clear there is no magic bullet. "Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform. "So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking." The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn. A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system "as a whole to be unfair". He added: "That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives. "The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn."	Replacing or reforming the council tax in Scotland could prove challenging, according to a study.

The fire started at about 10:00 in the complex on Walter Hay Court in Rosyth, which contains about 30 retirement bungalows. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said several people had been rescued and evacuated from the burning building. Police said a body had been found within the property. An investigation was under way at the site. John Mills, head of Fife Council's housing services, said: "We were alerted to an incident this morning at an address Walter Hay Court. "Unfortunately the fire has resulted in the death of an occupant and our sympathies are with their family and friends at this sad time." A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Police in Fife are investigating following a fatal fire at an address in Walter Hay Court, Rosyth. "The incident happened around 10am on Friday, December 16, when a fire was reported. Police and emergency services attended, however a body was found within the property. "Police are currently undertaking a joint examination of the circumstances with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. A report will be sent the procurator fiscal."

Liam McGerrigan, 27, from the city, was pronounced dead at the scene after officers were called to Holyhead Road at about 22:10 BST on Thursday. He had been stabbed in the chest. West Midlands Police said it was still keen to hear from anyone who may have seen an altercation near a church. A 33-year-old man was arrested in the Tile Hill area on Friday. Det Insp Shaun Egan, of West Midlands Police Force CID, said: "We believe there was an altercation and Liam staggered to an address in Holyhead Road where he collapsed. "This was on a busy road and we believe there may be witnesses out there who can help with our investigation." Police were called to Holyhead Road near the junction of Northumberland Road on Thursday night.	A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man was found stabbed at an address in Coventry.
Specialist newsprint manufacturer Palm Paper has submitted the planning application in a bid to cut its reliance on imported energy. Due to its size, the application will be decided by the secretary of state instead of West Norfolk Borough Council. The plan includes a gas-fired turbine. Palm Paper's King's Lynn mill began production in August 2009 and in January this year produced its second millionth tonne of newsprint paper. The company said generating its own electricity and steam would help reduce its carbon footprint. The proposed new plant would replace existing boilers. No concerns have been raised about air quality issues but an environmental management plan is proposed. It would prevent construction work generating dust and emissions, which would constitute a risk to health or nuisance to local people or industry.	A paper manufacturer has applied to build a new plant to generate electricity and steam for its mill in West Norfolk.
The teams came head-to-head in the FA Cup quarter-final, with Chelsea winning the match 1-0. The action wasn't all on the pitch though. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte and Mourinho argued throughout the game, and had to be separated by the assistant referee at one point. Mourinho does, of course, have past history with Chelsea having been sacked by the club back in December 2015. He started his new job with United in May 2016. N'Golo Kante scored the only goal in the game. The victory means the Blues could still win the double of the league and FA Cup. The argument between the two bosses flared when United midfielder Ander Herrera was sent off for two yellow cards, leaving United to play for almost an hour with 10 men. Chelsea will now face Tottenham in the semi-final.	Chelsea boss Antonio Conte and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho argued during their match last night.

Craig Bryson gave the Rams an early lead when he struck from the edge of the area, before Thomas Ince curled in a stunning effort to double the lead. Shortly after Bryson hit the crossbar, Darren Bent added a third when he headed home from close range. Ipswich struggled for clear-cut chances, while Derby missed several. Ince, whose earlier effort came after he drifted in from the right to score his 11th goal of the season, could only hit the post from a low cross by Bent in the second half. Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski also made smart saves from both Bent and Jacob Butterfield. The hosts had a late penalty appeal when Grant Ward went down in the area, shortly before Kieffer Moore's shot was deflected wide on his home debut. The result leaves the hosts with just one win from their last seven games, a run which included being knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln City. There was further bad news for McCarthy's men, with influential forward Tom Lawrence replaced at half-time because of injury. Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "It looked like an ordinary start from both teams, but the first goal was far too easy for me, as was the second. "We'd had a bit of a rally just before the third goal, when we should have scored from a corner kick, but then we give the ball away and it ends up in the net. "It's quite clearly a foul in the build-up, which is not irrelevant because at 2-0 we could maybe get back in it, but 3-0 has put the game to bed." Derby manager Steve McClaren: "We should have scored more goals, but you can't have everything. I thought we were great in the first half - we've been so disappointed with our starts over recent games. "There were some tremendous performances and to come here and win 3-0 means the credit has to go to the players. "The most important thing in the second half was not to be complacent, keep a clean sheet and take home the three points." Match ends, Ipswich Town 0, Derby County 3.

Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death by a 15-year-old pupil at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April. Her attacker Will Cornick, now 16, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years at Leeds Crown Court in November. The plaque is displayed at the pavilion at Wigan's Mesnes Park where Mrs Maguire sold ice creams as a teenager. A rose was also planted in the park's memorial garden. The plaque was unveiled on Friday by Mrs Maguire's sisters, Shelagh Connor and Denise Courtney. Ms Courtney told BBC Radio Manchester it was "very, very important" to have a memorial in Wigan. She said: "This was her hometown; she was here for 19 years of her life and she still has family and friends [here]. "She said she wanted somewhere this side of the Pennines for people to go to to remember her without having to travel to Leeds." Ms Courtney added: "She was an extraordinary person; she touched so many people in so many different ways particularly the students she taught for 40 years." She said the words on the plaque "capture the essence of Ann and the person she was". They say: "Ann was one of life's beautiful, sunny and extraordinary people. May her goodness, kindness and generosity of spirit continue to be an inspiration to us all and may her memory never be forgotten." A memorial service was held in Mrs McGuire's memory on Thursday, featuring a choir consisting of many of her former pupils.	A plaque dedicated to a murdered school teacher has been unveiled in her hometown in Greater Manchester.
Sally Chidzoy said she was targeted after raising concerns when an MP appeared to convince a senior colleague to drop one of her stories. She further alleges she was "falsely imprisoned" by management during an attempt to seize her phone. Ms Chidzoy also claims she was sexually discriminated against and victimised. The tribunal in Cambridge was told Ms Chidzoy, who works as BBC Look East's home affairs correspondent, had been investigating East of England Ambulance Service boss Anthony Marsh's salary package. She said the story was dropped after assistant editor Steve Silk received a late-night email from then-Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb in July 2014. Sent from a private account, it noted Mr Lamb's "real concern about the potential damage" the story could have on the service. Giving evidence, Ms Chidzoy said she had discovered a "very close" relationship between Mr Lamb and Dr Marsh and she felt the MP was "attempting, in my view, to stop a broadcast". "He should not be doing this and leaning on the BBC and its duty to be impartial and independent. "[It was] a direct attempt to interfere with an ongoing piece that had not yet been broadcast." Representing the BBC, Sophie Belgrave disputed the suggestion Mr Silk had been influenced by the email, saying he would have done it in a "clandestine" way had this been the case. She said: "If he was going to give in to political interference from Norman Lamb on the sly, they would just do it." Disciplinary proceedings were launched against Ms Chidzoy after she raised the issue of the MP's interference and after an email from Mr Lamb to Mr Silk was leaked to a Sunday newspaper. Bosses subsequently attempted to seize her phone and "falsely imprisoned" her at a meeting in September 2014, the tribunal was told. Ms Chidzoy said she investigated another story about the Centre for Business and Public Sector Ethics, which was receiving money from the Chinese government. She was informed BBC Look East editor Nikki O'Donnell was the "organisation's press spokesperson", the tribunal was told. Ms Chidzoy said: "The problems I encountered involved what I believe is internal corruption and poor management." She also alleges she was subjected to a covert investigation by ex-Met police officers at the BBC investigation unit while the proceedings were ongoing. The tribunal continues.	A BBC TV reporter was the victim of a "witch-hunt" after blowing the whistle on political interference, a tribunal has heard.
Researchers who looked at 1,500 samples of seven malaria drugs from seven countries in South East Asia say poor-quality and fake tablets are causing drug resistance and treatment failure. Data from 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa including over 2,500 drug samples showed similar results. Experts say             The Lancet Infectious Diseases  research is a "wake-up call". The US researchers from the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health who carried out the work believe the problem may even be much greater than data suggests. "Most cases are probably unreported, reported to the wrong agencies, or kept confidential by pharmaceutical companies," say the researchers. No large studies of drug quality have been carried out in China or India - countries that house a third of the world's population and are a "probable" source of many counterfeit drugs as well as genuine antimalarial medicines, they say. Lead researcher Gaurvika Nayyar stressed that 3.3 billion people were at risk of malaria, which is classified as endemic in 106 countries. "Between 655,000 and 1.2 million people die every year from Plasmodium falciparum infection," he said. "Much of this morbidity and mortality could be avoided if drugs available to patients were efficacious, high quality, and used correctly." In parts of the world where malaria is prevalent, antimalarial drugs are widely distributed and self-prescribed, both correctly and incorrectly, say the researchers. The study found there are insufficient facilities to monitor the quality of antimalarial drugs and poor consumer and health-worker knowledge about the therapies. And there is a lack of regulatory oversight of manufacturing and little punitive action for counterfeiters. Despite this, malaria mortality rates have fallen by more than 25% globally since 2000, and by 33% in the WHO African Region. But the World Health Organization says maintaining current rates of progress will not be enough to meet global targets for malaria control. It is calling for renewed investment in diagnostic testing, treatment, and surveillance for malaria.	A third of malaria drugs used around the world to stem the spread of the disease are counterfeit, data suggests.
Matthew Daley, 35, denies murder but has admitted attacking 79-year-old retired solicitor Donald Lock claiming diminished responsibility. Lynda Daley agreed at Lewes Crown Court the day Mr Lock was killed was "the day that all your nightmares came true". Mr Lock was attacked on the A24 at Findon, near Worthing last July. Earlier defence counsel David Howker QC said Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust apologised to Mr Daley's family for having "failed" him in his care and treatment. Mrs Daley told the court her son had many debts and the recent breakdown of his relationship with his girlfriend had left him "distraught". "We were never provided with a proper diagnosis. We were frequently in meetings but we were not listened to," she said. "It's been continual over the last 10 years. In the past 10 years we have pleaded to people, it has been on a regular basis." Mrs Daley told the court the apology from the NHS trust was "10 years too late". She said she feared her son was involved in the killing in Findon when she saw the news on television. When she failed to contact him she drove to the stables where he worked and saw his damaged car. The court heard the family decided to go to Worthing police station and as Mrs Daley was about enter, her son called her saying: "I need to know where you are and that I can trust you." Mr Daley also told her he had done "something really bad or something really wrong. "I killed someone." The court also heard Mr Daley police told a police officer "when I drive, people try and break into my thoughts". He also said: "It's sad that I had to kill someone who was so aggressive to me when I wasn't aggressive at all." Mr Lock was returning from a cycling meet when he was stabbed 39 times during a "ferocious" attack on the A24 at Findon in July. Witnesses have described Mr Daley as being "expressionless" during the attack, as though he was "having a passport photo" taken. Mr Lock was fatally stabbed after he hit the back of Mr Daley's Ford Fusion and then asked why he had braked so abruptly. Jurors have been told that Mr Daley's defence team will claim the defendant may have been acting in self defence because Mr Lock was angry and aggressive . Consultant forensic pathologist Dr Nathaniel Carey said Mr Lock died from a stab wound to the aorta. Stab wounds may have also also been inflicted when the 79-year-old lay dead or dying. The case continues.	The mother of a man who stabbed a motorist 39 times told a court she "pleaded" with mental health experts to have her son sectioned.
The anti-IS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said a water pumping station had been hit, along with the Taj Hall and Furousiya area. IS-linked news agency Amaq  also said Raqqa's water supply had been cut. Russia said its bombers had targeted an arms depot, a chemical weapons factory and a training camp. A defence ministry statement said the strikes had inflicted "significant damage" and that a large number of militants had been killed. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), whose activists have reported on developments on the ground in Raqqa since IS militants seized control of the city in early 2014, said the water pumping station hit in Thursday's strikes was located in the nearby village of Kasrat. Residents found their water had been cut off "totally" afterwards, it added. Amaq also reported the "interruption of the water supply in all neighbourhoods". RBSS said 20 civilians had been killed and 50 others wounded in the air strikes, but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll higher. It said 24 civilians had died, along with six others whose identities could not yet be confirmed. Raqqa, estimated to have a population of between 250,000 and 500,000, has become the de facto capital of the "caliphate" whose creation was proclaimed by IS two years ago after it took control of large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. IS militants are currently under pressure from two separate offensives west and north-west of Raqqa by Russian-backed Syrian government forces and an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters supported by the US.	Air strikes on so-called Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa have cut the city's water supply, with 20 civilians reported dead.
The airport is in competition with Heathrow to win approval for an additional runway. One of the guarantees is compensation for people living close to the airport. Gatwick's chairman Sir Roy McNulty said: "These guarantees would mean Gatwick takes on the main risks of building the new runway." The Airports Commission is currently considering three options for expanding airport provision in south-east England and is due to publish its findings in the summer. These options are a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick. Gatwick has "guaranteed" the project would be privately funded with no need for public subsidy, that airport charges would be capped and it would bear the main risks of the expansion plan. It has also promised to compensate residents by Â£1,000 towards council tax bills if they are affected by significant level of aircraft noise, and said it would ensure that air quality targets always were always met.	Bosses at Gatwick Airport have unveiled five "guarantees" they hope will convince the Airports Commission to approve a second runway.
Corrie Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in the town 11 days ago. Suffolk Police said the three young people aged between 16 and 18 were seen at Short Brackland at 04:20 BST on 24 September. They could be "potential witnesses", the force said. For updates on this story, visit BBC Suffolk Live Acting Supt Kim Warner appealed to the trio: "We appreciate that getting in touch with police may be intimidating but we do need to speak to you. "At this stage in the investigation we just need to talk to anyone who may have seen Corrie during his night out so we can build a picture." One of the teenagers is described as a white female, of quite slim build, wearing either a dark green or navy blue jumper-style top. The other two were both males, one wearing a hooded top. They were seen towards the back of Cornhill Walk shopping centre, police said. Acting Supt Warner added: "We need to find Corrie and a number of inquiries are being carried out to do this. "We know from CCTV images that we have already viewed that he engaged with a number of people during his evening out. "We have had several calls but still need to talk to anyone who may have seen him or spoken to him during the early hours." Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 on 24 September. It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.	Police searching for a missing RAF serviceman want to trace three teenagers spotted in Bury St Edmunds on the day of his disappearance.
The song United We Stand brings together Ladysmith Black Mambazo from South Africa and Malian singer Salif Keita. Lyrics include the line "Africa is our home, make it a better place". At least seven people have died over a month of attacks on foreigners and foreign-owned property in South Africa. African news at it happens: 1 May 2015 Ladysmith Black Mambazo singer Sibongiseni Shabalala told the BBC he was trying to send the message that "Africa is for all of us". "You can't say you don't like the foreigners to stay in your country. This is not your country, this is our country. "We are saying people should unite. If there's problems, people should sit down and talk. "One day your child will want to go and live in Mali, Nigeria or Ghana but because of your decision today it will be very difficult for your future generation to be able to do the same." The song is playing on South African radio from Friday, will be premiered on TV on Friday evening and will be released on iTunes on Monday.	Two of Africa's most famous musicians have released a song against the recent violence against foreigners in South Africa.
The man, believed to be a Polish national, was found badly injured in the early hours of Wednesday at flats in Thurso Crescent. He later died at Ninewells Hospital. A 24-year-old man was arrested on Thursday and has now been charged. He is expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court on Monday. Police have not named the victim as they have not been able to formally identify him.	A man is to appear in court over the suspicious death of a 34-year-old in Dundee.
As many readers of this blog like to point out, a virtual reality environment will never be a substitute for actually experiencing something. No-one, even in the corridors of Oculus Connect, a conference for the virtual reality industry, would suggest otherwise. Owned by Facebook, Oculus is credited with breathing new life into the virtual reality industry which had faded out after an almost cringe-worthy first-go in the nineties. Its headset, the Oculus Rift, hits shelves next year. Anticipation is huge. But today we had a reminder of just how far we are from enjoying anything that comes even close to producing an fully-immersive world - one that can recreate common human feelings and emotions; the sense of being somewhere else, with other people, feeling different sensations. Oculus and Facebook made a range of announcements relating to VR today. Here are the most significant: To hammer this home, Oculus' chief scientist Michael Abrash took a refreshing approach to his keynote - outlining all the things Oculus could not yet do. The problems are so great the team is not even trying to solve them - something for the next generation to tackle. One is providing a sense of smell, a sensation so integral to experiencing, and later remembering, a new place. Another challenge is the ability to taste something, or hear realistically in a way that does not feel as if we're just wearing headphones. Perhaps the biggest barrier is a sense of touch. Haptic technology is only just beginning to recreate basic touch sensations - but it remains that in VR, it's going to be years before you'll stop putting your hand through virtual tables, killing the illusion in an instant. But virtual reality enthusiasts shouldn't feel disheartened. Right now, VR is what Space Invaders is to Call of Duty. They're both games, sure, but they're worlds apart. The now-primitive blip-blip-blip of 1970s arcade games were the building blocks needed to get us to where we are now. And so the feeling among Oculus Connect is that this is just the beginning, and there's still a long way to go. Gamers and the wider public may take a while to reach the same level of excitement felt within the industry. Mr Abrash told delegates that they're living in the "good old days" of VR - a time that will be looked back upon as the start of something significant. Except it's not quite the start. We've been here before. Journalists in the 1990s were writing about VR as the next big thing just as I am now. But the technology wasn't ready then. Is it now? There are a few veterans prowling the halls here, enticed back to the action after some time away. One was Greg Panos, who has been studying virtual and augmented reality for over two decades. I asked him if this latest wave of VR was any different to what happened in the 90s. Yes, he said - the difference now is that VR is good enough, and cheap enough, for companies to start making some serious money. And so it starts. The first battleground for VR will be gaming. Therefore the best games will win - in theory - so efforts from HTC Vive headset could disrupt Facebook's ambition. HTC has partnered with legendary games maker Valve, and so the games should be terrific. And the Vive goes on sale first. Sony is jostling in, too. Its Morpheus headset has two things going for it. One, it's tied to the already immensely successful PlayStation 4, and so will likely be bundled with the console. But with the announcements made today, Facebook is giving itself a huge headstart in a new, exciting world of entertainment. Deals with Netflix and Minecraft could give Oculus the edge, even if other competitors have better hardware, as has been the suggestion. Content, as always, is king. Vive and Morpheus will need to compete with that. The possibilities are mind-blowingly enormous - from gaming to tele-presence, education to blockbuster movies, Facebook is trying to nurture a platform that one day could rival the mobile app ecosystem in its scale. But - and it's a big but - Facebook still needs to pull it off. One year on from Facebook's purchase of Oculus VR, we've still not seen the technology really hit the market in any meaningful way. That means Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg's $2bn bet in VR bet is still wide-open. Will that purchase be seen as a shrewd move on par with Google's bargain-tactic $1.65bn purchase of YouTube in 2006? Or will Oculus be Mr Zuckerberg's MySpace - a service with great early momentum, bought by NewsCorp for $580m, only to be later offloaded for $35m? It was a newcomer that took what MySpace started and made it much much better, killing the business in the process. That newcomer being Facebook, of course, Mr Zuckerberg certainly knows how this game works. It's presumably why he appeared, unannounced, at Thursday's event, seemingly with one key purpose - to manage the expectations of developers, the press and the public. "All of you are inventing the next major platform," he told delegates. "This is going to go very slowly. "Facebook is committed to this for the long term." He doesn't expect "millions" of units to be sold - at least not for a while. He was there to reassure developers that even if things don't pick up and make millionaires straight away, he's committed to sticking with it. But he's not the only one - and it could be competitors that take what Oculus has started and does things better - giving Mr Zuckerberg the MySpace treatment.

Taylor, 23, underwent surgery on multiple fractures, but the club's head physotherapist Kate Rees says he is expected to make a full recovery. Rees said: "The surgeons worked hard on Neil's injury... and did a very good job. "He is comfortable and the surgeons are happy with the operations." She added: "While he should make a full recovery, the extent of the injury means Neil is likely to miss the rest of the season.'' Taylor was injured after falling awkwardly in the first half at the Liberty Stadium. His foot was trapped underneath him as he fell to the ground, taking the full weight of Sunderland's Craig Gardner on the way down. Taylor immediately summoned the Swansea medical staff as he held his left ankle in agony after just 15 minutes of the match. "When you have injuries like that it is normally very violent, but this was not violent," said manager Michael Laudrup. "It was even a free-kick against us. "Sometimes these injuries happen in strange ways, you don't think anything is wrong and then there is ligament damage or something like that, it is very sad. "But you see things that are much more violent than that - this was not violent, it was unlucky. "He was very unlucky to fall in a bad way, you can't blame the Sunderland player for that." As well as missing a significant part of Swansea's season, Taylor will be unavilable for most of Wales' 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, which starts against Belgium on Friday. Taylor impressed for Team GB at the 2012 London Olympic Games and was expected to play a big part in Wales boss Chris Coleman's plans. Teenager Ben Davies was Taylor's replacement for Swansea, making an assured Premier League debut as Laudrup's side twice hit back to secure a draw.	Wales defender Neil Taylor is expected to miss the rest of the season after fracturing an ankle in Swansea City's 2-2 draw with Sunderland on Saturday.
The 56ft (17.1m) converted trawler was 6 miles (10 km) west of South Stack when the crew radioed coastguards at 07:00 BST. Holyhead coastguards said a pump on board the boat was unable to cope with the water coming in. The RNLI lifeboat crew placed a pump and towed the vessel to Holyhead.	Three people have been rescued from a boat which had started to take on water off the Anglesey coast on Friday.
An "in-depth investigation" will look into claims made by Veracruz governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares on Monday, the Ministry of Health said. He alleged fake medicine had been bought and used in state hospitals under his predecessor Javier Duarte. Mr Duarte has been on the run from the authorities since October. The former governor, who was elected in 2010,  has not been seen since a week after he stepped down amid allegations of corruption. He has been charged with organised crime and money laundering, but there are calls for the Attorney General's office to file criminal charges relating to the latest accusations. On Monday, Mr Yunes Linares told a press conference that an investigation into malfeasance and corruption under Mr Duarte had uncovered medical fraud. `We have tests on a medication given to children, a paediatric chemotherapy that wasn't really a medication, it was an inert substance, practically distilled water,'' he said. "This really seems to us a brutal crime, an attempt against the lives of the children. We're finishing our analysis and, at the appropriate time, we'll be filing legal complaints." Mr Yunes Linares also alleged there had been inadequate tests for HIV detection and the existence of outdated medicines. The allegations have shocked Mexico. "It is absolutely inhuman, criminal," Senator Roberto Gil Zuart said, according to Mexican news site Quadratin. Mexico's Secretary of Health JosÃ© Narro Robles has promised to act on "the persons or companies involved" if irregularities or responsibility is found, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.	Mexican authorities are to investigate allegations children battling cancer were given "distilled water" instead of chemotherapy.
Media playback is not supported on this device Caley Thistle lie five points adrift at the bottom of the Premiership with just five games of the season remaining. "It's massive," Foran told BBC Scotland. "Biggest game of my career, biggest game of the players' careers. "Ross County [are] probably out of the relegation battle but we can drag them back into it." The recruitment of former assistant manager Maurice Malpas last week was designed to address defensive problems. Foran concedes that it was the club's directors who proposed the idea of adding more experience to the coaching team, but insists that he identified Malpas as the man to appoint. "The board thought it would help by bringing someone else in," Foran said. "An older, more experienced person. "We're all trying to fix the problem. I had a think who was out there, who I could trust, who had the game knowledge and Scottish Premiership knowledge, so I picked Maurice. "The board recommended I bring someone in. There was no problem with that." With just four wins from 33 league fixtures, retaining their top-flight status seems an uphill task for Inverness, particularly given their record of conceding more goals than any side in the Premiership. "Defensively as a team, it hasn't been good enough," Foran said. "[We've] probably been too open at times attacking, so we've worked on that. There's obviously been a problem; we've conceded too many goals. "Maurice has over 50 caps. He's managed, he's been assistant manager. But the main thing for me, you can always trust Maurice. "He's old school and is never going to stab you in the back. He'll always say it straight to your face and he's good to have around the place."	Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran insists Friday's Highland derby against Ross County is the most important match of his career.
Many Sephardic Jews were killed, forced to convert to Christianity or leave at the end of the 15th Century. Parliament paved the way for a change in citizenship laws two years ago, but the move needed Cabinet approval. From now on, descendants of Sephardic Jews who can prove a strong link to Portugal can apply for a passport. Proof can be brought, the government says, through a combination of surname, language spoken in the family or evidence of direct descent. Thousands of Sephardic Jews were forced off the Iberian peninsula, first from Spain and then from Portugal. Some of those who fled to other parts of Europe or to America continued to speak a form of Portuguese in their new communities. The Portuguese government acknowledges that Jews lived in the region long before the Portuguese kingdom was founded in the 12th Century. "There is no possibility to amend what was done," says Portuguese Justice Minister Paula Teixera da Cruz, adding that the law change was "an attribution of a right". Portugal's Jewish community which once numbered in the tens of thousands has shrunk to just 1,000 - most of them Ashkenazim with roots in Eastern Europe. Neighbouring Spain is still debating a similar law to address its treatment of Jews in the past.	The Portuguese Cabinet has approved rules under which descendants of Jews expelled from Portugal more than 500 years ago can claim citizenship.

The National League club's ground is undergoing refurbishments this summer. The Hive, home of Barnet, hosted Arsenal for the 2017 Spring Series as a new pitch was laid at Meadow Park. "We're delighted to continue our long-standing relationship and pleased to contribute to these improvements," said Arsenal club secretary David Miles. Boreham Wood chairman Danny Hunter told his club's website: "This long-term partnership and a grant from the Premier League, through the FSIF (Football Stadia Improvement Fund), have helped us to undertake an incredible range of Premier League-type ground improvements." Meanwhile, former WSL 1 champions Arsenal have given a new deal to Netherlands international goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal. The 27-year-old, who joined the Gunners in 2015, has agreed an undisclosed-length contract with Pedro Martinez Losa's side.	Arsenal Ladies have agreed a deal to continue playing their home games at Boreham Wood's Meadow Park home until 2027, along with Arsenal's youth teams.
The station, based in Toxteth, was set up as part of a government initiative three years ago and has been supported by money from the BBC licence fee. Another operator, Made TV, provided further support, but the BBC understands the station has struggled. Bay TV's chief executive said he hoped it would be sold as a going concern. Chris Johnson added he was optimistic the channel would continue. Peter Harold, of Skelmersdale-based adminstrators Refresh Recovery, said a meeting with the station's 20 staff had been held. He said more than one buyer was interested in taking over the business, "but we have a few more hoops to jump through first". Bay TV, which was awarded a licence in February 2013, continues to broadcast and can be viewed on Freeview and Virgin. In addition to news, sport and music, the station also covers arts, culture and religion.	The owners of Bay TV, Liverpool's local television station, have insisted it will survive despite going into administration.

The French authorities say the Airbus A310, which set off from the Yemeni capital, should not have been allowed to fly, the AFP news agency reports. Most of the 152 people killed in the crash were French citizens visiting relatives in the Comoros. There was just one survivor - a teenage girl who was rescued from the sea. Many of the passengers were travelling to the Comoros, but had begun their journey in Paris or Marseille on another jet operated by the national airline of Yemen, before boarding flight IY626 in Sanaa. An association of the victims' families, AFVCA, has welcomed the charge. "It's a great relief for the families of the victims who have waited four and a half years," a spokesman for the association told the BBC. "Now the company will finally be forced to face up to its responsibilities." Yemenia has previously said that bad weather - strong winds and high seas - was the more likely cause of the crash. The carrier is not included on the current European Union list of banned airlines. The crash caused anger amongst the Comorian community in France as people complained that the aircraft had been in poor condition. The plane was banned from French airspace after inspectors found numerous faults in 2007, according to the then transport minister, Dominique Bussereau. Several European countries had also found a number of problems when they inspected Yemenia aircraft prior to the crash. Officials from Yemen have previously said the plane had undergone a thorough inspection and conformed to international standards.	France has charged Yemenia Airways with manslaughter over a 2009 crash off the Comoros Islands that killed 152 people, judicial sources say.
Now, the community is turning to introspection. Questions are being raised in the province around radicalisation and whether there is a climate of intolerance that needs to be addressed. On Monday, Alexandre Bissonette, a 27-year-old University of Laval student, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder. Police have not said what motivated the alleged attacker, who opened fire at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre during evening prayers. Quebec attack: Who were the victims? Quebec Muslims 'emotionally destroyed' Who is Alexandre Bissonnette? But there are reports that Mr Bissonette expressed anti-immigration and anti-feminist views online. Francois Deschamps, an official with an advocacy group, Welcome to Refugees, said the suspect was known for those views online. Vivek Venkatesh, a professor with Montreal's Concordia University who studies online hate and radicalisation, says social media creates "echo chambers", where more extreme views can gain traction. He says while Quebec is "still reeling" from the mosque shooting, it is important that there be a public debate in the province on how to prevent radicalisation and violent extremism in all its forms. Pierre Martin, a political science professor with the University of Montreal, says that it appears Mr Bissonette may have been influenced by a mix of global nationalist trends, the so-called "alt-right", and "currents within Quebec itself". Trump’s shock troops: Who are the ‘alt-right’? In the 1960s, Quebec shifted quickly from a highly religious society to a deeply secular culture. "People (now) tend to be critical of religion in general and how religion shapes people's social interactions," he said. He said Quebecers tend to reject overt displays of religion. For example, the province has debated in the past few years whether government workers should be allowed to wear clothing that showed their faith, like hijabs or turbans. Mr Martin said the current provincial Liberal government is seen as being overly permissive on the issue while the opposition "have tended to be criticised for seizing some currents of resentment and exploiting them for political purposes". But he says the fact that thousands of Quebecers attended candlelight vigils on Monday showed "that the large majority of people who may have even traces of reservations about ostentatious displays of religion in the public sphere are extremely tolerant of private observance". Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard echoed that on Tuesday, telling journalists that while "all societies live with demons and our society is not perfect", the majority of the province is open to newcomers. Still, many in Quebec City's Muslim community have said over that past two days that they have concerns about Islamophobia in the province. Amira Elghawaby, with the National Council of Canadian Muslims, says that in Quebec, recent debates around the niqab - like whether to ban the wearing of the face veil while offering or receiving public services - have been "toxic" and contributed to the mischaracterisation of Muslims as the "other."	The shock from Sunday night's deadly the Quebec mosque shooting is slowly waning.
Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as  V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same "nursery" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.

However, the Scottish Conservatives claim a surge in their support has "sunk" a case for a second indy poll, according to The Herald. The Scotsman says the local election results have laid down the "battlelines" for the upcoming general election. "The result now sets up a Westminster poll on 8 June in which independence will be the number one issue," the paper adds. The Scottish Daily Mail claims it was the Conservatives' best-ever council election result in Scotland, while the SNP "saw its vote plummet compared to recent elections". However, the Scottish Sun says the surge in support for the Conservatives came at the expense of votes for the Labour party, which "suffered a bruising ... defeat". Despite the Tory comeback, the SNP was still the "runaway winner", it added. Scotland's "constitutional obsession" sparked the Tories revival, according to the Daily Record. It notes that the "party of Thatcher" even won a council seat in Ravenscraig, "25 years after she sounded the death knell for the Motherwell steelworks". Meanwhile the Aberdeen edition of The Press and Journal reports that the SNP is poised to take over control of the city council after support for Labour fell. In Dundee the SNP lost their overall majority, according to The Courier, but the SNP group leader is still likely to run the council, as head of either a minority administration or a coalition.	The National hails the SNP's victory in the local elections "emphatic", adding that it deals a blow to Theresa May's bid to stop a second independence referendum.
The original game was postponed on 26 November because of a frozen pitch. The offer from the Latics is for both home and away supporters visiting SportsDirect.com Park. Oldham, who are next to bottom of the table, three points from safety, have just exited a transfer embargo and reappointed John Sheridan as manager. "We want as many supporters to welcome back the manager to the football club as he takes his place on the sidelines for the first time," said a club statement. Supporters are, however, being invited to make a donation to a local charity. Brentford were the first team to offer free entry for a league game in England when they played Peterborough in 2001.	Oldham Athletic have offered free entry to all fans for their rearranged League One fixture against Peterborough United on Tuesday, 24 January.
A spokesman said the new estimate was based on a review of intelligence reports from May to August. IS has seized vast swathes of Iraq and beheaded several hostages in recent months, leading to US airstrikes. US Secretary of State John Kerry is visiting Turkey, seeking more support for action against IS. US officials say retired Gen John Allen will be tasked with forming an international coalition to fight IS. On Thursday, 10 Arab countries agreed to help the US attack the group in both Iraq and Syria. The CIA had previously believed that IS had about 10,000 fighters, spokesman Ryan Trapani said. "This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate, greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence," he added. The revision comes a day after President Obama outlined a plan to "degrade and destroy" IS and to increase military support for allied forces engaged in fighting the group. For the first time, he authorised air strikes against the group in Syria. In recent months IS has expanded from its stronghold in eastern Syria and seized control of more towns, cities, army bases and weaponry in Iraq. The US has already carried out more than 150 air strikes against IS in Iraq. It has also sent hundreds of military advisers to assist Iraqi government and Kurdish forces, but has ruled out sending ground troops. Other countries, including the UK, have contributed humanitarian assistance to Iraqis displaced by the group's advance. Mr John Kerry secured the co-operation of several Arab countries during a meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Thursday. Nato member Turkey, however, refused to sign a communique calling for countries to join the US in the fight against IS. Analysts say this may be because the group currently holds 49 Turkish citizens, including diplomats. Mr Kerry downplayed the move, saying the important US ally was dealing with some "sensitive issues". He is due to travel to Turkey on Friday to try to secure more co-operation from the government.	The CIA says the Islamic State (IS) militant group may have up to 31,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria - three times as many as previously feared.

Lego refused a bulk order for bricks that were to be used in a new artwork about political dissidents as part of an exhibition in Melbourne, Australia. Toymaker Lego said it never sold directly to anyone wanting to use its product to make a political statement. The artist has since been deluged with offers of Lego from supporters. Ai used Lego last year to create portraits of 175 dissident figures who had been jailed or exiled, from Nelson Mandela to Edward Snowden, on the site of the former Alcatraz prison near San Francisco. He planned a similar work for the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, but a bulk order placed by the museum was rejected by the Danish company. The Chinese artist said the company told the museum its bricks could not be used for artworks containing "any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements". Referring to The Lego Movie's slogan "everything is awesome", Ai wrote on Twitter: "Lego will tell us what to do, or not to do. That is awesome!" He added: "Lego is giving us the definition of what is 'political', and all the big corporations are telling us what to love or hate. That is awesome." In an Instagram post, he wrote: "As a commercial entity, Lego produces and sells toys, movies and amusement parks attracting children across the globe. "As a powerful corporation, Lego is an influential cultural and political actor in the globalized economy with questionable values. "Lego's refusal to sell its product to the artist is an act of censorship and discrimination." Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek would not comment directly on the case but said that, as a principle, Lego "respects any individual's right to free, creative expression". But he added that the company had a long-standing policy not to directly sell to anyone if it knew that its bricks would be used to make a political statement. The artist also linked Lego's stance with plans for a new Legoland in Shanghai. Lego said the theme park was being built by Merlin Entertainment and not Lego, but that Lego does have some ties with Merlin because it uses the Lego brand. Ai Weiwei is known for his criticism of the Chinese government as well as for being one of the world's leading contemporary artists. He was arrested during a crackdown on political activists in China in 2011 and was released without charge after 81 days. The Chinese authorities kept his passport for four years, but it was returned earlier this year.	Artist Ai Weiwei has accused Lego of "censorship and discrimination" after the company refused to allow him to use its bricks in a new exhibition.
Mr Besigye, under house arrest since Friday, said Ugandans had seen "the most fraudulent electoral process". He described the poll as a sham and a creeping military coup. President Museveni, in power for 30 years, received nearly 61% of the votes, with Mr Besigye taking 35%. Foreign observers say the poll was conducted in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. While praising the "remarkable determination" of Ugandans to vote, EU chief observer Eduard Kukan said the governing National Resistance Movement's "domination of the political landscape distorted the fairness of the campaign". The election has been marred by sporadic violence and opposition allegations of electoral fraud, with social media sites and messaging apps blocked. "Today I am under house arrest," Mr Besigye said in a statement. "My home is sealed off and I am not allowed to leave. Nobody is allowed to access my home. I am also under some kind of electronic blockade. I am unable to access any form of internet service in my house. "Generally, the regime is baring its bloodied fangs and claws for all to see. This has not been an electoral process. This is a creeping military coup." It was the fourth time Mr Besigye, candidate for the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, had taken on President Museveni. The two men were once allies, with Mr Besigye serving as Mr Museveni's personal doctor when they were guerrilla fighters. He was placed under house arrest ostensibly to stop him announcing his vote score unilaterally. Mr Museveni seized power in 1986 and is credited with restoring stability to Uganda. However, critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian. The next closest challenger to Mr Museveni, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, is also reportedly under house arrest. The National Resistance Movement put out a statement celebrating the win, saying Mr Museveni's opponents had "failed to offer any alternative". Uganda's old guard tries new election tactics	The main opposition leader in Uganda, Kizza Besigye, has rejected the result of Thursday's elections, in which President Yoweri Museveni won a fifth term of office.
AFC Wimbledon are set for the big screen, having reached agreement with Hollywood studio Fox 2000 for a film to be made about the club. The Dons' story will be retold from its formation in 2002, when it held trials on Wimbledon Common. The phoenix club, founded by supporters after the old Wimbledon FC was given permission to relocate to Milton Keynes, reached the Football League in 2011 following five promotions in nine years. American author John Green, who sponsors a stand at the Cherry Red Records Stadium, will co-produce the film. "AFC Wimbledon isn't just one of the best underdog stories in sports history; it's also a story about a community that fought the injustice of the Milton Keynes debacle and is now fighting to have a stadium back in Wimbledon," Green told the club website. The film is in the early stages of development, with no script yet written or schedule for release. However, Matthew Breach, chair of the Dons Trust which owns the club, said the deal was "a fantastic opportunity to tell a great story". With the Dons currently 10th in League Two and attempting to reach the play-offs, it is not yet known whether the likes of manager Neal Ardley or striker Adebayo 'The Beast' Akinfenwa will have roles in the film. So the prospect of a Dons movie is fact, not fiction. But the same could not be said of the imaginative lines appearing on social media and club websites on Friday morning. Southampton were straight out of the blocks, informing fans they would be introducing a new club crest this summer. There would be one minor change to their current badge - replacing the halo-topped football at the top of their badge with an angel-face emoji. Meanwhile, Arsenal claimed they would be installing a retractable sunroof at the Emirates and Championship club Bristol City said 6ft 5in defender Aden Flint had signed a dual-registration deal with local basketball side Bristol Flyers. But perhaps best of all saw Hartlepool United announcing that the Football Association had given them permission to play in fancy dress on the final day of the season. Maybe both Pools and Wimbledon are in need of a good costume designer... Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

Several football clubs tried to catch out their supporters on April Fool's Day - but one of the more remarkable stories to appear is in fact true.
In a dismal Dons performance, Samir Hadji gave the hosts a deserved lead when he raced onto a loose ball and lashed it home just before half-time. As Aberdeen continued to create little after the break, Emmanuel Francoise thumped the ball off the post. But despite dominating, the hosts could not find the second goal they needed. The Dons live to fight another day and will face Latvian side Ventspils in the second qualifying round, with the first leg at Pittodrie next Thursday. But they were well short of their best, with Fola Esch claiming their first-ever win in a  European tie. It was Fola who were the more dangerous of the two sides in the opening minutes as they attempted to pull back the two-goal deficit from the first leg. An audacious effort from the halfway line almost caught out Dons goalkeeper Joe Lewis, before Hadji raced to the near post and tested the Englishman from close-range. The hosts pressed again when Mehdi Kirch sent a left-foot shot wide from distance, before Shay Logan had a similar strike at the other end with Aberdeen's first effort of the game. Peter Pawlett, making a rare start for the Dons in place of the rested Niall McGinn, cut a neat ball across from the byline for Jayden Stockley and goalkeeper Thomas Hym had to be alert to deny him from close-range. The best chances were continuing to fall to the hosts, though. Hadji was not too far away with a back-post header from a corner, before Stefano Bensi volleyed over. A goal was coming and it was no surprise when Hadji found the net on the stroke of half-time. Bensi stabbed the ball through the heart of the defence, and with Ash Taylor caught between the player and the ball, Hadji raced past him and fired beyond goalkeeper Joe Lewis. Manager Derek McInnes' frustration was apparent with a double substitution at the interval, with Pawlett and debutant Anthony O'Connor being replaced by Willo Flood and Mark Reynolds. The Dons though continued to toil and goalkeeper Lewis twice denied the hosts in quick succession; first tipping Bensi's curling effort wide before getting to Tom Laterza's low shot from the resultant corner. A second goal from the hosts would have been enough to send the Dons out of Europe, and that nearly became a reality when Logan stood off Francoise and allowed him to rattle the ball off the inside of the post. Flood appeared to have injured himself in a clumsy challenge on Fola's Ryan Klapp, and with Aberdeen having used all three substitutes, he was a passenger for the final 20 minutes. That allowed the home side to continue to go forward in numbers, and Gerson Rodrigues should have done better with a weak shot from the edge of the box. Adam Rooney was booked for diving after going down in the box in a rare reprieve from late Fola pressure, with Hadji nearly poking a cross beyond Lewis in the last minute.	Aberdeen limped into the second qualifying round of the Europa league with a 3-2 aggregate win, despite going down to Fola Esch in Luxembourg.
The UK government has announced measures to speed up development. Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant has written to councils reminding them of the temporary ban on fracking in Wales. He said fracking technology was "unproven", saying Welsh ministers preferred to look at renewable energy. Fracking is a process of using high pressure water to break up rocks deep underground to release gas and pipe it to the surface. It is a major industry in the United States, but there are concerns about safety, the environment and underground water. There have been protests against applications for test drilling for gas in both the Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham, as well as sites in England. Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has stressed the UK government's support for fracking, and frustration at delays in its development. She has told councils in England to make decisions on applications within 16 weeks, to stop the process being "dragged out for months". In his letter to Welsh councils, Mr Sargeant said the new guidance only applied to England and that the moratorium in Wales remained in place. "The UK government's general support for oil and gas applications is contrary to the approach of the Welsh Government of promoting renewable and low carbon forms of energy through the planning system and other measures," he said. "We still see renewable energy as a key element in ensuring that Wales achieves sustainable development for the benefit of future generations. "Local planning authorities must ensure that planning applications for renewable energy projects are determined within statutory timescales." Plans to devolve control over fracking were confirmed in the Queen's Speech in June following the Conservatives' general election victory.	Fracking for shale gas in Wales should still be opposed despite plans to fast-track such schemes in England, the Welsh government has said.
Father-of-two Timothy Mardon had barricaded himself in after hearing intruders going from room to room. Three men broke into the Grade II listed mansion in Sible Hedingham, Essex on 6 February. One man denies attempted murder and aggravated burglary. Two others have denied aggravated burglary. Mr Mardon, who is in his 40s, had a high-powered job at an insurance firm, but the raiders had mistakenly believed he was a drug dealer. He told Chelmsford Crown Court he was home alone when he awoke to the sound of voices and footsteps on his gravel drive. A man could be seen trying to force open a sash window, he said. Mr Mardon had called 999, and was still on the line to the police when he was shot, the court was told. A recording of the call, which lasted almost 35 minutes, was played to the jury. "Suddenly there was a loud explosion," said Mr Mardon, giving evidence. "I was thrown to the ground and the door burst open and the individual with the stocking over his head burst into the room wielding a gun." The court heard the gunman screamed at him: "Where's the weed money?" With blood pouring from the leg wound, he replied: "I don't deal weed. I work for an insurance company." Mr Mardon said the intruder threatened to kill his family if he was lying. Charlie Simms, 23 from Great Yeldham, Kalebh Shreeve, 24, and Christopher Bergin, 27, both from Sible Hedingham, deny charges of aggravated burglary, wounding with intent, possessing a firearm, and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Mr Simms also denies attempted murder. The trial continues.	A millionaire businessman whispered to a 999 operator that burglars were in his mansion, moments before he was shot through a locked door, a court heard.
The 56-year-old ex-Derbyshire skipper leaves his post as club president to take the newly created job. Graeme Welch left as elite performance director in June, having been appointed following a management revamp in 2014. "We have not achieved enough success in recent years. We're determined to change this," said Barnett. "With a strong captain and players technically sound and tactically clued up, we will be in a great position for next season." Derbyshire finished bottom of Division Two, having failed to win a County Championship match in 2016. A review of the "cricket pathway to the first XI" was undertaken, with a new coaching structure put in place alongside a "targeted" recruitment drive for experience senior players, which will be funded by savings made by revamping the coaching team. Barnett will head a smaller backroom staff "streamlined" and aided by player-coaches, who will work "occasionally" with specialised "world class" coaches and cricketers. The new structure sees the post of first XI support coach and Twenty20 specialist coach created - neither of which have been filled yet. "The Elite Performance model regrettably has not produced the results that we have been hoping for," Derbyshire chairman Chris Grant told the club website. "We have been spending over 20% of our overall cricket budget on coaching and this new model will achieve a better balance between our coaching and playing budget."	Former England batsman Kim Barnett has been named Derbyshire director of cricket in the latest coaching restructure at the Division Two club.
The UN bestowed the honorary title to the famed heroine, also known as Princess Diana of Thermyscira, on her 75th birthday on Friday, marking the launch of a year-long social media campaign to promote women's empowerment and gender equality. But the decision was not without controversy, sparking outrage among both UN members and women's rights advocates across the world. More than 1,000 of anonymous and "concerned" UN staff members have signed an online petition arguing that Wonder Woman was not an appropriate choice, noting the character's physique as: "a large breasted, white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery, thigh-baring body suit with an American flag motif and knee high boots -the epitome of a "pin-up" girl". Critics who signed the petition said it was "disappointing" that the UN "was unable to find a real-life woman that would be able to champion the rights of ALL women on the issue of gender equality and the fight for their empowerment". The comic book superhero has sprung back into culture relevance with the upcoming release of a new Wonder Woman film starring Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who appeared at the UN ceremony along with actress Lynda Carter, who also portrayed her in the eponymous 1970s US TV series. Wonder Woman, an Amazonian princess who was created by Harvard-trained psychologist William Moulton Marston in 1941, was inspired by the leaders of the suffragist movement and has been long considered a feminist icon. "The focus [of the UN] was on her feminist background, being the first female superhero in a world of male superheroes and that basically she always fought for fairness, justice and peace," UN official Maher Nasser told NPR. The organisation said the character's appointment was meant to "highlight what we can collectively achieve if women and girls are empowered" and "to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls", according to the UN's website on sustainable development goals. But the honour appeared to be ill-timed. The announcement follows the UN's selection of Portugal's Antonio Guterres as its next Secretary General despite a global push for the organisation to select its first female top diplomat. In fact, a recent analysis found that nine of 10 senior leadership roles at the UN went to men. Prospective female candidates in the race included the former prime minister of New Zealand, the director general of cultural agency Unesco, the Moldovan deputy prime minister and a senior EU official. Why wasn't a woman elected as UN secretary general? "It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualized image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls," the petition read. About 100 UN staff members protested the appointment at UN headquarters, bearing signs emblazoned with the words: "I am not a mascot" and "Let's get real". Outrage reverberated across social media, with women's rights advocates pointing to real-life women who fit the bill over Wonder Woman. France's highest-ranking female Cabinet minister, Segolene Royal, told CBS "Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai would have been a good choice". Anne Marie Goetz, a New York University professor of global affairs and former adviser on peace and security issues for UN Women, called the decision "disgusting". Feminist icon Gloria Steinem also told CBS she was "all for symbolism" but "we are now looking for women with real terrestrial power." She added she would rather see the ascension of the UN's first female Secretary General. Some critics contend the character's appointment appears to be dated at a time when gender equality is at the forefront of global issues. "She stands for things that people still care about and will always care about so much that she's never going to fade away," Diane Nelson, the president of DC Entertainment, told the BBC. "Her ability to operate alone and be her own independent person but also to work right alongside with the same strength and same abilities as some of the strongest male super heroes I think is a testament to her character and kind of ties back again to the UN designation and this idea of gender equality."	The United Nations has come under fire for appointing comic book character Wonder Woman as its new Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls.
Rosberg has won the first three races of the season to build a commanding 36-point lead in the championship. Hamilton said: "Of course there is an urgency. I can't really afford to fall any further back than that. "Who knows how the weekend will go? It could be as bad as in the past but I'm hoping it will be positive." Hamilton has finished second, third and seventh in the races so far. Bad starts took him out of the reckoning for victory in the first two races in Australia and Bahrain and then in China technical trouble left him at the back of the grid, from where he was involved in a crash at the first corner. Formula 1 has introduced new rules this season that gives the drivers more control at starts, reducing the technical assistance they get from the car. And Hamilton said he had been encouraged before Sunday's race in Sochi by the fact he had made a good start in Shanghai from his position at the back of the grid. "I made the best start," he said. "At the end of the weekend the team analyse the starts and I had the best of everyone, they told me. "This is a circuit where you need that because I think it is one of the longest runs to Turn One and it is easy to get drafted so a good start would help." Rosberg, who has won won six grands prix in a row dating back to last October in Mexico, said he was expecting a fightback from Hamilton over the remaining 18 races. "I'm pleased with the way I'm driving," he said. "For me it's not six straight, it's three, because I only count from the start of this season. "I have been driving really well but my opposition had a really messy start and I definitely expect them to bounce back, especially Lewis. And it is going to be really tough, like always. There is a massively long way to go still." Rosberg said Ferrari would also be a tough challenge for Mercedes, despite their difficult start to the season. "I'm not sounding a note of caution, I'm just realistic," he added. "Ferrari among others haven't shown what they can do yet - as an example they took each other out at the first corner in the last race. "They are a lot quicker than they have shown and for sure they are very close to us." But Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel said he believed the Italian team were still not quite on Mercedes' pace. "I hope we can be very close this weekend," the four-time champion said. "First of all have a smooth weekend and see where we are. "We know we are probably not close enough but the race is on Sunday and there is always a chance. "We expected Mercedes to be very strong. Of course it is important you score points at this stage of the season, but there is still a long way to go. Our feeling is good but we know we can ramp it up."	Lewis Hamilton says he must beat Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg at this weekend's Russian Grand Prix to kick-start his title defence.
Kieren Moss crossed twice to give the hosts an early lead at Craven Park before Ben Heaton scored the first of his four tries for the visitors.

Last year's event, the first at Strathallan in Perthshire, was criticised over traffic issues and antisocial behaviour. DF Concerts said improvements include colour-coded zones, better signage and 24-hour dedicated management teams. This year's event will take place between 8 July and 10 July. The Stone Roses, Calvin Harris and Red Hot Chili Peppers will headline the main stage over the three nights. Last year's T in the Park had a daily attendance of about 85,000 people with an estimated 70,000 of those camping. DF Concerts has produced an animated video highlighting the new campsite layout. T in the Park security manager Colin Brown, said: "We have overhauled the campsite layout and management and guarantee there will be well-informed stewards on hand to assist with any questions. "The layout, clearly marked-out zones and improved signage will make getting about much easier, meaning our campers can concentrate on having a good time." DF Concerts said the Slam and King Tut's tents would open exclusively for campers on Thursday 7 July. Last week, the promoter announced that this year's festival arena will increase in size by a third. It will publish revised transport plans for the event next week. Campsite entertainment manager Gail MacKenzie said: "We know that the campsite is a huge part of the T in the Park experience and have listened to feedback from last year. "As a result the entertainment will be enhanced and we're even opening the King Tut's Tent on the Thursday for the first time ever. "	T in the Park organisers have announced an overhaul of the festival's campsite that will see it increase in size by a quarter.
Some dairy farmers have said they face going out of business if prices they receive for their products do not rise. They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production. Asda has said it will begin paying 28p a litre for milk from Monday. Dairy farmers currently receive about 19p a litre for milk, well below the cost of production at about 27p. Asda confirmed on Friday that it had told Dale Farm, its Northern Ireland supplier, that it will increase the price it pays to 28p a litre. It said this would "assist our farmers during the current crisis". Ian Marshall, the president of the UFU, said Asda's move was something farmers were "glad to see" and hoped other retailers would follow. But he warned that the situation remained "dire" for those in the dairy industry. "It's a starting point for us," Mr Marshall said. "What we're seeing is a move in the right direction. "We just hope it's something that it can roll out to other products, not just milk." Mr Marshall said farmers accept that they need to "strive to produce as efficiently as possible". Asda has said that the cost of paying more for milk will not be passed on to its customers and retail prices will remain at their current rate.	A decision by supermarket chain Asda to increase the price it pays for milk is a move in the right direction, the Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) has said.
Stamp duty would raise less money per head in Wales than the rest of the UK, the Wales Governance Centre claims. The Cardiff University experts fear the UK Treasury could cut the block grant based on revenue predictions inflated by the London property market. They have called for the figures to be adjusted to set Wales "a more realistic and achievable target". Control of property and landfill taxes passes to Wales in April 2018, with the prospect of power over income tax rates to follow. Until now, the Welsh Assembly and Welsh Government have largely been funded by a block grant from the UK Treasury. Negotiations are due to begin in the autumn over how much the grant will be cut as Wales raises more of its own income. On the subject of stamp duty, a Wales Governance Centre report said there was a "very significant difference" between revenues per head in Wales and the UK as a whole. It claimed it could result in a "large negative impact" on the Welsh budget - about £50m a year - if the higher UK figure was taken as the benchmark for income. Report author Ed Poole said changes to grant funding "exposes the Welsh Government to the deep-rooted differences in UK housing market conditions". He added: "In many ways, the property market of London and south east England is detached to that of the rest of the UK and is heavily influenced by international factors totally outside the control of the Welsh Government. "And that distinct nature of London's property market has further amplified since the UK's vote to leave the European Union. "Excluding revenues from London and south east England from the adjustment calculations would still provide an incentive for the Welsh Government to grow the Welsh tax base, but with a more realistic and achievable target."	Wales could suffer a budget shortfall if devolved taxes do not make up for grant cuts, academics have warned.
Character actor Wallach - who began his film career in 1956 after 10 years on stage - was admired for his wide range in a career spanning six decades. His portrayal of bandit chief Calvera in The Magnificent Seven was regarded by many as his definitive role. When he received an honorary Oscar in 2011, he was described as a "quintessential chameleon". Though he was never nominated for an Oscar during his 60-year career, the Academy rewarded him in 2011 for "effortlessly inhabiting a wide range of characters, while putting his inimitable stamp on every role". His films included the classic westerns How the West Was Won and The Misfits. Arguably best known for his villains, he made a lasting impression as Tuco opposite Clint Eastwood, in Sergio Leone's 1966 spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Years later, Wallach said strangers would recognise him and start whistling the distinctive theme tune. "As an actor I've played more bandits, thieves, warlords, molesters and mafioso than you could shake a stick at," the Hollywood Reporter quoted him as saying. He was also successful in light comedy and appeared in many TV shows, including playing Mr Freeze for a spell in the 1960s Batman TV series. The veteran star continued making films into his 90s, making his last big screen appearance in Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps in 2010. His death was confirmed by his daughter Katherine in the New York Times. Wallach was born on 7 December 1915 in Brooklyn to Polish Jewish immigrants. He graduated from the University of Texas, initially intending to become a teacher. But his focus shifted to acting, and after serving in World War II he studied at the Actors' Studio, where he became a practitioner of method acting. He first appeared on the New York stage in 1945, where he met his wife Anne Jackson, to whom he was married for 65 years. Wallach made his London debut in 1954 with The Teahouse of the August Moon. His screen debut came two years later, playing an unscrupulous seducer in Baby Doll. The role earned him a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor and a Bafta award for most promising newcomer. But the theatre remained Wallach's first love. "For actors, movies are a means to an end,'' he told the New York Times in 1973. ''I go and get on a horse in Spain for 10 weeks, and I have enough cushion to come back and do a play.'' He became a household name as Calvera in 1960's The Magnificent Seven, alongside Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn. He went on to earn an Emmy in 1967 for his supporting turn in the drama Poppies Are Also Flowers, and picked up four further nominations - most recently for his guest turns in Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (2007) and Nurse Jackie (2010). Other notable roles came in How the West Was Won, Mystic River, The Holiday, Lord Jim, and The Godfather: Part III, playing an ill-fated Mafioso. Asked about possible retirement, he told the Times in 1997: ''What else am I going to do? I love to act."	Eli Wallach, whose films included The Magnificent Seven and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, has died aged 98.
Members of the RMT union will walk out at 11:00 BST on 26 April and at the same time on 10 and 12 May. The union is against plans for a new grade of on-board supervisor and proposals for drivers to operate doors. Govia Thameslink said there would be no job losses or cuts in salary and the changes would make staff more visible. Members of the union were 306 in favour of walkouts and 14 against. A total of 320 votes to one backed other forms of industrial action. The RMT said it was fighting to keep the conductor grade and the changes were "nothing short of bullying and harassment". RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the "reward" for the "loyal and professional service" of members was having their "role and responsibility reduced and their hard-earned terms and conditions attacked". "These trains are desperately over-crowded and the conductors are the eyes and ears preventing a major tragedy on the platforms and carriages," he said. He added the company had already axed catering services, "threatened" ticket offices and delivered "appalling levels of customer service in their drive to milk these routes for every penny they can". A spokesman for Southern, which is run by Govia Thameslink, described any possible strike action as "unnecessary and damaging". He added: "The changes we are making to the conductor role mean there will be no job losses and no reduction in salary for any staff, whilst passengers will benefit from having more visible staff on trains. "We are preparing contingency plans in case a strike does go ahead, but in the meantime we urge the RMT to return to the negotiating table." Southern operates in Sussex, Surrey and parts of Kent and Hampshire.	Conductors on Southern railway are to stage three 24-hour strikes in a dispute over changes to their role and the introduction of driver-only trains.
Media playback is not supported on this device Amy Wilson Hardy went over in the corner as England scored from their only chance in the first half. Ireland could not breach England's solid defence and were made to pay as the world champions ran in four tries. Forwards Laura Keates and Amy Cokayne extended the visitors' lead before backs Emily Scarratt and Lydia Thompson rounded off the win with fine tries. With the under-20 men's side having won a Grand Slam earlier on Friday, England's men will look to complete a hat-trick by beating Ireland in Dublin on Saturday. The women, who return to Ireland in the summer to defend their world title, have won their first Six Nations title since 2012. Wing Wilson Hardy completed a fine England move in the 16th minute, but then Ireland dominated play. Centre Sene Naoupu came within a metre of going over but was stopped by a superb tackle from flanker Marlie Packer, and home captain Paula Fitzpatrick was prevented from touching down by a posse of England players. England regrouped after half-time and extended their lead when replacement prop Keates drove over the line from two metres out. Ireland were reduced to 14 players two minutes before the hour when substitute Mairead Coyne made a deliberate knock-on. Hooker Cokayne burst through to increase England's advantage but Ireland hooker Leah Lyons responded to give Ireland hope. However, Scarratt finished off an excellent England move to put the result beyond doubt and then replacement winger Thompson showed her pace to score England's fifth try. Ireland: Flood, Tyrrell, Murphy, Naoupu, Miller, Stapleton, Muldoon; Peat, Lyons, Egan, Spence, Reilly, Griffin, Molloy, Fitzpatrick (capt). Replacements: O'Connor, Van Staden, O'Reilly, Cooney, Fryday, Healy, Caughey, Coyne. England: Waterman, Wilson Hardy, Scarratt, Reed, Wilson, Scott, Mason; Clark, Cokayne, Lucas, Taylor, Millar-Mills, Matthews, Packer, Hunter. Replacements: Fleetwood, Cornborough, Keates, Cleall, Noel-Smith, Blackburn, Burford, Thompson.	England completed a Women's Six Nations Grand Slam by beating a physical Ireland 34-7 at rainy Donnybrook.
The Scots can reach the World Cup quarter-finals with a victory at St James' Park on Saturday. "In a World Cup you don't go out half-hearted to get through to the next game," said Visser. "I don't think any coach puts out a second string squad to do that against South Africa." Stuart Hogg continues at full-back and will be the only player to start the first three Pool B matches for Scotland. Fly-half Finn Russell is absent through injury and flanker John Hardie is not being risked after suffering a head knock in the opening win over Japan. Impressive performers Sean Maitland and Mark Bennett are left out, while experienced front-row duo Ross Ford and Alasdair Dickinson are on the bench. Gordon Reid, Richie Vernon, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and Blair Cowan, who was called up in place of the injured Grant Gilchrist, are all in the match-day 22 for the first time at the tournament. "We've had three games in 10 days and the squad has been selected with 31 players to do the job," added Visser, a try-scorer in the win over USA. "We're expecting everyone to perform and we're going out to win the game tomorrow." Scotland top the group after two bonus-point victories, while the Springboks recovered from a surprise loss against Japan to demolish Samoa. The big-hitting Pacific Islanders are Scotland's final opponents before the knockout phase of the tournament. But Visser is only focused on the task ahead in Newcastle. "South Africa are a physical team and that generally comes out in the forwards because that's the way they like to play. But they have quality throughout the team," added the 28-year-old. "They've got a world class set of backs and some young players have come through really well recently. "They have a world class finisher in Bryan Habana as well, so they are incredibly dangerous. We'll keep an eye on Willie le Roux at the back as well - he's a handy player." South Africa: Willie le Roux; JP Pietersen, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Bryan Habana; Handre Pollard, Fourie du Preez (captain); Tendai Mtawarira, Bismarck du Plessis, Jannie du Plessis; Eben Etzebeth, Lood de Jager; Francois Louw, Schalk Burger, Duane Vermeulen. Replacements: Adriaan Strauss, Trevor Nyakane, Frans Malherbe, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Willem Alberts, Ruan Pienaar, Pat Lambie, Jan Serfontein. Scotland: Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour, Richie Vernon, Matt Scott, Tim Visser, Duncan Weir, Greig Laidlaw, (capt), Gordon Reid, Fraser Brown, Willem Nel, Richie Gray, Jonny Gray, Josh Strauss, Blair Cowan, David Denton. Replacements: Ross Ford, Alasdair Dickinson, Jon Welsh, Tim Swinson, Ryan Wilson, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne, Peter Horne, Sean Lamont.	Winger Tim Visser insists Scotland are only thinking about beating South Africa and rejects the notion that the side is weakened by 10 changes.
Three masked men, two armed with handguns, forced their way into the property in Glenfearna Gardens in the Lagmore estate at 22:45 BST on Friday. They threatened the women, aged 81, 49, and 25, and tied up the 49-year-old during the robbery. The gang left in a small silver vehicle with a substantial sum of cash. One of the women, Saoirse Joyce, said it was a traumatising experience. "They barged into my room - two masked men that I could see," she said. "I just jumped up to the window and pushed the window open and shouted out help, but one of them trailed me down by the hair onto the ground and said to the other one 'hold her there'. "He pointed a gun to my head and I couldn't move and all I kept saying was 'my granny, my granny',". Det Const Fiona Mills said: "This was a despicable act perpetrated against three generations of the one family. "All of these women have been left understandably extremely shaken and upset by the ordeal." Police appealed for anyone with information to contact them.	Three generations of women from the same family have been threatened during an armed robbery at a house in west Belfast.
It will be used to stage competitive cycle sports as well as recreational events, coaching and training. The Welsh Government has agreed to sign over some land near the entrance to Pembrey Country Park, meaning work can start shortly. Welsh Cycling welcomed the announcement. Chief executive Anne Adams-King said: "The development of cycling facilities in Wales is a priority for Welsh Cycling as they provide opportunities for all to cycle encouraging physical activity and progression through sport to elite performance." It is expected to make more than £25,000 a year from entrance fees and caravan and camping stays.	Work will begin on a £500,000 purpose-built cycling circuit in Carmarthenshire after a funding boost from the council.

The bears batted it around until their sharp claws eventually popped it. Xaviera Simons was visiting the safari park when she filmed the moment.	When a stray pink balloon drifted into the sloth bear enclosure at a zoo in the Netherlands the curious bears there saw it as a great opportunity to play.
She is the regiment's colonel-in-chief and will attend the colours parade at the home of Welsh rugby on 11 June. Members of the public from across Wales and the UK have been invited to attend the event. The presentation of new colours will be the final formal recognition of The Royal Welsh. It was formed in 2006 after the merger of two regiments - the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Regiment of Wales. She will also address the regiment and meet soldiers, their families and others associated with the regiment. In recent years the regiment has served in Iraq and Afghanistan.	The Queen will present new colours to Wales' infantry regiment The Royal Welsh at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff next week.
Kerri Imelda Doherty was supposed to see four offenders at least once a month, a Care Council for Wales (CCW) hearing in Cardiff was told. The men needed regular visits because they could suffer a relapse which could put the public at risk. Ms Doherty denied any wrongdoing but three allegations were found proven. A fourth charge of acting "dishonestly" was found not proven. The hearing was told Ms Doherty worked for Vale of Glamorgan council as a senior social worker and had years of experience. Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed "significant crimes" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act. Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent. "[This led] to a potential increased risk of somebody's mental health deteriorating and an escalation in their behaviour - which is more likely to go undetected," he said. Mr Cole also said the minimum four-week frequency of visits was set by doctors and would have been "clearly marked" on official documents. In her evidence, Ms Doherty told the panel she often had an excessive work-load, inadequate management support and often felt "left out on a limb". The hearing was also told that bereavement had caused her to "burn out" and that her life had become "chaotic" as a result. Ms Doherty, who had been subject to a suspension order since the allegations came to light in 2014, told the hearing she was not seeking to return to social care. A report by the care watchdog said: "The committee finds that only a Removal Order will be adequate in this case given the seriousness of the impairment."	A social worker who failed to make regular visits to convicted criminals with mental health problems has been struck off.
An international team of maritime archaeologists are diving, excavating and recording the wreck of Dutch ship the Rooswijk off the Kent coast. All 300 shipmen died when the vessel, carrying coins and silver ingots, sank on Goodwin Sands in January 1740. Never before have any of the Dutch East India Company's 250 wrecks been scientifically excavated on this scale. Historic England manages the protected site and is working with the Dutch government, which owns the ship's remains. It is only now, after more than 250 years, that the sands have shifted enough to unveil the wreckage. Some explorations were carried out last year and those finds are being showcased as part of the #Rooswijk1740 project, led and financed by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, with open days in Ramsgate between 19 August and 16 September. They include a large seaman's chest, pewter jugs, ornately carved wooden knife handles and leather shoes. The current mission will see archaeologists delve further into the storage rooms and living quarters in the stern of the ship. Martijn Manders, project leader of the Rooswijk Excavation and Maritime Heritage programme manager at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, said: "The Goodwin Sands has been a treacherous place for ships throughout the centuries and is now a treasure trove for archaeologists. "The rapidly shifting sands mean that the site is even more exposed now than it was during our initial dives to assess the condition of the Rooswijk last year. This makes the excavation urgent." The wreck is high on the Heritage at Risk register due to its exposed remains and vulnerability to the shifting sands. Alison James, maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said: "Wrecks such as the Rooswijk are time capsules that offer a unique glimpse into the past and tell a story. "We look forward to the fascinating insights and discoveries that the Rooswijk excavation will uncover this summer."	A ship excavation is expected to reveal a "treasure trove" of items and stories from Europe's global trading history.
The Championship side are willing to allow the Scotland international to leave on a free transfer, but they are also willing to consider a loan move. The 28-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of the season, joined Blues from Swindon in August 2012. He has since played in 159 games for the club, but has been limited to just one appearance this season. "We have had a very good chat," boss Gianfranco Zola told BBC Sport. "I've told him very clearly that I don't mind if he wants to stay. "He has players in front of him in his position, but I've told him that If you want to stay and fight and you deserve to play, then you will play." Caddis is a player whose name is imprinted in Birmingham footballing folklore, having scored the late goal at Bolton that kept Blues in the Championship on the final day of the season, in May 2014.	Birmingham defender Paul Caddis has been told he is free to find a new club after more than four years with Blues.

Ivan Cameron, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in hospital aged six in February 2009. Mrs Cameron told the Times: "Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant." She also said it changed her husband's outlook. "I think it changed Dave's politics. It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective." David Cameron had been an MP for less than a year when Ivan was born in 2002, and became prime minister the year after Ivan died. Mrs Cameron said: "From the moment he is born, you are living in a situation that is quite surreal and difficult to deal with. "It is intense every day, in and out of hospitals... in a way, that prepared me for Dave being prime minister, because I was used to living and operating in a way that's not normal." When Ivan died, she said, the outside world "became meaningless". "Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice." The Camerons have three other children; Nancy, born in 2004; Arthur, born in 2006; and Florence, born in 2010. Mrs Cameron also spoke about her family's life in Downing Street. "We tried to make the flat feel like a home. "Dave would be combing the children's hair for nits before giving a speech in the evening." They got their groceries delivered because there was no supermarket nearby - and if she forgot butter, she would have to go to a shop in Trafalgar Square. "So I did plan quite carefully." She also said she dreaded the official holiday photograph. "At the last minute we would panic and think, 'Oh God, it's the holiday photo... "I hated the holding-hands thing because it looked too romantic, so we overdid the cups-of-coffee-looking-wistful pose." Mrs Cameron was speaking to the Times Magazine to promote her clothing brand Cefinn. Before her husband became Prime Minister, she was creative director for Smythson, which makes luxury leather goods.	Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former Prime Minister, has said their son's death "overshadowed everything".

The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) bought the artwork for $650,000 (£420,000) from New York dealer Art of the Past in 2007. The company's manager later admitted selling stolen Indian antiquities, including the bronze being returned. The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities. The sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari is thought to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu in southern India. The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore's National Heritage Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The ASI submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, according to the museum. "While there is no conclusive proof that the sculpture was stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu, India, ACM took note of the confession of Aaron Freedman, who was the manager of Art of the Past, of dealing in looted Indian antiquities and of criminal possession of 150 stolen objects," the museum said in a statement. It was one of 30 objects ACM bought from the art dealer, although none of the others are thought to be listed as stolen. The ASI was reportedly allowed to view them, anyway. The museum said it will take legal action to get compensation for the apparent fraud.	A Singapore museum will return to India an 11th Century sculpture believed to have been stolen from that country.
The group trotted through the streets after escaping from a local ranch, but were soon captured following an unlikely police chase. Meanwhile a raccoon climbed a crane in Toronto and a lorry full of honeybees overturned in Washington state. And all this as the internet recovers from the great llama escape of 2015. Bernard Luyckx, a friend of the zebras' owner, said the animals were apparently upset by the sale of some of their stable-mates. "Some of the horses got sold and the other zebras got mad and trampled the gates and fled into the streets. Luckily there were no injuries, nobody got hurt, the zebras too." He said locals got "a free safari" on Friday. And the dazzle of zebras, to everyone's delight, did at one point appear to cross a zebra crossing. The raccoon, who was on his own so does not get a collective noun, was photographed by a crane operator more than 200 metres up a skyscraper. Rob MacFarlane told the Toronto Star the raccoon safely made it back to the ground again. "It's not unusual," he said. "Raccoons seem to like cranes."	Three zebras have gone on the loose in the Belgian capital Brussels, capping a generous helping of "animals at large" stories.
They have trained wild monitor lizards, known locally as goannas, not to eat the toxic amphibians. They did this by feeding the reptiles small, less potent cane toads. Many that tried the toads once did not make the same mistake again. The researchers say that extending the trial could help the continent's wildlife. The study is published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters. Lead researcher Georgia Ward-Fear, from the University of Sydney, said: "We've been very surprised by the results, by the amount of time that some of these lizards have actually retained this knowledge and survived in the presence of a high-density of cane toads, which is basically unheard of in the wild." Cane toads were introduced to Australia in the 1930s to control sugar cane pests. But the subsequent spread has been unstoppable, devastating the continent's animals. Among the hardest hit are the yellow-spotted monitors (Varanus panoptes).   Their population is estimated to have plummeted by 90%. When the toads invade a new area, these yellow-and-black-spotted reptiles feast on the amphibians, and subsequently die. "A goanna only has to mouth a toad for less than 30 seconds and it can kill them," said Dr Ward-Fear. "This species is quite abundant in ecosystems ahead of a cane toad invasion, and then as we see the invasion move through, they are basically wiped out of the landscape." In the trials, the researchers tracked down wild lizards before the toads descended. Dr Ward-Fear explained: "We presented them with a small toad via our very technical apparatus: a telescopic fishing pole. The toad had a little cotton belt attached to it. "We sidled up to the goanna in a very stealthy manner and extended the fishing pole." The young toads made the lizards sick, but were not toxic enough to do lasting harm. The scientists then attached radio transmitters to follow the goannas as the amphibians arrived in the area. Many of the 16 lizards who'd already tasted toad did not make the same mistake again - and more than half survived during the 18-month study period. The team also followed 31 "untrained" lizards that had not eaten the toads. "We saw the goannas that had not had a negative experience with the small toad died very quickly. They all died within three months of the natural cane toad invasion arriving at the site. At the end of the study, every untrained goanna had died." The scientists say the study suggests goannas have the ability to learn from experience and retain that knowledge over a long period of time. Dr Ward-Fear said: "This study provides the proof of principle that this strategy could be very effective. Employing it in the wild could potentially have a really large positive impact on the goanna population."

The Lib Dem leader said the Tories would have to cut 10,000 police officers, 28,000 carers and 25,000 military personnel to pay for the tax cuts promised by George Osborne. He said the poorest would "bear the heaviest burden". David Cameron has accused Mr Clegg of "running away from his record". The Lib Dems have announced that they want to raise the income tax threshold to £12,500 by 2020, which would be funded partly by using the proceeds of measures to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion. Mr Clegg said the Tory plans to raise the income tax personal allowance to £12,500, and also increase the 40p rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020 would cost more than £7bn. At a press conference at the National Liberal Club in London, Mr Clegg said: "To find that money they will have to do what Tories do best - cut. "Gone are the days of compassionate conservatism. Now they promise to cut and cut and cut. Not because they have to, but because they want to. "As George Osborne has said, the Conservatives will cut much deeper than is necessary to balance the books and make the poorest bear the heaviest burden. "But at the same time they are promising tax giveaways for the wealthy, all of which must be paid for by yet more cuts to public spending. "In the firing line are parents and police officers, soldiers and social workers." This issue includes the wider economy and deficit reduction but also employment and the role of business. Policy guide: Where the parties stand But in an article in The Daily Telegraph Mr Cameron told the newspaper that Mr Clegg's attacks on him will fail, he said: "I don't think it works because you can't run on your record and run away from your record at the same time." Mr Clegg also went on to criticise Labour and said Ed Miliband's plans for the deficit would mean an extra £134 from every taxpayer being spent on debt interest payments. "If the Conservatives will cut too much, Labour will borrow too much. "Labour will borrow £70bn more than we will - meaning an extra £4bn just to pay the interest on our debt," he said. His sentiments were echoed by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander who said the "common thread" running through the Lib Dem approach to tax was fairness. He said: "Fairness means that everyone should pay their taxes, zero tolerance of evasion and aggressive avoidance. Fairness means that as we finish the job of balancing the books, we should ask those who have the most to contribute to most." But in response to Mr Clegg's claims Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said nobody could trust the Lib Dems. He said: "They broke their promise not to raise VAT on families and pensioners and backed the Tory tax cut for millionaires. "For all their claims, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies says families have lost £1,100 a year on average when all this government's changes are taken into account - including the changes to the personal allowance. Like the Tories, the Lib Dems give with one hand but take much more with the other hand. "Labour's plan will back working people with fully funded tax cuts and reverse the Tory and Lib Dem tax giveaway for millionaires to balance the books in a fair way." Meanwhile, in an interview with The Economist, Nick Clegg has said that many of the voters who have stopped supporting his party "want to be entirely bereft of any responsibility". He told the publication: "There is clearly a section of the support we had in 2010 that was virulently anti-Conservative. "They're the ones who still scream and shout blue murder and have done so without pause for breath for half a decade. "And they're loud and they're noisy and they're angry. And that was a significant chunk of support that basically wanted to be associated with any party that didn't have the remotest sniff of power. "There just is a constituency out there that wants to be entirely bereft of any responsibility."

Riot police quelled skirmishes between rival fans behind one of the goals just before kick-off in England's 3-0 win. An English FA statement said the incidents had not taken place in the area where fans who bought tickets from the FA were located. The cases will be dealt with on Thursday, 22 October. "We would encourage the authorities to identify anybody involved in disorder and deal with them appropriately through the criminal system and with banning orders," the English FA said. "We will, of course, fully cooperate with Uefa." When fighting broke out, local police quickly intervened to form a barrier between fans to prevent the violence escalating. Some England fans appeared to have purchased tickets for sections of the ground designated for home supporters. Lithuania's FA has also been charged by European football's governing body over breaches of ticketing rules and for having blocked stairways. BBC Radio 5 live reporter Alan Green reported he had seen missiles being thrown by fans. And BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty added there had been "a few brief skirmishes between rival fans at one end of this tiny stadium where some England fans have posted themselves near Lithuania supporters". England won 3-0 with goals from Ross Barkley and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, either side of an own goal from Lithuania keeper Giedrius Arlauskis. The victory meant Roy Hodgson's side won all 10 of their qualifying matches for next summer's European Championship in France.	Uefa has charged the English and Lithuanian Football Associations over crowd disturbances at their Euro 2016 qualifier in Vilnius on Monday.
It is the third time Vitalmiro Bastos Moura has been tried for Dorothy Stang's 2005 death after previous convictions were overturned. Ms Stang, 73, campaigned for 30 years to save rainforest from the interests of wealthy landlords. She had tried to block Moura's attempts to seize land and was shot six times. Moura, who was convicted in 2007 and 2010 in verdicts that were subsequently overturned, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In the latest trial, the judge said Moura had acted in a cold-blooded and cowardly manner. Prosecutors earlier said Moura and another rancher had hired gunmen to kill Ms Stang. Moura's lawyers argued there wasn't enough evidence linking him to the crime. The death of Ms Stang in the northern state of Para became a symbol of the violent conflict for natural resources in Brazil's Amazon region. In the past 30 years, more than 1,000 people have been killed in land disputes in Brazil, with some two-thirds of the murders happening in Para. Ahead of the latest verdict, Ms Stang's sister, Barbara Richardson, said the repeated trials had been upsetting but had helped maintain a spotlight on the issues. "That keeps the injustice of the system before the people's eyes," she told AP. "Dorothy is ever prominent. The people understand what happened to her and what this means."	A Brazilian court has convicted a rancher for ordering the murder of an American nun over a land dispute - a case that caused international outrage.
Clive Weatherhogg's counsel told appeal judges that prosecutors now conceded there had been a miscarriage of justice over the coercion charge. Appeal judges also agreed that a jury was misdirected over charges relating to the footage sent to relatives. Mr Weatherhogg, 43, was jailed last May after being found guilty by a jury. It is understood he will now be released from prison. Sheriff George Way had remitted the case from Dundee Sheriff Court to the High Court in Edinburgh to be dealt with because of its greater sentencing powers. Defence counsel Shelagh McCall QC told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that the Crown conceded there was insufficient evidence to prove lack of consent on the coercion charge. The Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, who heard the appeal with Lady Paton and Lord Turnbull, said: "We are satisfied the concession is well made." Lord Turnbull said that information conveyed to the court seemed to show that even at an earlier preparatory marking stage in the case there were concerns over a lack of corroboration. Lady Dorrian said the appeal judges were also satisfied that misdirections given to jurors by Sheriff Way over the charges relating to the footage sent to relatives were "material and constituted a miscarriage of justice". Mr Weatherhogg, of Guthrie, near Forfar, Angus, had denied the charges during the trial, but admitted a separate charge of uploading the film to the internet. He was jailed for four-and-years by Lady Wolffe with an additional 18 months for the charge he admitted. The appeal hearing was told that Mr Weatherhogg had been in custody since March last year and had served the 18 month sentence, taking into account early release provisions.	A man jailed for six years for coercing a woman into having sex with a stranger and sending "revenge porn" to her family has had the convictions quashed.
Seal wardens on the National Trust (NT) reserve at Blakeney Point have recorded 180 more grey seal pups compared to this time last year. Coastal ranger Ajay Tegala said the location is a "fantastic" breeding site as "human disturbance is minimal." Mr Tegala predicts up to 1,800 pups could be born by the end of February. "The seals like Blakeney Point as it has beaches and dunes which are safe and easy places to have a pup with no predators," he said. Last year, 1,566 pups were counted during the four month breeding season at Blakeney Point, a split of shingle and sand jutting out into the North Sea. Seals have been breeding on the site since about 2001, when just 25 were recorded. Pup numbers reached over 1,000 for the first time during the 2012-13 breeding season, with newborns now increasing by about 25% year-on-year. Blakeney has become well known for its seals with thousands of tourist taking boat trips to see the colonies each year. Mr Tegala said: "We do a pup count twice a week and comparing this year to last year we're almost 200 ahead so it looks like the number will continue to increase and another record-breaking year is on the cards." Source: BBC Nature Visitors have been flocking to the north Norfolk coast to see the seals, prompting the NT to warn people to keep their distance and keep all dogs on leads.	More than 900 seal pups have been born on a north Norfolk nature reserve in the last three weeks giving experts hopes of another record breaking year.
Wellington monument on the Blackdown Hills, in Somerset, was built in 1817 but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris. The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding. Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was "crucial". Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo. But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been "expensive and unsustainable". Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to "understand this unique and somewhat complex monument". "We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected," he said. "The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk." Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a "more effective repair approach".	A computer model of one of the world's tallest three-sided obelisks is being made to find out why it is falling apart.
Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is "clearly under pressure". It comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding. The numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years. This trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E. Social care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly £20bn on services this year. But even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly £1bn short of what they need. By 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to £2.6bn. The money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way. It is expected to be phased in - with £1bn coming next year and the remaining £1bn spread out over the subsequent two. This will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities. Charities have called it a "sticking plaster" to the wider problems facing the sector. Although, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War. About 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive. One in 10 people face costs of over £100,000 once they pass the age of 65. And there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market. Analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are £100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care. Its researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a "hidden care tax" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care. To limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than £72,000 over their lifetime. This was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes. But the extra money will do nothing to help these people. More than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help. What happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help. In theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help. But given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope. They may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS. There is £100m extra to help A&Es ahead of next winter and £325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services. Eventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly £120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited.

The 45-year-old, who led Quins to the Premiership title in 2012, has been linked with the Italy head coach job. The club, which also won the Amlin Challenge Cup and the LV Cup under O'Shea, says it is searching for the Irishman's replacement. "The end of this season is the right time for me to move on," said O'Shea. "We have a very talented group of players and coaches who are intent on securing silverware this season. "That is my sole focus and where all our efforts are concentrated." O'Shea won 35 Ireland caps between 1993 and 2000, spending 10 years at London Irish as a player and coach before taking over at Quins. He took the job in the aftermath of the 'Bloodgate' scandal that ended with Dean Richards resigning. "All of us at the club are of course disappointed that Conor will be leaving us at the end of this season," said Harlequins chief executive David Ellis. "Conor took over after a difficult period in our history. "Under his leadership and through his determination, energy and positive approach he has helped restore pride in our famous shirt and rejuvenate the playing style for which we are known. "On behalf of all of us associated with Harlequins, I would like to thank Conor for his tireless and selfless commitment over the last six years, guiding us through our most successful period on the field. "Conor will leave the club in a significantly better place than he found us and for that we are all grateful to him." Quins are third in the Premiership table, six points behind leaders Saracens. "O'Shea has done a magnificent job at Harlequins, dragging the club from the low of the 'Bloodgate' saga and turning them into Premiership champions in 2012. "Under his tutelage Quins have also provided a host of England internationals, and at one point fielded a whole XV of England-qualified players. "With his contract up at the end of the season, O'Shea clearly feels ready for a new challenge, and has had discussions about replacing Jacques Brunel as Italy's head coach. "As for his successor, the former England boss Stuart Lancaster could possibly fit the bill as a like-for-like replacement."	Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea will leave The Stoop when his contract expires at the end of the season after six years in charge.
A Monitor report published in February called for the closure of acute services including the A&E department. The trust that runs the hospital was put into administration by the health regulator Monitor on Monday. Support Stafford Hospital campaigners and police said up to 30,000 people had joined the mile-long march, from the town centre to the hospital. The campaign group said the town's Market Square was so full of protesters it took 45 minutes for it to clear after the march started at about 1400 BST. Thousands of people had previously signed a petition calling for Stafford Hospital's services to remain and a campaign shop from the protest group has been set up in the town centre. By Chris KingBBC Radio Stoke For the past four years the name "Stafford Hospital" has been a byword for everything that is bad about the NHS. Today, 30,000 people turned out with their banners and placards to send out the message that they believe their hospital is now safe, and they are prepared to fight for its future. The special administrators were not there today but they will find it hard to ignore the views of so many people. Last week they told me that they were starting with a blank sheet of paper when it came to the future of services at the Mid Staffordshire Trust. This afternoon the people of Stafford gave them a clear indication of what they'd like them to write on it. Jean Tabarner, one of the marchers, said she had had cancer and that Stafford Hospital had saved her life. She said: "We've got to try - if you don't try, no-one will listen. We've got to keep plugging away and hope that the administrators listen to what the people around here want." Sue Hawkins, chair of the Support Stafford Hospital group, said she believed it was important for people to move on from what had happened in the past at the hospital. She said: "We've got a safe hospital today and we're looking to the future." She added: "We need to have an intensive care unit here, we need to have an accident and emergency 24 hours a day and we believe that's possible. "We know there have to be changes, we know there may have to be some alliance with another hospital to achieve that." Stafford Borough Council leader Mike Heenan, who joined the marchers, said: "The important thing is delivering services locally, for the local people. "That's what we're fighting for - so that acute services can stay in Stafford." Monitor has given the administrators for the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, Ernst and Young, 145 days to work with local healthcare organisations to produce a "sustainable plan" for the future of services at the Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals. The Contingency Planning Team (CPT) report to Monitor last month said staffing levels at the hospitals were not sufficient to meet required standards in the long term, given the current range of services and number of patients. It said some services, including accident and emergency, intensive care and maternity, could be provided at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, the Royal Wolverhampton Hospital Trust and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust instead. Unison officials said earlier this week the administrators had told the union that they "were not bound by the recommendations". The town of Stafford has a population of about 63,000 people, while its surrounding borough is made up of 122,000 people. The area covered by the health trust extends beyond that, also taking in homes covered by the Cannock Chase Council area. Staffordshire Police said there was no trouble during the march.	Thousands of people have marched in opposition to plans to downgrade Stafford Hospital's services.
Carayol, 26, is back to full fitness after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury which had kept him out for 13 months. Last month he signed a two-year extension to his contract at Middlesbrough, having been on loan at Brighton, and he says he is now focused on establishing himself as an international with the Gambia. I've got quite a lot of support there already and I've not even played so hopefully I can live up to the hype when I do play and make a lot of people happy "I think it's been a long time coming,  I've had a few times when they've invited me but it wasn't the right time for myself and my family," Carayol told BBC Africa Sport. "A few of the times I've had a little injury. So I didn't really want to come and perform half heartedly. I feel like it's the right time in my career now,"  Carayol explained. Carayol, who was born in Banjul, is targeting an appearance for The Scorpions in the forthcoming qualifiers for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. "Obviously I've spoken to them. I'm looking forward to the official invite and look forward to representing the Gambia in the Africa Nations Cup qualifiers. "All my family's Gambian, so everyone's excited and I'm going to have a lot of pressure when I do get the chance to play. "But for me, it's the experience of a professional footballer to go and represent your country. I've got quite a lot of support there already and I've not even played so hopefully I can live up to the hype when I do play and make a lot of people happy." The Gambia have been drawn in Group M of the 2017 Nations Cup qualifiers, along with South Africa, Cameroon and Mauritania. Despite facing formidable opposition, Carayol believes his country can cause an upset by qualifying for the 2017 finals to be held in Gabon in two years' time. "I always see challenges as something you can overcome and that's why they put challenges in front of you. "At least even if we don't qualify, everyone can be proud of us and say that we gave it a right go. "But for me personally, I'm looking more forward to the challenge of playing international football." The Gambia's first 2017 Nations Cup qualifier is against South Africa next month. Before that, Carayol is concentrating on helping Middlesbrough's bid for promotion to the Premier League. The club have a 2-1 advantage over Brentford going into the home leg of their Championship play-off semi-final. "The boys are really confident. Keep my fingers crossed and hopefully we can get over the line and I can be a Premier League player next year." If Carayol does reach the Premier League with Middlesbrough, he may well come up against other African icons such as Yaya Toure and Didier Drogba - players who have made their name in England's top flight. "They're massive role-models because as a young African player, you always look towards the people that you can actually relate to. "Oviously I've not had the chance to play internationals yet, but I've spoken to a few close friends of mine. "Albert Adomah who's at Middlesbrough - who represented Ghana at the World Cup - and Yannick Bolasie who's a really close friend of mine who represented DR Congo in the Africa Nations Cup just gone. "And they've all told me good things about playing African football, so I'm excited. I can't wait to get the chance to go and kick a ball out there and show everyone what I can do."	Middlesbrough winger Mustapha Carayol says it is the "right time" in his career to commit his international future to the Gambia.
Jessica Chisnall, 15, was hit by the bike on Ashton's Green Drive in St Helens as she walked home from school on 13 January. She suffered a severe head injury which resulted in bleeding on the brain. Her parents, Carl and Sara Chisnall, said their "smiling, laughing" daughter had "a long road to recovery". They said Jessica, who was due to take her GCSE exams this summer, "suffered a very severe head injury" with "eye socket injuries and deep cuts from head to toe". She remains in the neurology department at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. Police said two males were arrested and released on bail, and appealed for witnesses to come forward. "The depth of some of her injuries are still unknown so we are unsure how this will affect her in the future", her parents said. "We have not left her side and are sleeping with her." They described Jessica as a studious girl who is full of energy and very close to her two big sisters. "We say she is like the Tasmanian devil with all her energy. She will help anyone and has a heart of gold," they added. They thanked well wishers for their support and said Jessica was currently stable and "taking very small steps on to the road to recovery".	The parents of a teenage girl who was hit by a scrambler bike and put into a medically-induced coma say her future remains uncertain.
Opponents fear the development on the site in Hermitage Lane, Allington, will destroy ancient woodland and cause traffic gridlock. Developer Croudace Homes said the number of homes had been reduced from 600 and efforts made to cut the impact on the woodland of building a new road. The public inquiry in Maidstone is expected to last until 10 June. Barbara Woodward, from the New Allington Action Group (NAAG), said: "People are very upset. This is our last piece of green land. "We take our dogs for a walk in the woods, you can let them off their leads. If they build a road across the woods it will no longer be safe." She added that the inquiry was the "last step" to protect the woodland which she said had been on the site since the 14th Century. Councillor Fran Wilson, the Lib Dem leader of the borough council, said it would be "inappropriate" for the authority to comment at this stage. Following the public inquiry a recommendation will be made to the Secretary of State who will make a decision on the planning application.	An public inquiry is under way into plans for up to 500 new homes in an area of open land in Kent.
More than 20 competitors are due to take part in Saturday's event in Carrbridge in the Cairngorms. Carvers from Scotland, England, Ireland as well as continental Europe, Canada and the US regularly enter the competition. They can use only chainsaws - any other carving tool is banned - to carve logs into the shapes of animals and people. Last year's winner Pete Bowsher, from Moffat, is to return to defend the title, and retain the first place winner's prize the Claymore Trophy.	About 3,000 people are expected to attend the 14th annual Carve Carrbridge chainsaw carving competition.
Proposals for the upgraded tennis court at Anmer House would see it moved from its current position to improve views from the hall. The new court, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, would would be resurfaced with astroturf, says the application. King's Lynn Borough Council will consider the plans at a later date. The application, lodged by the Estate Office at Sandringham, says the "current tennis court needs extensive work to resurface" and it would make sense to "remove all the existing court and start again". It says: "On completion of the new court, the garden will be prepared to reinstate the fencing and re-erect parkland iron fencing." The Royal couple are known to be fans of tennis and have previously been spotted attending games at Wimbledon.	Plans to revamp the tennis court at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's country mansion have been submitted.
The inmate, from Romania, had been serving a 30-month sentence for sexually assaulting a girl under the age of 13. He was due for release from HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire on 6 January, but was deported on Friday morning. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said an investigation is now under way. A spokesman said the man had not been released out on to the streets, but placed in an immigration removal centre. "He was placed in an immigration removal centre before being removed from the country the following day," he said. "Incidents like this are extremely rare." An investigation was under way to establish the circumstances of the man's release, he added.	A sex offender was mistakenly released from prison a month early, the BBC has learned.
The Dutch firm said the 26.9bn euro (Â£22.8bn) offer undervalued Akzo and showed a "lack of cultural understanding of the brand". The company, which claims its own plans for growth are superior, has been urged to reject a merger by the Dutch government and its own workers. But some Akzo investors favour a deal. PPG said it was disappointed by Akzo Nobel's decision and would "review" the firm's response. It comes several weeks after PPG increased its offer to buy the Amsterdam-based firm for the second time as it seeks to create an industry leader in the paints and coatings sector. The US firm suggested the bid was its last friendly attempt to merge with Akzo and has not ruled out putting the matter directly to shareholders. But responding on Monday, Akzo chief executive Ton Buchner said his team had conducted an "extensive review" of the bid and had again found it wanting. "The PPG proposal undervalues AkzoNobel, contains significant risks and uncertainties, makes no substantive commitments to stakeholders and demonstrates a lack of cultural understanding," he said. Akzo says its own plans for the firm - which involve spinning off its chemicals division into a separate business - would better serve shareholders. It has promised to increase its dividend for 2017 by half and pay a 1bn euro special cash dividend in November. However, it also faces mounting pressure from some of its biggest shareholders to consider a deal, having repeatedly refused to enter talks with PPG's management. Last month, the activist investor Elliot Investors also called for a vote to oust chairman Antony Burgmans - a proposal Akzo rejected. In its favour, Akzo has won political support against a tie-up, with four provincial governments having warned of its impact on jobs. The company also says that PPG would struggle to get the deal past Dutch competition regulators, which poses a risk to shareholders. As part of its latest offer, PPG offered commitments on jobs and to pay a break fee in case the deal was rejected by officials. In a statement on Monday, it said: "[Akzo] has once again refused to enter into a negotiation regarding a combination of the two companies, ignoring the best interests of its stakeholders, including long-term shareholders who overwhelmingly support engagement." Akzo Nobel shares fell more than 2% in morning trading in Amsterdam but have jumped about 30% this year.	Akzo Nobel, the owner of Dulux paint, has rejected a third takeover offer by US rival PPG Industries, leaving the door open to a hostile bid.
A trailer was taken from Burton's Foods Ltd on Ty Coch Way, Cwmbran, Torfaen on 17 June. The two men, from Liverpool and Cheshire, had been charged with theft. A hearing at Newport Magistrates' Court heard a third man will appear in court in relation to the alleged theft on Friday.	The case against two men accused of stealing £20,000 of biscuits from the makers of Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels has been dropped.
On Monday the Austin resident used a golf buggy to pick some of them up. The Sure Walk project has been set up to ensure students get back safely from campus when it is dark. McConaughey, 47, graduated from the university in 1993. He is an avid fan of its American football team. A photograph of him dressed in an orange shirt driving smiling and startled students home was posted by the university on social media. Matthew McConaughey: From rom-com star to Oscar winner "Longhorns take care of each other, and it's 'safe' to say Matthew McConaughey agrees," a post on the university's Facebook page says. "Don't forget to use Sure Walk when travelling home late at night; you never know who might pick you up!" Sure Walk - or Students United for Rape Elimination - provides students of the University of Texas at Austin with "volunteer companionship while walking home from campus". It expanded its services earlier this month from 7pm to 2am every day of the week, the university's news magazine said. It provides students with "peace-of-mind when studying late at night and ensure[s] safety for all". Canada police to punish drink-drivers with Nickelback Australian man's 'breast implant' find revealed as jellyfish New five pound note not suitable for vegetarians Born in the small city of Uvalde, Texas, McConaughey eschewed a role in the family oil pipe business to study radio, TV and film at the University of Texas. Although he is perhaps best known for his leading roles in rom-coms such as Failure to Launch and The Wedding Planner, he won an Oscar for Best Actor in the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club. In one of his latest films, The Sea of Trees, he stars as a suicidal man who travels to Japan to take his own life. Yet McConaughey has acknowledged that it is the rom-coms that have provided him with his "bread and butter", telling the Daily Telegraph in a recent interview that has no qualms about being associated with the genre.	Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey has surprised students at the University of Texas at Austin by taking part in a scheme to provide them with safe late-night lifts home.
A 30ft (9m) decomposed whale washed up on the beach at Felixstowe on Sunday and the body of a minke whale was spotted near Orford on Saturday. Scientists from the Cetaceans Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) say there is now a third dead whale off the coast. They do not think the deaths are linked. The third whale floating off the Suffolk coast is thought to be a sperm whale, Rob Deaville, from CSIP, said. More on this and other news from Suffolk He believes the whale on the beach at Felixstowe is a fin whale and a large injury on its body is the result of it being struck by a vessel "some time ago, perhaps hundreds of miles away". CSIP - which attends cases of whales, porpoises and dolphins that become stranded on the UK coastline - is currently examining the Felixstowe whale. It is too decomposed to carry out a full post-mortem test but samples have been taken to assist with analysis in terms of whale population, Mr Deaville said. The Orford whale stranded on mud flats on the tidal River Ore will be "tricky to get to", Mr Deaville said. However, he does not believe the deaths are in any way related. "Three very different species, and in my opinion, they're not linked," he said. "It's a series of coincidental events. "We see hundreds of strandings a year, it just happens that these three are in close proximity." A spokeswoman for Suffolk Coastal and Waveney Councils said contractors were expected to remove the whale from the beach at Felixstowe on Wednesday. It is not yet known when the body of the Orford whale will be moved.	A third dead whale has been found by experts investigating the deaths of two others found along the Suffolk coast.
In May, Qatar vowed to improve the rights of migrants in the Gulf state amid growing alarm at their treatment. But Amnesty said  progress to end exploitation had been minimal. Among others, the report highlighted that Qatar was "lagging behind" in reforming controversial laws that tie migrants to a single employer. Amnesty said that requirements that workers obtain exit permits from their employers in order to leave the country were also still in place. Sherif Elsayed-Ali, Head of Refugee and Migrants' Rights at AI, said: "Time is running out fast. It has been four years since Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, putting itself in the global spotlight, so far its response to migrant labour abuses has not been much more than promises of action and draft laws." "Urgent action is needed to ensure we do not end up with a World Cup tournament that is built on forced labour and exploitation." The Gulf state has seen an influx of foreign workers ahead of the football tournament and expatriates now make up the bulk of the workforce in the country. Earlier in November, Qatar's Sports Minister Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al-Ali told The Associated Press news agency that the country planned to implement labour reforms in the "next few months". Amnesty says the proposals do not go far enough. The report said that Qatari officials increasingly acknowledge the need for improvement but that widespread changes must happen in the coming months. A failure to put serious changes in place would "call into question whether the Qatari authorities are serious about reform," said AI. More than 180 migrant workers died in Qatar last year and a significant number are believed to have suffered injuries as a result of unsafe working practices. Qatar is reported to be spending more than $200bn (Â£121bn) on a series of infrastructure projects, and says the World Cup is a catalyst for a nationwide building project.	Qatar is failing to tackle the abuse of migrant workers, Amnesty International has warned, six months after work began on the Fifa World Cup 2022 stadiums.
The plans would allow victims to ask for a case to be reviewed when police identified a suspect but did not pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service. The policy would begin with rape and child sexual exploitation cases. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was time to "put victims in the driving seat". The CPS already has a right to review scheme in place, where victims can request a review of their case if it is dropped by prosecutors before reaching the courtroom. Labour said it intended to extend this to decisions by the police. Ms Cooper said: "Rape and child sexual exploitation are vile crimes that ruin lives and destroy families. "Too often victims and survivors aren't listened to and aren't heard, especially children. "And although reports to the police have gone up, arrests and prosecutions have gone down. "But right now if the police decide not to pursue a crime, there is little more victims or their families can do. That's not good enough. "We'll change the law so that if the police decide to drop a case after a suspect has been identified, victims will have a new right to challenge their decision. "It's time to change the culture, stop these awful crimes being hidden away and put victims in the driving seat." Main pledges Labour said that of 16,300 complaints of rape made to the police in England and Wales in 2012-13, 5,400 were passed to the CPS. The party said a decision to drop a case when a suspect had been identified would follow the process used by the CPS, of local resolution followed by independent review. Under the plans, the decision to drop the case would be first be checked by a prosecutor who has not been involved with the case previously. Labour said it would ensure victims were provided with a clear and detailed explanation of the decision and the local resolution would normally be completed within 10 days of the receipt of a request for review. If the victim were not satisfied with the local resolution, the decision would be independently reviewed by another prosecutor. Former Thames Valley Chief Constable and head of the National Policing Improvement Agency, Peter Neyroud, said: "It is critical that victims have a right to review decisions all the way from the duty to record and allegation, through to decisions on whether to pursue a prosecution. "Not only does this put the spotlight of accountability on the police, but it also gives the victim an important additional opportunity to influence their case and understand the decisions. "Sometimes this will encourage a fresh angle to the case; sometimes there will be no new avenues. But there should always be a full and frank explanation of the steps taken to bring an offender to justice and the rationale for police decision."	Labour has said it would give victims of sexual offences the right to challenge decisions by police not to prosecute suspects.
The right-wing AfD party, formed only three years ago, came second in the chancellor's home state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, polling 21%. Mrs Merkel has defended her policies but said she needs to "win back trust". Some 1.1 million refugees and migrants entered Germany in 2015. Many of them arrived after the government decided to loosen border controls just over a year ago. Mrs Merkel, who is in China for the G20 summit, said she was "very unhappy" with the election result. "Everyone now needs to think about how we can win back trust - most of all, of course, myself," she said. "Obviously it [the election result] has something to do with the refugee question. But I nevertheless believe the decisions made were right and we have to continue to work on them." This is humiliating for Angela Merkel - not least because this was on home turf.  This election - which was seen as a significant test ahead of next year's general election - was all about her refugee policy. For a year she's insisted "Wir schaffen es" (we can do it) but German voters aren't convinced. Alternative fuer Deutschland's anti immigrant and increasingly strident anti-Islam message has a powerful appeal to people concerned about integration and worried about domestic security. It doesn't look good for Mrs Merkel. Her approval ratings are at a five-year low. But don't be tempted to write her off just yet - she has a habit of bouncing back and there is no serious contender waiting in the wings to replace her. The AfD leader in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Leif-Erik Holm, suggested that "perhaps this is the beginning of the end of Angela Merkel's chancellorship". AfD (Alternative fuer Deutschland) now has delegates in nine of Germany's 16 states. "It's a debacle for Angela Merkel and her refugee policy," said Edmund Stoiber, honorary chairman of the Bavarian-based CSU, the sister party of the CDU. It was not enough to criticise the AfD's voters, he argued - the CDU had to understand why people were losing faith in its policies. Mr Stoiber called for a limit on the number of people entering Germany. The CDU is in coalition nationally with the SPD, and also regionally in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, although that may now change. Wolfgang Bosbach of the CDU said the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants without documents had "put the wind in AfD's sails". CSU Secretary General Andreas Scheuer spelt out that what was now needed was a cap on refugee numbers and better repatriation of failed asylum seekers. Ahead of the vote Mrs Merkel gave a defiant interview on immigration, insisting that change was not a bad thing and that "Germany will remain Germany, with everything that is dear to us". Although the chancellor's popularity has fallen nationally, she still has 45% approval ratings and has yet to decide if she wants to run for a fourth term in the September 2017 elections. "How many more electoral disasters can Merkel take?" wonders tabloid Bild, predicting that opposition to the chancellor inside her conservative bloc could erupt with full force. A piece in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung predicts an "autumn of discontent" for the chancellor, while Die Welt thinks many of her long-standing critics will now "break cover" and "let rip". Der Spiegel believes while the election is a "debacle" for Mrs Merkel, her job is not on the line quite yet.  And Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung argues that voters are angry at "(almost) all" mainstream parties, and not just the Christian Democrats, mainly over globalisation and "compromise-based politics". What does Germany's right-wing AfD want? Frauke Petry: Profile of AfD leader	German Chancellor Angela Merkel's allies have urged her to change course on refugees after her governing CDU party was beaten in a regional election by an anti-immigrant party.
Indonesian jazz pianist Joey Alexander is the youngest performer ever to be nominated for the prestigious music award. He did not win a Grammy but while the young musician performed on stage, the cameras panned across to singer Bruno Mars, who was watching with glistening eyes. Many from Joey's homeland also expressed their admiration and support for the young star. You were definitely the star of the show," tweeted Indonesian music composer Sherina Sinna. Movie-maker Joko Anwar also described him as a "hope". Josiah Alexander Sila was born in Bali's Denpasar city to Christian parents Denny Sila and Farah Leonora Urbach, who ran a tourism business. His parents have described their son's talents as a "gift from God". There were no formal jazz classes in Bali where he grew up, so the young musician took part in jazz sessions with more experienced performers. It was then that his parents decided to make the move to the Indonesian capital Jakarta - home to one of the world's largest jazz festivals - to pursue Joey's musical dream. He went on to win music competitions before his family moved to New York in 2014. The child prodigy taught himself to play piano at age six, after his father bought him an electronic keyboard. Joey has said that learning music came naturally for him, thanks to listening to songs from his father's personal jazz collection. "My dad played a little bit of piano and guitar, but not that professionally," Joey said in an early interview, about falling in love with the piano. "I saw him play and I said, 'I want to play. I want to try this instrument.'" The young musician considers Harry Connick, Jr. and Herbie Hancock among his main musical influences, and also admires Clifford Brown and Miles Davis. There could be something in the blood because he is also the nephew of Indonesian rock singer Nafa Urbach. Renowned Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, discovered Joey after seeing him perform in a YouTube video in 2014. Praising the young pianist on Facebook, he then invited him to play at the Jazz at Lincoln Center's gala, making him him an "overnight sensation". Joey went on to make his US debut, performing at several Jazz festivals. Joey's debut album titled, "My Favourite Things" was released on 12 May, 2015. He was 11 years old at the time of its release. He  became the first Indonesian act to crack the US Billboard album charts, debuting at number 174. The record re-entered the charts and peaked at number 59 in January 2016.	He may be only 11, but he delivered a performance that brought the audience at the 2016 Grammy awards to their feet in a standing ovation.
The Scottish champions fielded a makeshift side in the 4-0 reverse and Rodgers was delighted with the 21-year-old he signed from Manchester City. "For Ollie it's about fitness - you see how he moves in the game today," the Celtic manager said. "He has the qualities to play at the very highest level." Ntcham, a French international youth player, spent the past two seasons on loan at Genoa in Italy. He played for just over an hour of Saturday's friendly and Rodgers reckons that was enough to show how vital he will be. "His range of passing, it makes the game look very simple," Rodgers added. "He can play short, play long, he can dribble and shoot. "He has everything to be a top, top level number eight. It's just timing really, that's his first game so 65 minutes was enough for him. He'll just build up his fitness over the next few weeks and when he's ready he'll be a big player for us." Another player to have recently signed a four-year deal with Celtic, Kundai Benyu, has also made a big impression on his new boss. He played more than 70 minutes on Saturday and Rodgers admitted the 19-year-old, signed from Ipswich, has forced his way into contention. "Young Kundai did really well," he said. "He's surprised me to be honest. I knew he was a good player, you can see what we're trying to build here in terms of players who are technically gifted, but they have to have good mobility and good physicality, and he has that. He's come in and played with a nice little edge, he's competitive and he's got confidence. "How he receives the ball is very good, he's an attacking player, he wants to get goals and he's actually quite exciting. "Initially the plan was to have him in, thinking he would maybe get an idea of how we work and then go on loan, but I've sort of changed my mind on him after watching him. I think it's going to be good for him to have at least six months with us, see how we train, see how we work, get an education on our footballing idea then review it again in January and see where he's at. "He's certainly a boy who can contribute for us and he's done very well." Second-half goals from Maxwel Cornet, Myziane Maolida Nabil Fekir and Amine Gouiri won the friendly for Lyon, who finished fourth in the French top flight last season. But Rodgers was happy with how the match went. "I really enjoyed it," he said. "Up until the first hour it was a real good game. I have a responsibility to try to get as many of my players as fit as we can for the beginning of the season and for throughout the season. "First half we were very good, some of our combination play, the speed in our game was excellent and we should have went in in front at that time. "Once we make the changes into the second half it becomes a little bit broken, and the level in our quality changes. For the senior players it was great to get game time."	Brendan Rodgers says Celtic new boy Olivier Ntcham proved he has the ability to play at the very top level in Saturday's friendly defeat to Lyon.
8 March 2016 Last updated at 10:47 GMT This time he's explaining the difference between deficit and debt. But there's a catch: he has to do it in as short a time as possible.	Economics correspondent Andy Verity takes a regular look at some of the more confusing phrases bandied around in finance and economics.
Carlisle's Hallam Hope was sent off for a dangerous challenge on Darnell Furlong before the U's James Dunne was denied by Mark Ellis block. Ben Williamson's tap-in for Cambridge was ruled offside and Derek Asamoah lifted over the bar from two yards. Ellis then picked up a second yellow for time-wasting and was sent off. Carlisle move down to 11th while Cambridge sit 12th, four and five points off the play-off places respectively.	Cambridge United were held to a goalless draw against nine-man Carlisle United, a result which damages both clubs' League Two play-off hopes.
Charlton Athletic supporter Daniel Boylett, 36, of Eltham, was arrested after trouble broke out at the match on 23 September 2015. He was found guilty at Croydon Crown Court of attempted damage for the attack on Kayla. He was also found guilty of violent disorder. Boylett was released on bail to be sentenced on 28 April. Crystal Palace, who are nicknamed The Eagles, adopted Kayla as a mascot in 2010. Who is Kayla the Eagle? The court heard handler Chris Belsey was walking around the Selhurst Park pitch with the bird on his forearm at the game. Prosecutor Daniel Higgins said "three or four fans were shouting abuse" at the pair when one leaned over the barrier and "threw a punch". He said Mr Belsey did not know if the punch had landed and Kayla "seemed unhurt", but "due to her delicate bone structure if she had been hit with force, her bones could easily break". Four other men were on trial with Boylett over the trouble which marred the Capital One third-round tie. Mr Higgins said there had been trouble "before, during and after" the game. The first scuffles broke out as police escorted Charlton supporters to Selhurst Park. One officer suffered a cut lip after being hit by what he thought was a bottle as rival fans tried to break the police cordon, the court heard. At the end of the match, which Charlton lost 4-1, Donegan ran at police wielding a large yellow cone and had to be "subdued with a baton strike". After his arrest, he told police he was "annoyed" as "we just got battered. I picked it up and let my anger out". The jury were previously directed to acquit Cowcher, Boylett, Kitto and McConville on another count of violent disorder due to insufficient evidence.

Richard McAuley, 42, from Townhill Road in Portglenone pleaded guilty to the murder of Denise Dunlop, aged 32. The fatal stabbing occurred in the living room of Ms Dunlop's Centuripe Avenue home in Ballymena last June. The court heard that as a result of the attack, the couple's daughter suffered a "complex and traumatic experience". McAuley was told by the judge, Mr Justice Weir, that he had caused "enormous and permanent harm" to his daughter. The court heard that prior to the attack, on the evening of 14  June,  Ms Dunlop and McAuley had gone to her father's house. As they made their way back home in a taxi accompanied by Ms Dunlop's step-mother, the taxi stopped at an off-licence where alcohol was bought. When the taxi arrived back at Centuripe Avenue, Ms Dunlop's seven-year old daughter returned home from the babysitter's and they watched football on the TV. A row between the couple then broke out - possibly over an ice cream that was given to the girl - which resulted in what Mr Justice Weir described as "mutual pushing and pulling". As Ms Dunlop sat on the sofa, McAuley went to the kitchen where he armed himself with a knife. He returned to the living room, where he stabbed his partner three times in the upper body in front of their daughter and Ms Dunlop's step-mother. A wound to her chest, which passed through her left lung and heart, proved to be the fatal injury. Mr Justice Weir said the killing was "senseless" and told McAuley his actions had deprived a young girl of her mother. Saying the row was "fuelled by drink and drugs", the judge said a young woman had died in a row which was "almost unbelievable in its triviality". Since murdering Ms Dunlop, the court heard McAuley had made the case that he acted as he did due to provocation. However, the judge said that while he accepted the couple's 13-year relationship was on and off - largely due to McAuley's substance abuse - there was no history of violence between the couple, and there was "no justification" for McAuley's actions. Mr Justice Weir told McAuley: "You are a powerfully built man of six feet one, while the deceased was a foot shorter. There was no excuse for bringing a knife into this silly domestic dispute. "The deceased was very drunk, and the prescription drugs she had taken would have made her intoxication worse. She was no threat to you." The judge also told McAuley he did not believe his claims that he did not intent to kill Ms Dunlop, and that the knife attack was carried out in front of their daughter and Mrs Dunlop "without a thought for the consequences for them." The court heard McAuley has 44 previous convictions.	A County Antrim man who stabbed his partner to death in front of their seven-year-old daughter has been given a minimum 12-year sentence.
Seventeen years ago, he was responsible for work at a particularly troublesome oil field in Kazakhstan. "That oil field, Karazhanbas, was a real dog," he recalls, explaining that the oil there was very viscous, making it difficult to extract. "Nobody wanted it." But Mr Barak and his colleagues persevered, drilling hundreds of wells. The field was later sold in 2005 for around $2bn (Â£1.5bn), he says. Now, Mr Barak has turned his attention to the Wardlaw oil field in Edwards County, Texas. It lies in the southern corner of the Permian basin, a huge sedimentary basin in Texas and New Mexico that is associated with a high number of oil deposits. But while there are an estimated 168 million barrels at Wardlaw, only around 120,000 have ever been extracted. That's what Mr Barak and his colleague Anatoly Bazhal, principal science coordinator, hope to change. At Galex Energy Corporation, they have developed various technologies designed to dislodge hydrocarbons from the rock and move them to the surface. One example of their innovations uses acoustic waves that are "swept", a process invented by Galex in which the waves are transmitted into oil-bearing rock surrounding the oil well. Oil is trapped within that rock in tiny pores - the "reservoir" is more like a hard, wet sponge than an underground lake. To force oil out of the pores, the acoustic waves produce micro fractures in the rock that increase permeability. The area is also exposed to cycles of low and high pressure. During low pressure cycles, the trapped oil droplets are impacted dramatically. "The liquid bursts into vapour within the pore," explains Mr Barak. The pressure differential then encourages the hydrocarbons to flow towards the well where they can be drawn out of the ground. Galex hopes to drill around 25 test wells this summer to measure the effectiveness of swept and other technologies it has developed. But the process is not without risks. In a 2013 article Mr Barak and Mr Bazhal wrote, "the unauthorized and incompetent use of [the] technology swept can cause damage to the subsoil environment, property and threat to the life of staff". Nevertheless, oil and gas companies are continuing to pursue new methods and techniques like this in order to get ever more fossil fuels out of the ground. It's important to note that, traditionally, it has been commonplace for firms to recover only about a third of the oil from an oil field using existing techniques. But that is changing. There are various reasons why new extraction methods are cropping up, but a key factor was the high price of oil in recent years - between roughly 2011 and 2014 the average price of a barrel was $100 or more. "That period of time [when prices were high] allowed investments to be made in places such as very deep water in Brazil, Canadian sands and other parts of the world," explains Neil Atkinson, head of the International Energy Agency's oil industry and markets division. In other words, the oil companies invested heavily in research and development at trickier sites, and in some cases are now benefiting from increased extraction. An area long associated with oil production that some thought would have largely "dried up" by now is the North Sea, says Prof John Underhill at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland. "More oil is being produced from those depleted fields than ever was thought possible when the North Sea was opened up," he says. One new approach he cites is directional drilling, in which non-vertical wells are bored into the oil field. "One can target those pockets of oil that would otherwise be left behind," he explains. There have been innovations in injection too - the process of putting fluid into an oil reservoir to increase the pressure, helping it to flow through to the well. At BP's major new site at Clair Ridge, off the coast of Shetland, chemistry will be harnessed to dislodge oil from the reservoir during injection. The technique involved is called "LoSal". The oil in the Clair field clings to clay thanks to ions - atoms or molecules with an electric charge. They act a bit like a chain holding the hydrocarbons in place. However, by lowering the salt content of the water in the reservoir, BP thinks this will make the chemical bonds of that chain relax. If that happens, the ions may be replaced by less binding ones, releasing the hydrocarbons in the process. BP plans to begin production at Clair Ridge in 2018, and continue recovering oil from the field for the following 32 years. The list of options for engineers vying to lure yet more oil from underground reservoirs is certainly growing. Some firms, like Titan Oil Recovery in the US, are even enlisting the help of microbes, tiny organisms living within the oil field. A sample of water in the field is sent to the lab for analysis, explains chairman and founder Ken Gerbino. The goal is to find a microbe living there that can be fed and encouraged to proliferate. Once one is identified, Titan can deliver its - secret - formula. "They multiply like crazy," says Mr Gerbino. The microbes, booming in number, surround globules of oil trapped in the porous rock. "They physically deform the droplets into micro oil droplets," he explains. That means that the oil is more mobile and easier to recover. "We've been on 48 commercial oil fields, we've done over 300 well applications, and the average increase in production has been 92%," he adds. But microbial enhanced oil recovery, or MEOR as it is known, is not commonplace despite having been in development for many decades. MrGerbino says his company's approach can cost as little as $6 per barrel, but the oil industry has long hesitated over MEOR techniques because of high costs and fears that microbial manipulation might not work as intended. Of course, specialised techniques for encouraging oil towards the production well are one thing - simply locating pockets of oil suitable for extraction is another. This is no mean feat when, as in the North Sea, hundreds of smaller pools of oil are of course locked under the seafloor. Selecting which to aim for needs to be done carefully. But augmented reality could soon help engineers decide which of these resources to earmark, according to Chris Pearson, small pools solution centre manager at the UK's recently opened Oil and Gas Technology Centre (OGTC), The OGTC is working with Aberdeen University to develop 3D visual representations of reservoirs - simulations of the oil field - based on data from geophysical surveys. Artificial intelligence techniques can then predict what oil in that model is most recoverable and these evaluations can be represented within the 3D view. "I'd call it augmented decision-making," says Pearson. "It gives you a more informed view of what the reservoir looks like." For those in the oil industry right now, new technologies are just part of the excitement associated with high levels of both supply and demand. They also play to many people's confidence that "peak oil" - when the maximum rate of oil extraction has been reached - is still a long way off. And that, of course, is despite continued concerns that the fervour to extract more oil will lead to serious environmental problems - including, ultimately, a problematic contribution to climate change once those hydrocarbons are burned as fuel and emissions released. But peak oil has certainly seemed more distant in recent times than it did, say, 10 years ago. The entrepreneurs and engineers behind new extraction technologies have plenty of faith that the status quo will continue - as does Neil Atkinson at the IEA. "Oil production has been going up and up and up remorselessly for a very long time," he says, "and it will continue to do so."	Russian engineer Alex Barak has been coaxing oil out of the ground for a long time.
A row erupted after council proposals for new contracts for more than 2,000 staff that would result in wage cuts of up to 23%. The authority fears it could face equal pay claims from other employees if it does not make the cuts. Hundreds attended a rally to "celebrate the work of Durham's teaching assistants". Claire Williams, Northern Regional Secretary of Unison said: "There is positive progress being made... we are really keen to  get a resolution to this dispute quickly for our teaching assistants as it's been a very stressful year for them." The new contracts were originally proposed for January but after industrial action in November the plan was suspended. Members of the Unison and ATL unions were due to strike again for three days in December but that was called off to restart talks. The council says its review of the matter should be completed in September.	Talks held between teaching assistant unions and Durham County Council are "progressing positively", Unison said.
The 60-year-old Frenchman has been suspended along with Fifa president Sepp Blatter and secretary general Jerome Valcke. They deny wrongdoing. Platini, a Fifa vice-president, is the Football Association's preference to succeed Blatter at Fifa. The French FA wants the Court of Arbitration for Sport to intervene to ensure Platini can stand for election. Fifa's ethics committee began its investigation after the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings against Blatter in September. He is accused of signing a contract "unfavourable" to Fifa and making a "disloyal payment" to Platini. The ethics committee also opened an inquiry into Platini over the 2m euros (£1.35m) payment, which was made nine years after the former France footballer carried out consultation work for Blatter. Fifa will hold an emergency meeting on 20 October in Zurich to discuss February's presidential election, at which a successor to Blatter will be chosen. Platini, Uefa's president since 2007, has been backed by South America's football confederation following his suspension. Conmebol said he should be regarded as innocent until proven guilty. The French Football Federation is expecting a decision from Fifa's appeal committee within eight days. "The FFF has adopted the principle of an appeal if the decision of the Fifa appeal committee does not go Michel Platini's way," said a FFF spokesman. Blatter, 79, won a fifth consecutive presidential election in May but announced he would be stepping down just days later following the launch of two investigations into Fifa by United States and Swiss authorities. Platini is one of the favourites to replace him and still plans to stand. He has the full backing of Uefa, which is holding an emergency meeting next week.	Uefa chief Michel Platini is appealing after Fifa banned him for 90 days while corruption claims are investigated.
Igor Dodon, head of the Party of Socialists (PSRM), is riding a wave of public discontent in this impoverished ex-Soviet republic. Moldova has moved closer to the European Union in the past seven years, a course championed by his rival, former education minister Maia Sandu. Mr Dodon, 41, was a deputy prime minister in the Party of Communists government before 2009. He blames widespread corruption on the pro-EU parties which have ruled Moldova since then. Last year, three banks collapsed and $1bn (Â£790m) disappeared - equal to about one-sixth of the country's GDP. Mr Dodon repeatedly tried to pin the blame on Ms Sandu, as she was in the government on whose watch the "theft of the century" happened. She strongly denied that accusation, and is seen as one of the few "clean" politicians in Moldova. In the first round, on 30 October, she got 38% of the votes, while Mr Dodon got 48%. Mr Dodon has promised to revoke Moldova's association agreement with the EU. But recently he has appeared less committed to that pledge, especially as Moldovans can travel visa-free in the EU's Schengen area, which covers most of Europe but excludes the UK and Ireland. He has vowed to take Moldova into the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. He has proposed turning Moldova into a federal state, to solve the frozen conflict in Trans-Dniester, a region run by pro-Moscow separatists for the past 26 years, where Russian troops are still deployed. Trans-Dniester profile This year Moldova reverted to direct presidential elections after a 20-year hiatus. But the president does not have strong powers to deliver the changes many Moldovans are clamouring for, especially tackling corruption. "We want a leader close to the people, not to the oligarchs," said Maria, from the Chisinau suburb of Ghidighici. "First of all we need an improvement in the economy. The president should fight corruption. They all appeal to those abroad to return home, but what can they do here? There are no jobs. Electricity, gas, everything is getting more expensive. A pensioner cannot survive on 1,000 lei ($50) [per month]." She said Moldova should maintain good relations with its neighbours in the EU and with Russia. Population 3.5 million Area 33,800 sq km (13,050 sq miles) Major languages Romanian (called "Moldovan" in official documents), Russian Major religion Christianity Life expectancy 66 years (men), 73 years (women) Currency leu Moldova country profile Moldova crisis: An elite power grab? Vlad, a young disabled man, said that politicians should "come up with actions, not just promises and words. "The next president should be concerned about the problems of disabled people. They should be able to get a job, to have the same rights as other citizens." Mr Dodon is a great admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying Moldova needs a similarly strong leader. He has angered neighbouring Ukraine by describing annexed Crimea as de facto part of the Russian Federation. That raises the spectre of a diplomatic conflict if he becomes president. But many voters, including most of the Russian speakers who make up almost 25% of the electorate, do not seem to mind, as long as Russia is seen as supportive of Mr Dodon. He criticises Ms Sandu for wanting reunification with Romania, which included Moldova (formerly Moldavia) between the two world wars. Mr Dodon is also supported openly by the Moldovan Orthodox Church, which is subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate. Orthodox Bishop Marchel urged voters to support him as a "Christian and patriot", contrasting him to Ms Sandu, who is single and childless. Both Mr Dodon and Bishop Marchel have said that Ms Sandu is supported by gay people in Moldova, a country where homophobic attitudes are deeply entrenched. In the end, if elected, Mr Dodon could find it hard to deliver many of his promises. In that case "he should govern like the French President De Gaulle in the 1960s, by referendum", suggested Igor Botan, a political analyst close to Ms Sandu. "He should call a referendum for each promise and if he loses, he should resign," he added. The president appoints judges and sets foreign policy priorities, but other major decisions need the approval of parliament.	A politician who wants to restore close ties with Russia is tipped to win the second round of Moldova's presidential election on Sunday.
Christopher Adjei, 29, of Riversdale Road, Ramsgate, pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit a sexual offence and battery. Kent Police said he grabbed the woman, tried to cover her mouth with his hand, and forced her to the ground in the early hours in Church Lane. Adjei fled the scene when the woman asked what he wanted. Officers traced Adjei after his DNA was found on the victim's coat and were able to piece together his whereabouts on 14 June 2014, the night of the attack, based on his bank details and a train ticket to Canterbury. Det Sgt Daniel Aylett said Adjei put the victim through a terrifying experience. A warrant was issued for Adjei's arrest after he walked out of a Canterbury Crown Court hearing in August. He was arrested the following month in the Thanet area. Adjei was also ordered to spend two years on extended licence after his release from jail as part of his sentence.	A man has been jailed for four years for attacking a woman in her 20s in the street in Canterbury.
Smith was named captain of the Red Rose for the 2015 season, but only skippered the team in one game after being told he needed back surgery. The injury kept him out for 13 months but he came back to feature in the final months of last season, only for back problems to return. "It's very sad and a tough decision to come to," he told BBC Radio Lancashire. "Following some medical advice from the specialist and thinking about the long term future it has come because of injury. "The highs of lows of the past two years from captain to not playing, to surgery, to back playing, to retiring but ultimately it has taken its toll. My long-term health has taken priority." The club have announced that Smith will stay at Old Trafford to assist academy director Gary Yates in helping bring young players through their system. BBC Radio Lancashire cricket reporter Scott Read: "Tom Smith can look back on his career with a great deal of pride for both his performances on the field Lancashire and for the courage he showed off it. "He fought hard to return from injury last season, an injury which robbed him of the captaincy in 2015. "A genuine all-rounder, who consistency with the bowl and skill with the bat saw him named the club's player of the year after a stellar 2014. "He'll be admired and respected at Old Trafford in equal measure both as a player and a person."	Lancashire all-rounder Tom Smith has announced his retirement at the age of 31 after a series of injury problems.
Pae Jun-ho, known in the US as Kenneth Bae, smuggled anti-government materials and plotted the state's downfall, a Supreme Court spokesman told state news agency KCNA. He denied Mr Bae was being used as a "political bargaining chip" with the US. Mr Bae was detained last year after entering North Korea as a tourist. North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytism. They were released after intervention from high-profile American figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both of whom went to Pyongyang. The court spokesman told KCNA that Mr Bae was "dispatched to China as a missionary". There he was involved in setting up "plot-breeding bases" from which he "infiltrated at least 250 students" into the North Korean port city of Rason with the aim of "bringing the government down". US citizens held by N Korea "He committed such hostile acts as egging on overseas [North Korean] citizens and foreigners to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign," he said. He added Mr Bae's full confession was the reason why he did not receive a possible death sentence. "He dared commit such hideous crimes as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership," he said. The spokesman denied that Mr Bae was "not tried in a transparent matter and [the North] was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip". Mr Bae, 44, was arrested in November as he entered Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. South Korea activists believe he was arrested for taking pictures of starving children. Other reports have described him as a devout Christian. His conviction on 30 April came amid high tension between the US and North Korea, after Pyongyang's third nuclear test. The UN expanded sanctions against the communist state in March, in the wake of its 12 February nuclear test and December long-range rocket launch. Pyongyang reacted angrily both to the measures and the annual US-South Korea military exercises, threatening to attack US military bases and cutting key hotlines with its southern neighbour.	North Korea has released details of the alleged crimes of a US man it sentenced to 15 years of hard labour.
The Poland international was injured following a late challenge on his left knee by defender Antony Kay in Tuesday's 2-1 away win at MK Dons. Following an initial scan, the 23-year-old forward is now facing surgery. "If he gets back in under a year, he'll have done well," Wolves head of medical Phil Hayward told BBC WM. "He's really looking at a full year and maybe more than that. "He has suffered damage to both the cruciate and lateral knee ligaments, as well as other structural damage. There is a small fracture on the inside of the knee, indicative of the amount of force involved in the challenge. "He will see a consultant this week and undergo surgery once the swelling has subsided at some point in the next two weeks. The timeframe will become more apparent following surgery. But he is expected to be out for a considerable time." MK Dons defender Kay was yellow carded for the challenge by match referee Mark Heywood. Zyro is the third Wolves player to suffer a serious knee injury this season. Striker Nouha Dicko has been sidelined since August, while winger Jordan Graham was then himself ruled out for up to nine months in January. Wolves have also lost winger Razak Boukari and defender Ethan Ebanks-Landell for the season, while centre-half Mike Williamson (thigh injury) has not figured since returning to the club from Newcastle United in January. Since Christmas, they have also spent long spells without Zyro, who missed two months with a calf injury, James Henry, Dave Edwards and Jed Wallace. Henry made his first start since February in midweek, while Wales international Edwards made a late appearance from the bench. Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett has cleared up confusion over midfielder Kevin McDonald's whereabouts. It was reported that the 27-year-old Scot had been told to "train with the kids" after being left out of Jackett's matchday squad of 18 at MK Dons. But McDonald actually voluntarily chose to keep fit with Wolves' Under-18 side. They were the only ones in training, because the Under-21 team also had a game on Tuesday. McDonald, Wolves' player of the year in 2013-14 when they won the League One title, has not made the starting line-up since 8 March and has been linked with an end-of-season move to Scottish Championship winners Rangers. Wolves boss Kenny Jackett and head of medical Phil Hayward were speaking to BBC WM's Rob Gurney.	Injury-hit Wolves have suffered a new blow with the loss of Michal Zyro for potentially more than a year with multiple knee ligament damage.
One eyewitness described the fire at Eco-Oil Ltd at the Kingsnorth Industrial Estate at Hoo as "huge". Kent Fire and Rescue Service managed to contain burning oil which spread on to adjacent land cleared for development. Firefighters said the blaze started at about 2300 BST and was finally brought under control at around 0545 BST. The fire started in two road tankers before spreading to plastic and steel drum oil containers. No casualties have been reported. At least 10 fire crews from around the county were tackling the fire, with extra foam units brought in from London and Essex. Graham Gash, area manager from Kent Fire and Rescue said: "Crews have done a great job in fighting this serious fire and successfully managing to prevent it spreading further and damaging nearby buildings. "We worked alongside our partners from the London Fire Brigade and Essex Fire and Rescue Service and I think praise goes to everyone for a job well done." Mr Gash said crews were confronted by a very serious fire involving road tanker vehicles carrying 1,000-litre containers of reclaimed engine oil and numerous 200-litre barrels of oil which were exploding. He added: "More importantly, we had fuel that was flowing from the site and this posed a significant threat to the surrounding building which was three industrial units." The fire officer said foam had to be used to put out a very hot oil fire, while two high volume water supplies were needed for a major foam strike - one for cooling and one for foam production. He added: "This particular area is not very well served with a good water supply so we had to run in two water mains from Kingsnorth power station." By about 0800 BST on Saturday, fire crews had entered the turning over and damping down phase, Mr Gash said. He said crews were working to make sure the fire was out and checking the industrial units with thermal imaging cameras to make sure there had been no undetected fire spread. Mr Gash said there was minimal risk to people nearby because the industrial estate was surrounded by commercial industrial retail outlets and not residential areas. He said the brigade's fire investigation team would be investigating the cause of the fire along with Kent Police.	More than 60 firefighters have spent the night tackling a major blaze at a waste oil depot near Kingsnorth power station in Kent.
Organisers of the Magical Journey, at The Belfry Golf Club, near Sutton Coldfield, said they had "no alternative" after a "key financial backer dropped out". The attraction closed temporarily after receiving hundreds of complaints on its opening day last month. Ticket-holders have been advised to contact their banks for refunds. In a message posted on the attraction's website on Monday night, bosses apologised to those who had bought tickets. "After all we've been through having to shut down in the final week is devastating," they wrote. "However, today a key financial backer has dropped out leaving us in the lurch. We have tried desperately over the last few hours to find a replacement but to no avail." The attraction had been due to operate the event until Christmas Eve. Llewelyn-Bowen, who said he only found out about the closure via Twitter, said he was shocked at the news. "I was really impressed with the way they addressed all the issues the first time around and the energy and resources that went into it so I'm extremely surprised the towel's been thrown in at this stage," he said. His contribution had only been "some design concepts" and he had not backed the project financially, he added. "I feel very much I was the designer and I'm a very public face so people are cross with me," he said. Helen Blakemore, from Aldridge in the West Midlands, visited the Magical Journey on Monday night with daughters Lucy, eight, and Molly, 11. She said it had been "very busy" and there was "no indication" of any problems. "There were lots of helpers, lots of happy elves," she said. "It was wonderful. The kids thoroughly enjoyed meeting Santa." Other customers took to Facebook to express frustration at the short-notice cancellation. Tracy Peach said it was "so unfair for families who have paid for their children to go." "How awful to have to tell them at this point that Santa won't see them," she wrote. Louise Tanner branded the attraction "the tragic journey" and said she had received an email on Monday night advising her of the closure. The Belfry's managing director Lynn Hood said the resort had not charged operator Magical Journeys for using its land. She said because the firm was a start-up company the hotel had not asked for payment. "We genuinely thought they would create a magical journey," she said. "We're shocked and very saddened at what's happened." "We were given no prior warning." The event closed for three days last month, after dissatisfied customers branded the top price of Â£22.50 for a children's ticket a "rip-off". Some reported seeing elves smoking and criticised the poor quality of gifts handed to children. Event director Paul Dolan admitted bad weather had hampered first-day preparations and it had not been ready to open.	A much-criticised Christmas attraction designed by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has closed down permanently.
Speaking in Vienna, US Secretary of State John Kerry said world powers would back Libya in seeking exemption from a UN arms embargo. He said IS was a "new threat" to Libya and it was "imperative" it was stopped. Last month, the Libyan government warned that IS could seize most of the country if it was not halted soon. After holding talks with international partners, Mr Kerry said: "The GNA [Government of National Accord] is the only entity that can unify the country. It is the only way to ensure that vital institutions... fall under representative and acknowledged authority. "It is the only way to generate the cohesion necessary to defeat Daesh [IS]." The requested arms embargo "exemption" for Libya will need to be approved by the UN Sanctions Committee before it comes into force. But the Libyan government's formal request for it signals that they have been given assurances that it would soon be approved. Libya remains a country where multiple administrations are still bickering over who is in charge.  Armed groups in western Libya, reputed for their shifting allegiances, only loosely back the new government, and there is no clear chain of command. There is a risk that future arms shipments will either fall into the wrong hands, or exacerbate the civil conflict there between rival militias. Mr Kerry said support for arming the government was part of a package of measures agreed at the meeting, which included accelerating non-military aid to Libya. He said that as well as countering IS, the GNA should take full control of Libyan ministries, backed by the international community. A joint statement from the countries attending drew attention to Libya's role as a major transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe. "We look forward to partnering with the GNA and neighbouring countries to tackle the threat posed throughout the Mediterranean and on its land borders by criminal organisations engaged in all forms of smuggling and trafficking, including in human beings," it said. "We are ready to respond to the Libyan government's requests for training and equipping the presidential guard and vetted forces from throughout Libya." But the prime minister of Libya's unity government, Fayez Sarraj, warned major challenges lay ahead, saying taking on IS would require further outside help. "We urge the international community to assist us," he said. "We are not talking about international intervention, we are talking about international assistance in training, equipping our troops and training our youths." The North African country has been in chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-time ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Until recently it had two rival governments competing for power, and there are still hundreds of militias, some allied to IS. Western nations hope the unity government will take on IS, which has a foothold in Sirte - the home town of Gaddafi. The militant group has launched a series of suicide bombings and attacks on oil facilities in the country.	The US and other world powers have said they are ready to arm Libya's UN-backed unity government to help it fight the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group.

An ultra low emission zone in London for the most polluting cars will come into force in April 2019 and reports say other cities will follow suit. The government will also produce a new air quality plan by the end of April. But Theresa May has said she will "take into account" drivers encouraged to buy diesel cars by previous governments. Former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax in 2001 to encourage people to buy diesel cars, as they were more economical and thought to be less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. But there has been increasing concern from experts that the vehicles emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to have caused thousands of premature deaths in the UK. The government has to produce a new air quality plan after receiving a "final warning" from the European Commission about breaches of legal air quality levels in the UK. It also lost two court cases in 2015 and 2016 over pollution levels brought by environmental lawyers ClientEarth. To tackle the issue, a so-called "toxin tax" is expected to be rolled out across several cities, charging drivers of diesel cars up to Â£20 per day to come into urban areas. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that such a scheme - creating an the ultra low emission zone in the capital - would come into force in two years' time, with a charge of Â£12.50 for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards. But motoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being "punished" for following a previous government's policy. Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase. Speaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: "Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan. "But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future. " She did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles.	Diesel car owners could get some help from the government if cities adopt new charges to tackle pollution, the prime minister has suggested.
He told The Hollywood Reporter he was "super excited" and wanted "to put a different spin on it", but did not expand on what role he would play. The film will see Jordan reunite with his Creed director Ryan Coogler. "I'm looking forward to working with Ryan once again. It's gonna be a good time," he said. He added he could not wait to work with Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for 12 Years a Slave in 2014, as well as Chadwick Boseman - who is currently on the big screen playing Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. Jordan played the Human Torch in last year's Fantastic Four flop reboot.  Nyong'o also played CGI character Maz Kanata in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Black Panther will be released in February 2018.	Michael B Jordan has confirmed he and Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o will be among the cast of the upcoming Marvel superhero film Black Panther.
Yorkshire Sculpture Park said 100,000 people visited in September when the poppies were installed, compared with about 37,000 last year. The poppy arch segment, Wave, consists of 5,800 ceramic poppies falling from Cascade Bridge into the Lower Lake. Park entry on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day will be by ticket only. Yorkshire Sculpture Park said visitor numbers would be restricted on 8 and 11 November "to ensure a calm and contemplative experience for all". Belinda Eldridge, operations manager, said the 170% rise in visitor numbers was "phenomenal" and Yorkshire Sculpture Park was expecting its biggest ever year, with more than half a million visitors. "We feel extremely privileged to be able to bring the poppies to Yorkshire," she said. "It's safe to say tens of thousands of people are coming as a result of the poppies." She said the sculpture had a "different feel" from any other sculpture at the park, and many people found seeing the poppies was a "calm and contemplative experience". The installation is part of a nationwide tour of poppies from the artwork Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, which was unveiled in London in July 2014. The artwork, created by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper, marked 100 years since the start of World War One and drew more than five million visitors. The Yorkshire Regiment raised 24 Battalions served by 65,000 men, of whom 9,000 died.	A sculpture park near Wakefield has reported a 170% rise in visitors since poppies from the Tower of London went on show in September.
At the trial in the town of Douai, the prosecution had asked for an 18-year term for Dominique Cottrez, 51. The defence had argued that the former health worker should be acquitted because of her troubled mental state. Cottrez earlier confessed to suffocating her children after giving birth secretly at home near Lille. She then buried the bodies in the garden of her parents' home and at her own home nearby in Villers-au-Tertre. The former nursing assistant had previously said she had a long incestuous relationship with her father and that she feared each baby might be his. However, during the trial she did not talk about the relationship. Cottrez, who is obese, also said that from a young age she had battled with her weight and was mocked by other children at school. She apparently managed to conceal her pregnancies from everyone, including her doctor and her husband, because of her obesity.	A court in northern France has sentenced a woman to nine years in prison for killing eight of her newborn babies between 1989 and 2000.

"People were just so excited and happy. When people hear music and a beat they want to dance. You don't have to ask. They will just come and dance and jump in front of your camera," says Ollie Williams, one of The Busy Twist duo. Inspired by highlife, reggae and dance sounds emanating from Ghana's streets and clubs, the track represents something different from digitally driven dance music.	London DJs The Bush Twist shot a music video of their track Friday Night around Ghana.
While the club investigates Pearson's behaviour for unspecified reasons, contact between the manager and Rams staff is not allowed. Powell, Pearson's assistant, led Derby to victory at Cardiff hours after his boss was removed from his role and be in charge at Reading on Saturday. "It's a situation that no one wants to be in," Powell told BBC Radio Derby. "But in this game that we love, we know that things change and happen and we have to do our best to move on, take care of what is happening now and try to plan for the future - and the immediate future is Reading on Saturday." Beyond the weekend, however, Powell admits he does not know what will happen. Since Pearson's suspension, first-team manager Inigo Idiakez has also left the club. "We have to get on with the job in hand." Powell said. "We have a responsibility to carry on with the jobs we do and make the sure the team is focused and the players are prepared and coached in the same manner. "I am fine. I have spoken to many people at the club. I have spoken to the players most importantly. They are fine and they have to carry on."	Chris Powell has not spoken to Nigel Pearson since the Derby County manager was suspended by the club on Tuesday.
Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five bullet wounds to his chest in June 1995 while on guard at a perimeter fence at Deepcut. An original inquest into his death recorded a verdict of suicide. His family applied for a new hearing after using the Human Rights Act to access evidence held by police. His twin, Tony Benton, and sister, Tracy Lewis, wept and said: "We are just happy and relieved. It's been too long." A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: "We care deeply about our young recruits and our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Sean Benton." BBC Local Live: For the latest updates and more news The malevolent culture at Deepcut barracks Justice Collins said fresh evidence had "come to light which casts some doubt upon the correctness" of the original decision. He added that under article two of the Human Rights Act there was material that questioned the care Pte Benton received from the Army at the time. Mrs Lewis said: "Our family had just 20 years with Sean. It has taken us another 21 to secure the thorough, independent inquiry we should have seen immediately after his death." "For two decades, our family has been tormented by questions about what Sean went through at Deepcut," she added. "If his death had been properly investigated in 1995, we would have been spared years of uncertainty and pain. "It should be a source of huge shame to the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Police that our mother had to fight for so long - far longer than she should have had to - to force the authorities to answer basic questions." The family said the original inquest took less than two hours and heard from six people. A criminal investigation seven years later found no evidence of third party involvement. Pte Benton's medical records were not obtained and no evidence was gathered or presented about his experiences at the base. The family, who are represented by human rights group Liberty, believe he was subjected to severe bullying. In a statement, the MoD said: "The Armed Forces will not tolerate abuse, bullying, or discrimination. All allegations are taken very seriously and will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken." "It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing -  we will assist the coroner as necessary," it added. Pte Benton was the first of four young soldiers to die at the barracks between 1995 and 2002. Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, North Wales, shot herself in November 1995, according to a second inquest into her death which concluded in June. However, the coroner criticised a lack of training, structure and inappropriate sexual relationships in the camp. Pte James' father, Des, said he had applied to the MoD for a full public inquiry into what went on at the barracks. Pte Geoff Gray, 17, from Hackney, east London, was found dead with two gunshot wounds to his head on 17 September 2001. Pte James Collinson, 17, from Perth, was found dead with a single gunshot wound through his chin on 23 March 2002. A date for the fresh inquest into Pte Benton's death is yet to be set.	A fresh inquest can take place into the death of a young soldier at an army barracks in Surrey 21 years ago, a high court judge has ruled.
The former striker, still remarkably fresh faced for 40, is now attempting to make an impact as a Premier League manager at Cardiff City, having spent three seasons in his native Norway in charge of Molde. One of the biggest things he did was make the players feel more confident. It wasn't magic - it was paying attention to the details His spell there brought two top-flight titles, the first in Molde's history, as well as a Norwegian Cup as he quickly established a reputation as a promising young manager. Those who know Solskjaer describe him as mild mannered and gentle, with a knack for getting the best out of players and a desire to play attacking football. They also call him tough-minded and ambitious. But how will a manager used to "complete control" of team affairs fare in one of Europe's most unforgiving leagues and under one of the Premier League's more controversial owners in Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan? "He showed he is a good manager in the short time he was here at Molde," says the club's Norway international goalkeeper Espen Bugge Pettersen. "There is no reason why he should not be successful. "He probably has not changed a lot since his playing days. He is a mild and gentle guy but when it is needed he can put his foot down. "You won't find anyone who has a bad word to say about him, because they don't exist. He isn't afraid of making the tough decisions but he does it the right way and if he is not satisfied he will let you know." Solskjaer, scorer of Manchester United's injury-time winner in their 1999 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich, ended his 11-year playing career at Old Trafford with six Premier League titles and two FA Cups to add to that Champions League winners' medal. Injuries disrupted his final few years as a player and he was then offered a coaching role at the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, where as reserve team boss he won the Manchester Senior Cup, the Lancashire Senior Cup and the Premier League reserve play-offs. "Ole always wanted to stay in the game, so from an early age he was preparing to stay in the game as a coach or as a manager," Ferguson told the Manchester Evening News in 2012. "He was always one of the professionals who used to take down all the notes from the training sessions and games. He has got an inner toughness, there's no doubt about that." Given his first senior managerial role at Molde in 2011, Solskjaer delivered instant success at the club from which Manchester United had signed him in 1996. A first Tippeligaen title in the club's 100-year history arrived in his first season, breaking the dominance of Rosenberg, who had won 16 of the previous 19 championships, followed by a successful title defence and then the Norwegian Cup in November. "Molde is a small place with 25,000 to 30,000 people," says Jonas Bergh-Johnsen, a journalist for Norwegian TV channel TV2. "It is small club and he won the league at his first attempt and I think it surprised him. "They say the most difficult thing is to recreate success but he did. It was a magnificent achievement, massive for the town and for the club. He was a hero before but now he is a legend. Media playback is not supported on this device "There wasn't loads of money to spend at Molde but he got together a very good group of young players who wanted to play for him. A lot of his success has come from developing young players." Like Ferguson, Bergh-Johnsen marks out the young manager for his "mental toughness". "At the start of last season, things were not going well and he was getting a lot of criticism," he adds "This was a new thing for him but he dug deep and turned things round." Solskjaer's playing career, which included 67 caps for Norway, earned him instant respect when he arrived as manager at Molde but those who played under him insist he brought far more than just his reputation. "He is a legend in Norway, in football, and he brought that aura with him," says keeper Petterson. "He was able to get that little bit extra out of the players "When he came, the club was good and the squad was good. The year before, we came second so the platform was already there. "But one of the biggest things he did was make the players feel a little bit more confident. He made us all feel special and wanted. It wasn't magic, it was by paying attention to the fine details. "He changed a lot around the place. He put pictures up around the ground, like they have at Old Trafford, and brought a lot of what he learned at Manchester United to Molde. "He wants his teams to play attacking football but he also insists on hard work. I am sure he will stick with that philosophy in the Premier League." Cardiff are not the first Premier League club to have been tempted by Solskjaer's early managerial promise. He held talks with Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner in May 2012 following the sacking of Alex McLeish but decided to remain with Molde because he was reluctant to uproot his family from Norway. He was also a candidate to replace Steve Kean at Blackburn Rovers in the Championship last season after the Scot's troubled relationship with controversial owners Venky's finally came to an end. Some in Norway are surprised he has now opted to make his Premier League managerial debut under Bluebirds owner Tan. But it is not as simple as that, according to former Norway and Middlesbrough striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, now a football pundit. "It has always been said that a manager has to find the right owner," says Fjortoft. "If you believe everything you read about Tan, you would think 'any owner but him'. "Ole has seen something at the club, though, and has seen this is a big chance. "At Molde, he did have full control and was completely hands on, so wherever he went it would be a challenge because he would not get that control he has been used to." Not everything will be unfamiliar in his new environment, however. Solskjaer will take former Manchester United and Sheffield United midfielder Mark Dempsey, his assistant at Molde, with him to south Wales. Solskjaer's former Norway team-mate Morten Gamst Pedersen, who spent nine years at Blackburn, believes the duo work well together. "It is always an advantage if you can come in with people you know," says Pedersen. "I know Mark well as I used to train at Tromso sometimes where he was coach. He is a very good coach. "There is no getting away from the fact Ole is a very nice guy. I remember he wished me luck by text when I joined Blackburn but there is no reason you can't be nice and succeed. "He has never had lots of money to spend before so it will be interesting to see how he copes with that. He knows the English game, though, and is a very clever guy, so I think he will deal with it all well." Solskjaer's new Premier League adventure begins with a home match against Newcastle United in the FA Cup, before Premier League trips to former employers Manchester United and their local rivals Manchester City later this month. "The best word to describe him is adjustable," says Fjortoft. "He wants to play football and wants to play the ball from the back, with speed and young kids, like he did at Molde. "But he won't be naive. He will be ready to fit around what best suits the match and the players. He has a very good footballing mind. "I think he might bring Mats Moller Daehli and goalkeeper Orjan Haskjold Nyland with him from Molde but he also has to find the right market for Cardiff. He has to find the right mix."	Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is fondly remembered by Manchester United supporters as the "baby-faced assassin" whose goalscoring talents - frequently as a substitute - helped them conquer the Premier League and Europe.
Interest and participation has increased hugely in recent years across the country, according to the Outdoor Swimming Society. Eighty outdoor swims are being held over the 2015 season, with most taking place on Christmas or Boxing Day. Safety advice has been issued by the society for the first time. Spokesman Will Cairns said it was expecting more people to take part this year in the sea, rivers and lidos. "What's interesting this year is the temperature of the water. "It's three to four degrees higher in certain places than it was this time last year. Temperature does play a part." He said overall membership numbers increased from 15,000 last year to 25,000 this year and that 40% of members now actively swim throughout the winter. "The Christmas swims very much appeal to the British psyche of doing something different, something slightly weird and wonderful," he said. - Do not take part if you are pregnant, suffer from asthma or have a heart condition. - Get warm before the swim and remove your warm clothing at the last minute. - Go in feet first, not head first, and control your breathing before immersing your shoulders. - Have low expectations of how long you will be in for or how far you will go - Dry off and put on layers within ten minutes of getting out Charlie Hoskin, 33, from Cornwall, described herself as a "granite-fleshed cold-water bathing enthusiast" who always swims in the sea at Christmas. "The sensation is truly electrifying. It is a great way to test your constitution and boost your immune system," she said. Daniel Fox has been photographing the Exmouth Christmas Day swim since 2007. "Its getting massively busy now and the atmosphere is amazing. Costumes are getting wilder and there are more and more people taking part," he said. "There are about 1,000 swimmers, thousands of spectators and tens of thousands watch by webcam too so we have a worldwide audience". Brian Thomas from the Serpentine Swimming Club in London said: "We have seen a huge growth in numbers over the past five years". He said its Christmas swimming race tradition began in 1864 and about 100 people usually take part after a strict vetting process. "Swimming in a wetsuit is cheating" he said, although stressed that the club has "strict guidelines" making sure participants have acclimatised.	Christmas swims are expected to attract bumper numbers this year due to milder winter weather and growing popularity for the craze.
Samuel Ward scored a goal either side of half-time to set up the victory, before Henry Weir made sure of the result in the final quarter. Jackson went close to scoring, shooting after the Dutch had pushed their keeper outfield, but Weir deflected it in. The result follows Thursday's 1-1 draw against hosts Germany. Britain face Belgium in their final match on Sunday (10:30 BST).	Great Britain beat the Netherlands 3-0 in the Ergo Masters Four Nations Invitational in Dusseldorf as Ashley Jackson won his 100th cap.
A team statement said Henao, 28, had been contacted by cycling's governing body and an anti-doping agency about data between August 2011 and June 2015. The Colombian said he was "beyond disappointed", having missed three months in 2014 over similar concerns. "I know who I am, how hard I have worked and the sacrifices I have made to be where I am today," he added. Henao was voluntarily withdrawn by Team Sky in 2014 while they carried out research into the biological characteristics of riders who live and train at high altitude. They said the results revealed nothing to raise suspicions of wrongdoing. Team Sky stressed Henao had not failed a doping test and had been withdrawn because of the "very obvious distraction to him". "We continue to support Sergio and remain confident in the independent scientific research which was undertaken," the team added. "It is our hope that this can be looked at and resolved quickly by all the relevant authorities so Sergio can start racing again soon." A specialist climber, Henao signed with Team Sky in 2012 and finished in the top 10 in his first Grand Tour, the 2012 Giro d'Italia.	Team Sky have withdrawn Sergio Henao from riding after concerns about his biological passport data resurfaced.
The party secured about 19% of the vote, unofficial tallies show. But it is not clear if it will meet the 25% voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo in the 9 July presidential election by itself. The official election results will be announced in May. Some 19,000 seats were contested across Indonesia in Wednesday's polls, including the 560 seats in the national parliament. A poll by Jakarta think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), put the opposition Golkar party in second place with 14% of the vote, followed by the Great Indonesia Movement Party with 12%. Islamic parties also appeared to have performed better than expected, together grabbing about a third of the national vote. Support for the ruling Democratic Party of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono - who cannot serve a third term as president - fell by half. His party came in fourth with 10% of the vote. Mr Yudhoyono told reporters that he respected the early results. "Let's honour the result of this election and be ready to accept new national leadership that will lead the nation to be better," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. CSIS political analyst Philips Vermonte told Reuters news agency: "Parliament is likely to be very fragmented because many parties have gotten a relatively big share of votes." The parliamentary polls are key to deciding which parties can field presidential candidates. Parties must either secure 25% of the total vote or 20% of the seats in parliament. Candidates whose parties fail to meet these thresholds must form or enter a coalition before they can run for president. Indonesian stocks fell over 3% on Thursday, after expectations PDI-P would secure enough votes to put Mr Widodo, the Jakarta governor, straight through to presidential polls were dashed. "We see the possible formation of a weak government with limited ability to push through necessary reforms and policies ahead," Bahana Securities research head Harry Su told Reuters news agency. Mr Widodo is seen by many as Indonesia's next president. He told reporters on Wednesday that his party was "widely open" to a coalition. "It is not possible for PDI-P to work alone. We have to co-operate with those having the same platform," he said.	Indonesia's opposition Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) leads parliamentary polls but its star candidate may face a tougher path to the presidency, early election results indicate.
The allegations relate to Mr Olmert's time as Jerusalem mayor in the 1990s. Mr Olmert, who resigned as prime minister in 2009, has already been charged in three unrelated corruption cases. He denies any wrongdoing. The latest charges concern the construction of a luxury residential complex in Jerusalem called Holyland which is built on a prominent hilltop. Prosecutors claim that millions of dollars changed hands illegally to facilitate a series of property deals. Jerusalem's planning laws were altered to enable the complex to be built. The project's developers have also been charged in the case. Haaretz newspaper describes the case as one of the largest corruption scandals in Israel's history. The former prime minister denies any wrongdoing and has called the investigation a "witch hunt". Mr Olmert was mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 - 2003, then became a minister in the Israeli cabinet. He took over as prime minister in 2006 after Ariel Sharon suffered a stroke. His three-year premiership was dogged by corruption allegations, and he eventually agreed to stand down. Mr Olmert has pleaded not guilty in the separate proceedings against him, in which he is accused of taking cash for favours and double-billing for overseas trips.	The former Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has been charged with taking bribes in a property scandal.
The 31-year-old, Fulham's top scorer in 2013-14, will join the Potters on a two-year deal on 1 July. "Steve was much in demand and we are delighted to have won the race to secure his signature," said Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes. I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent addition The former Chelsea player is the club's second signing of the summer following the capture of Phil Bardsley. They are "hopeful" of landing ex-Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf from Hannover 96 as Mark Hughes seeks to strengthen a squad that achieved the club's record Premier League points tally last season. Hughes signed Sidwell, who has made more than 180 appearances in the Premier League, while working as Fulham manager in 2011. The former Arsenal trainee played in all 38 of the Cottagers' top-flight fixtures in 2013-14, scoring seven goals. "Like Phil Bardsley, Steve brings great experience to our squad and I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent addition to our squad," said Scholes. Sidwell, who has also played for Reading and Aston Villa, wrote on Twitter he was "saddened" his time at Craven Cottage had ended.	Stoke City have signed midfielder Steve Sidwell on a free transfer following his release by relegated Fulham.
With 100 hours of video added to the site every minutes it can be hard to get noticed, so some people buy fake views. There are many companies that will sell YouTube views, likes or comments for a fee. Most videos have genuine views but the website wants to crack down on the small number that don't.	YouTube has warned it will clamp down on users who buy 'fake views' to make their videos look more popular than they really are.
The crackdown combats phishing by ensuring that the websites of legitimate banks appear at the top of search results. The move comes as the personal details of more than 45 million Chinese people were stolen in separate attacks. The government is investigating the thefts and said that the wave of attacks "threatened internet safety". The 10 biggest search engines in China have signed up to the anti-phishing scheme to ensure that users looking for bank websites go to the right place. Phishing attacks involve messages that look like they come from a bank or other organisation and direct people to a website that mimics the real thing. When people visit the fake site and enter their login details these are recorded by cyber criminals who may loot the account soon afterwards. By ensuring that the websites of banks appear first, the government hopes to limit the numbers of people falling for phishing scams and visiting the fake sites. Some of the search engines will put a special icon next to the bank links in lists of results to flag them as legitimate. The anti-phishing initiative comes at the end of a week in which the personal details of almost 10% of China's 485 million web users were stolen. On Christmas day, the hugely popular Tianya chat site revealed that the login names and passwords from 40 million of its users had been stolen. All risk being plundered by attackers as the information was held in plain text. Tianya has contacted the affected users and urged them to change their passwords as soon as possible. Soon after, CDSN, one of China's largest forums for programmers, reported that the details of all its six million users had been stolen. The attackers got away with email addresses, login names and passwords. Again, all the details were stored in plain text. The scale of the attacks prompted government action and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it would investigate who was behind the attacks. "The department believes the recent leak of user information is a serious infringement of the rights of internet users and threatens internet safety," the Ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government is known to have put in place technology that monitors online chat rooms for controversial topics but the far-reaching measures have not stopped all nefarious cyber activity. As well as criminal hackers, many activists are turning to the web to make protests more visible. The website of Mengniu, a firm at the centre of a tainted milk scandal, was vandalised and its homepage image replaced with text that read "Do you have a conscience?".	The Chinese government is cracking down on home-grown cyber thieves seeking to steal online banking details.
In the space of two months, the 25-year-old has become one of the most controversial politicians in Hong Kong - and is now pitted in a court battle against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments - even though she has admitted it could bankrupt her. Ms Yau and fellow party member Sixtus Leung won elections in September, gaining more than 55,000 votes between them. Ms Yau, a daughter of two civil servants, had little previous political experience, and made headlines for edging out a veteran politician to win a seat. The Chinese Studies graduate had been involved in the 2014 pro-democracy protests, when tens of thousands of people, including large numbers of students, took to the streets demanding fully democratic elections in Hong Kong. She describes the protests as an important part of her political awakening. After the movement failed to win any concessions from Beijing, Ms Yau and Mr Leung became involved in a new political party - Youngspiration - that campaigns against mainland China's influence on Hong Kong, and advocates a "Hong Kong first" approach. The party struck a nerve with many young Hong Kongers unhappy with China and disillusioned with traditional pro-democracy parties, who they argue have failed to achieve any reform. But, after their election victory, things quickly spiralled out of control. Ms Yau and Mr Leung sparked a furore when they were being sworn in last month. Instead of pledging allegiance to the "Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China", the duo swore allegiance to the "Hong Kong nation", used a term considered derogatory towards China, and displayed a banner that read "Hong Kong is not China". Their oaths were invalidated, and thousands of people protested against their actions, demanding they be removed from parliament. A top Chinese official even likened the duo to "two cancer cells - if you don't care about it, it will continue to hurt your body". The Hong Kong government launched a court case to disqualify them. And the Chinese government also decided to intervene - issuing a controversial interpretation of Hong Kong's law on oath taking, to say that any oath that is not "sincere" should be automatically disqualified. After losing the court case, Ms Yau and Mr Leung were disqualified as legislators - and are now also bombarded with angry comments on social media, where people accuse them of being useless, politically naÃ¯ve, or insulting their country. But for all the controversy surrounding her, Ms Yau comes across as mild-mannered and determined in person - and less slick or media trained than many other politicians. "We know that appealing the court decision will cost a lot," she says. "We may face bankruptcy, but we have no choice." She is concerned that if the case is not challenged, it may set a legal precedent for other pro-independence legislators to be disqualified, which would allow the government to "negate the results of a democratic vote". She says she believes in independence for Hong Kong because the "One Country, Two Systems" model under which it is governed, after it was handed back to China from the British in 1997, is "a failed experiment". Despite the model, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, "in these few years we have seen the PRC [People's Republic of China] government having direct interventions into the internal affairs of Hong Kong". "We have to find another way to solve this problem," she says. "One solution may be independence - or maybe we can find another kind of solution, but right now I can't think of any other solutions." It is true that there has been growing anger in Hong Kong at perceived Chinese involvement in its affairs. In particular, the disappearance of five Hong Kong booksellers who published books critical of mainland China in late 2015 sparked concerns over Hong Kong's future. But a majority of people in Hong Kong do not support independence - or think that calls for independence are part of the problem, not the solution. Hong Kong relies on China for much of its food and water supplies - as well as much of its trade - and the Chinese government has shown that it has zero tolerance for moves towards independence from any of its territories. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, supported democratic reform in Hong Kong - but recently said that independence for Hong Kong is "something which is not going to happen". He has argued that the campaign for independence "dilutes support for democracy and makes a mockery of a serious political argument", and that it would be "a tragedy" if the "moral high ground" of those seeking democracy was lost. Veteran democracy activist Martin Lee has even said he felt suspicious of Ms Yau and Mr Leung's actions, saying that they are "giving [Beijing] the excuse" to destroy Hong Kong's judicial independence. Some have even accused Ms Yau and Mr Leung of secretly working with Beijing to undermine Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Ms Yau flatly denies this, and says her party has faced such accusations ever since it was founded. "There are no external forces telling us what to do, to make long term plans, or betray Hong Kong." Looking amused, she adds: "If we really were undercover agents, surely we'd still be in the legislative council - we wouldn't have let ourselves get kicked out, would we?" Ms Yau is known for being outspoken. She supported gay marriage in her election campaign - despite receiving criticism for it - and also raised eyebrows when she said that Hong Kong's housing shortage meant that young people had "no room to bang". But a lot of the comments about Ms Yau have focused on her gender and appearance, rather than her policies. One newspaper wrote articles about what she wore to rallies, highlighting what they called her "protest look", while others nicknamed her "goddess" in reference to her appearance. And the sexism appears to have stepped up a notch since the oath-taking controversy. At one pro-Beijing protest, demonstrators stuck a photo of Ms Yau on a sex doll - and internet commentators have shared photos of Ms Yau's dress being hiked up during a scuffle in parliament. Ms Yau says she believes the sexist attacks are "not because of my gender - it's because my ideology is different from theirs". However, experts have argued that the remarks are indicative of gender stereotyping in Hong Kong media - and worry that they could put off other women from entering politics. As for Ms Yau, she says she will continue to work to fulfil her campaign pledges - even if she loses her appeal and her seat in parliament. "The fact is that many Hong Kongers take [independence] as an aim for the future of Hong Kong," and the government can't ignore those voices, she says. "I hope in the future, Hong Kong people have the power to choose their destiny and the future they want - whatever it is they decide to choose." Additional reporting by BBC Chinese's Martin Yip	Yau Wai-ching is the youngest woman to be elected to Hong Kong's parliament - and she has been called many things, including: "radical", "goddess",  "spy", "pretty" and "cancer cell".
The 23-year-old from Kinross finished second behind Kenyan Faith Kipyegon in four minutes, 19.12 seconds. That erased Yvonne Murray's 1994 effort of 4:22.60 in the Scottish rankings and moved her second on the British all-time list behind Zola Budd's 4:17.57. The new record holder said: "I am really pleased to get that Scottish record. It means a lot to me." Muir, who finished fifth in last year's World Championships, now holds the Scottish 1500m and mile records. "This is my first race of the season over this distance, so I am really pleased," she said. "Faith's been running so quick, so to get so close to her, I'm excited. Murray's husband, Tom Mooney, said on Facebook: "Yvonne says: 'Well done to you, Laura." Muir hopes to secure an Olympics place for Great Britain in Rio at the British trials in Birmingham from 24 to 26 June. The Scot started her season with an 800m victory in Montbeliard, France, last week and next competes in a week's time in a 1500m race in Stockholm. "Training's been going really, so I was expecting to run a good race," added Muir, who fits her training around her veterinary studies. She recently completed her fourth year of vet school.	Laura Muir set a new Scottish mile record with a superb run in Oslo to continue a strong start to her season.
Rhinos' hooker Matt Parcell crossed to open the scoring with Liam Sutcliffe's score making it 12-0 at half-time. Parcell's second was added to by Jamie Jones-Buchanan as Wolves made a number of handling errors. Joel Moon's 15th try in 16 games, Parcell's hat-trick and a Rob Burrow try extended the lead as the hosts kept the Wire scoreless. Leeds, beaten by leaders Castleford at Magic Weekend, are up to third in Super League and have won five of their past seven games. The closest Wire came to scoring was when Joe Philbin was held up over the try line, but it was a disjointed performance throughout. Wolves head coach Tony Smith, who spent three years in charge at Leeds, had seen his side lose their first six games of the Super League season but this was just a second defeat in 10 games. Wolves won the reverse fixture back in April, with what was their first win of the season at their eighth attempt, but were nilled for the first time since April 2016. Leeds head coach Brian McDermott: "It was clinical and the further the game went the better we got. "But I'm just mindful we're playing a team who aren't where we know they can be. We went through that last year. "We'll judge it accordingly. I'm really pleased not to have a try scored against us but at the same time we beat a team that is lacking confidence and not as good as they can be." On Matt Parcell: "There's still some improvement in him. I thought Rob Burrow when he went on was very influential as well. He posed a massive threat for us." Warrington head coach Tony Smith told BBC Radio Merseyside: "I'm disappointed. We needed to execute better as we didn't take opportunities when they were there early in the game. "After that I think we forced a lot of things that weren't the right things and the right time. "Our kicking game wasn't good enough and we just didn't put them under enough pressure tonight. "You can't come to Headingley and turn over too much ball or kick poorly as they're a dangerous team." Leeds Rhinos: Golding; Briscoe, Watkins, L Sutcliffe, Hall; McGuire, Moon; Singleton, Parcell, Cuthbertson, Ferres, Ward, Jones-Buchanan. Replacements: Burrow, Baldwinson, Delaney, Mullally. Warrington Wolves: Ratchford; Russell, Hughes, Atkins, Lineham; Brown, Gidley; Hill, Clark, Sims, Jullien, Westerman, Cooper. Replacements: Crosby, G King, Patton, Philbin.	Leeds Rhinos ran in seven tries as they comfortably beat a poor Warrington Wolves side at Headingley.
Witnesses said after the attack, at Forest Hill station at about 13:20 GMT, a man then chased other people outside the station. People said they saw a man attack another on the train then run out of the station shouting "he wanted to kill Muslims". A 38-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and remains in police custody. Train services were temporarily stopped on the line. Police said they were not treating the attack as terrorism, but as a hate crime. Ambulance officials said the victim, who is in his 40s, was treated at the scene for a stab injury and taken to a south London hospital. He remains in hospital in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition. Emma Pinder, who was at the station, said a man had "chased other people outside the station with a knife". Shellby Curry, 24, from Forest Hill, said she saw a man "waving what looked to be a knife in his hand" near the station and screaming words like "Muslims... kill them all". She described the attacker as a black man with short hair, who she thought appeared to be in his late 30s or early 40s. Several people phoned the police, who arrived about 10 minutes later and restrained him, Miss Curry said. "I was walking along and someone stopped and said, 'be careful, he's got a knife'. As I looked around there he was. "I just grabbed my baby and ran across the road. Looking back I saw him marching up and down waving his arm about." Appealing for witnesses senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp, Paul Langley, said: "This was a serious assault on a man in broad daylight and we are aware that other passengers may have seen what happened or been threatened themselves. "We have spoken with many witnesses from the train but if you saw what happened and haven't yet contacted police, please do so as soon as you can." Services were stopped on the rail line but have since reopened with severe delays, London Overground said. Roads around the station were also shut for a while.	A man has been stabbed on an Overground train in south-east London.
Beth Potter, Laura Muir and Callum Hawkins sealed early places. Andrew Butchart, Eilidh Doyle, Zoey Clark, Chris O'Hare, Steph Twell, Josh Kerr and Eilish McColgan secured their spots at the British team trials. Guy Learmonth qualified at the Anniversary Games, while Lynsey Sharp and Jake Wightman were handed team berths by the selectors. Marathon runner Robbie Simpson had qualified but then withdrew due to a calf injury. Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015. The number of Scots represented reflects a recent improvement in the results of the nation's athletes. Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year. She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m. O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games. Kerr, who finished second at the trials, joins O'Hare in the team, with Wightman also selected after finishing third at the trials. Doyle will be competing at her fifth World Championships as she goes in the 400m hurdles, while Aberdeen's Clark will sample her first major championships having earned her spot in the 400m. Learmonth will be racing in his first World Championships, having finished second in the 800m at the British trials and secured the qualifying time at the Anniversary Games. Butchart will be up against Mo Farah in the 5,000m. "First of all let me firmly congratulate the athletes, their families, their coaches and the clubs involved in their development on selection by GB and NI for a World Champs," said Rodger Harkins, performance director with Scottish Athletics. "We should never be under the impression that selection for a British team at this level comes lightly. It comes after many years of hard work and dedication, sacrifice by athletes and families, and strong commitment, guidance and experience from coaches. "Looking through those selected, I can see examples of that in each and every one of those 13 Scottish names."	Scotland will have 13 athletes at the London 2017 World Championships - almost double the previous best total.
Compounding the trauma of personal loss they face a lonely battle to find and identify husbands, wives and children before trying to bring them home for burial. Mohammed Nowrouz Noori is an Afghan man in his late 30s but he is already a broken man. In January this year he set off with his wife Nilufar, son Mohammad and baby daughter Nastaran from the Turkish coast heading for Greece. "When we were boarding my son said 'Dad I have prayed that we reach to other side safely'," Nowrouz says as he recounts the tragedy at the family home back in Kabul. "We could see lights from Greece. I reassured him, saying 'tonight is the last night of our troubles'." But the boat arranged by people smugglers soon got into trouble and capsized. "In a matter of seconds water was everywhere, filling the boat. It was dark. I lost my children and my wife who had been sitting next to me," Nowrouz says. At least 39 migrants, including several children drowned that day. Nowrouz was among more than 60 rescued, What came next was a 12-day struggle to recover the bodies of his loved ones and bring them home for burial. Read more: The untold story of Europe's drowned migrants Anatomy of a shipwreck Nowrouz says he received medical treatment in a camp on the Turkish coast where police showed him photos of bodies which had been recovered. "I saw my family's pictures there," he says. "I saw the photo of my one-year-old daughter, my six-year-old son and my wife who was 25. I lost them." A police officer asked whether Nowrouz intended to bury his family in Turkey or take them home. After phoning relatives he decided the family should be buried in Kabul. The next day a minibus took Nowrouz and other survivors to Istanbul where he turned to the Afghan consulate for help. "They said that I have to repatriate the bodies myself," he says. At the Afghan consulate in Istanbul, Zia Zaki is one of those trying to cope with the fallout from the migrant crisis. "We have assembled a team of three people to deal specifically with refugee issues," he says as he sifts through piles of documents. "In the last incident I attended there where 25 Afghans who lost their lives at sea. I saw a child's body in the cold room. "I have my own small child. I tried to stay strong because it was my job to be there and identify the bodies. But when I returned home I looked at my child and I cried." Nowrouz spent days calling relatives back home. "I had to borrow money to repatriate my family back to Afghanistan," he says. The consulate told Nowrouz that the bodies of his wife and children were kept in Bursa, a town 300km (187 miles) inland from where the accident happened. He hired a car for the four-hour drive, leaving in the middle of the night. He also booked flights to Kabul for the following evening. But once in Bursa, he could find only the bodies of his wife and son; his baby daughter was missing. With flights arranged he had little choice but to leave her behind to be buried in one of Bursa's cemeteries. At Bursa's Kent cemetery, Imam Neshet Kaya performs the funeral rites for deceased migrants. "I just buried a child who has no name and we don't know who he was," he says. "He was buried here surrounded by me and a few cemetery workers. Today we are his brother, sister and his family." Whether he buried Nowrouz's daughter here is impossible to know. Many of the migrant victims are Muslim and the imam says he makes sure they are buried properly. "We go to hospital to pick up the body and bring it here to perform the Islamic rituals, washing them and wrapping them in a shroud," he says.  "Later we perform the prayers at the mosque." The cemetery keeps records of each grave together with available documents, photos or DNA records to allow possible identification and exhumation if a body is claimed at a later date. For Afghans taking a body home means travelling by air. In Bursa, Mr Nowrouz bought coffins for his wife and son, hired an ambulance and headed back to Ataturk airport for the flight to Kabul. At Istanbul airport, Sohila Shalizai runs the office of Afghanistan's Ariana airline - the tragedy of migrants' deaths has become overwhelming here too. "Lately we have been carrying at least two or three, even up to seven bodies on each flight," Ms Rizi says. "Sometimes we can't cope with the numbers of bodies that come to us and we have refer people to Turkish airlines. Sometimes most of our cargo is coffins." Her colleague, Khan Mohamad, says the airline has transported 70 bodies back to Afghanistan over the last 12 months. "I just returned from customs where I have processed another coffin which came from Izmir." Sometimes, Mohamad says, families don't have the money. "They lose it all when they capsize or the smugglers take it. Last time we sent four bodies to Afghanistan and the relatives still need to pay." Nilufar and Mohammad were buried the day they arrived back in Kabul. But even in grief the family is not united. "I wanted to bring my daughter's body to Afghanistan too", Nowrouz says, "but because the whole process took so long I couldn't find her." Compounding the heartbreak of losing his family, he now has debts to worry about as well. Having borrowed $8,500 to cover the costs of the ordeal, Nowrouz has been left bankrupt by a journey that already cost him everything. Additional reporting from Ismael Shahamat and Johannes Dell	Hundreds of migrants face huge debts and a logistical nightmare to repatriate the bodies of loved ones who have died during perilous sea crossings to Europe.
Bristol Crown Court heard Christopher Daldorph, 45, spent up to two hours a day over 14 years viewing the material. Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) found 20 devices at his home in West Wick, Weston-super-Mare, when he was arrested in April. One hard drive alone contained more than 150,000 images and videos. Daldorph admitted nine counts of making indecent photographs and one count of possessing extreme pornographic images between November 2010 and April this year. Passing sentence, Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC, said: "For over 14 years, as you admit, you have regularly set time aside to scour the darkest corners of the internet to find some of the more disturbing representations of child abuse available. "This is in my judgment an extreme case of downloading indecent photographs of children, because of the volume of the material which you downloaded over a substantial time." Christian Hall of the NCA said: "Daldorph was responsible for amassing hundreds of thousands of indecent images, some of them the most extreme possible involving very young children. "Each of those involved a child being abused in some of the worst ways imaginable." Daldorph, who had worked for the NHS for 17 years, was dismissed from his job after he was arrested.	A hospital radiographer, who downloaded more than a million indecent images and videos of children, has been jailed for two years and four months.
The US-born radical Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki is head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Two brothers believed to be mid-ranking al-Qaeda officials died in a drone strike in south Yemen on Thursday, Yemeni officials said. The attack came just days after al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US Navy Seals. The Pentagon refused to comment on the reports that Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted in Yemen. According to Yemen's defence ministry, the missile fired by the drone hit a car in in the province of Shabwa carrying two brothers, identified by Yemeni officials as Musa'id and Abdullah Mubarak. But reports from Washington now suggest US commanders had believed they had one of al-Qaeda's most valuable targets in their sights. "We were hoping it was him," one unnamed US official told CBS News. The reported attempt to kill Mr Awlaki is believed to be the first known US military strike within Yemen since May 2010, when missiles mistakenly killed one of Mr Saleh's envoys. In September the country's foreign minister said that such unmanned strikes had been suspended. The report comes as Yemenis continue to take to the streets to demand that Ali Abdullah Saleh, president for 30 years, step down. According to the Wall Street Journal, there were several attempts to target Mr Awlaki on Thursday. He escaped an initial attack of three rockets fired at a vehicle in which he was travelling and then swapped cars with the two brothers, who were killed in a second strike by a single drone, the newspaper said. Washington considers the Yemen-based al-Qaeda branch the world's most active terror cell. It is estimated to have some 300 fighters within Yemeni strongholds, clustered around mountain ranges where the central government has little reach. The group is said to have inspired attacks by Muslims within the US as well as plots to smuggle explosives on planes heading to the US. Some analysts are convinced that, after the death of Bin Laden, Mr Awlaki represents the greatest threat. An American-born cleric of Yemeni descent, he was placed on a terrorism blacklist in July 2010 and had imposed financial sanctions on him. US officials say Mr Awlaki helped recruit Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of attempting to blow up an airliner as it flew into Detroit on 25 December 2009. Maj Nidal Hasan, the US Army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 comrades in the Fort Hood shooting in 2009, sought religious advice from Mr Awlaki and saw him preach in the US state of Virginia in 2001, US officials say. A student found guilty of attempting to murder British MP Stephen Timms in London was also said to have been inspired by Mr Awlaki's online sermons.	A US drone attack in Yemen targeted but failed to kill one of al-Qaeda's most influential figures, US reports say.
Adam Mitchell is believed to have been in a pub in Inverness' Baron Taylor Street on Wednesday night last week. Police Scotland said CCTV images show him near the Harry Fairbairn BMW garage on Longman Road at 00:52 on Thursday. Coastguard and police helicopters and the RNLI's Kessock lifeboat were involved in making searches of Inverness Harbour and Beauly Firth. The effort followed up on searches made earlier last week. Family and friends said Mr Mitchell's failure to return to his home in the Culduthel area was out of character. Mr Mitchell is described as 5ft 11in in height, stocky build with long mousy brown hair and a beard. When last seen he was wearing a black leather jacket, a denim vest, black jeans and boots.	Air, sea and land searches were made over the weekend for a missing 18-year-old Inverness man.
The public car park is just off the Upper Newtownards Road, one of the main routes into the city. Thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars. The bonfire makers are involved in a dispute with the city council over the storing of pallets. They say the council collected pallets from the area earlier this year, agreed to store them and return them this month but failed to do so. Bonfire builder Macauley McKinney, 21, said: "We had an agreement with the council that they were going to store the pallets in a safe place, and now because the agreement was broken, they've let us down." Belfast City Council is not commenting in detail on the issue, as an investigation has been called into the storing of pallets. A spokesperson said: "It was agreed at a meeting of Belfast City Council's Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday that an investigation and full review, led by the chief executive with independent input, would be carried out into the issue of collection and storage of bonfire material, and the future approach of bonfires across the city." The committee's decision needs to be approved at a full council meeting next week. Traditionally, bonfires are lit in many loyalist areas of Northern Ireland on the "eleventh night" - the eve of the Twelfth of July, an annual celebration to mark William of Orange's victory over King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.	A car park in east Belfast has been closed to the public by young men building bonfires.
It will take a while for supporters and other leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, or AIADMK, to come to terms with the huge void created by the death of Jayalalitha, one of India's most flamboyant and controversial leaders. The party, founded in 1972 by the charismatic MG Ramachandran, known as MGR, a film star turned politician, has been playing a crucial role in providing political stability in Tamil Nadu, which is among the most important Indian states economically and politically. Jayalalitha's death has triggered an air of uncertainty among the 75 million Tamils who have been used to seeing the AIADMK either as a governing party or as the main opposition for nearly four decades. Political stability has played a key role in Tamil Nadu's development over the years.  Its economy has been growing at a rate of around 12% in the past 10 years, much higher than the national average of around 8%. Tamil Nadu is also the second largest economy among Indian states, next only to Maharashtra. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2015 was estimated to be around $150bn (Â£119bn). And as a whole, GDP per person in Tamil Nadu is 68% higher than the national average of $1,390 (Â£1,102) a year. For the moment, one of Jayalalitha's trusted lieutenants, O Panneerselvam, has taken over as chief minister. The smooth transition of power has surprised everyone. But there are challenges ahead. "The party does not have any other leader who is similarly charismatic or popular. That is a vacuum. Right from its inception, the AIADMK has had popular leadership. For the first time, the party does not have a popular figure," says Gnani, a veteran political analyst. It is well known that there is no second - or even third - line of leadership in the party. The AIADMK flourished and succeeded mainly because of the charisma of Jayalalitha after she took over the party in 1990. At the helm, she never allowed anyone to challenge her and those who showed signs of rebellion were summarily dismissed. As a woman leader in a male-dominated society, she stamped her authority to instil respect or even fear among her party's men. Her autocratic style led to her ministers and senior party members prostrating in front of her in public, sometimes even in front of her car, to get her blessing or attention. The AIADMK leadership - both MGR and Jayalalitha - appealed directly to its supporters, mostly in rural and semi-urban areas. The middle-level leaders were usually hand-picked and most of them had no political base of their own. The winning formula was achieved by offering free tablets, bicycles, televisions and money, and also by striking alliance with smaller or caste-based political parties. The party's election symbol, Two Leaves, introduced by MGR, is still a powerful tool to attract votes. There is speculation that Jayalalitha's long-time friend and confidante Sasikala Natarajan is likely to play a crucial role in the party's affairs and establish a power structure around her. Though she was close to the former leader, Mrs Natarajan was never given any official position by Jayalalitha. Mrs Natarajan and her family members are influential within the party, but they do not have any political base of their own. If there is any trouble within the party over the growing influence of Mrs Natarajan, that will work to the advantage of the main opposition in Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). It is not uncommon in Tamil Nadu politics to engineer a split in the rival camp to bring down the government. Some regional leaders of the AIADMK, who were sidelined by Jayalalitha, may use the opportunity to stage a comeback and demand ministerial berths. Any infighting within the AIADMK is also likely to have an impact at the national level politics. In the past two decades, India's political direction has been dictated by powerful regional parties and the AIADMK was one of them. It took 30 years for a single party to achieve an outright majority in the Indian parliament, in 2014. Support of the regional parties was crucial in the formation of a national coalition government. But the political equation changed after Narendra Modi led the BJP to power two years ago. Whether in a coalition or not, an assertive Jayalalitha never hesitated for a moment to take on the central government, even eclipsing her mentor MGR. She castigated the federal government over their stance on the Sri Lankan Tamil issue or the Cauvery river water sharing dispute with neighbouring Karnataka state. There are concerns now that a weak AIADMK beset by internal squabbles will reduce the party's influence in central policies affecting the state. "Regional parties have already lost their influence after the BJP got an absolute majority in parliament. If infighting erupts within the AIADMK, it will diminish the power and political leverage of the AIADMK. But the BJP still needs their support in the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) to pass crucial bills and laws," says AR Venkatachalapathy, historian and professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies. If nothing goes wrong, the present AIADMK government is expected to complete its full term and the next state assembly elections are scheduled for 2021.  The challenge for the AIADMK will be how it will face the electorate if there is any election in the interim period. The two Dravidian parties - AIADMK and DMK - have been ruling the state for nearly five decades. The national parties, like Congress and the BJP, have been waiting for decades to make inroads in Tamil Nadu. Is it the right moment? "It AIADMK weakens, then the main opposition DMK will benefit. I don't think any national party (like Congress or the BJP) will benefit from the situation. The DMK will move into the space," says N Ram, former editor-in-chief of the Hindu newspaper. Tamil Nadu has witnessed lots of political drama over the years, but it is now entering a new phase and getting used to a life without Ms Jayalalitha for the first time in 35 years. More twists and turns are on the cards.	Jayaram Jayalalitha was the undisputed leader of the governing party in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, but her sudden death has raised questions over who will replace her and what direction the party will take.
Malka Leifer, the former principal of a Jewish girls' school in Melbourne, fled to Israel in 2008 after accusations were raised against her. Ms Leifer says panic attacks stop her coming to court. Extradition hearings have been delayed for two years so far. Based on a psychiatric report, a judge has decided Ms Leifer will not face court until she completed treatment. Ms Leifer allegedly raped and indecently assaulted girls at the ultra-Orthodox Adass Israel School in Melbourne, Australia. The court in Jerusalem has also lifted her house arrest, meaning she will be able to move freely for the first time since Israeli police arrested her in 2014. Prosecutors are expected to appeal this decision. Ms Leifer will begin an initial six months of treatment before a committee assesses whether she is fit to face future extradition proceedings. "We are committed to seeing this woman extradited to Australia to face these very serious child sex abuse charges," Australia's ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. "We are determined to be patient and persevere to this end with the view to seeing her extradited."	An Israeli woman facing 74 child sex charges in Australia is mentally unfit to face extradition, a court says.
Gosport Borough Council says it brought in the £100 fines to combat dog mess and poorly controlled dogs. Previously walkers were allowed to walk up-to six charges, but this has been curbed with the new Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). One professional dog walker said it will affect business. Nick Lower, who runs Gosport Dog Walking, said: "There are a few professional dog walkers who are going to be affected, and members of the public as well." Sue McNaughton, who will now have to walk her five huskies in two packs said: "I understand where [the council] are coming from, but they're penalising the many because of the few. "I wouldn't walk five dogs if I didn't think I could control them." Councillor Graham Burgess said: "In a densely-populated borough like Gosport, we do believe new rules are needed." Some residents are happy about the change, including Jenny Brown who said: "I'm pleased this has come into focus. I've had so many problems when encountering larger groups of dogs." Similar fines are in place in other areas including Oxford. In 2011 the council brought in fines for people walking more than four dogs after complaints of packs being out of control. Councillor John Tanner said: "With more than four dogs, you are not taking your dog out for a walk but a pack of potentially dangerous animals for a riot around the park."	Fines for people who walk more than four dogs at a time have come into force in a Hampshire town.
The Oscar-winning John Ford film has been conserved in the US National Film Registry for its "cultural, historical, or aesthetic" significance. But brawling and boozing feature prominently in the 1952 film, which was shot in County Mayo and County Galway. An official warned "the theme is not likely to be well received here". Although counsellor Joseph Brennan said the film's colour was "beautiful" and its scenery "delightful", he raised fears it would provoke protests from Irish-Americans. His concerns were addressed to the Irish government's Department of External Affairs in a letter dated 17 April 1952, The Irish Times reports. He asked for a swift reply as he wanted to gauge the reaction to the film in Ireland, but no response was received until June. Another missive from the embassy official in July added: "If it were to be taken completely at its face value it would be accepted as a rollicking farce and no harm done. "But I fear it will be regarded by the Irish-American element here as purporting to portray actual life in Ireland. "We may then have protests." Mr Brennan's concerns are outlined in the latest volume of documents on Irish Foreign Policy 1951-1957 which are due to be published later this week. The Quiet Man, which starred John Wayne as boxer Sean Thornton and Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, won Oscars for Best Director and Best Cinematography. When it was added to the film registry in 2013, O'Hara described it as "the first great movie about Ireland" and said it had endured as it was "a simple and timeless story about people in love".	The Irish embassy in Washington feared protests by Irish Americans against the romantic comedy The Quiet Man, newly released documents reveal.
The subsidies for job-seeking graduates and other state support for youngsters are worth €400-500m (£321-401m). The Nuit Debout movement has organised nightly rallies since 31 March against Mr Valls' labour market reforms. Early on Monday police cleared away a protest camp on a central Paris square. Wooden structures erected on Place de la Republique were dismantled and about 100 protesters dispersed peacefully. The Nuit Debout activists, organised through social media, are mainly left-wing, and their activism has been compared to the Spanish Indignados citizens' movement and the Occupy anti-globalisation movement. Mr Valls announced the new aid package during a meeting with student leaders on Monday. It includes a four-month subsidy for graduates who face financial hardship while seeking work. There will also be a state housing guarantee for people under 30, which could apply to 300,000 people renting property. The leader of France's main student organisation Unef, William Martinet, welcomed Mr Valls' package but said the protests against the labour bill would continue. The labour bill would remove some of the protection workers enjoy against being laid off, in a bid to encourage businesses to hire more people. It envisages giving employers more flexibility in setting the hours that their staff work; lowering the current high barriers to dismissal of staff; and new rules on industrial tribunal payouts. The Socialist government is striving to push the unemployment rate below 10%. Many Socialist voters see the current labour protections and 35-hour working week as key achievements that must not be sacrificed for a pro-business economic agenda.	French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has proposed an aid package for students and young apprentices, after so-called "Nuit Debout" (Up All Night) protests by thousands of young people.
Weaker commodity prices and consumer spending, together with a slowdown in its key trading partner, China, has hurt growth. Towards the end of last year, however, the economy expanded by just over 5%, boosted by government spending. President Joko Widodo had promised to lift annual growth to 7% on average. However, the country has seen an average of just under 6% growth over the past decade and analysts have said growth is unlikely to improve for some time. "The fourth quarter data is a positive surprise," economist Tony Nash told the BBC. "But unfortunately the uptick will likely be short lived. We expect deterioration in the first quarter and it'll be tough to regain growth momentum before 2017," he added. Mr Widodo made his promise to raise growth when his five-year term began in 2014, but he has faced problems boosting government spending and has seen several large infrastructure projects delayed. A $5.5bn high-speed railway project, funded by China, was signed last year and is scheduled to be up and running by 2019. But the project has faced widespread objections from transport experts and its long-term viability has been questioned. Mr Widodo has also faced international condemnation for the country's man-made forest fires, which have caused serious economic and environmental damage. In December, the World Bank said Indonesia's forest fires last year had likely cost the country more than twice the amount spent on reconstruction efforts after the 2004 Aceh tsunami. In its quarterly report, the bank said the fires had cost some 221tn Indonesian rupiah ($15.72bn; Â£10.5bn). It added that regional and global costs would be much higher.	Growth in South East Asia's largest economy, Indonesia, has come in at 4.76% for 2015, marking the fifth consecutive yearly decline.
The 25-year-old Spaniard agreed an initial three-year deal with the Whites last summer after moving to Craven Cottage from Rayo Vallecano. However, he has not made a first-team appearance for the Championship club since October. Celta are ninth in La Liga and will face Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk in the last 32 of the Europa League. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page or visit our Premier League tracker here.	Fulham midfielder Jozabed has joined Spanish La Liga side Celta Vigo on loan until the end of the season.
The 26-year-old has been without a club since leaving Blackpool at the end of last season. He started his career with Aston Villa before joining Scottish side Hibernian in August 2011. Osbourne, who is new Iron manager Mark Robins's first signing for the club, could make his debut against Colchester on Saturday.	Scunthorpe United have signed free-agent midfielder Isaiah Osbourne on a three-month deal.
Csongor Sandor, 30, of Dallow Road, Luton, was arrested in June after police, acting on information, found a photo of the attack on his phone. Other images of children were also found stored on the device. At Luton Crown Court he admitted sexually assaulting a child under 13. Sandor also admitted three counts of making indecent images of children. The court heard that at the time of his arrest, police found a photo of a young girl being sexually assaulted by Sandor which he had taken three months previously. The former police officer, from Budapest, had been living in the UK for four years. The court was told he had been employed at an Amazon depot in Hemel Hempstead and was described as a "man of good character". Judge Michael Kay QC said although Sandor appeared willing to seek help to tackle his urges concerning children, he posed a risk to the public of committing further serious offences. He jailed him for eight years and eight months and told Sandor that once he was released he would be made subject to an extended period on licence for five years. He has also been put on the sex offenders' register.	A former Hungarian policeman living in the UK has been jailed for almost nine years for sexually assaulting a child, in a case a judge said showed "extraordinary levels of perversion".
He was withdrawn from this year's race because of possible irregularities in his biological passport. But the rider's Tinkoff-Saxo team said that 28-year-old Kreuziger is now free to continue racing. "The team is very happy he has been cleared and that he is is now eligible to resume racing," a statement said. "He was found not guilty for the alleged abnormalities in his biological passport profile." Kreuziger began 2014 by finishing third at the Tirreno-Adriatico in Italy and claiming eighth in the Tour de Suisse. But he was pulled from his team, although not technically suspended, before the Tour de France. The International Cycling Union (UCI) decided to ban him provisionally in August pending the Czech Olympic Committee's ruling. The UCI said in a separate statement it would consider an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. It has one month to lodge a challenge. The data in question is from Kreuziger's biological passport in 2011 and 2012, when he was riding for the Astana team.	Czech cyclist Roman Kreuziger, fifth in last year's Tour de France, has been cleared of any doping offence by his national Olympic committee.
The 19-year-old moved to Glasgow a year ago and has played in more than 40 games for the Scottish champions. His 18-month deal ends in the summer and Roberts intends to return to City to battle for a place. "I'll always have that belief; the more you play, the more you improve," said Roberts. "It's been my first proper season playing men's football. I did a bit at Fulham, but I was in and out, the same at Man City, so coming here, the manager before [Ronny Deila] played me a lot and Brendan's [Rodgers] been really good with me as well. "It's been good and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  I came here to improve, to win trophies and score goals. "Hopefully at the end of the season I can take that back with me to City and have a good go there. It's been a great experience and I'm thankful for that." Roberts has often found Scott Sinclair and James Forrest starting games ahead of him this season, but the winger says he has learned from working alongside Sinclair in particular. He also insists that the camaraderie within the squad has been a significant factor as Celtic reached the Champions League group stages and have put together a run of 25 unbeaten domestic matches. If Celtic can avoid defeat against St Johnstone on Wednesday, they will equal the record of 26 set by the Lisbon Lions in the 1966-67 season. Roberts, though, insists that the players are not giving too much thought to the record. "The team spirit's been great since day one, when the manager came in and the boys came back for pre-season," he said. "We've kept each other going, we've had good times, fun together, and done well on the pitch. It shows in results and if we continue to do that, it should be a very good season for us. "It's [about] momentum, you feel good, positive and go into every game believing you can win. The more you win, the more positive you are. We're in good stead right now and we'll go into Wednesday firing and ready to go. "We're just going out with the mentality to win every game. On Wednesday we'll show that again. We'll be buzzing to be back in the league and looking to put on a good show. "It's more other people [looking at the record], we just focus on trying to win. We'll do all we can to do that and focus on the game."	Patrick Roberts believes his loan spell at Celtic will prepare him for the challenge of trying to break into the Manchester City first team.
Mr Trump said Mr Obama had learned well before the 8 November poll about the accusations and "did nothing". His comments followed an article in the Washington Post which said that Mr Obama learned last August of President Vladimir Putin's "direct involvement". The alleged meddling is the subject of high-level investigations in the US. President Putin has repeatedly denied any Russian interference into the presidential election. The Washington Post article says Mr Obama was told early last August by sources deep within the Russian government that Mr Putin was directly involved in a cyber campaign to disrupt the election, injure Hillary Clinton and aid a Trump victory. The Post said Mr Obama secretly debated dozens of options to punish Russia but in the end settled on what it called symbolic measures - the expulsion of 35 diplomats and closure of two Russian compounds. They came in late December, well after the election. The Post reported that Mr Obama was concerned he might himself be seen as trying to manipulate the election. The paper quoted a former administration official as saying: "From national security people there was a sense of immediate introspection, of, 'Wow, did we mishandle this'." Measures Mr Obama had considered but which were not put into action included planting cyber weapons in the Russian infrastructure and releasing information personally damaging to Mr Putin. Imagine, for a moment, that you're Barack Obama in August 2016. You've just been informed by the CIA that Vladimir Putin has ordered a wide-ranging effort to disrupt the US presidential election. What do you do? Mr Obama responded in typical fashion - cautiously. He alerted state officials, warned Russia and attempted (unsuccessfully) to fashion a bipartisan response with Republicans in Congress. Now the second-guessing has begun. Some Democrats are saying the Obama team should have gone public with such a startling discovery before election day. The president feared such a move would prompt the Republican nominee to accuse him of meddling and undermine faith in the electoral process. He believed Mrs Clinton was going to win anyway, so it was best not to rock the boat. Mr Trump himself is now questioning why Mr Obama didn't do more - a curious position given that he recently described the Russia hacking story as a Democratic "hoax". These latest revelations add yet another wrinkle to a 2016 campaign that will be hashed and rehashed for the foreseeable future. The most pressing question now, however, is not what Mr Obama did. It's what the US government does next. Mr Trump tweeted on Friday: "The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?" He followed that up with two more tweets on Saturday, the second saying: "Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?" He repeats the argument in an interview with Fox News, which will air on Sunday. "If he had the information, why didn't he do something about it? He should have done something about it. But you don't read that. It's quite sad." Allegations of collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials during the election have dogged the president's first five months in office. He has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling the investigations a "witch hunt". US investigators are looking into whether Russian cyber hackers targeted US electoral systems to help Mr Trump win. US media say special counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice over the Russia inquiries. They involve the president's firing of FBI chief James Comey, who led one of the inquiries, and Mr Trump's alleged attempt to end a probe into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn.	President Donald Trump has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of inaction over alleged Russian interference in the US election in 2016.

The gang were responsible for more than 35 thefts across Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, Nottingham and Yorkshire over 11 months in 2013. Lincoln Crown Court heard how the gang targeted three major rail improvement projects being delivered by Network Rail, and stole signalling cable. They then stripped the cabling and sold the copper inside. The men targeted sites where Network Rail were carrying out work to upgrade signalling. Gordon Aspden, prosecuting, said "It was organised, well-planned and professional thieving. "Over 11 months between February and December 2013 the defendants were responsible for the large-scale theft of power cables being used in these projects. Most of the thefts took place in isolated locations. "There is a strong suggestion that at least one person with inside information, an employee within the rail network, played some part in providing information to these defendants." He said: "Once cabling was stolen it was stripped of its sheathing. It was a very valuable commodity. It was sold as scrap to dealers. The total cost to Network Rail was in excess of £1m. That figure dwarfs the sums these defendants gained." Mr Aspden said that on one occasion the line between Lincoln and Spalding had to be closed for two days following a theft at Sleaford that cost Network Rail £23,000. Recorder Simon King, passing sentence, told them: "I have no alternative but to impose immediate custodial sentences. This was organised and professional thieving. It was plainly worth your while to engage in that."	Six men, including five from the same family, have been jailed for conspiracy to steal railway cable.
The two nations meet in a 2018 World Cup qualifier on Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Day, when the United Kingdom remembers those who have lost their lives in war. But Fifa, who are in charge of world football, say they do not allow any nations to have any political, religious or commercial messages on shirts. They had turned down a request to allow England and Scotland's players to wear armbands with poppies on. The FAs have now said that they will let their players wear the armbands anyway and will accept any punishment. Poppies are worn by millions as a symbol to remember those who have lost their lives in war or been injured. British Prime Minister, Theresa May, has said Fifa's refusal of players being allowed to wear poppies is "outrageous". Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, she said: "Our football players want to recognise and respect those who have given their lives for our safety and security - I think it is absolutely right they should be able to do so." The Football Association of Wales has also written to Fifa requesting permission to wear poppies on armbands during their game against Serbia in Cardiff on 12 November but has not yet said if it will ignore the ban.	The Football Associations of England and Scotland say they will ignore a ban on players wearing poppies in their upcoming match on 11 November.
Both teams remain in the bottom three after drawing 1-1 in the Tyne-Wear derby, with Aleksandar Mitrovic's late header earning Newcastle a point. An increase in TV money means Premier League relegation could cost £100m. "I think we will have to fight until the last game and the last minute, so we have to do it," said Benitez. After spurning a one-goal lead for a second successive game, Allardyce said: "Put those four points on the board now and we are feeling like we are going to be surviving and we are going to stay safe. "Now we are going to go right to the wire to try to stay safe, and that's the bottom line." Mitrovic's 83rd-minute goal ended a run of six defeats against Sunderland and left the Magpies three points adrift of safety with eight games remaining. Sunderland, who took the lead through Jermain Defoe's 15th goal of the season, are a point better off in 18th place, two points behind Norwich. Newcastle travel to the Canaries after the international break with Sunderland also facing them at Carrow Road on 16 April. Media playback is not supported on this device After losing his first game at leaders Leicester, the result earned Benitez a first point since becoming Newcastle manager just over a week ago. Asked if his team were now in a scary position, the former Real Madrid boss replied: "It was scary before. I am here because I have to give the team confidence and we have to improve things. "We are creating chances, we are attacking, so we have to improve this part of the game and create more chances and Mitrovic or Papiss Cisse or the other strikers will score more goals and we will be fine." Media playback is not supported on this device Allardyce, whose team have not kept a clean sheet in 18 consecutive games in all competitions, said his team need four wins from their eight remaining games. "If we don't start getting these clean sheets it's going to be a massive problem," he added. "We are a team that has to score twice to win. Sadly we didn't get the second goal and we conceded late on again. "In the second half, I don't know why we sat in and let Newcastle come at us. Maybe that was the size of the game, but in the end we haven't done that and it's two points dropped. "We need four wins from the last eight, so it's now must-win rather than draw."	Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez and Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce both expect their fight to stay in the Premier League to go down to the wire.
Boyce, 27, who had a couple of spells with Glentoran, had spent this season on loan at Dungannon Swifts after being put on the transfer list at Coleraine. Last June, Coleraine boss Oran Kearney said Boyce was not in his plans and the player was not given a squad number. "We are delighted to get someone of Darren's ability," said Ballymena United manager Glenn Ferguson. "He will add quality to our front line and score goals." Earlier this week, Ballymena signed former Linfield defender Jim Ervin, also on a 30-month deal. United said both players would be eligible to make their Sky Blues debuts in Saturday's Irish Cup fifth round match away to Championship One side H&W Welders. The match at Tillysburn has a 13:30 GMT kick-off. Meanwhile, on Thursday night, Linfield midfielder Brian McCaul signed for Glenavon. McCaul was Linfield's top scorer last season but had not commanded a regular place this term. He had previously been at Glenavon on loan and has signed an 18-month deal at Mourneview Park.	Ballymena have announced the signing of winger Darren Boyce from Coleraine on a two-and-a-half year contract.
Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983. They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. Judges have ruled that there will now be a "By Order hearing" to discuss the next part of the case. Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions. The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals. The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was "wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself". However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case. These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said "for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election". The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts. Lady Paton said: "Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context. "The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement." Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was "irrelevant" and "bound to fail". Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live. The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years. It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April. Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the "details of the account are not correct". The constituents who brought the petition were aided by crowd funding.	A legal challenge to Alistair Carmichael's election as MP for Orkney and Shetland is to proceed.
Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river. He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists. Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing. He had barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals. Legal wrangling Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work. "Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing," he said. Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project "could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen". He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama. Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban. If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay. The government says it is crucial to meeting growing energy needs, but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in their opposition.	A judge in Brazil has revoked a decision which had halted work on the Belo Monte dam in the Amazon region.
The higher education sector largely supported remaining in the UK and since the vote, has voiced concerns about the financial implications of leaving. Universities fear losing research funding, students and staff in the event of a "hard" Brexit. But some universities are considering expanding into Europe as a way round the problem. The University of Kent has had a centre in Brussels for almost 20 years, for more than 200 postgraduate students from 60 countries, and also runs branches in Paris, Athens and Rome. These sites are recognised by relevant legal and educational authorities in each country and allow the university "to develop and foster connections that enable our students to gain important access to professional networks", said a University of Kent spokesman. Other universities could follow suit as Brexit negotiations gather pace. "You can imagine a situation post-Brexit where UK universities are operating as aggressively in Europe as they are in China and India and elsewhere, Chris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, told the Guardian newspaper. There is evidence that UK universities are already losing out on research collaboration with European partners. British universities, in collaboration with small businesses, receive Â£850m in research grants each year from the European Union. Universities also worry that they would find it harder to recruit students and staff from EU countries if freedom of movement restrictions were brought in and the rules on fees for EU students were changed under the UK's new relationship with the EU. EU students currently pay the same fees and have the same access to loans as UK students - and Universities UK president Dame Julia Goodfellow has already called for reassurance for those who have already started degrees at UK universities that these arrangements will last for the duration of their courses. Branches within the EU could allow UK universities to retain research links and European funding while also allowing them to continue to attract staff and students. The Guardian quotes one vice-chancellor as saying that institutions were "window shopping" for the EU countries with the most co-operative regulatory regimes. Germany, Finland, the Republic of Ireland and the Baltic states are said to be emerging as the preferred options of some universities. Alistair Jarvis, deputy chief executive of Universities UK, said British universities faced "significant challenges". "British universities can thrive post-exit with the right support from government," said Mr Jarvis. "To thrive post-exit, we need government to take action to make the UK an even more attractive destination for talented university staff and students from around the world and develop new policies and funding to enhance international research collaboration." Oxford University says it has no plans to expand overseas, though vice-chancellor Louise Richardson has voiced concerns about losing staff to other countries. "Our academics might decide to leave if they're concerned that they may not be able to get their research funded in the future. "There are many universities in the world who would be thrilled to have them and who are approaching them," she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has told the BBC that formal negotiations to leave the EU will probably begin early in 2017.	UK universities could open campuses in Europe to offset the effect of Brexit, some vice-chancellors have suggested.
It was a "good opportunity" and "a chance to work together," a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put "in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent. Moroccan troops went into Western Sahara after Spain withdrew in 1975.

After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered. Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two? The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to "taking an egg out of omelette"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he "wanted to serve" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a "third way" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. "To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision," he said about whether he would extend his stay. "No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. "Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors." Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of "tension" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.	Sometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.
Owen and Karl Oyston sued fan David Ragozzino for Â£150,000 over a post on website Another View From the Tower. The 32-year-old said he had "limited financial means" and feared what would happen should the Oystons win the case. The judge at Manchester Civil Justice Centre gave him 21 days to respond to the claim. The application to default hearing was brought by the Oystons on the grounds Mr Ragozzino had failed to file a defence in time to their action. He was supported at the court by dozens of Blackpool fans, who carried banners that criticised the Oystons' running of the club. On Friday, fellow fan Stephen Sharpe apologised to the Oystons over his online comments, withdrawing his posts after accepting they were "false, defamatory and, in some cases, threatening". On Saturday, about 1,000 fans staged a demonstration before the club's home game with Brighton, calling for the Oystons to relinquish control of the club.	A Blackpool football fan who is accused of libelling the club's owners on the internet has told a court he has "never written anything defamatory".
One head teacher decided "all reading can be done on iPads," a delegate told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference. The union voted to lobby for libraries to be included in Ofsted inspections. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that school libraries "played a vital role". Cathy Tattersfield from Derbyshire quoted international evidence suggesting a positive correlation between good school libraries and student attainment. Ms Tattersfield said she had been "shocked" that two secondary academies had "recently closed or attempted to close their libraries and several of them have had their librarian hours or posts cut, mostly in the ex-mining areas of Derbyshire". A survey of 485 ATL members last month suggested a patchy picture on library provision said Ms Tattersfield. "It seems to be feast or famine. "Some secondary provision is fine, cherished and secured," - but others faced reduced opening hours, conversion to e-learning centres, cuts in staff hours, or librarians having been removed or replaced by support staff or teachers. "We identified a third of secondary schools have had cuts of 40% or more since 2010, with 20% redundancies in library staff at their school." Another delegate said his school library, closed last year, had provided a host of benefits to pupils, from paired reading for special needs pupils to introducing able readers to new authors and running a range of enrichment activities. He said the library's books and magazines had been distributed among subject departments. "Lesley Mumbray-Williams whose school dispensed with her services as librarian said a third of the stock had ended up in skips within three weeks of her leaving." Another delegate said the librarian post in their school had not been filled and the library doors were often locked. Of the education staff who responded to the survey: A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "We want all children to read widely and well and believe school libraries can play a vital role in fostering that love of reading. "We trust schools to decide on whether to provide and maintain a library service for their pupils."	Too many school libraries in England face cuts or closure with schools increasingly viewing books as obsolete, a teachers' union has heard.
The 24-year-old from Runcorn became Britain's first champion in the event's 17-year history in 2016. After winning gold in the season-opener in Switzerland earlier in April, she finished behind 18-year-old Janja Garnbret in Chongqing, China. Coxsey still leads Slovenia's Garnbret in the overall rankings, with five more events to take place before August. Japan's Akiyo Noguchi, 27, picked up bronze with third place. "It was a hot and sweaty final," Coxsey wrote on Twitter. "I'm very happy to finish in second place. Massive congrats to Janja!"

It follows a tweet by the rail firm encouraging its passengers to post messages to the union saying how they feel about on-going strike action. Southern also took out newspaper adverts headlined Let's Strike Back and including the RMT's twitter details. Most people who responded criticised the company rather than the union. Southern said on Monday its aim had been "to get the debate going". The RMT said it believed the advert amounted to "targeted harassment", which contravened Twitter's regulations. On Monday Southern tweeted: "Time to get back on track. Tweet @RMTunion & tell them how rail strikes make you feel." Dozens of passengers immediately responded, including Marianne Powell who tweeted: "You brought this on yourselves. We, your customers are suffering." Another passenger, Simon Cox, posted: "I dislike unions but I dislike incompetent management more." Commenting on Southern's message, Another Angry Woman tweeted: "Strongly recommend you read this thread, @SouthernRailUK bc the problems are on you." The next planned strike announced by the RMT is between 00:01 BST Tuesday 11 October and 23:59 BST Thursday 13 October. Months of industrial action by the RMT and high levels of staff sickness have hit Southern's services, which link London with Surrey, Sussex, Kent and Hampshire. Last month the RMT announced 14 days of strike action in the long-running dispute over the role of conductors on trains. On Monday Southern offered conductors a lump sum of Â£2,000 in a bid to bring industrial action to an end.	The RMT union, which is embroiled in a bitter dispute with Southern Railway, says it is to make an official complaint to Twitter.
The emails confirmed the Trump camp's interest in receiving help from the Russian government to discredit opponent Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign last year. The Dow Jones was unchanged at 21,409.07 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.08% to 2,425.53. The Nasdaq rose 0.3% to 6,193.3. Wall Street has generally climbed this year, in spite of some shaky moments stemming from unease over the fate of the Trump administration and prospects for its business-friendly agenda. Markets also sank in May amid a furore over US President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating ties between the campaign and Russia. That investigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, a rise in oil prices helped lift energy stocks, such as Exxon Mobil, which climbed 0.6%. But bank stocks lost ground ahead of the release of quarterly earnings this week and a day after the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unveiled a rule making it easier for customers to file collective lawsuits. introduced a The rule forbids companies from requiring that people use an individual, out-of-court process to resolve disputes as part of the contract for their credit card and bank accounts. Bank of America and Citigroup shares fell 1.2% on Tuesday, while Wells Fargo dropped 1%. The rule may be short-lived as it comes amid a push by the White House and Republicans in Congress to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau less powerful. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, said on Tuesday he would file legislation to undo the rule.	The US stock market closed on Tuesday about where it began, recovering after a flash of panic prompted by the release of emails from Donald Trump Jr.
Labour MP Mrs Cox died when she was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on Thursday. After her death, her friends set up a fundraising page, with proceeds to be divided between causes she had supported. In a tweet, her husband Brendan said the money would "change lives". The fund was pushed past the seven-figure mark shortly before 20:30 BST on Monday by a single £6,000 donation. More than 30,000 people have donated so far. Money raised will support three charities Mr Cox said were close to his wife's heart - the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets. Mrs Cox's friend Tim Dixon, one of those who launched the fund, said: "The scale and speed of the public response to this fund has been overwhelming and deeply gratifying to Jo's family. "It shows how powerfully Jo's story has moved so many. Jo would be so proud." Gofundme, which hosts the appeal, said it was the largest UK campaign it had seen, and the third largest globally. The fundraising milestone came after MPs gathered in the House of Commons on Monday to pay tribute to Mrs Cox as members of her family looked on. Friends of Mrs Cox have announced plans for a public event in Trafalgar Square in London on Wednesday, on what would have been her 42nd birthday. Mr Dixon said her husband Brendan was doing "an amazing job, and we're telling him that". He said: "Over the weekend, he was thinking about how having kids just three and five years old, they're not going to have many memories of their mother when they grow up - he wants to capture those memories now. "He had them write down special memories of mummy on pieces of paper, cut them out and hang them on the tree in his parents' garden." The Batley and Spen MP died after she was attacked outside a library on her way to a constituency surgery. Bernard Kenny, 77, was discharged from hospital on Monday night after he was stabbed in the stomach as he went to the aid of Mrs Cox. A petition to the Cabinet Office calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross has gained over 27,000 backers. Rachel Collinson, who started the petition and is a Green Party spokesperson, said the move would "draw the nation together to celebrate rather than to give in to fear". She said: "This man is a ray of light in a dark time, in a moment where the UK seems to be troubled by fear and division. This guy can be a beacon for all of us in what he did." A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "The government is of course aware of the calls for Bernard Kenny to receive an honour and we will examine the evidence, which will then be considered by the honours committee to decide whether to recommend him for an honour." Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox.	The husband of killed MP Jo Cox has praised the public's "incredible generosity" after a fund set up in her memory hit £1m in donations.
City led through Daphne Corboz's tap-in after Nikita Parris hit the post. Steph Houghton's curling free-kick towards the bottom corner was well kept out by keeper Sophie Baggaley as the visitors dominated the game. In second-half stoppage time, Jane Ross headed home Parris' pinpoint cross to secure all three points. Birmingham's best chance came through Melissa Lawley whose drive was saved by Karen Bardsley, but the hosts were second best throughout.

Dear Alison I am compelled to write and seek review of an historic case of rape. Unusually, and contrary to current practice and the ACPO/CPS Guidance on the Investigation and Prosecution of Rape Cases, the investigation into the serious allegations in this case was dropped before the suspect was interviewed. The elements of lack of freedom and capacity to consent - which may even have triggered the "no consent" legal presumption - make the decision highly irregular. This is shocking in itself. It further troubles me that the senior police officer who dropped the case revealed to the victim he apparently took a series of worthless stereotypes and other irrelevant points into consideration. He did this after apparently consulting with an unnamed CPS official. Most of these stereotypes have been blown out of the water in recent months. Or so I thought. There has been a sea change in the climate surrounding rape, historic cases in particular. Why is it that the tide has not reached this case? I am driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator - Leon Brittan - may in some way have influenced treatment of the case.  I hope I am wrong. But in my view the case demands your personal attention and an immediate review by the CPS Area Head of Sexual Offences. As you know, I have been working with the Metropolitan police on a number of cases involving sexual crimes over the last 18 months. I have been the recipient of a considerable amount of information from victims directly, much of which I have passed on to the police. You will know that some of this information has already led to arrests. I anticipate that, under your leadership, more work will follow. I enclose a contemporaneous note written by victim _________ of a rather blunt conversation she had with DCI Settle concerning his decision to drop the case. I invite you to note, in particular, that he told the victim - who had been locked in a flat and tried to escape from the bathroom window: "There is no evidence he asked you for sex, forced you to have sex, or asked you to take off your clothes, which you did voluntarily" This was apparently considered to be a fatal deficiency. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the victim has not has this confirmed in writing as promised. I asked _______ to share her thoughts after her experience of reporting a crime. These are her words: "My feelings are that I have been brutally misled having been encouraged by the DPP statements to come forward with my historical case following the Savile affair. All the public pronouncements after Savile suggested that these investigations would be treated sensitively, non-judgmentally and in a victim-centric way. I have been interviewed twice in long, harrowing video sessions first by ______ Police, then MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]. I have been encouraged by the MPS to believe that my evidence is both credible and corroborated. I have repeatedly had to relive the most harrowing night of my life, long pushed to the back of my mind. Then, when I had the temerity to question a police decision I have been turned on by a senior police officer, apparently with the support of the CPS. I have been implicitly accused of making an allegation against someone because 'it is all about who he is'. I have been implicitly accused of being a slut because I sat on a bed. These are attitudes that women of my generation associate with the police and prosecution authorities of the sixties and seventies, not an enlightened and publicly accountable twenty- first century service. It was these attitudes that made me think I would get nowhere if I proceeded with the case when the rape happened. It seems nothing has changed". I have found myself appalled at the conduct of this investigation. I would like to believe that it is not typical of the CPS and Metropolitan police as a whole. However the case raises some very serious questions which are likely to remain unanswered without your attention. In the light of this, please could you confirm to me that: Everyone is complicit in the failures of the past. But we have an opportunity now to put matters right. Any attempt to perpetuate a CPS in which a victim's acquiescence in or inability to escape rape is a barrier to prosecution would fail, with grievous consequences, and would be wrong. There is a strong public interest in getting this right. I have every confidence that your leadership, and personal intervention in this case, will take the CPS in an altogether better direction.	Below is the full letter that deputy Labour leader Tom Watson sent to the director public prosecutions Alison Saunders in April 2014 urging her to look again at the Lord Brittan allegations.
There have been huge battery-related recalls before - Nokia had to ask consumers to send back 46 million batteries in 2007 because of overheating fears, but because they were removable it did not mean a well-reviewed flagship had to be scrapped. "Stop using your device, back up your data and switch it off," the Samsung told Note 7 owners the day after it confirmed it had shut down its assembly lines following a spate of fires. A compensation scheme is being put in place - users will be offered the choice of either getting all their money back or swapping the phablet for an older, smaller-screened Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge phone plus a partial refund. But several questions remain unanswered. When Samsung instituted the initial recall last month, it pointed to a "battery cell issue" being the cause. A report sent by the company to regulators was more specific, saying a production fault had caused some of the batteries to be slightly larger than intended, which had put pressure on them when they were fitted inside phones, according to a leak reported by Bloomberg. The issue was blamed on the components' manufacturer - Samsung SDI  - and was supposed to have been fixed by putting  batteries made by another company, ATL, in the replacements. Now that several of that second batch of phones have overheated too, it is unclear whether the original problem was misdiagnosed. According to the New York Times, Samsung's engineers were never able to get the phones to explode when they tried to recreate the fault. "We are working with relevant regulatory bodies to investigate the recently reported cases involving the Galaxy Note 7," was the only comment a Samsung spokesman was willing to make on the matter. Samsung has yet to reveal exactly how many Note 7s it made before pulling the plug on Tuesday. On 2 September, the South Korean company said 2.5 million devices were subject to its initial recall. On 27 September, it added that more than 60% of the Note 7s that had been sold in South Korea and the US had been replaced with new devices. Those two countries accounted for the vast majority of the phones sold - only about 50,000 devices made it to Europe. And the Note 7 only briefly returned to sale to new customers in South Korea last week. All of which gives a rough tally of four million units. IHS had originally forecast Samsung would have made about six million Note 7s by this point if all had gone according to plan. It is less clear how many actually overheated Samsung said it had received "35 reported claims" at the time of the first recall, and there were seven reports in the media of replacement models being affected. Samsung has said it will take "all measures" to get the devices back. For now, that involves sending emails and notifications to registered users. At the time of the original recall, it also issued a software update that prevented some of the batteries from being fully recharged. There is speculation that other restrictions - or a full lockout - could be imposed if users now refuse to give the devices up. There is also the question of what Samsung does with the mountain of returned mobiles. A spokesman declined to say whether it might strip them down and re-use components in other products. But one environmental pressure group urged it act responsibly. "Mobile phones have valuable and precious materials within them, the mining for which can cause significant environmental harm - and can sometimes be carried out in appalling working conditions in developing countries," said Friends of the Earth's policy director, Mike Childs. "All phones should be 100% recycled at the end of their lives, or when they have to be returned due to faults. "The environment shouldn't suffer because of the mistakes of  mobile phone firms." Many consumers bought cases, a Blackberry-styled keyboard cover, a wide-angle lens attachment and spare styluses and power packs for their Note 7s. A spokesman for Samsung said it was still in discussions with vendors about how to cover these costs. Some owners are also wondering if they will be offered extra cash for handing back the second-generation Gear VR virtual reality headset that was bundled with pre-orders. It costs abut Â£100 to buy separately. The spokesman said the company considered this to have been a "gift" but did not rule out some kind of additional compensation. Samsung's Galaxy line-up used to distinguish itself against Apple's iPhones by allowing users to take off the phones' backs and swap out their batteries. But the S6 and Note 5 phones changed that, helping Samsung offer more compact designs with added water resistance as a bonus. Some people have pointed out Samsung might have avoided its current problems if it had not made that choice. And it is notable its domestic rival LG has included removable batteries in its two current top-end models. Unsurprisingly, Samsung would not comment on its future designs. But one expert said all smartphone-makers would be reviewing their plans. "There are greater power demands on modern smartphones - they have bigger, higher-resolution screens, faster processors, and 4G data - but there is also greater pressure to keep them very compact and also enable owners to charge them quickly," said Ian Fogg, from IHS. "Those are competing demands. "Everyone will be looking at their forthcoming smartphone launches and tasking their engineering teams to have another look at the way their charging and the batteries work to make sure they don't have the same problem. "And Samsung will be looking at its upcoming models in a particularly close way, as it's possible they were set to share some of the same design elements as the Note 7."	Samsung's second recall of its Galaxy Note 7 handsets is an unprecedented disaster for the company and the wider mobile phone sector.
It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain clumps of a protein called tau that is closely linked to the disease. Alzheimer's Research UK said it was promising work. Alzheimer's disease is a problem for researchers trying to come up with a cure. The brain starts to die years before any symptoms are detected, which means drugs are probably given too late. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's cannot be made with absolute certainty until a patient has died and their brain is examined. It is also not 100% clear what is the cause of the dementia and what are just symptoms. One protein, called tau, is very closely linked to the disease, with tangles of tau thought to be one way in which brain cells are killed. The team, lead by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, used positron emission tomography to build a 3D picture of tau in the brain. They developed a chemical that could bind to tau and then be detected during a brain scan. Tests on mice and people with suspected Alzheimer's showed the technology could detect tau. Dr Makoto Higuchi, from the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, said: "Positron emission tomography images of tau accumulation... provide robust information on brain regions developing or at risk for tau-induced neuronal death." The research is at an early stage, but it could eventually lead to an actual test for Alzheimer's disease. It might also allow researchers to closely follow the impact drugs that affect tau have on the brain. Another protein - beta amyloid - is also linked to Alzheimer's and can be detected in similar tests. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain. "With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target. "If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression."	Pioneering brain imaging that can detect the build-up of destructive proteins linked to Alzheimer's has been developed by Japanese scientists.

Alice Gross, 14, was found in the River Brent in west London in September 2014. Days later the body of Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns was found nearby. The inquest into her death will look into whether failures by the government and the police contributed to her death and will examine why Zalkalns was allowed to live unchecked in the UK. Reading from a prepared statement at the inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice, Alice's mother Rosalind Hodgkiss said the family wanted to "establish whether or not the systems for monitoring foreign offenders and cross-border sharing of information are robust". She added: "We appreciate that they may have changed significantly, but we remain stunned that a foreign national with a conviction for murder was not monitored, or even known about in any way. "This has destroyed much of our faith in our country's ability to protect its citizens. "The Home Office and the police forces nationwide should be doing everything they can to ensure that this should not be allowed to happen again." Ms Hodgkiss described her daughter as "lively and popular" as well as "witty, sharp and academic". She said Alice was a keen songwriter and it was "impossible to convey the devastation her death had caused to the family". She added: "We have many unanswered questions. We will never know exactly what happened on that day." Alice went missing on 28 August 2014 after leaving for a walk along the canal. Her body was found a month later following what the Met Police called the largest inquiry since the 7/7 bombings in 2005. Pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl told the inquest her body had been discovered in the River Brent, tied into a foetal position and weighted down by bricks, logs and a bicycle wheel. He concluded she had been sexually assaulted and asphyxiated, probably by being prevented from breathing by a larger person pressing on her torso. Zalkalns was the chief suspect in Alice's death and the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) both said he would have been charged with her murder had he not died. Zalkalns was convicted of murdering his wife in Latvia in 1998.	The mother of a schoolgirl who police believe was killed by a foreign convicted murderer said she was stunned he was not being monitored.
It is hoped the vaccinations will halt the spread of TB from hotspot areas in the South West and West Midlands. Groups will be offered funding of up to 50% of the costs for vaccinating. The move comes as the government prepares to cull more than 1,000 badgers in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset. Areas identified for vaccination include Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and East Sussex. The aim is to create a "buffer" zone to prevent the spread of the disease in new areas of the country where incidence is currently low. The programme is part of the government's strategy to achieve bovine TB free status in England by 2038. The scheme has been welcomed as "fantastic" by Dominic Dyer of the Badger Trust and Policy Advisor at Care for the Wild. "Badgers are no more than a minor player when it comes to bovine TB... culling them is a completely pointless, unscientific and ultimately unsuccessful way of dealing with this small percentage of infectious badgers," he said. Projects considered eligible for the Badger Edge Vaccination Scheme (BEVS) need to be predominantly close to the borders of the hotspot areas and must cover a minimum area of about nine sq m (15 sq km). Nigel Gibbens, the UK's Chief Veterinary Officer, urged groups to take advantage of the offer to help stop the spread of the disease. "We know vaccination cannot cure badgers already carrying TB, but used in the right areas, it can play a vital role in creating a barrier to the disease's spread," he said. Culling of badgers is due to begin again in Gloucestershire and Somerset, with the maximum number of badgers that can be culled set at 1,091 in Gloucestershire and 785 in Somerset.	A scheme to vaccinate badgers against bovine tuberculosis in a bid to tackle the disease in cattle has been launched by the government.
New Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent envoy Fukushiro Nukaga to deliver a letter to South Korean President-elect Park Geun-hye. The two states have been involved in a prolonged row over disputed islands. Mr Abe was sworn in in December, while Ms Park is set to assume office next month. Diplomatic relations became tense after South Korean President Lee Myung-bak made a surprise visit last year to the disputed islands known as Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan. Profile: Dokdo/Takeshima islands North Korea also claims the islands, which consist of two main islands and about 30 smaller rocks, the waters of which are seen as valuable fishing grounds. A South Korean coastguard detachment has been stationed at the disputed islands since 1954. "At a time when a new government starts [in both countries] I hope we can make a mutual effort to build trust based on people's sentiment and strengthen our bilateral ties in various fields," Ms Park said during the meeting. She had turned down an earlier request for a meeting with Japan last month, citing a tight schedule. Mr Nukaga went to Japan saying he wanted to "play the role of mediator so that this year can be a good one for the two countries". The talks have been met with some protests in South Korea. One of the demonstrators, a 63-year-old man, stabbed himself in the stomach with a knife. The man had also previously rammed his truck into the Japanese embassy's gate last year, reports Yonhap news agency. That incident prompted a diplomatic protest from Japan. Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have frequently been troubled by issues from their shared history - including Japan's use of military sex slaves or "comfort women" during World War II, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul. Many had judged that Japan's new nationalist leadership would mean further tensions on such issues, but others have pointed to the economic and security incentives for both countries to work together, our correspondent adds. Mr Abe had said earlier this week that he wanted to make a good start with South Korea. On Friday, however, he criticised the country's refusal to extradite to Japan a Chinese man wanted over a 2011 arson attack on the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, where Japan's war dead are buried. The court in Seoul sent Liu Qiang home to China, saying he might not get a fair trial in Japan. He had spent 10 months in jail in South Korea for a separate arson attack on the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Mr Abe said the decision was "extremely regrettable". China's foreign ministry welcomed the ruling. Japan and China are involved in a separate territorial dispute in the East China Sea.	A Japanese special envoy has met the South Korean president-elect in Seoul in a move aimed at helping soothe relations between the two countries.
The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September. Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects. The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said. "Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement. "They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings. "The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit." Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings. Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions. The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty. However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation. The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment. The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand. He had previously rejected offers of assistance. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds. Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.	UK police are to return from Thailand after reviewing an investigation into the murders of two British tourists, Scotland Yard has said.
A masked gunman opened fire at La Terrasse bar, killing a French national, witnesses said. A Belgian security official working for the EU and three Malians also died in the attack. One witness said an attacker shouted "God is Great" in Arabic ("Allahu Akbar"). It is the first attack of its kind in the capital. It is not clear who carried out the attack, but al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants have been fighting the army in northern Mali for a number of years. France, the former colonial power in Mali, intervened two years ago to stop their advance south on Bamako. French President Francois Hollande condemned the attack as "cowardly". He spoke by phone to Malian counterpart Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and they "decided on common measures to strengthen security in Mali", the French presidency said. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders called the attack a "cowardly act of terror". La Terasse is popular among expats for its salsa evenings. You often see people there from the UN and EU mission that trains the Malian army. When I arrived there about an hour after the attack, there was a white body bag on the floor. A dozen Malian police were at the scene, including an inspector who used tables and stools to cordon off the bar. A witness said the attackers had sped off in a vehicle and on a motorbike and that one had shouted "Allahu Akbar". If confirmed as the work of Islamist fundamentalists, this would be the first such attack in Bamako. But locals have long feared it might happen. Many think the UN and the French and Malian militaries have been complacent to believe the danger is limited to Mali's north. There is very little security in Bamako apart from around foreign embassies and the UN mission. European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU would "not be intimidated by terrorism, at home or abroad". The attack happened shortly after midnight. Witnesses and officials said the attackers had killed the Belgian and Malian victims near the bar. Our reporter says French soldiers arrived quickly afterwards on the first-floor nightclub on Saturday. They confirmed that a man killed at the bar, in the Hippodrome area of the capital popular with expatriates, was a French national. The French foreign ministry later named him as 30-year-old Fabien Guyomard, who French media said was in Mali working for a private company. One of the Malian victims is believed to have been a police officer, and another a security guard, our correspondent says. Militancy in Mali: A witness told the BBC he had seen four men flee the scene in a vehicle and one on a motorbike. UN officials said an early report that a third European had been killed was incorrect. Nine people were wounded in the attack, officials said. They reportedly include three Swiss citizens, two of whom were soldiers working at the UN mission, according to the Swiss defence ministry. It has also emerged two people detained by police after the killings on Saturday were not involved. France has troops based in the Sahel region of northern Africa in an effort to stop the emergence of jihadist groups. This follows their intervention in Mali in January 2013, after various Islamist militant groups managed to take over most of northern Mali in 2012. The militants were eventually expelled from towns across the north, but both nomadic Tuareg rebels and other Islamist militant groups have remained active in the vast desert region. Peace talks with Tuareg rebels ended inconclusively in Algiers last week. Northern Mali has been a flashpoint of conflict since Mali's independence from French rule in 1960, with Tuareg rebels campaigning for independence or more autonomy. The conflict has become more complex with the emergence of jihadi groups, which roam freely across parts of the Sahara desert.	Five people have been killed in a machine-gun and grenade attack on a bar in Mali's capital, Bamako.
The adware - dubbed Superfish - was potentially compromising their security, said experts. The hidden software was also injecting adverts on to browsers using techniques more akin to malware, they added. Lenovo faces questions about why and for how long it was pre-installed on machines - and what data was collected. The company told the BBC in a statement: "Lenovo removed Superfish from the preloads of new consumer systems in January 2015.  At the same time Superfish disabled existing Lenovo machines in the market from activating Superfish. "Superfish was preloaded on to a select number of consumer models only.  Lenovo is thoroughly investigating all and any new concerns raised regarding Superfish." Users began complaining about Superfish in Lenovo's forums in the autumn, and the firm told the BBC that it was shipped "in a short window from October to December to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping". User feedback, it acknowledged, "was not positive". Last month, forum administrator Mark Hopkins told users that "due to some issues (browser pop up behaviour, for example)", the company had "temporarily removed Superfish from our consumer systems until such time as Superfish is able to provide a software build that addresses these issues". He added it had requested that Superfish issue an auto-update for "units already in market". Superfish was designed to help users find products by visually analysing images on the web to find the cheapest ones. Such adware is widely regarded in the industry as a form of malware because of the way it interacts with a person's laptop or PC. Security expert from Surrey University Prof Alan Woodward said: "It is annoying. It is not acceptable. It pops up adverts that you never asked for. It is like Google on steroids. "This bit of software is particularly naughty. People have shown that it can basically intercept everything and it could be really misused." According to security experts, it appears that Lenovo had given Superfish permission to issue its own certificates, allowing it to collect data over secure web connections, known in malware parlance as a man-in-the-middle attack. "If someone went to, say, the Bank of America then Superfish would issue its own certificate pretending to be the Bank of America and intercept whatever you are sending back and forth," said Prof Woodward. Ken Westin, senior analyst at security company Tripwire, agreed: "If the findings are true and Lenovo is installing their own self-signed certificates, they have not only betrayed their customers' trust, but also put them at increased risk." Although Lenovo has said that it has removed Superfish from new machines and disabled it from others, it was unclear what the situation would be for machines where it had already been activated. Prof Woodward said: "Lenovo is being very coy about this but it needs to explain how long it has been doing this, what the scale is and where all the data it has collected is being stored. "There will be remnants of it left on machines and Lenovo does not ship the disks that allow people to do a clean install." It raises wider questions about the deals that computer manufacturers do with third parties and the amount of software that comes pre-installed on machines. Mr Westin said: "With increasingly security and privacy-conscious buyers, laptop and mobile phone manufacturers may well be doing themselves a disservice by seeking outdated advertising based monetisation strategies." Users were particularly angry that they had not been told about the adware. One Lenovo forum user said: "It's not like they stuck it on the flier saying... we install adware on our computers so we can profit from our customers by using hidden software. "However, I now know this. I now will not buy any Lenovo laptop again." The problem also caused a storm on Twitter, where both Lenovo and Superfish were among the most popular discussion topics.	Computer maker Lenovo has been forced to remove hidden adware that it was shipping on its laptops and PCs after users expressed anger.
Cooper, 18, was registered with the National League in time for him to be part of the squad for Saturday's home fixture against Braintree Town. The son of former Swindon, Peterborough and Darlington manager Mark Cooper, the Blues under-21 player signed a first professional deal last summer. However he is yet to make a senior appearance for Birmingham City.	Forest Green Rovers have signed midfielder Charlie Cooper from Birmingham City on a one-month loan.
Visitors from boats have also built bonfires and cleared vegetation on Les Minquiers - a group of islands and rocks to the south of Jersey. The States is urging boat owners and visitors to respect Jersey's wildlife laws and the "fragile environment". Dozens of people from France and Jersey visit the reefs each summer. Dr Paul Chambers from the Environment Department said the reefs were "ecologically important". The States said that between March and August the main islands were home to nesting seabirds and it was an offence to disturb them. Then in autumn large numbers of migrating birds are dependent on the vegetation on the reefs for shelter and food.	Birds' nests have been deliberately destroyed and seals and dolphins disturbed around Jersey's offshore reefs, the States has said.
Tumours can "seed" themselves elsewhere in the body and this process is behind 90% of cancer deaths. The mouse study, published in Nature, showed altering the immune system slowed the spread of skin cancers to the lungs. Cancer Research UK said the early work gave new insight into how tumours spread and may lead to new treatments. The spread of cancer - known as metastasis - is a fight between a rapidly mutating cancer and the rest of the body. The team at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge was trying to figure out what affected tumour spread in the body. Researchers created 810 sets of genetically modified lab mice to discover which sections of the DNA were involved in the body resisting a cancer's spread. The animals were injected with melanomas (skin cancer) and the team counted the number of tumours that formed in the lung. Their hunt led them to discover 23 sections of DNA, or genes, that made it either easier or harder for a cancer to spread. Many of them were involved in controlling the immune system. Targeting one gene - called Spns2 - led to a three-quarters reduction in tumours spreading to the lungs. "It regulated the balance of immune cells within the lung," Dr David Adams, one of the team, told the BBC News website. "It changes the balance of cells that play a role in killing tumour cells and those that switch off the immune system." The field of immunotherapy - harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer - has delivered dramatic results for some patients. A rare few with a terminal diagnosis have seen all signs of cancer disappear from their body, although the drugs still fail to work in many patients. Dr Adams said: "We've learnt some interesting new biology that we might be able to use - it's told us this gene is involved in tumour growth." Drugs that target Spns2 could produce the same cancer-slowing effect but that remains a distant prospect. Dr Justine Alford, from Cancer Research UK, said: "This study in mice gives a new insight into the genes that play a role in cancer spreading and may highlight a potential way to treat cancer in the future. "Cancer that has spread is tough to treat, so research such as this is vital in the search for ways to tackle this process." Follow James on Twitter.	The deadly spread of cancer around the body has been cut by three-quarters in animal experiments, say scientists.
Gosport's HMS Sultan and Fort Blockhouse are among 91 Ministry of Defence sites now set to close - 35 were previously earmarked. The town's borough council said the loss of more than 1,000 sailors from the area would affect the economy. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon announced the closures on Monday. He the closures would deliver better value for money and release enough land across the UK to build 55,000 homes. It is also estimated that about Â£140m will be saved over the next decade by selling off the sites, which Sir Michael said would be reinvested in creating "areas of military expertise" in locations across the country, including a specialised infantry group in Aldershot. Leader of Gosport Borough Council, Mark Hook, said: "We are relieved the majority of jobs will remain in the area, but we'll lose the economic benefits of having more than 1,000 sailors based in the town." He admitted the authority could not stop the sale of the land, but said it would work to get the "best possible outcomes" for the town. He said it would be "seeking assurances" from the MoD that the sites could be redeveloped for business use. "We need to reduce the impact on the area by using these sites to create business spaces that will bring with them opportunities and jobs to benefit local people," he said. Unions have described the plans - which are part of a review of Ministry of Defence land - as "brutal" and have also promised to fight the closures.	The government will be lobbied by a Hampshire council over its plans to sell off an additional 56 defence sites by 2040.

Inflation, as measured by Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 0.1% in May, up from -0.1% in April. The biggest contribution to the rise came from transport, notably air fares, the Office for National Statistics said. In April, CPI inflation turned negative for the first time since 1960, mainly due to a drop in air and sea fares. ONS statistician Philip Gooding said: "Last month CPI turned negative, mainly because of falling transport fares due to the timing of Easter. This month, that fall has been reversed." He added that the falls in food and fuel costs over the past year "have eased this month, helping to push inflation up". While the prices of food and fuel rose in May from the previous month, the prices were still lower than a year earlier. However, while the overall effect of food and fuel on CPI inflation pulled the rate down by about 0.5 percentage points in May, this was less pronounced than the month before when the prices had a negative effect of 0.7 percentage points. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that "seasonal factors surrounding the timing of the Easter holiday were at work in last month's figures - CPI inflation was pushed down by cheaper air fares relative to last year. Now those factors have dropped out of the calculation we are back where we started." Negative inflation "proved both marginal and fleeting", said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. "We doubt that deflation will recur in the UK, although it cannot be completely ruled out if oil prices take a renewed appreciable downward lurch," he said. Nevertheless, inflationary pressures "remained limited in May and core inflation was still only 0.9% after hitting a 14-year low of 0.8% in April," Mr Archer added. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said that CPI inflation measure could briefly turn negative again during the summer. "Petrol prices, having rallied earlier in the year, have stabilised lately, while today's producer prices data indicates that there are no inflationary pressures coming along the supply chain," Mr Beck said. In May Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, a separate measure which includes housing costs, was 1%, up from 0.9% in April. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he expects inflation to remain low in the short term. The Bank expects near-zero inflation to help the UK economy by boosting the spending power of households. Chancellor George Osborne said "a powerful mix of low prices and rising wages" was "good news for working people and family budgets". Nevertheless, he said: "Of course the job is not done and we will continue to remain vigilant to all risks, particularly when the global economic situation is so uncertain." Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Shabana Mahmood, said that despite the low level of inflation, "many households are still struggling to pay the bills". "We need stronger action now to raise productivity to deliver sustainable growth and rising living standards," she said.	Transport costs helped the UK's inflation rate turn positive in May after one month of negative inflation.
European Space Propulsion (ESP) Limited blamed disappointing sales for going into liquidation. Formed by Aerojet Rocketdyne in 2012, it operated from missile maker Thales UK's factory in Castlereagh. Its offices were opened by the former First Minister Peter Robinson. He had expressed delight the US company had selected Belfast as its European sales base. But it never got near its projected Â£13m annual turnover. A spokesman for the firm said: "We had high hopes, just like the Northern Ireland ministers did. "We thank them for their support but unfortunately expected sales just never materialised." As recently as December, then Economy Minister Jonathan Bell talked of ESP as having "brought significant benefits to Northern Ireland". Employee numbers never got above eight.	An American-owned aerospace firm attracted to Belfast by Invest NI and backed by the  Northern Ireland Executive is ending its local operation.
The adapted artwork for the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album is worth about ??70,000. It was created to celebrate the success of the record - released in June 1967 - for Christmas of that year. The artwork is one of five Beatles album sleeves to feature in the top 10, compiled by Record Collector magazine. Sir Peter Blake's original Sgt Pepper collage was doctored to replace the faces of The Beatles and other notable figures with those of executives from the band's US label Capitol. Only about 100 are thought to have been made. 'Main attraction' In second place, valued at ??7,000, are the first 10 numbered copies of the Beatles' self-titled 1968 record, which became known as The White Album because of its plain white cover. The band's name was embossed on the front of the sleeve, which was designed by pop artist Richard Hamilton, along with a unique stamped serial number. In third position was a pair of sleeves designed by Andy Warhol. Madrigals' 1953 work Magic Key To Spanish Volumes 1 and 2, and spoken word anti-crime lecture The Nation's Nightmare, from 1951, have been valued at ??3,500 and ??3,000 respectively. At number four was the bizarre US-released compilation album Jolly What! England's Greatest Recording Stars: The Beatles and Frank Ifield on Stage. The 1964 album, featuring the songs of both the Fab Four and crooner Ifield, is valued at ??3,000. The Beatles  were also in eighth place for the original album sleeve created for the US release of their Yesterday And Today record in 1966, which is valued at ??2,000. Known as "the butcher sleeve" because it featured the musicians posing with dismembered doll parts and slabs of meat, it was quickly withdrawn from the US market. List compiler Ian Shirley, editor of the Rare Record Price Guide 2012, said: "While pristine records and inserts are vital to securing a top price, the numbered sleeve is the main attraction. "The hunger to collect low numbers remains undiminished amongst Beatles fans."	A Beatles sleeve which features the faces of music executives in place of the Fab Four has been named the world's rarest album cover.
The company said it had faced a "chorus of music label representatives and artists" accusing it of "mistreating" songwriters and performers. Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said YouTube gave musicians "new revenue streams". The row comes as the video-sharing website renews its agreements with major record labels. Prominent voices in the music industry have accused YouTube of paying low royalties for music video streams and turning a blind eye to copyright infringement. In March, the Recording Industry Association of America said YouTube paid "meagre" royalties when compared to subscription music services such as Apple Music and Spotify. On Monday, music manager Irving Azoff, formerly in charge of Ticketmaster and who now represents artists such as Christina Aguilera, said artists were paid a "pittance" on the advertising-funded site. In an open letter, he said YouTube did not allow musicians to put their tracks behind its YouTube Red pay-wall to earn more revenue. He also accused YouTube of "hiding behind" a so-called "safe harbour" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which stops websites being held responsible for copyright infringement by users, in some circumstances. Trying to keep copyright music off YouTube was "an impossible, expensive game of 'whack-a-mole'," he said. "When the artist sends a 'take down' it should be a 'stay down'." YouTube said comparing subscription services to free advertising-funded websites was "like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi". In a blog post, the company said it paid "a majority" - more than 50% - of its advertising income to content creators and the music industry. However, it added that the average YouTube user listened to only one hour of music a month, compared to the 55 hours a month it said Spotify subscribers consumed. The company said its Content ID technology could detect when copyright music was uploaded to the website and automatically dealt with 99.5% of copyright claims. It said record labels had the choice of whether to earn advertising revenue from unauthorised uploads or have them blocked indefinitely, and that half of the $3bn (Â£2bn) it had paid out to the music industry came from monetising these "unauthorised uploads" by the public. Income from its subscription service YouTube Red, available in the US, was shared with content creators and musicians in the same way as advertising revenue. YouTube has been separately criticised by video-makers who say Content ID does not respect the "fair use" of television and film extracts, which is protected by a provision of the DMCA. It has attempted to address the problem by allowing disputed videos to earn advertising revenue which is kept until the correct copyright holder can be identified. Hank Green, co-founder of the world's biggest online video convention VidCon, described YouTube's Content ID technology as a "win-win" situation for record labels. "[Record labels] can take the video down, or they can claim the revenue for themselves... this is not an expensive game of 'whack-a-mole', it's 100% automated," he wrote in a reply to Mr Azoff. "They've been given a new 10-figure revenue stream of claimed fan creations that they never would have had without YouTube." Singer Dave Giles, a regular performer at YouTube events, said musicians did benefit from advertising-supported streams on the video site. "It was interesting that when Taylor Swift took her songs off Spotify, she kept them on YouTube," he told the BBC. "If it wasn't really helping her career, surely she should have taken them off there as well. "Spotify might be paying more per stream than YouTube, but they have more subscribers. There's an argument that YouTube should be doing more to push its subscription model, but they are still rolling it out. "It's still more than artists get on Facebook. Where's Mr Azoff's email about that? Why is YouTube facing the rap and Facebook not?"	A prominent online video star has defended YouTube in a row over the way the site treats musicians.
Joshua knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to add the WBA world heavyweight title to his IBF crown at Wembley Stadium last weekend. Afterwards the Englishman was hailed as "the biggest sports star in Britain". "Nothing would make us happier than having a Joshua fight at some point," Phillips told BBC Radio Wales Sport. Phillips says the stadium's roof - the only one of its kind in the United Kingdom - ensures the home of Welsh rugby can be used at anytime. "The stadium is an asset that we want to use," he continued. "When we're not playing rugby on it, we want to use it as much as we can so we've sort of driven that quite hard this year with concerts." Speedway, rugby league, football and boxing have all taken centre stage there and Phillips says talks are continuing with NFL chiefs over the possibility of hosting American Football. Joshua's stunning win over Klitschko added to his appeal and Tyson Fury has accepted the prospect of an all-British title bout. Welsh boxing legend Joe Calzaghe beat Mikkel Kessler in front of an estimated 50,000 fans at what was then named Millennium Stadium in November, 2007 Phillips, the joint stadium and Welsh Rugby Union chief executive, added: "We're in conversations with various boxing promoters. Find out how to get into boxing with our special guide. "Obviously the roof - we are the only big stadium with a roof - and it's been done before, obviously, with Calzaghe and so on, previously.

The "cradle of the Arab Spring" will this time see officials of the former government taking part in the election, prompting interim President Moncef Marzouki to call it a contest between "supporters of the revolution and supporters of the counter-revolution". The system is based on proportional representation, with each of the country's regions having a fixed number of seats based on population. Lists of candidates are drawn up by parties, coalitions and independents and endorsed by the overseeing body, the Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE). Some five million Tunisians have registered to vote. Candidates must be aged 23 or over and have held Tunisian nationality for at least 10 years. According to ISIE, 49% of newly-registered voters are women. And the 26 January 2014 constitution introduced - for the first time in the Arab world - parity between men and women in elections. The law stipulates that women should comprise 50% of all electoral lists and there must be an equal number of lists headed by women and men. Tunisian women take a 'step backwards' Tunisia's election process means that no party is likely to win a majority of seats in the renamed National Assembly. However, political observers agree - in the absence of opinion polls, which are banned during the campaign - that the favourites are the Islamist Ennahda Movement and their secular opponents, the liberal Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia's Call). A number of other parties are in contention, including the centre-ground secular Congress for the Republic (CPR) and secular Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberty (FDTL or Ettakatol) and those led by former officials of Ben Ali's regime. Most candidates claim to have the economy at the heart of their campaign, realising that poverty and unemployment were the main factors that triggered the 14 January revolution in 2011. Ennahda won 89 of 217 seats in 2011 and led a coalition government with CPR and FDTL. It lost power in January following street protests but hopes to make a comeback. It has said it is willing to form a coalition with any other party. Nidaa Tounes wants to rally nationalist and liberal supporters to weaken the position of Ennahda. It was founded by Beji Caid Essebsi, a former transitional prime minister, and enjoys the support of the Tunisian General Labour Union and some business groups. Nidaa says it will not contemplate any coalition with Ennahda until that groups "clarifies" its relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East and North Africa. Congress for the Republic (CPR) is led by interim President Marzouki and won 29 seats in 2011. Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties was founded in 1994 by National Constituent Assembly Speaker Mustapha Ben Djaafar. It won 20 seats in 2011. Popular Front is a coalition of five left-wing and Baathist parties led by Hamma Hammami. It played an important role in mobilising street protests to bring down two Ennahda-led governments. The Front parties, however, do not seem to have significant electoral support. The al-Qaeda-affiliated Okba Ibn Nafaa battalion, active on Tunisia's border with Algeria, has threatened to disrupt the election. Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou has said his ministry has plans in hand to deal with the "terrorist" threat, which he described as "serious". Tunisia is to mobilize 50,000 security officers and nearly 20,000 soldiers to secure the election. Tunisians have shown only "lukewarm interest", according to al-Jazeera TV on 20 October. Tunisian academic Abdellatif Hanachi told al-Jazeera that this is partly because of the difficult economic and social conditions in the country. He added that voter apathy was due to a "sense of frustration" among a broad section of people at the failure to fulfil revolutionary promises. However, he concluded that this could all change on polling day, as it did in 2011. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Tunisians vote on 26 October in a parliamentary election, which they hope will see the end of a nearly-four year transition period which followed the ousting of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.
Wayne Madsen (70) batted well before the innings stalled in the twilight, as the pink ball swung more. Marchant de Lange (3-82) and Timm van der Gugten (3-88) were particularly dangerous while Graham Wagg weighed in with two wickets. But Derbyshire flourished in the last session through Daryn Smit (41) and Tom Milnes (53). Much of the day's action was played under thick cloud cover and wicket-keeper Chris Cooke snaffled five catches as the seamers found plenty of movement. Meanwhile Derbyshire's 16 year-old Afghan-born spinner Hamidullah Qadri, who made 11 not out, is the first Championship player to have been born in the new Millennium. Glamorgan coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport: "It's different, certainly I've very open-minded to see how it pans out. After 40 overs, it seemed to get some swing, but I put it down to good bowling rather than conditions. "If the ECB and world cricket are serious about making pink-ball, day-night four-day and Test match cricket a thing of the future, we have to play more of it to get people used to it," Wicket-keeper Chris Cooke added: "The pink ball played pretty well and we'll see how good that score is, but it showed there was a bit in it for both bat and ball under lights. "Marchant bowled excellently in that (second session) spell and Waggy with him when the lights came on, but Tom Milnes showed you could definitely bat under lights. It's new for everyone so it's whoever adapts quickest might have the edge." Derbyshire batsman Wayne Madsen told BBC Radio Derby: "It's different having to change routines but we adapted to it quite well, it's a pretty good score we've put on the board considering the conditions, particularly in that middle session where we lost a few wickets and they bowled really well. "I felt really good at the crease, they've got a decent four-pronged attack and it was a good challenge but conditions when it got overcast made it a lot harder to bat and our guys who came in (later) did a fantastic job."	Derbyshire recovered well to 288 all out against Glamorgan, who reached 5-0 at the close in the day-night game.
A controversial firmware change made earlier this month meant HP printer owners using unofficial, usually cheaper, cartridges discovered they would no longer work. A campaign calling on HP to reverse the move was launched, backed by rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In a blog post, HP admitted it should have done a "better job of communicating” the change. An optional update that removes the restriction on unofficial cartridges will be available “within two weeks”. The firm added: “We are committed to transparency in all of our communications and when we fall short, we call ourselves out." But while making the apology for how it informed users, HP defended the move, saying it did so to protect users from counterfeit products. "When ink cartridges are cloned or counterfeited, the customer is exposed to quality and potential security risks, compromising the printing experience,” wrote Jon Flaxman, the company’s chief operating officer. However, campaigners argued HP’s motivation was less about security, and more about protecting the large profit margins it adds to official ink cartridges. As consumers took to online forums and social networks to express anger, the EFF came down hard, saying HP had betrayed the public's trust. "Customers should be able to buy an HP printer without fear that the company will later place artificial limits on the printer’s use,” the group said. "It would be a security nightmare for customers to avoid installing security updates for fear of unwanted and unannounced feature changes." It also called on HP to explain how it planned to tell customers who may have been affected about the revised update. "Right now,” the EFF said, “the vast majority of people who use the affected printers likely do not know why their printers lost functionality, nor do they know that it’s possible to restore it. "All of those customers should be able to use their printers free of artificial restrictions, not just the relatively few who have been closely following this story."

Jerome Lavrilleux said the former president was not aware of the "slip". It comes after a lawyer for an event organiser accused the UMP of ordering almost 11m euros ($15m; Â£9m) worth of fake invoices to cover overspends. Reports say the scandal could damage the party and complicate any efforts by Mr Sarkozy to be re-elected. Police searched the headquarters of the UMP in Paris on Monday afternoon. "There have been anomalies," Mr Lavrilleux, a deputy director of Mr Sarkozy's 2012 presidential campaign, told France's BFM TV. with tears in his eyes. "There was no wrongdoing, there was a terrible spiral, a train going at high speed and people who should have pulled the emergency alarm and didn't, and I was probably one of them," he said. He said Mr Sarkozy, UMP Chairman Jean-Francois Cope and Batien Millot, the founder of the events company Bygmalion, were not aware of the actions taken. It comes after Patrick Maisonneuve, the lawyer for Bygmalion, told the same television station that the centre-right UMP had ordered fake invoices to cover exploding campaign costs. He said it was made clear to Bygmalion that if it did not comply, it would not be paid. The UMP's chairman was already facing growing speculation that he will have to step down after the French newspaper Liberation reported this month that the party paid some 20m euros to a unit of Bygmalion, founded by two associates of Mr Cope, to organise campaign events. Mr Cope told BMF TV earlier on Monday that he knew nothing of any wrongdoing. He said he had put his trust in the people who were responsible for the party's accounts and did not think he had to look over their shoulders. Mr Cope was already expected to face challenges for the leadership of the party after the UMP's poor result in the European Parliament elections. It came second to the far-right Front National. Mr Sarkozy, who lost the presidency to Francois Hollande in 2012, is rumoured to be preparing to make a comeback in 2017. He has not commented on the scandal over his 2012 campaign finances.	A senior member of France's opposition UMP party has admitted there were "anomalies" in the accounts of Nicolas Sarkozy's 2012 presidential campaign.
Kim Wall, 30, was last seen on Thursday evening on board the vessel with the owner, 46-year-old Peter Madsen. The submarine later sank and Mr Madsen was rescued before being arrested and charged with manslaughter. The stricken vessel, the Nautilus, has been raised but no body was found and the search for Ms Wall goes on. Mr Madsen initially said that he dropped Ms Wall off before it sank but police say he has now changed his statement - although they have not said what to. Police gave no other information on why they thought the Nautilus was deliberately sunk, but it contradicts Mr Madsen's explanation that there was a technical fault. Mr Madsen has denied involvement in Ms Wall's death, and will be held in custody for 24 days while investigations continue. Ms Wall's boyfriend first reported her missing after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip on the submarine. She had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Police are still appealing for witnesses who may have seen Ms Wall on Thursday evening. "We're still hoping that we'll find Kim Wall alive, but we are preparing  ourselves for the fact that she may not be," Copenhagen police homicide chief Jens Moller said.	Danish police believe that a submarine at the centre of an investigation into a missing Swedish journalist was deliberately sunk.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster's World Cup preparations suffered a blow as for the first 70 minutes a largely first-choice XV struggled to deal with French power. Two late tries flattered the visitors, who have one game left before launching their World Cup campaign against Fiji on 18 September. "We gave away penalties and our discipline was shocking," said Robshaw. "Whether it was rust, or nerves, it wasn't good enough. Credit to France, they put us under pressure and made us make mistakes. "We gave too many penalties away, but in the second half we came out and played well but couldn't quite get over the line in the end," he told Sky Sports. "We can't give teams like France and other quality sides head starts like we did. "We'll look long and hard at ourselves, because we let ourselves down in the first half. We played well in phases but you can't wait for 40 minutes to do that." Late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard but Lancaster was left with much to ponder by a disappointing team display in the Stade de France. Media playback is not supported on this device The head coach, who must announce his final squad by 31 August, added: "We've got to get our discipline at the breakdown - we can't give France easy position like we did. We need to improve on that, because all the little mistakes add up. "The bench made a difference. It upped the energy levels and we scored some good tries. I won't gloss over what went on before that, because it was too little too late. "There are a few players who have given me food for thought, those guys who came on and gave us the energy we needed and made a difference. "I need to have a sleep on this game and think about my final squad. We're two weeks away from playing Ireland and four weeks away from Fiji in the World Cup and we'll expect a reaction next time." England host Ireland in their final World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham on 5 September. Fly-half Ford told Sky Sports: "I thought we might snatch that at the end but we had hardly any ball in the first half and gave away too many penalties. We played some good stuff in the second-half. "In the first half a lot of our undoing was down to ourselves. We just weren't good enough in that first half and there's no excuse for that. We let them build up the score and that made it hard for us. "It was frustrating and we had to think of ways to adapt and that was constantly going through our minds. We tried to get ourselves out of a hole. "We've got to turn up against Ireland now and make sure that we win. Our basics have got to be world class."	Captain Chris Robshaw blamed England's "shocking" first-half discipline for their 25-20 defeat by France in Paris.
Former Manchester City and Liverpool striker Balotelli, 26, protested at his treatment in a social media post. Plea said: "We heard monkey noises in the warm-up and during the game. A few supporters insulted him the whole game. Balotelli was very, very upset." Bastia released a statement on Saturday expressing surprise at the allegations. "Having never noticed nor been informed, either by the referees, the delegates or any member of Nice of any incident of this type, it is with surprise that our club discovered these accusations, which carry considerable harm to the image of our club as a whole," the Bastia statement said. French governing body Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) has announced an investigation into Balotelli's allegations. The Bastia statement added: "Taking note of the LFP announcement of an inquiry, our club is now at the disposal of the authorities so that all light is shed on this type of behaviour, which is by its nature stupid and unacceptable." Balotelli has scored 10 goals in 15 games for Nice since joining on a free transfer from Liverpool in August, two years after a £16m move to Anfield. In 2013 he suffered abuse from Roma fans while playing for AC Milan and threatened to walk off the pitch if he was subjected to it again.	Nice midfielder Alassane Plea has confirmed he heard racist abuse directed at team-mate Mario Balotelli during Friday's 1-1 draw at Bastia.
The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online. O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin. She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked. O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York. In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker". The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services. However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911." She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings.	US comedian and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell has revealed that she suffered a heart attack last week.
Tshibola, 20, came through the Royals' academy system and signed his first professional contract last summer. He made his professional debut against Nottingham Forest in August. Bingham, 21, joined Mansfield from Wigan Athletic in the summer and has scored four goals in 20 games for the Stags in all competitions. Pools are awaiting clearance from the Football Association and the Football League for the duo to feature against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.	Hartlepool United have signed Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola on a one-month loan deal and Mansfield striker Rakish Bingham on a season-long loan.
Juhel Miah had flown to Reykjavik, Iceland, with the party from Llangatwg Community before boarding an onward flight to New York. But before the plane took off on 16 February, he was escorted off by security staff. BBC Wales has asked the US Embassy in London to comment. Neath Port Talbot council has written to the US Embassy to "express its dismay" at the treatment of Mr Miah, who the local authority said had a valid visa to travel. The school trip continued as planned but Mr Miah's removal left pupils and colleagues "shocked and distressed," a spokesman said. "We are appalled by the treatment of Mr Miah and are demanding an explanation. "The matter has also been raised with our local MP." The council confirmed Mr Miah has a British passport and does not have dual nationality. His family's ethnic background is Bangladeshi. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was "providing support to a British man who was prevented from boarding a flight in Reykjavik". Mr Miah, who teaches maths at the 700-pupil school, was also denied access to the US Embassy in Reykjavik, the spokesman added. "No satisfactory reason has been provided for refusing entry to the United States - either at the airport in Iceland or subsequently at the embassy. "Understandably he feels belittled and upset at what appears to be an unjustified act of discrimination." On 27 January, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions and temporarily barring people from seven Muslim-majority countries, sparking numerous protests and legal challenges. A week later a federal judge in Seattle suspended it nationwide - a ruling which was later upheld at an appeals court hearing in San Francisco. Mr Trump is now considering a revised plan. Abdul-Azim Ahmed, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Wales, said he was "deeply troubled" by the incident. "What we do know is quite troubling and in the context of a school trip and the children being left with one less teacher because of this," he said. "This is the latest in a series of incidents where Muslims have been denied entry to the US which date before even Trump was elected." The school party returned to the UK on Monday after the week-long trip.	A Muslim teacher from Neath Port Talbot has been denied entry to the United States while on a school trip.
Caroline Wootton-Thomas, 49, forged colleague's signatures on cheques and transferred cash to a bank account she set up in her mother's name. She used the council's Child Protection Unit petty cash fund for debts, expensive gifts and luxury holidays. A Cardiff Crown Court jury convicted Wootton-Thomas, of Newport, of theft and transferring criminal property. The court heard she had asked to be put in charge of the petty cash fund which was meant to be used to cover fuel and parking costs. The grandmother was caught after a bank statement was sent to the wrong department. She denied any wrongdoing and blamed her colleagues for stealing the money, which the jury rejected. Matthew Roberts, prosecuting, said Wootton-Thomas had shown an "arrogance" which culminated in her mother also being charged with money laundering, though she was cleared at trial. Judge Neil Bidder said: "You have manipulated your mother in the most unscrupulous way. You took out a loan in her name to pay off your debts. "I've observed fake tears and not a jot of remorse for casting suspicion against other members of your team. "I regard the fact this money was reserved for vulnerable children to be an aggravating factor." A hearing in May will set out how she will be able to pay back the money.	A Cardiff council worker who stole £35,000 from a children's fund has been jailed for two and a half years.
Students were asked to trace Arabic calligraphy in an exercise some parents said amounted to indoctrination. Officials said the schools were closed out of an "abundance of caution" and there were no specific safety threats. School administrators say a different lesson will be used in the future. One week ago, students at Riverheads High School were studying the Middle East and were asked to trace a piece of Arabic calligraphy that translated to: "There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah". Some pupils refused the assignment and parents accused the teacher of indoctrination. Officials with the Augusta County school district were quick to point out that the study of a region's religion and language are included in geography lessons. However, anger built up and by Wednesday complaints had become so numerous that the school's doors were locked and monitored. By Friday, the messages - described as profane and hateful - had increased and the decision was made to close the schools. Officials said that no specific threats were received, but law enforcement officials and the school district board recommended the closure because they were being cautious. The lesson was intended to illustrate the complexity of the Arabic language, they said, and not meant to promote any religious system. But future classes will use a different, non-religious example of Arabic. The decision to close the schools has drawn criticism as well. "It looks like fear wins again," a resident told the News Virginian newspaper. On the paper's Facebook account, locals have been debating the closure with one man saying, "our patriot forefathers are rolling in their graves," and another rhetorically posting, "how do these terrified people leave their houses every day?"	A school district in the US state of Virginia has closed all schools on Friday after a geography lesson that included Islam sparked vociferous complaints from around the country.
The port at Invergordon is providing space for storing parts for the turbines and also office accommodation. The Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited is being constructed in the Moray Firth at a cost of Â£2.6bn. Energy firm SSE is among the scheme's investors. A total of 84 turbines are to be installed by Seaway Heavy Lifting. The Nigg Energy Park, also on the Cromarty Firth, is also being used for the construction of the wind farm. Fife-based Burntisland Fabrications Ltd (BiFab) is manufacturing offshore jacket substructures for the scheme at its yards in Arnish on the Isle of Lewis and Burntisland and Methil in Fife.	Port of Cromarty Firth has secured two contracts related to the construction of a massive offshore wind farm in the Outer Moray Firth.
Nick Hardwick said staff shortages, population pressures and prison policy all contributed to problems, with a 69% rise in self-inflicted deaths. The Ministry of Justice said there was no evidence linking the rise in such deaths to government policy. Presenting his annual report, Mr Hardwick also pointed to problems involving so-called legal highs. He highlighted the growing availability of the drugs as a cause of debt, bullying and health problems, warning their use had grown sharply. According to the HM Inspectorate of Prisons annual report, cannabis substitutes Spice and Black Mamba were particular "causes for concern" in more than a third of the jails inspected. It says current mandatory random drug testing does not detect legal highs and reduced staffing had made some "suspicion" testing programmes "virtually inoperable". Mr Hardwick said profits for prisoners selling legal highs outstripped other drugs because they sold for 10 times as much as they would outside jail. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: "We all want prisoners to come out of prison less likely to commit offences than when they went in and if they [prisons] are not safe places where people aren't working and are not doing rehabilitation activities, then that's not going to happen." But warning cracks in the system had "widened", Mr Hardwick's report said: "Of most concern, the number of self-inflicted deaths rose by 69% from 52 in 2012-13 to 88 in 2013-14, the highest figure in 10 years." The term "self-inflicted deaths" includes suicides and any death as a result of the prisoner's own actions. Bullying was a factor in "many cases", the report said, warning that adult male prisons were becoming "more violence every year". Andrew Selous, the Conservative prisons minister, said it had been a "challenging year" for prisons staff dealing with "major organisational change". But he added: "During this time we have always had enough staff to deliver decent and safe prison regimes, and this will continue to be our top priority. "We remain committed to reducing violence and understanding the reasons for the recent rise in self-inflicted deaths. "But this is a complex issue and the chief inspector has failed to provide any evidence to support his assertion that this is linked to the reforms made under this government." Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the report "lays bare the deteriorating conditions in our jails under David Cameron's government" and showed ministers were "burying their heads in the sand". "The government should be alarmed at reports of prisoners idling away their time in their cells rather than being on courses or working," he added. "It does nothing to improve rehabilitation and puts the safety of communities at risk from unreformed prisoners drifting back into a life of crime and creating more needless victims." Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: "This report spells out in painstaking detail the mounting challenges faced by prisons and gives the lie to repeated assertions by the Ministry of Justice that the system is not in crisis. "If prisoners are spending most of their days locked up in their cells doing nothing, while regimes are violent and wracked with drug abuse, then how can we magically expect people to be safer citizens when they are released? He added: "The end result will only be more crime and more victims of crime."	There has been a "rapid deterioration" in prison safety in England and Wales, the prisons inspector has warned.
Laser mapping will be used to measure the impact of extreme weather on six Welsh islands in the Irish sea. The aircraft beams will assess the effect of rising sea levels and storms on locations, including Bardsey and Ramsey islands. The mapping will also create "stunning" animations as part of the first 3D data for many of the islands. Led by the Royal Commission of the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, the five-year project will assess the damage done to archaeology and heritage sites by coastal erosion. "This is an exciting new project, bringing a strong partnership of archaeologists, geoscientists and maritime specialists to bear on the significant challenges posed by climate change," said commission secretary Christopher Catling.	Animation showing the threat of climate change is on the horizon, thanks to new 3D laser mapping.
His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: "I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one." On bird flu: "I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama." On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: "After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine." Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: "Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem." On being sacked: "If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later." On Chelsea's pitch: "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed." On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: "If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message," Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: "If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood." Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: "My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: "When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer." Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: "I find Jose's 'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. "It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation." Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: "Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him." Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: "It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football." February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined £8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an "enemy of football" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined £5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of "fault and fault and cheat and cheat" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined £200,000, which is reduced to £75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation. December 2010: Mourinho is banned for one Champions League match after being found guilty of improper conduct. It follows the dismissal of Real Madrid players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during a Champions League game against Ajax. August 2011: Mourinho, now in charge of Real Madrid, pokes Barcelona's then-assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye during touchline exchanges after a stormy Spanish Super Cup tie. January 2013: After dropping club captain Iker Casillas before the mid-winter break, reports emerge in the Spanish press of disagreements between Mourinho and some of his senior players. Stories continue to appear throughout the rest of the season about disharmony in the squad, with centre-back Pepe the latest to fall foul of Mourinho last month. May 2013: In a bad-tempered Copa del Rey final defeat by neighbours Atletico Madrid, Mourinho is sent from the bench for furiously protesting a decision from the referee. He was jeered by sections of the Real support during his final game in charge against Osasuna.	Jose Mourinho is back as manager of Chelsea after leaving Stamford Bridge in September 2007.
The Tories won 37 of 64 seats to claim a majority and wipe out Labour's 22-seat majority from 2013. Labour picked up 24 seats this time around, the Liberal Democrats won three and UKIP finished with none. Towns where seats turned from red to blue included Swadlincote, Matlock, Glossop, Buxton, Ripley, Belper and Ilkeston. Turnout was 38%. Election 2017: Full results from across England Conservative leader Barry Lewis described the result as "brilliant". "We didn't think at this point in the electoral cycle we'd be taking control of Derbyshire County Council," he said. "We fought a really good campaign on local issues and I think that's really helped. We got our manifesto out early and really hit the doorsteps." This was Labour's last stand - its last county council to be defended in England. And its defences have proven to be weak. The Conservatives have won across the south and centre of the county - in places like Heanor, Ilkeston and Ripley. They've also taken seats off the Lib Dems. And it was a bad night too for UKIP - their share of the vote in Derbyshire collapsed.	The Conservatives have taken control of Derbyshire County Council with a massive swing from Labour.
New Zealand-born Solomona, 23, will be available for Eddie Jones' side later this year after playing in England for the past 36 months. He left rugby league when he switched codes to join Sale Sharks in December. "He's scoring better than anyone in recent times. He's a revelation," Monye told BBC Radio 5 live. "Is he good enough for England, based on what I've seen? Most definitely. "The beauty of English rugby at the moment means we've got so many quality players and out of nowhere in the few months we've unearthed another potential international. It's a fantastic position for Eddie Jones to be in." Solomona won a rugby league cap for Samoa last year, but that would not affect him meeting residency criteria for the 15-a-side code. After successful spells with London Broncos and Castleford Tigers, including a record-breaking 40 tries in a single season, Solomona has caught the eye since joining Sale with seven tries in five Premiership games. "He's a natural-born finisher, his try against Northampton was the best finish you'll see from any winger this season," said Monye, who believes the British and Irish Lions summer Tests in New Zealand and Argentina could be a good way to introduce Solomona to international rugby. Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond has echoed Monye's thought, saying that Solomona has the "world at his feet". Diamond added: "He understands the game. His spell in rugby league did him no harm. He got his basic skills up and comes to the party a top-drawer professional. I'd be looking at him if I was Eddie Jones." Solomona's departure from Cas was acrimonious and the Super League club are taking legal action against the player, his agent and Sale.	Former England winger Ugo Monye believes Denny Solomona has a good chance of playing for the national team when he becomes eligible.
The Ibrox club opened their Premiership account with a win at Motherwell and followed that up with a 6-0 thumping of Dunfermline in the League Cup. "It is always important to build on winning. They are believing in themselves as a team," Caixinha said ahead of Hibs' visit on Saturday. "I am a guy who chases perfection, but when I get it I want more." Alfredo Morelos netted twice in the demolition of Dunfermline, with Bruno Alves and Daniel Candeias also scoring maiden Rangers goals in a one-sided contest. "One of the major parts of football is enjoyment," added Caixinha. "I felt freedom from the team. The early second goal helped, but the players worked hard to get it. "It's just a good start. We want more. We want to keep progressing. "I believe you need to be focused at all times, with a strong mentality and team spirit. "The boys are doing well but we still have a long journey in front of us." Rangers and Hibs last met in the top flight in 2012, while the most recent contest came in the 2016 Scottish Cup final. A stoppage-time header from David Gray gave Hibs a dramatic 3-2 win at Hampden but Caixinha insists he is not interested in using previous pain as a motivation. "Football is a moment, there are no two games played the same way," he explained. "The contest is different, what was to be fought for is totally different, so we just want to focus on the three points that we want to take, that's all. "My concern is to prepare the team, recover the players and make them ready for a strong start at 3pm on Saturday." Meanwhile, the Rangers manager revealed that club captain Lee Wallace will have a scan on a leg injury. Lee Hodson was drafted in as a late replacement for Wednesday's victory over Dunfermline at Ibrox.	Pedro Caixinha has urged his Rangers players to continue their winning start to the season against Hibernian.
Clarkson, 30, joined Premiership Well for a second spell in July and could make his St Mirren debut in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday. He scored nine goals at Dundee last season and has featured mainly as a substitute so far this term. "I'm ready, I've been fit all season and I'm as fit as I've ever been," Clarkson told the St Mirren website. "I've been playing games, playing for the U20s and I like to keep my match fitness up. "I've been training hard and making sure that when my time came, wherever it may be, that I was ready and match fit and hopefully up to speed with everyone else really. I'm looking forward to getting started." Capped twice for Scotland in 2008 and with one international goal to his name, Clarkson has made almost 400 senior appearances at club level. His previous teams include Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers. St Mirren are eighth in the Championship, seven points clear of bottom side Alloa. "Obviously the game on Saturday, every game is a big game, and the more games we can win the more confidence we can get from that we can hopefully go on a run of games and push up the table and try to get the club back to where it has been," added Clarkson. For all the latest transfers check out our transfer deals page.	St Mirren have signed Motherwell forward David Clarkson on a loan deal until the end of the season.
Sir Richard Leese is a senior figure in the drive to unite the north of England as an economic force. North Wales could benefit from better transport links and growth potential and the Welsh government had been supporting the development, he said. But Sir Richard also said the region "needed more freedom". "Devolution to Wales has to go beyond the Welsh assembly," he told the BBC's Wales At Work programme. "I'd argue Cardiff and its city region ought to be able to do some of the things we're doing in Greater Manchester. "North Wales again needs to be given more power by the Welsh assembly to enable it to work better with us in the north of England." "From the discussions I've had in north Wales, the growth potential is enormous but it's more likely to be realised if we can work out those synergies between what's happening in north Wales and just the other side of the border. "They need to be given the freedom by the Welsh assembly to do that." The cities of the "Northern Powerhouse" stretch from Manchester and Liverpool to Sheffield, Leeds and Hull and up to Newcastle and Sunderland in the north east. Radical improvements to transport connections over the next 15 to 20 years could create a single labour market and "virtual city" of 15 million in the north of England, which could provide an economic counter-balance to London. Sir Richard, who is also chair of the Core Cities cabinet which includes Cardiff, said north Wales could also benefit from that and there was a recognition in Cardiff Bay that the links between north Wales and northern England were more important than those with south Wales. Sir Richard said energy production, advanced manufacturing and health innovation and digital industries were not just based in the urban cores and some of these sectors already existed in north Wales. "North Wales has the opportunity to play into and contribute to those sectoral strengths of the north of England. "For industry in north Wales its route to market is through the North of England. So what we're do to improve transport connections, there's a shared interest in extending that beyond the north of England." He said care had to be taken with comparisons, as Wales had the same population as Greater Manchester but he said areas like transport and business support might benefit from greater devolution within Wales. Tracy North, chair of the CBI in north Wales said company owners and managers wanted to be involved with the Northern Powerhouse but there was not an obvious body or mechanism for doing so. "The CBI wants the next Welsh government to create a regional development corporation for north Wales," she said. "It would need to be set up immediately after the election. It would have funding and staff, run in partnership with business and be unencumbered by local red tape. "This way, the north Wales region can act independently to optimise economic opportunities, without going through the impracticality of discussing and voting on devolution, which would out of necessity take years and years." A Wales Office spokesman said it was committed to delivering a fundamental shift of power from Westminster to the people and communities of this country and wanted the Welsh government to "have the same confidence and faith in Wales". "Only by giving local areas the powers and freedom they need can we further drive economic growth and create the jobs and investment opportunities this country needs," he said. The Welsh government said: "As part of the Mersey Dee Alliance, we already recognise the economic importance of cross border working and links. We will work with the UK Government to ensure north Wales has full potential to exploit the maximum economic advantage from any Northern Powerhouse proposals."	North Wales needs more devolution if it is to fully benefit from the "northern powerhouse," Manchester city council's leader has said.
Wales in the 13th Century was a mixture of regional powers. By the middle of the previous century, most of the lowland areas, particularly in south Wales, were under English control, in the form of Anglo-Norman barons from the Marches and across Glamorganshire to Pembroke. Gwynedd and the north-west of Wales remained largely independent. Welsh princes acknowledged the ruler Llywelyn the Great and his successor Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as the overarching Prince of Wales. But as the century wore away, and Edward I of England came to power, the balance of power changed as Llywelyn refused to pay tribute to Edward. In 1276 Edward I led an invasion into Gwynedd and forced Llywelyn into the very top corner of the country, and set about his castle-building programme. An uprising in 1282 led to renewed fighting, and saw the death of Llywelyn. By the following year it was over, and English domination over Wales was entrenched. Edward's son, the future Edward II, was created Prince of Wales. At the start of the 1200s, Welsh was the language of the common people. It was how people did business, conducted family life and worshipped. By the end of the century, daily business was increasingly done in English. English settlers were encouraged to move to Wales by free land grants and the imposition of English law. As the settlers moved into the more fruitful lowlands, Welsh speakers were increasingly pushed to the higher ground, although there was crossover between the two. One of the main changes through the course of the 13th Century was the difference in the way people paid for things. According to Dr Mark Redknap, head of collections and research in the history department at the Museum of Welsh Life, the old system of "render" was starting to change. "It's fair to say that from about the end of the 13th Century the Welsh were more familiar with using money than they had been a century earlier," he said. "You had an increasing use of coinage whereas there is very much a barter economy with the pre-Norman period, and payment in kind." He said taxes to the English king were paid in cash. Coinage though was still more at the stage where the actual weight of the coins, in silver for example, was what provided the value rather than a nominal amount printed on the coin. As well as tithes paid to the church, Llywelyn had tried to levy tax on cattle and in lieu of military service. But it was Edward I who pushed formalised tax collection. By the time of his death in 1307, tax revenue from Wales had tripled. According to Gerald of Wales, the Welsh were a militaristic society, more concerned with learning to fight rather than ploughing their land more than necessary. But this only applied to free men: about a third of the population at the start of the century were bonded to a lord and worked for them on large estates. The common people wore simple clothes: a tunic and thin cloak. Although much of Wales was rural, with large forests being an important source of food and resources for many, fledgling towns had been established by the Normans in places like Carmarthen and Cardiff and by the end of the century there were around 90 small towns, although few had populations over 1,000. It is worth remembering that the population of Wales was tiny in comparison to now, with the whole population equivalent to modern-day Cardiff.

Blades goalkeeper George Long saved Kyle Vassell's first-half spot kick. Billy Sharp then put the visitors ahead with a low shot, his 20th goal of the season, only for Abu Ogogo to level from Sullay Kaikai's cross. But Che Adams won it for United, who are four points outside the top six, firing in low from the edge of the box. Shrewsbury are now without a win in seven games, during which they have picked up just four points out of a possible 21. Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire: "If I'm absolutely honest, which I always try to be, I thought the only team that was going to score was us because we looked like we had the momentum. "But then a bit of slack defending from a throw-in and we got punished. It was hugely frustrating. "I couldn't fault much of the performance. We deserved much more than we got, but a bit of loose defending on two occasions cost us."	Sheffield United kept their slim League One play-off hopes alive by beating Shrewsbury Town, who are just two points above the relegation zone.
Cornwall Live said its journalists were told they could not broadcast the PM's visit via Facebook Live. The publication, owned by Trinity Mirror, took to social media to vent its frustrations. The Conservatives said the reporters' "last minute" request to film had "not been possible" because a pooled resource had already been agreed. Reporters and broadcasters are traditionally given a pooled resource for video, stills and text at such events. Read more on this story and others from Cornwall Cornwall Live sent two reporters and a photographer to cover the prime minister's visit to Helston. The reporters published a photo of the room they were held in while the PM was interviewed by other media. Editor Jacqui Merrington said they were "a lot more" than a local newspaper. "When we arrived... we were told we were not allowed to film anything because we were invited as print media, which seems a bit 20th Century really." She added: "We are digital media and that is the case for most local media nowadays and to be restricted on that basis seems very archaic." A spokesman for the Conservatives said Cornwall Live only made a request to film on the morning of the visit. "One media organisation's last minute request to add a camera to a pre-arranged pool of broadcast cameras was not possible this morning. "The organisation's journalists did interview the prime minister and their photographer accompanied [her] on a factory tour."	Website reporters covering Theresa May's visit to Cornwall have complained they were not allowed to film her.
The politician, who had secured his 2011 seat through the list vote, beat SNP candidate rival Roderick Campbell by 3,465 votes. Mr Rennie received 14,928 votes, an increase of 15% from 2011. He said: "It feels fantastic to have won North East Fife back for the Liberal Democrats. A big majority of 3,000 against a Nationalist tide." Mr Rennie added: "It's a tremendous result for the Liberal Democrats in North East Fife." In his victory speech, he said it had been a "positive, uplifting campaign" and added: "I've had the time of my life in this campaign." He appeared at the count with two toy pigs in his hand, a reference to a photo opportunity at farm while out on the campaign trail. Alex Cole-Hamilton, of the Liberal Democrats, also won Edinburgh Western from the SNP, with 16,645 votes - a 42% share. The party also comfortably held both Orkney and Shetland.	Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has taken the Fife North East seat from the SNP.
The 25-year-old wing has crossed codes from Super League side Wigan Warriors, in arguably the most high-profile switch since Sam Burgess' move to Bath. Burgess' time in union only lasted a year, but Chorley-born Charnley is hoping he can take to the game more naturally. "I just want to learn it and not have to ask where I should be stood. I just want to have it free-flowing," he told BBC Sport. Since his move to Sale was announced in March, Charnley has been to the AJ Bell Stadium to watch the team as much as possible. With his focus on league as a youngster, he did not grow up watching the Premiership, Six Nations or England internationals. "I've wanted to try union for a while," he added. "I've been lucky enough to be successful in league and achieve things that not many people can achieve so when the opportunity came to switch codes, I couldn't turn it down. "I've been watching a lot of games and analysing it. It is one of those where I need to watch as much as I can as I need to know what I need to be doing." Charnley said he was having to adapt to a different way of training and the pace of the game in union. "I was doing some clearing out the other day and it hurt my neck," Charnley said with a wry smile. "It is getting my body used to it. I'm used to running between two people and getting up and down and this is different. "It's good, it's a new challenge and I'm excited for it all." He signed off with his hometown club in the perfect way, scoring a try at the Grand Final at Old Trafford as Wigan beat Warrington 12-6 last month. His stats in rugby league were staggering - 165 tries in 176 appearances - and Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond does not want to suppress that natural ability to cross the whitewash. "We're not going to take away anything that he has already got, we can't enhance that at all at the moment," said 48-year-old ex-Sale hooker Diamond. "We have a good management structure here. We understand what we're bringing from one sport to another and the differences in the codes. "We have to settle him in; we don't want to rush him in. I think he will be nothing like the Sam Burgess affair that happened." There is a long line of Wigan players moving to union, and in recent times both Chris Ashton and Joel Tomkins have become cross-code internationals, but still the most successful was Jason Robinson's switch. England head coach Eddie Jones has spoken about Charnley as having the ability to join the list of players who have represented their country in both codes. "The potential is there, without a doubt," former Sharks and England winger Mark Cueto told North West Tonight. "You don't want to pile the pressure on him but he has the ability to do it, and I'm sure he will. "He has such a good career so far, so as a long as he does that in a Sale shirt then he is always going to have a sniff." Asked if he thought about running out at Twickenham, Charnley added: "Any player wants to play for their country. You want to put that jersey on. "If I'm lucky enough to be successful enough to get picked then it will be a nice thing on my CV."	Only two weeks after his first training session in rugby union, Josh Charnley will make his debut for Sale Sharks in Friday's Anglo-Welsh Cup game against Wasps.
The Fraser of Allander Institute reckons that growth this year will be 1.9%, the same as its forecast for last year, for which official data has not been finalised. That is a reduction on the 2.2% forecast for 2016 that it published in November. For 2017, the forecast has fallen from 2.5% to 2.2% in those past four months. The economists at the Strathclyde University institute warned that growth was too dependent on household spending based on credit, which they said was unsustainable. They explained that the benefits of cheaper oil had not fed through to the economy as strongly as the harm it had done to the energy sector itself. The sustained low price was further pulling back on investment plans. The economists argued that this month's Westminster budget should avoid a further squeeze on spending, as tax revenues appeared to fall short of previous expectations. Prof Brian Ashcroft, author of the regular Fraser of Allander reports, said that would slow growth further and worsen the flow of tax revenues to the exchequer. The report said that job creation should continue but forecasted a slower rate of growth. The central forecast for net employment increase was 36,800, whereas in November, it was 45,000. The report also warned of the effect of the UK being taken out of the European Union, following the referendum in June. It claimed the uncertainty about the outcome of the vote would have a negative effect on investment. Its analysis of the European choice was that "it is difficult to imagine that it would help improve Scotland's competitive position to our trade with the EU". It noted that the fall in electronics and other manufacturing exports had meant Scotland already found it hard to penetrate open EU markets. The Strathclyde report said Scottish exporters would find it more difficult if the trade arrangements were changed. Also, productivity could be slowed, when it was already relatively weak. The latest report from Fraser of Allander noted that the Scottish economy still benefited from low inflation and low interest rates and earning power had been increasing slowly. However, it reflected on the strength of Sterling, making imports cheaper and exports more difficult. That factor had weakened in recent weeks, though trade had been slowing globally. It said growth had been depending too much on rising and unsustainable household debt. Paul Brewer, a senior partner at PwC which sponsors the Fraser of Allander reports, said: "The potential for the forthcoming budget to exert further fiscal tightening, oil price uncertainty and the uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome of the EU referendum, together create a difficult environment for business and investor confidence." He suggested the UK Chancellor could help the economy with a further cut in tax on oil producers. At sector level, the analysis said the service sector was the driver of growth, although financial services showed little sign of recovery to pre-recession levels. The production sector had contracted in the most recent official data, and construction had ceased to be the driver that it was of Scottish growth.	Growth in the Scottish economy is failing to pick up pace, according to one of Scotland's main forecasters.
A judge is considering whether to charge the star over the incident, which was filmed and went viral. He will spend the night in detention and investigations will continue on Wednesday, a BBC reporter says. Olomide has denied assault, though he has since apologised for his behaviour. The Kenyan authorities deported the 60-year-old rumba singer and three of his dancers on Saturday to DR Congo's capital, Kinshasa, following a public outcry over the incident. The BBC's Poly Muzalia in Kinshasa says police officers arrived at the singer's home early on Tuesday morning and took him into custody. He was handcuffed, put into a police car and then taken to a court where a judge is considering whether he should be put on trial. His lawyer, Landry Tanganyi, told the BBC that Olomide, one of Africa's most popular musicians, should not be detained overnight as he was not a flight risk. However, Olomide left the courthouse under police escort and will spend the night at the police station, our reporter says. The Congolese musician has been in similar trouble in the past:	Musician Koffi Olomide has been taken into custody in the Democratic Republic of Congo, days after he was deported from Kenya for allegedly kicking one of his dancers at an airport in Nairobi.
The Grocer magazine reported that the firm is charging £2.64 for a 250g jar. It is the first supermarket to raise the price of Marmite since the recent dispute between Tesco and manufacturer Unilever over the effect of the falling pound on production costs. A Morrisons spokesman said: "Sometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising." Unilever has raised the wholesale price of many household products, including PG Tips tea and Pot Noodles, because falls in the value of sterling have increased the cost of products made outside the UK. The pound has lost nearly a fifth of its value since the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June. It is the world's worst-performing currency on the global money markets this year. This makes imported goods more expensive because they continue to cost the same in dollars or euros, but the price is higher when converted into sterling. Morrisons said it did its best to avoid putting prices up. It added: "More often than not we have been reducing prices and more than 3,000 products are currently cheaper in our supermarkets than they were last year." Tesco's row with Unilever broke out earlier this month and has since been resolved, according to both sides. However, the Grocer reported that both Tesco and Asda have raised prices on a number of Unilever products, and Morrisons has also increased the prices of other items made by the company. According to supermarket websites, a 250g pot of Marmite costs £2.64 at Morrisons, £2.50 at Sainsbury's, £2.35 at both Waitrose and Tesco and is on special at Asda for £2.	Supermarket chain Morrisons has increased the cost of a jar of Marmite by 12.5%, say retail industry experts.
Judge Michael Levanas said the $2bn sale could go ahead. Mr Sterling, 80, had been contesting his estranged wife Shelly's decision to sell the basketball team franchise to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Mr Sterling was banned from basketball for life after he was recorded making racist remarks in April. The Los Angeles court case focused on allegations that Mrs Sterling used medical tests of her husband's mental capacity to remove him as a member of the trust that owned the team, and deceived him into selling. Mr Sterling had originally agreed to the sale of the basketball team, but then revoked his blessing, saying he had been improperly removed from the trust. Mrs Sterling had told her husband to seek an evaluation by two doctors in May. The doctors declared him "mentally incapacitated" and unfit to administer his duties as trustee of the Sterling Family Trust. This in effect handed Mrs Sterling control of the Clippers. Judge Levanas of the California Superior Court said he found Mrs Sterling to be a more credible witness than her husband and that she had acted properly over the sale, the BBC's Peter Bowes in Los Angeles reports. He said that Mrs Sterling "had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the team". Mrs Sterling burst into tears as the ruling was delivered after the nine-day hearing, saying: "I can't believe it's over. I feel good." The ruling would take effect in the coming weeks, the judge said. In a statement, the National Basketball Association (NBA) said it was "pleased" by the ruling. "We look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible," it said. The racism allegations had led the NBA to fine Mr Sterling $2.5m. It had also said it wanted to force Mr Sterling to sell the team. In a 10-minute audio recording published on celebrity website TMZ in April, Mr Sterling was heard telling a woman, subsequently identified as his girlfriend V Stiviano, not to associate in public with black people nor bring them to Clippers games. The remarks drew widespread condemnation from fans, retired basketball stars and President Barack Obama. Mr Sterling is suing the NBA, alleging it violated his constitutional rights by relying on information from an "illegal" recording.	A US judge has ruled that the LA Clippers basketball team can be sold, despite the objections of banned co-owner Donald Sterling.
The nine employees were made redundant when Ilex closed earlier this year. Ilex was set up in 2003 to regenerate two former Army bases but was shut down in March amid accusations it failed to deliver enough investment and jobs. The ex-workers taking the legal action have accused the Northern Ireland Executive of breaching employment law. A spokesperson for the executive said it could not comment as the case was before an industrial tribunal, which is due to be heard early next year. Ilex was criticised in an independent review in July 2015 over failings in the redevelopment of Fort George Army base and Ebrington Barracks in Derry. The report said the lack of progress in infrastructure investment, specifically in developing business accommodation, was particularly concerning. Among its successes, however, the company pointed to its role in helping to build Derry's Peace Bridge and the opening of the Northern Ireland Science Park on the Fort George site. In March, 18 Ilex workers were made redundant and the two bases were handed over to Derry City and Strabane District Council. Nine of those workers are taking action against the Northern Ireland Executive claiming their jobs should also have been transferred to the council. They have accused the Northern Ireland Executive of breaching a law which ensures workers move from one employer to another when a business changes hands.	Former staff at a government-run regeneration body in Londonderry are taking a case against Stormont over the way they lost their jobs.
The plastic moulded figures, rebranded from the US GI Joe version, made their debut in the UK at the British Toy Fair in Brighton, in January 1966, after a toy executive realised their market potential. The early toys were imports but Palitoy, based in Coalville, Leicestershire, would go on to make its own version with "lifelike hair", "beards" and "gripping hands" in the early 1970s. According to Rob Burman, editor of the Collectors Gazette, Palitoy bosses gave strict instructions not to call them "dolls" as boys could be put off. They were hugely popular, with sales topping 20 million by the end of the 1970s. Modifications kept the toys fresh and collectable, for example "eagle eyes" were introduced in 1976 by Hasbro, the US makers, and Palitoy brought in "flocked" hair and non-military costumes such as football kits. However, despite a loyal band of collectors, the success did not last into the 1980s. "The 60s and 70s were the big times for Action Man and then Star Wars came along," said Mr Burman. "Everyone wanted intergalactic characters, they weren't bothered about poor old Action Man." The toy expert said the figure made a bit of a comeback in the 1990s but nowadays people are generally more "politically correct" and so there is little interest in soldier toys. However, there is still a thirst for the old outfits - a boxed judo costume recently sold for ??6,000 at auction. Chris Malbon, 58, from Nottingham, who runs Warwickshire-based Metropolis Toys, had at one time one of the most "comprehensive" Action Man collections in the UK. He started collecting in 1989 and spent thousands on his acquisitions, which he admits got a "bit out of hand", and he later he sold them all for a "substantial" fee. "I collected the entire range," said the trader. "Both boxed and loose, together with US, French, German, Spanish, Japanese variations. I guess around 200 figures." However, it all became a bit of a burden. He said: "It's not because of the money... you end up wanting that elusive item or upgrading what you have to the exclusion of other things." Mr Malbon, a former soldier himself, did not want to say what he sold his collection for but said it was as much as he paid for his house in the 1990s. Palitoy's former chief toy designer Bob Brechin, who modelled Action Man's gripping hands on his own, said the toy has endured. "It's hard to believe it has been 50 years," he said. "He's timeless, universal, we never gave Action Man a story, we just gave children [the figures] and the outfits you dress him in and left it to their imaginations." Hasbro has announced it is releasing a set of vintage figures as part of the anniversary celebrations. It seems Action Man is not quite ready to leave the battlefield.	It is 50 years since Action Man, the must-have toy of the 1970s, arrived in the UK.
Kimberly Mpukusa, 18, became the number one Welsh under 18s tennis player despite struggling to find a sponsor. Contributions made by black people to history and culture will be celebrated throughout October. The event's first youth awards, Young Gifted and Black, for people aged between 13 and 30, took place in Cardiff on Thursday. Ms Mpukusa, from Swansea, started playing tennis aged nine on a school trip, and her dad picked up the sport and read books in order to help her. She struggled to compete in tournaments due to her financial situation. She stopped playing at age 13 because of her asylum case, but returned to the sport two years ago when her family was granted an indefinite stay. She started that year as the 123rd best player and has now returned to the number-one spot. Ms Mpukusa : "It really means a lot to me, words can't explain how much my parents have struggled and how much that I've struggled. "This award, I can show people that if you work hard, if you're determined, if you sacrifice, you can become big and people can recognise how hard you work." Ify Iwobi from Swansea battled obsessive compulsive disorder, (OCD) to win the music award. She said: "When I was young, especially when I was a baby, I used to tinker up to the toy pianos that we had in the house and I used to just experiment with the keys and just tap along and make different sounds with my baby hands. "My friends were like 'she's drawn to the piano, there's something that she's drawn to with the piano so we need to get this talent honed'. So when I was a bit older, from six, I started classical piano lessons. "It hasn't been easy expressing my music especially, with the OCD... that includes disturbing thoughts, memories from the past which weren't that pleasant, basically they would disrupt what goes on from day-to-day living. "That would get in the way of me and my personal practice on the piano, waste a lot of time and energy. "I had to have lots of therapy, I had to go to lots of counselling and they gave me ways to think positively." Roselynn Mbwembwe, 15, a dancer from Swansea, won the award for the performing arts. She has been dancing since she was eight-years-old and had won over 25 awards in dance, including Welsh dancer of the year. She said the award is not just for her "but for other children like me too". Christopher Nation, 19, from Fairwater in Cardiff, picked up the young carer award. His family is originally from Jamaica and he has been looking after his mother since he was six. "It's important for us to know our history. It's easy for us to get caught up in the way that the west is and forget about our own culture and things like that," he said. More than 100 people attended the event in the Senedd. The origins of Black History Month go back to 1926 in America, and there are now more than 6,000 events across the UK. Ray Singh, chairman of Race Council Cymru who judged the awards, said: "These young people have so much to offer our society and many have already made some rich contributions as carers, community leaders, musicians and volunteers. "Their impact is already visible in the fields of science and innovation, citizenship and performing arts. "Now, post-Brexit, it is about looking forward and ensuring that Wales is a nation where black history, arts and cultural differences can be the subject of celebration and not division."	A former asylum seeker who was coached by her father has won a sport award as part of Black History Month.
The Swift Archway Cranford 545 caravan was stolen from a site in Yaxley, Cambridgeshire, on Thursday night. Davis tweeted "My touring caravan was stolen.. even though it was locked up with hitch & wheel lock! I want to swear... #rotters". He added the thieves could have "headed north or south on A1, or west on A14". Cambridgeshire Police said: "We have had a report of a caravan being stolen in the Yaxley area between 5pm on Thursday and 12.45pm on Friday. We are investigating." Davis, who played the role of Wicket in the third of the original Star War movies, is also appearing in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. Davis's credits include Professor Flitwick in the Harry Potter films and Nikabrik in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Anyone with information about the caravan is asked to call Cambridgeshire Police.	Star Wars and Harry Potter star Warwick Davis, who played an ewok in Return of the Jedi, has taken to Twitter to help recover his stolen caravan.
The fishermen aboard the St Apollo escaped into their life raft during the incident early on Monday. A rescue helicopter was sent from Prestwick but the group were reached first by the Oban lifeboat at about 03:30. They were taken ashore at Oban. It's thought no one was been injured.	Five people have been rescued after their fishing vessel ran aground and capsized in the Sound of Mull.
They include developments in Edinburgh, Haddington, Strathaven, Glasgow, Linwood, Aberdeen and Newmachar. Last year, Barratt built 1,390 new homes in Scotland, nearly half of which were constructed on brownfield land. The company said its building programme reflected "a continued recovery in Scotland's economy" and the health of the new-build housing market. Barratt said the new sites would "underpin" more than 300 extra local jobs. Douglas McLeod, regional director for Barratt Developments in Scotland, said: "We have seen demand for new homes across Scotland remain high and our new sites will provide more choice for buyers looking to purchase in some of Scotland's most sought-after residential locations. "It's also good news for the Scottish economy not just in terms of supporting local construction jobs, but also through the generation of local revenue from new residents spending in local shops and on local services. "We know the positive social and economic impacts that our developments can make and we'll be working closely with all the communities in which we're building, to make sure we maximise those impacts as we progress."	House builder Barratt has announced plans to create 1,420 homes at 14 new sites across Scotland this year.
Dear President Tusk On 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent. Earlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March. Today, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community. See the letter as published by Downing Street (PDF) This letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too. It is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union. The Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible, as early as possible. I would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom. As I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the "acquis") into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave. From the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration. The United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. If, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome. It is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.  And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent. Looking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible. i. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament. That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no "cherry picking". We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets. ii. We should always put our citizens first. There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens. There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights. iii. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.  We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom's continuing partnership with the EU. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. iv. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible. Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan. In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process. v. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement. vi. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match. We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation. vii. We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values. Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats. As I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February. We recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty. The task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent. Yours sincerely Theresa May	Here is the full text of Theresa May's letter to European Council president Donald Tusk, beginning the start of Brexit negotiations.
Andreas Von Knorre and Elton Hinz pleaded guilty to entering a train depot and spraying graffiti on a train. Singapore has strict laws on vandalism, and has caned and jailed foreigners in the past for the offence. These include a Swiss national in 2010 and US teenager Michael Fay whose 1994 caning sparked global controversy. Von Knorre, 22, and Hinz, 21, had flown into Singapore from Australia in November last year and vandalised a train during their stay. They left the country afterwards and were eventually arrested in Kuala Lumpur in neighbouring Malaysia. Both men expressed remorse in court, and called their acts "a stupid mistake". Caning in Singapore involves being struck with a wooden stick on the back of the thigh, which can leave permanent scars. The maximum penalty for vandalism is a fine of S$2,000 (Â£958: $1,461) or up to three years in jail, in addition to three to eight strokes of the cane. In 2010, Swiss software consultant Oliver Fricker was jailed and caned for spray-painting graffiti on a train in Singapore. American Michael Fay made international headlines when he was sentenced in 1994 for damaging cars and public property. Despite an appeal from US President Bill Clinton, Singapore authorities went ahead with the caning but gave Fay a reduced number of strokes.	Two German men have been sentenced to three strokes of a cane and nine months in jail in Singapore for vandalism and trespassing.
The early work, carried out on mice and pigs, reveals the protein-infused patch encourages the growth of healthy cells and leads to less scarring. Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers say the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks. Though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented the patch), said: "Many were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. "The hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage." Commenting on the study in Nature, Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work "could lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction". But she cautioned that further studies needed to be done to understand whether this type of approach would work on larger animals and ultimately humans.	A prototype patch could help the repair the damage caused by a heart attack, scientists say.
Earlier in the morning we saw a number of airstrikes in the Old City. Iraqi forces were still pinned down by snipers from the group that calls itself Islamic State. Colonel Jabbar Abad told us it was the last pocket of resistance. He claimed they would be defeated within hours. His troops helped a steady stream of civilians fleeing to safety. Mostly women and children. Their faces were haunted and some had to be helped. The children didn't even flinch when there was more sound of gunfire. An older woman was so weak she could barely walk. A few babies being carried looked almost lifeless. The families were given food and water. This, their first taste of freedom after three years of living under IS control. The battle briefly forgotten in their own fight for survival. If this is victory it has come at a huge cost. Not just in human life. Nearly everyone rescued had to leave dead relatives behind. Almost every building in the old city has been scarred or completely destroyed. Search and rescue teams are still pulling bodies from the rubble. The heat has contributed to the stench of decaying corpses. We met Ali, who had come to find his brother's family. Hoping against hope that some may have survived. He said IS fighters had been using their house when it was hit by a coalition airstrike a few weeks ago. Iraqi security forces had only recently taken the area. With tears streaming down his face, Ali held up his mobile phone and told me he'd spoken to his brother trapped under the rubble. But over the last few days there had been no reply. Ali helped the search and rescue teams make their way through the tonnes of rubble. They tried to console him when all they could find what must have been their remains, which they carried off in a black zipped bag. We watched them do the same at several other sites. Contrast that with the jubilation of the Iraqi security forces who mobbed Prime Minister Abadi as he arrived in the city to declare victory over IS. This is still a significant moment. The extremists have held the city for three years. It's taken nine months of brutal street to street fighting to dislodge them. This was their stronghold in Iraq. It was here, in the city's now flattened Great Mosque of al-Nuri, where their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his one and only public appearance as Caliph of their so-called state. For many IS fighters Mosul is their graveyard, though it is still likely that some have escaped. The misery of Mosul is far from over. The UN estimates it will cost at least $1bn (£0.77bn) to restore the city's basic infrastructure - such as clean water and electricity. It will take tens of billions more to rebuild this city.	Even while the Iraqi prime minister was on his way to Mosul to declare the liberation of the city, there was still the occasional sound of gunfire and coalition warplanes flying overhead.

The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said he had been told not to report for training with the rest of the players on Monday. It is seeking clarification about an incident outside a fast food restaurant in the early hours of Tuesday. Police attended and said a man was taken away by officers but no arrests were made. The WRU said while the player, aged 28, was on an agreed holiday period from pre-Rugby World Cup training it operated a strict code of conduct covering behaviour both on and off the field. WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: "The player has been suspended due to a clear breach of the standards which we expect to be maintained by someone involved in one of our national squads. "Discipline and acceptable behaviour are issues which run to the core values of the Welsh Rugby Union and we cannot tolerate any compromise of those standards. "Mike Phillips is an exceptional player, but there is irrefutable evidence ... that he was engaged in behaviour which falls below the standards we set. "It is vitally important that we send out a clear and unambiguous message to one and all concerning our views on matters of this sort. "That message must be heard clearly by all players, coaches, administrators, volunteers, supporters and, of course, the parents and guardians of any child attracted to take part in the national sport of Wales. "Our senior national squad players are highly visible because of the profile which accompanies the success of our national sport and it is made clear to them that they are the ambassadors we rely on to foster and sustain our image." The incident occurred outside a McDonald's restaurant in Queen Street. Footage taken by bystanders shows Phillips being restrained by police before being led away in handcuffs to a police van. South Wales Police say he was not arrested. The player was recently released by the Ospreys regional rugby team after securing a move to French club Bayonne. The WRU said the suspension has been approved by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and agreed by the senior squad management team. Wales team manager Alan Phillips said: "We have suspended Mike Phillips on the clear evidence of a level of behaviour we regard as unacceptable. "It is clear there has been a breach of our disciplinary standards." Cardiff Blues scrum-half Lloyd Williams has been called into the Wales Rugby World Cup training squad as a replacement and will report for duty on Monday.	Scrum-half Mike Phillips has been suspended indefinitely from Wales squad duties after a late night incident in Cardiff.
The injured bird was found by a walker in Hall Lane, Blubberhouses, on Sunday. It had suffered a shattered wing, possibly a few days earlier, and was put down by a vet. PC Gareth Jones, North Yorkshire Police wildlife crime co-ordinator, said: "I am saddened by the scale of persecution of these birds. It has to stop." The birds were all found in North and West Yorkshire and police are concerned by the "unusually high" number of recent attacks on red kites, which are protected by law. In the past two months, four red kites have died after being shot. Another was found shot but released back into the wild after being treated by vets. Three red kites have also died after being found "in circumstances that suggest poisoning". They are being examined by the police's Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme. PC Jones said: "Red kites were persecuted into virtual extinction in the UK, but in recent years they have been re-introduced through breeding programmes at a number of locations nationally. "In Yorkshire, they have spread from their release site at Harewood House, and are now breeding over a large area. Red kites are scavengers, and normally eat carrion, their favourite food being rats and rabbits. "They are magnificent birds than can be regularly seen soaring over our area, bringing pleasure to many people." He urged anyone with information about the most recent incident to contact North Yorkshire Police.	A red kite found shot in North Yorkshire is the seventh to have been killed in the region in the past two months, police have said.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told a BBC Radio Wales election phone-in he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests, but still wanted him to become prime minister. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not," he said. "The alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want." Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Gething rejected listeners' suggestions that Welsh Labour was failing to support the party's UK leader. "I want a Labour prime minister - and that means Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister," he said. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not - it matters whether I think he can do the job in running the country. "It matters whether I think this country will be better off having a Labour prime minister than a Tory." Mr Gething admitted he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two Labour leadership contests, but accepted the party had voted "decisively" for him to be its leader and candidate for prime minister. He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs "being returned from Wales in large numbers". "We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales," he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. "I don't think we will be wiped out here," he said. "We've got a good record in government ... we're directly engaged in our local communities," he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was "appalled" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the "triple lock" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a "more open relationship" with the EU than a "hard" Brexit, calling for "full and unfettered" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was "economically beneficial". "There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment," he said. "I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: "A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves."	Labour figures in Wales are not trying to distance themselves from party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a Welsh Government minister has insisted.
The competition which takes place on the Clyde this weekend, between Glasgow and Edinburgh Universities, was first staged 140 years ago. It is the third oldest race of its kind in the world, just behind Oxford-Cambridge and the Yale-Harvard Regatta in the United States. Preparing for the race means lots of early morning training sessions. One such dawn chorus greeted the Glasgow University rowers as they arrived for their 06:45 session on the river Clyde by Glasgow Green. Those taking part are students from a wide variety of courses but they are linked by a passion for rowing. The first Scottish boat race took place on the River Clyde in 1877. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow University rowing clubs were formed 10 years earlier than that, so it is a rivalry which is more than a decade older than that of football's Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers. In an extraordinary winning streak Glasgow won every year between 2000 and 2012 but for the past four years Edinburgh has triumphed. Glasgow 1st VIII captain Gavin Shields says they have been working hard to regain their form. He says: "We've had a really good few years of developing some guys coming straight from beginner level. "It's definitely a work in progress. Edinburgh have have some really good results but it just makes us work harder to try to beat them." Gavin is studying psychology but the person who really has to get inside the heads of the crew is the 1st VIII cox and French student Rebecca Vest. She is the lone woman in the men's boat. Rebecca says: "You are one of the team but you are also in charge. "You have to make sure you have that respect which is earned throughout the year. "Sometimes it's difficult and it might take some months before some people in your crew accept your role and trust you to do your job properly." Glasgow's Women's 1st VIII won their race last year and the university's club captain and chemistry student Stuart Mitchell says the men are on course to win again in the future. He says: "People who take part in the sport are incredibly passionate about it and there's a lot of self starters in the club. "I think the club is only going to get bigger and better." Meanwhile at Scottish Rowing's impressive facility at Strathclyde Park near Hamilton athletes from Edinburgh University arrive for their training session well aware there are quite a few rising stars among their ranks. The standard is high, reflected in the recent selection of Maddie Arlett from the Women's 1st VIII for British Rowing's GB World Cup team. And of course another woman - five time Olympic medal winner Katherine Grainger - began her extraordinary rowing career while at Edinburgh. On the men's side Josh Armstrong, a first year sports management student, has a long term ambition to compete at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. But in the more immediate future he is aiming to extend the winning streak of Edinburgh's 1st VIII over Glasgow from four years to five. Josh says: "This is the first time I'm going to be competing in it so I'm really looking forward to it. "The rivalry will be massive as both universities are in a really strong place just now. "But I think we'll be looking to get the win and would be slightly disappointed if we didn't get that." Some rowers like Josh are part of the university's elite performance sport department but coach Colin Williamson, who heads up Performance Rowing, insists that is only part of the explanation for Edinburgh's recent success. He says: "I don't really think there is a secret to it. We just put it down to hard work. "The guys train very hard and they train very consistently. "And with the good support services we have at Edinburgh, with our strength and conditioning and physio and Scottish Rowing and Sport Scotland, everything is there for the guys to reach their full potential." Last year Glasgow's women beat Edinburgh and the crew from the east coast are determined to settle that score this time round. Medical student Laura McDonald who coxes Edinburgh women's 1st VIII says the team is a better unit than before. She says: "I think there is a better bond within the crew this year. "Last year people were frustrated and there seemed to be something missing. This year everyone is in it together." The approaches of both teams to the sport might be slightly different but they match each other in their desire to win. When they meet on the Clyde beside the Riverside Museum on Saturday they will bring with them 300 years of history as rowing clubs, not to mention 140 years of the Scottish boat race itself which is the third oldest in the world. That is rather a lot of water under the bridge.	It is certainly not the country's most famous sporting event but the Scottish Boat Race is one of the oldest.
Both sides had chances before the Pars' Ryan Wallace drilled a low shot into the bottom corner with 15 minutes left. The lead last just two minutes as Ross Davidson got the last touch on a free-kick into the area. The home side dominated the closing stages but could could not deny Rovers, who remain in fifth place. Rovers remain level with Airdrieonians, who drew at home with Forfar Athletic.	Scottish League One leaders Dunfermline Athletic were held at home by Albion Rovers but still moved 11 points clear at the top of the table.
Nico Rosberg headed team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 0.505secs after the Briton made a mistake on his best lap. And the German was a massive 1.834secs quicker than Kimi Raikkonen, third for Ferrari, on the same 'soft' tyres. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat were fourth and fifth as Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was 11th on the medium tyre. In windy and comparatively cool conditions - it was only 21C and overcast when temperatures are more usually in the mid-30Cs at this race - Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne made his debut in Formula 1 as stand-in for the injured Fernando Alonso. Vandoorne, who had not driven the 2016 McLaren before Friday, flew in overnight from Japan, where he had been testing the car he races in the Super Formula category, and was 18th fastest, 0.952secs slower than team-mate Jenson Button. However, Vandoorne's best time was set on the medium tyre, which is about a second slower than the soft on which Button was running when he set his fastest lap. McLaren racing director Eric Boullier said: "He did very well - it is not easy to step in to this high-tech car with a lot of processes to learn. He knows most of them but doing it for real is very different." The comparison between the two will be watched with intense interest through the weekend as it is effectively a partial audition for the job of Alonso's team-mate at McLaren in 2017. Button is out of contract at the end of this season ad Vandoorne, McLaren's reserve driver, is the most highly regarded not to have a regular F1 drive. At the front, Rosberg and Hamilton were only 0.081secs apart after their first runs on the soft tyre - with the German again marginally ahead. On their second flying laps, Hamilton was quicker in the first sector, but then dropped half a second in the middle sector of the lap. The gap between the Mercedes and the rest are not likely to be representative - Ferrari were almost certainly on a different programme. The Italian team have brought two more sets of the medium tyre for each of their drivers than Mercedes for this weekend and appeared to be focusing more on establishing whether that is the correct tyre for the race. Behind the Red Bulls, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg was sixth fastest ahead of the Toro Rosso pair Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen, the Haas of Romain Grosjean and Williams' Felipe Massa. Bahrain GP first practice results Bahrain GP coverage details	Mercedes put in an imposing performance in first practice at the Bahrain GP, setting the pace by nearly two seconds.
Celtic and Dundee are exploring the possibility of staging a game in the US, where the Kilmarnock striker has experience with Portland Timbers. "I think there are avenues for the Scottish game to tap into if you look at the American model," said Boyd. "But, for our teams to go there to play, I don't think it's right." A formal proposal is set to be put before the Scottish Professional Football League regarding the Dundee v Celtic match in the next few weeks, with Boston and Philadelphia possible host cities. "It's not for me," Boyd, 32, told BBC Scotland. "With the two of them being Scottish clubs, it's right that they play in Scotland. "It's obviously a big market for Celtic with them being a worldwide club and because Dundee's owners are American, that's why they'll be trying to explore it. "There's a lot of Scottish people living in America. There is interest. "But the majority of Dundee fans will be from Dundee. I don't imagine there'll be a lot in America. With Celtic, there will be. That comes with the size of the club." Boyd spent 2012 in Major League Soccer, scoring seven goals in 22 starts for Portland. "Scottish clubs can go over and see what's going on and try and make things better but bring it back here to try and make the Scottish game better in Scotland," added the former Scotland international. "Football is definitely getting bigger [in the US]. "The majority of clubs are now playing in front of 20,000 every week. Seattle are playing in front of 60,000 - that's as big as Rangers and Celtic! "There's more to take into it - the travelling, the different climates, the time zones. It's a difficult place to go and play football. "And they change the rules every year as well to suit the teams that are struggling because if you win the league then players' wages might go up then the next thing they need is to trade their players to keep themselves under their salary cap. "It would be difficult to manage in and definitely be an owner in but the flipside is that if you're an owner and you're getting 20,000 every week, you know you're still making money."	Kris Boyd believes Scottish football can learn from the United States but is against the idea of playing Scottish Premiership matches overseas.
Paul Robson is the second trader at the Dutch bank to plead guilty to trying to rig the Yen Libor rate and the first Briton to do so. Last year Rabobank paid $1bn (Â£597m) to US and European regulators for its part in the global rate-rigging scandal. Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank have all previously been fined for rate rigging. Mr Robson conspired to manipulate Libor submissions to benefit trading positions between 2006 and 2011, the US Department of Justice said. Libor - London interbank offered rate - is one of the interest rates use by global banks to lend money to each other. It supports hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions, and is used to set interest rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages. Regulators in the US and Europe have been investigating whether banks attempted to manipulate this and other key interest rates to benefit their own trading positions. Nine people, including Robson, have so far been charged by the Justice Department. US prosecutors said Robson pleaded guilty to one charge out of the 15 he had faced. Takayuki Yagami, another former senior trader at Rabobank, in June became the first to plead guilty for his role in the scheme. Robson worked as a senior trader at Rabobank's money markets desk in London, and also served as the bank's primary submitter for the Yen Libor calculation, the Justice Department said. He used his position to submit rates requested by Yagami and other traders, according to prosecutors. In 2007 Yagami asked Robson by email for a high submission for one of the rates, Robson answered: "no prob mate let me know your level." After Yagami made his request, according to the Justice Department, Robson confirmed: "sure no prob... I'll probably get a few phone calls but no worries mate... there's bigger crooks in the market than us guys!" In a statement Leslie Caldwell, who heads the Justice Department's criminal division, said: "The scope of the fraud was massive, but the scheme was simple. By illegally influencing the Libor rates, Robson and his co-conspirators rigged the markets to ensure that their trades made money," In July Lloyds Banking Group was fined Â£218m for "serious misconduct" for its part in interest rate rigging. Lloyds manipulated both the yen and sterling Libor rates and tried to rig the rate for the US dollar, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and US financial regulators said. At the time Bank of England governor Mark Carney called the misconduct "reprehensible".	A former senior trader at Rabobank has pleaded guilty to interest rate rigging in the US.
But the original timescale, which envisaged the closures taking place by the end of 2015, has slipped. Calls have been made by Opposition MSPs for the work on the reorganisation to be postponed pending a review of the way calls to police are handled. The review, by HM Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS), is due to report in October. The closure of the Aberdeen control room was originally scheduled to be completed the previous month. But a north-east MSP has said the programme, which has already seen control rooms in Dumfries, Stirling and Glenrothes closed, should be halted until the HMICS review is published. It was ordered following the deaths of two people in a car crash on the M9 in Stirlingshire on July 6, and will examine the case for shutting regional control centres. Although the incident was reported to police at the time, officers only attended the scene three days later after a second call from a different person. John Yuill, 28, was found dead and 25-year-old Lamara Bell critically injured. She later died in hospital from injuries including broken bones and kidney damage caused by dehydration. The initial call had been handled by the Bilston Glen call centre which takes calls from Central Scotland and Fife following the closure of Stirling and Glenrothes. Lewis Macdonald, Labour MSP for north-east Scotland said the programme of closures - which has already seen a number of skilled staff leaving Aberdeen - should be halted by police until after HMICS has reported. He said: "It would be absolutely unacceptable for them to continue with the closure plans while the decision is being looked at and while the future delivery of police control rooms across Scotland is under review. "So I hope that we will hear from Police Scotland very, very shortly to the effect that they will take no steps leading to the closure of the Aberdeen control room, the service centre which answers 101 calls in Aberdeen or indeed the control room in Inverness. "Because it is quite clear the local knowledge that is accumulated in these control rooms cannot be replicated, will be lost if they close and will simply heap further pressure on the control rooms in the Central Belt." In a statement Assistant Chief Constable Val Thomson, commander of Police Scotland's C3 Division which is developing the control room reorganisation, said: "We remain committed to the C3 change programme and are in discussion with the Scottish Police Authority (SPA)." A police spokesman said any decision on closures would have to be ratified by the SPA, which oversees the single police force. It said the original timescale was now unlikely to be adhered to. A spokesperson said: "Consultation with staff has not started yet. The timeline over the coming months needs to allow both proposals from staff via official consultation and any key findings from the HMICS work to be considered, before any final decisions are made."	Police have confirmed they are continuing with plans to close control rooms in Aberdeen and Inverness.

Deliveries of the double-decker will now fall from 15 this year to 12 in 2018 and eight in 2019, Airbus said. Chief Executive Tom Enders said that prospects of further sales of the A380 in the short-term were not "necessarily high". Airbus, which has not had an A380 order for two years, makes the wings at its factory at Broughton, north Wales. The company said on Thursdays that production of the A380 continued to operate at a marginal loss. In June, Airbus unveiled an upgraded version of the world's largest passenger jet, promising greater fuel efficiency and room for more seats. Airbus hopes it will be the catalyst for more orders from airlines. Also on Thursday, Airbus posted second-quarter operating profits which fell 27% to 859m euros (Â£765m) on revenues of 15.27bn euros. That fell short of the 910m euro profit expected by analysts polled by Reuters. On Wednesday, shares in rival Boeing hit a record high after its second-quarter profit and cashflow came in well ahead of Wall Street estimates. Production at Airbus has been hit by delays in delivery of US engine-maker Pratt & Whitney's engines for the A320neo aircraft. The fuel-saving Geared Turbofan engine has suffered reliability problems. On Thursday, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said Pratt & Whitney had to "work harder" to fix the problems. "It should be a winning engine but they need to fix it," he told reporters. "Pratt & Whitney has introduced some fixes but we are still waiting for these improvements to come through." He also said that Airbus was in "constructive talks" with Qatar Airways over a recent cancellation of four A350 aircraft, adding, "I think we will find a way out" of the issue.	European aircraft maker Airbus has cut production of its A380 superjumbo for the second time in a year.
Speaking to reporters, FBI boss James Comey said the plans to enable encryption by default could thwart law enforcement investigations. Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. "I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was "very concerned" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. "What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law," he said. "I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law," he added. Apple and Google have yet to respond to Mr Comey's comments. Ten days prior to Mr Comey's press statement, iOS data forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski pointed out that Apple's encryption system would not stop police getting at data on portable devices. Specifically weakening security systems just to aid the police was a bad decision, he said. "For the sake of privacy and overall security, the only logical solution is to make products as secure as possible, and let good detective work do the crime solving, rather than an easy button," he wrote in a blogpost.	Plans by Apple and Google to do more to protect customers' privacy have made the FBI "very concerned".
But this was far from the first time bungling contractors have been left with red faces. BBC News rounds up some of the gaffes that have hit the headlines. When a misspelt road marking appeared outside a school in Chester, the finger of blame was as usual pointed at hapless contractors. The lettering outside Highfield Community Primary School, in Blacon, was "claer" evidence that spelling was not the forte of the person who painted it. The marking was hastily corrected, at no cost to the council, after it appeared in February 2014. At least the simplest of fixes was possible when blundering workmen misspelled the word "minutes" as "minuites" at an NCP car park at Cambridge's railway station. Although it was two years before anything was done about the gaffe, eventually an NCP boss harnessed an inner Mick Jagger and gave the order: "I want it painted black." Thus the offending "I" was covered up to restore basic literacy to this corner of Cambridge. NCP said those responsible for the cock-up were "committed to playing Scrabble in their lunchtimes as spelling revision". A set of double yellow lines that appeared in Cardiff last summer couldn't be faulted in terms of execution - but the location chosen for the markings led to the city council being widely mocked. That's because the road on which the lines were painted is barely 5ft (1.5m) wide and too narrow for anything but a toy car. Despite the markings being branded "ridiculous" and a "waste of money", the beleaguered council stuck to its guns, arguing the double yellows were necessary to "deter anti-social parking on the narrow access lane". Motorists using a supermarket petrol station in Doncaster were amused to find themselves being directed towards a species of low-flying seabird. The word "petrel" was painted in 3ft letters, next to the flawlessly spelt word "exit" and some perfectly drawn arrows, on the approach to the pumps at the Sainsbury's Edenthorpe store in September 2016. In a light-hearted response, Sainsbury's said it was "correcting the misteke". Not wanting to let anything as inconvenient as a parked car get in their way, slapdash council contractors tasked with painting double yellow lines in a suburb of Leeds simply daubed the markings around the vehicle. However, once the car's owner returned and drove away, the lines were left sticking out from the kerb. Leeds City Council branded the markings in Hyde Terrace, Clarendon, as "ridiculous" and said it would remind contractors "to use common sense" in future. The lines were later repainted. Welsh-speaking drivers in Swansea were bemused to encounter a road sign that informed them: "I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated." Above the baffling statement on the dual-language sign was the correct wording in English: "No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only". The howler came about because a non-Welsh speaking council employee emailed the authority's in-house translation service, and took the response received as the translation being sought for the new road sign. Brensiach!	A wonky cycle path sign that appeared in the Lincolnshire market town of Sleaford last weekend caused much mirth among local residents, who described it as looking like a penny farthing - albeit one with angular wheels.
Jung won aboard Sam, who was a late replacement when Fischertakinou contracted an infection in July. France's Astier Nicolas took silver and American Phillip Dutton won bronze as GB's William Fox-Pitt finished 12th. Fox-Pitt, 47, was competing just 10 months after being placed in an induced coma following a fall. The three-time Olympic medallist, aboard Chilli Morning, produced a faultless performance in Tuesday's final show-jumping phase. But the former world number one's medal bid had already been ruined by a disappointing performance in the cross-country phase on Monday. He led after the dressage phase, but dropped to 21st after incurring several time penalties in the cross country. Ireland's Jonty Evans finished ninth on Cooley Rorkes Drift.

Lyth hit two sixes and 13 fours in his 116 not out and shared a third-wicket stand of 150 with skipper Andrew Gale. Gale's 61 was his highest score of the season, but he fell to Tom Curran as his side closed on 207-3, 60 behind. Earlier on day three, Sam Curran (59*) and Steven Davies (56) helped Surrey add 103 to their overnight 164-5. With the best part of four sessions lost to rain on the first two days, a draw is now the most likely result, but having begun the game in fifth place, Yorkshire will have set their sights on reaching 400 to ensure they leave the Oval with maximum bonus points. After Davies and the younger Curran added 75 for the seventh wicket, Surrey lost their last four for 28 in the space of 10 overs. Alex Lees departed in the eighth over of Yorkshire's innings and Jack Leaning followed for a duck when he chopped Stuart Meaker's first delivery into his stumps. Lyth, though, was unperturbed as he progressed to three figures off 159 balls and partner Gale, who started the match averaging only 17.93, grew in confidence to reach his first half-century of the summer before he was caught behind. Surrey all-rounder Sam Curran told BBC Radio London: "It was nice to finally get back into the side after school and stuff, to get some time in the middle. "They showed they are one of the top teams in the division and I had a good battle with Adil Rashid, a good spinner, he really made me work on my feet. "It's been frustrating. Both teams wanted four days (of play) because we're both looking for wins. "Tomorrow we're going to have to come in quite hard with the ball, see how many wickets we can take in the first session and see where we can take it from there."	Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth made his third century of the season as the defending champions replied solidly to Surrey's 267 all out at the Oval.

The operation foiled a plan to smuggle drugs and weapons from South America to the port of Gioia Tauro in Calabria, officials said. The raids targeted two mafia crime families, the Gambino of New York and the Ndrangheta from Calabria. FBI agents travelled to Italy to take part in the raids. Police said the two-year investigation prevented the delivery to Italy of hundreds of kilograms of cocaine hidden in coconuts and pineapples, as well as heroin and marijuana. Gioia Tauro, the intended destination of the drugs, is one of Europe's largest shipping ports. Eight of the arrests were made in New York, and are linked with the Gambino crime family which is believed to have negotiated the deal. The other 18 people were arrested in Italy are believed to have been involved with the Ndrangheta clan.	Police in the US and Italy say they have arrested 26 people in a joint raid against a new mafia-operated drug trafficking route.
TrueTube, an educational platform, has been named a contender for three awards in total, including best drama and secondary learning. Horrible Histories also earned three nominations, all for its special episode celebrating the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. The awards will be held at the Roundhouse in London on 20 November. TrueTube's success "demonstrates the shift in how young audiences are consuming media", Bafta said. The website's drama nomination is for Refugee, a 12-minute film following a British girl and her family who have fled their home, while Katie, about a gay, Catholic nurse in a children's ward, is up for the learning award. TrueTube senior education producer Bob Ayres said: "We are over the moon. We are a small charity-funded online channel and to be nominated alongside such giants feels like an attack of vertigo. "We are very, very proud the films we make for young people and schools have been given such recognition, and extremely pleased they will now reach a wider audience." The Shakespeare special from the gruesomely entertaining Horrible Histories is up for the comedy and writing trophies and actor Tom Stourton will compete for the best performer honour for playing the role of the Bard. Elsewhere, a number of programmes received two nominations. Cartoon Network's The Amazing World of Gumball is up for the animation and writer awards. CBBC's Hetty Feather and The Dog Ate my Homework are among the other double nominees. The annual Bafta Children's Awards also recognise movies which have been on general release in UK cinemas.  This year, the academy has chosen Zootropolis, The Good Dinosaur, The Jungle Book and Star Wars: The Force Awakens for its feature film award. Star Wars is also in the running for two other awards - best game for Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the adapted interactive prize for Star Wars Arcade. The full list of categories and nominees can be found on the Bafta website, with voting closing on 18 November.

Mr Odinga, who was defeated by incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta, has accused the electoral authorities of fraud tantamount to "democracy's slaughter". But foreign observers described the election as free and fair. The international community has urged calm amid fears that the fraud claims could result in violence. The official results gave President Kenyatta about 54% of the vote, and Mr Odinga 45%. Mr Odinga, who had previously refused a court appeal against the outcome, said the opposition had collected concrete evidence of massive irregularities that were allegedly used to rig the vote. "We have now decided to move to the Supreme Court to lay before the world the making of a computer-generated leadership," he told journalists. European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan were among those who had urged Mr Odinga to seek redress through the courts. But he insisted that his decision did not mean he was giving up the fight. "By going to court we aren't legitimising misplaced calls from some observers for us to concede but are seeking to give to those who braved the long lines in the morning chill and hot afternoon... a chance to be heard." He also repeated his call for peaceful protests, saying Kenyans had the constitutional rights to demonstrate, strike and carry out acts of civil disobedience. But on Monday, Mr Odinga's strike request was largely ignored. "This is just the beginning, we will not accept and move on," he added. In 2013, Mr Odinga challenged the presidential results in the Supreme Court and lost. Now, he said, he the court had an opportunity to demonstrate its independence. "Our decision to go to court constitutes a second chance for the Supreme Court. The court can use this chance to redeem itself or, like in 2013, it can compound the problems we face as a country."	Kenya's opposition leader Raila Odinga says he will mount a legal challenge to the result of last week's presidential election, which he claims was rigged.
There have been ongoing industrial problems in the school for months. The panel consists of leading educationalist Prof Sir Robert Salisbury, trade unionist John Corey and Belfast Metropolitan College's principal Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se McGivern. Education Minister John O'Dowd has said he wants them to complete the investigation by early summer. The secondary school, in the Andersonstown area of west Belfast, has 1,100 pupils. About a third of its 70-strong teaching staff were absent for a period prior to Easter, and, in an unusual move last month, an associate principal was appointed to the school. A group representing some parents also held a number of protests to express their concern about how the disputes were affecting their children. Mr O'Dowd said that he wanted the panel to investigate events in the school, and make recommendations "to ensure the school's future". "I consider the panel members to be eminently well qualified and experienced," he said. "My priority continues to be to the pupils at the school and this investigation will give pupils, parents, staff and their representatives, and all those involved with the governance of the school, the opportunity to express their view." The investigation will look at staff relationships, the role of senior leadership, governance of the school and the impact of the ongoing disputes on pupils. Mr Corey was general secretary of Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) union from 2003-10 and is currently a member of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Prior to her role at Belfast Metropolitan College, Ms McGivern was director of development at Belfast City Council. Sir Robert, meanwhile, recently chaired the literacy and numeracy task force in Northern Ireland and is a former professor of education at the University of Nottingham. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), which represents almost half the teachers at De La Salle College, welcomed the appointments. It said the move "should reassure all partners in the De La Salle community that Minister O'Dowd is committed to finding a robust resolution to the recent period of challenge". However, it said the terms of reference would be "critical to the success or otherwise of the investigation". The NASUWT also said it will "seek assurances from the panel that their work will not cause any further disruption". Jim Clarke, chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), also welcomed the appointment of the panel. "The background and experience of those who will be carrying out the investigation gives confidence to the process," he said. "CCMS will continue with its ongoing work with the other interests through the agreed strategy. It remains focused on the needs and interests of the pupils at the school."	A three-person panel has been appointed to carry out an investigation into De La Salle College in west Belfast.
NHS Tayside had the highest number followed by NHS Lanarkshire  and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The figures also revealed that more than 560,000 people missed at least one NHS outpatient appointment in 2014/15. Each missed appointment is thought to cost the NHS Â£120, putting the total cost to the health service at Â£100m. The figures were obtained by the Scottish Conservatives through a Freedom of Information request. The statistics revealed: The Scottish Tories have previously suggested those who fail to show for appointments on a certain number of occasions could face some sanction from the health board. The party has also urged the Scottish government look at more innovative ways of reminding patients to turn up at appointments. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: "Missing a hospital appointment can happen to anyone, and for a range of reasons. "But when you're getting to the point where you are missing five or more in the space of just a year, something really has to be done. "That is costing the NHS thousands of pounds, wreaking havoc with hospital planning, and of course potentially harming the health of the patient involved. "We've been critical of the NHS in the past for cancelling appointments and procedures, so it's only fair we do everything we can to make sure patient no-shows are limited too. "We need to find ways to ensure people turn up at the appointments that are made and stop showing contempt for our NHS, doctors and nursing staff." Health Secretary Shona Robison said the percentage of patients missing appointments has decreased slightly over the last five years. She added: "However, it is important that all health boards understand why patients are not attending appointments and look at ways to reduce this. "The Scottish government is committed to supporting health boards to deliver secure messaging services, including reminders. "Health Scotland also recently published a report looking at those who did not attend appointments over a 10 year period from 2002/03 to 2011/12. "We welcome this report which will provide boards with further learning on the issue of non-attendance."	Nearly 17,000 patients in Scotland failed to show up for an NHS hospital appointment on at least five occasions last year.
South Wales Police said the incident happened at about 17:50 BST on Friday near to Court Road, Barry, and involved a black Renault Clio The child was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in their first one-on-one debate it was the senator from Vermont who started to trend worldwide. So what are Bernie's supporters doing differently to bolster his support amongst younger voters? One place where he is a surprising hit is the dating app Tinder. Kevin Smit from Alkmaar in the Netherlands has used Tinder to spread the Bernie gospel. "I'm not a heterosexual male and I too believe he's sexy" he joked to BBC News. "He's a hit because there's a lot of millennials on the app and he polls amazingly with them". Fans of Bernie's Tinder triumphs share their success on Facebook and Tumblr. Logan Jantzi from New York told BBC News that it was Bernie's policies which lead to his Tinder appeal. "He discusses problems that are of actual concern to young voters"  he said. "Gender inequality, low wages, high student loan debt, climate change, these are the things that 18-30 somethings are concerned with." Nelson Evans, a Bernie Sanders supporter from California, told BBC News that the popularity of Bernie on social media was because his supporters didn't think their candidate received enough attention in traditional media. "There's people who even pay the full Tinder membership fees in order to reach others across the country" he said. "I think it's effective because, prior to the Iowa caucus, the media has completely shut Bernie out of the news cycle. For every 81 minutes of election coverage he'd get 10 seconds and Bernie supporters know that." "But people who get their election news from the mainstream media, they have no idea what Bernie is all about. That's sort of what started the Tinder thing. "It's amazing how you see people from 17-29 who have gone from never being interested in politics to being completely enveloped by it. "This election represents more than just a candidate. It's an indication that the youth know what direction they want our country to go, and they're ready to work vigorously for it," he added. The hashtag #demdebate has been used more than 600,000 times over the past 24 hours to discuss the debate between Clinton and Sanders: Both candidates have their names shortened on Twitter to fit with the platform's character limit. Hillary Clinton is commonly called '#HRC' by supporters, a term which has featured in more than 49,700 tweets over the past 24 hours while the term #Bernie far surpassed that and was used in 322,000 tweets. On Facebook, Bernie Sanders' personal page has almost three million likes while Hillary Clinton is only able to manage 2.3 million. But his popularity on social sites won't necessarily translate into Bernie Sanders becoming the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Left-leaning young voters in the UK frequently made the Labour leader Ed Miliband the top trend on Twitter and other social sites during last year's general election, as part of the hashtag #milifandom campaign. Unfortunately for him, his online fans did not turn into a majority in voting stations last May.	As the race to become the Democratic presidential candidate heats up in the United States, the left-leaning Bernie Sanders has become a surprising star on social media, with young voters using mobile phone apps to push others to #feelthebern.
Former Carrick boss Haveron was appointed Glens supremo this week and could not have asked for a more high-profile first match in charge. Glentoran have slumped to 10th in the table after taking just one point from a possible 15. "We must show how much it means to play in games like these," said Haveron. "Our fans expect the players to show passion and pride and that is how it should be. "We have got to get a bit belief and a win would do that. "The best way to turn our season around would be to beat Linfield on Saturday." Despite being at home, Glentoran will be firm underdogs against David Healy's Linfield who are unbeaten this season. The Belfast Blues sit in second place and are five points behind champions Crusaders with a match in hand. The unbeaten Crues also face a big derby fixture as they host north Belfast neighbours Cliftonville at Seaview. Crusaders have won five league matches in a row while Cliftonville are up to fourth following back-to-back victories. "Cliftonville are back in form and are winning games of football quite well," said Crusaders manager Stephen Baxter. "They are packed full of quality players and have loads of confidence and ability. They will expect to get a result." Ballymena United travel to their fiercest rivals Coleraine looking to make it four wins in a row in the league. They came from behind to beat Glentoran 4-1 last weekend to consolidate third place in the table. "It will be my first experience of a Coleraine/Ballymena derby and we're looking forward to it," said Sky Blues boss David Jeffrey. "They came from two down to draw against Glenavon last week so that is an indication of the character they possess." The fourth derby clash in Saturday's Premiership is at Mourneview Park where Glenavon host Portadown. Final Score from Northern Ireland is on BBC1 NI at 17:00 BST on Saturday	New manager Gary Haveron has called on Glentoran's players to show pride in the shirt as they take on Belfast rivals Linfield on Saturday.
Dwindling domestic gas and coal supplies mean the nation would become dependent on volatile imports, it adds. The report, by Cambridge Econometrics for RenewableUK, said wind power saved the UK Â£579 million in fossil fuel costs in 2013. The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. "One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels," explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. "This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically." She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40% increase in gas prices by 30%, electricity prices would increase by 8%. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4%. "For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience," Ms Billington added. The report said that the UK electricity sector had undergone a substantial change in recent decades, shifting from a coal-based system to a more balanced mix "encompassing nuclear and gas-fired power stations, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies". It observed: "Over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy sector will need to be re-shaped again if the UK's targets to reduce CO2 emissions are to be met." In 2008, the UK established the world's first legally binding climate change target, requiring governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Rob Norris, RenewableUK's head of communications, said that currently there were "not enough renewables in the system to meet those targets". He told BBC News: "The crucial thing is that energy policy is a long-term game and at the moment we only really know what the government support will be out to 2020. "What you really need is a long-term vision out to 2030 so then you can plan, especially when it comes to things like large offshore developments." Mr Norris said he advocated a "rich energy mix so then you do not put all your eggs in one basket". He added: "If you have different technologies, including renewables, competing against each other then the cost is driven down for the consumer."	Installing more wind turbines will make the UK's energy market more resilient to global fossil fuel price shocks, an independent report has concluded.
It's not natural Labour territory. The party has lost every election here since 1950. At this year's general election, the Conservatives were returned with an 18,000 majority. But the people of Chelmsford, in Essex, were queuing round the block outside the city's civic theatre to hear Jeremy Corbyn. If this had been a football crowd, there would have been purveyors of hot pies. If it had been an audience waiting to the see the latest cinema blockbuster, there would be popcorn vendors. But it's the 87th Corbyn rally of the Labour leadership campaign. So the products being paraded at the venue were food for thought - newspapers from parties and factions to the left, or on the left, of Labour - Socialist Worker, Socialist Appeal, Labour Briefing. There were almost as many people here as there have been Corbyn rebellions against his own party leadership. So why were 500 giving up their evening to hear the veteran left winger? "He's a breath of fresh air," says Helen Davenport, a teacher who had left the Labour party for the Greens. "I gave up hope," she says. "But now there's an alternative. I like his ideas on renationalising rail and he has a more sympathetic policy on immigration. He has the wisdom of Tony Benn." Sasha McLoughlin agrees: "It's the first time a Labour leader has represented me in years. You vote Labour because that's what you do but it's so exciting to have a leftwing leader, not a Tory in disguise." Further up the line was Gerard Darcy. He says he wasn't a natural Corbyn supporter but found him to be "straight-talking". He went on: "There's no artifice. No spin. The other candidates are preened, moulded. He looks like a 70s sociology lecturer but people are now in to the issues, not the image - no one cares about what his smile looks like." He says Andy Burnham would be "excellent" but is now his second choice. And the phenomenon that is Corbynmania continued inside the venue. In the media scrum that now surrounds him everywhere he goes, he was asked by Finnish television to give advice to their social democrats, and by Le Monde to comment on French President Francois Hollande's move to the right. Incidentally, he responds that Hollande "hasn't felt sufficiently able to challenge austerity". Not a criticism he would level at himself. So how has a left-winger who had languished on the backbenches  - someone to whom Ed Miliband's former chief of staff Lucy Powell admits to never having spoken - now become something of an international celebrity? He seems quite bemused yet nonplussed by the attention. He needed the support of 35 Labour MPs to get on the ballot and he points out he only got enough nominations with just one minute fifteen seconds to the deadline. This was no long-standing left-wing conspiracy. He had to "max out" his credit card to get the campaign started and while he has received donations from trade unions such as Unite and communications workers' union the CWU, he appeared to have caught an anti-austerity zeitgeist, with his targets for "crowdfunding" from individuals exceeded. Irrespective of his politics, he does look and sound different from his Oxbridge educated opponents, all of whom were advisers to Labour politicians before becoming MPs. He's a generation older, for a start. At 66, he was a Haringey councillor in the 70s and 80s before the other contenders even went to university. "I have got very few qualifications," he tells me -  he dropped out of North London Polytechnic - "but I have a fascination of reading and read a lot. I spent a lot of time in the school library and the local library and I have this view that everyone I meet knows something I don't know and we can learn from each other." He was weaned on socialist literature. Not for him the Famous Five: "My mother gave me the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists to read." This was Robert Tressell's novel of working class life in Mugsborough - or Hastings - before World War One, and the philanthropists of the title are the people who are all too willing to do back-breaking work for the benefit of their "betters". His maths-teacher mother also gave him the diaries of George Orwell. He spent two years on voluntary service overseas in the Caribbean, but first became active in politics in Shropshire. He founded the Wrekin Young Socialists - the youth wing of the Labour Party -  in the mid-60s. He was the organisation's secretary and regularly attracted 40 to 50 youthful activists to Sunday night meetings. He produced a magazine and organised protests against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War - perhaps the perfect pedigree for someone who would go on to form the Stop the War coalition with CND stalwart Monsignor Bruce Kent in 2001 - though it's worth remembering that was initially a protest against intervention in Afghanistan, not Iraq. He is not in principle against the deployment of British troops but cannot think of current circumstances where he would do so. He first successfully fought his Islington North in seat in 1983, when the party went down to a disastrous defeat nationally under Michael Foot's leadership on a platform of unilateral disarmament and withdrawal from the EU. Labour had moved decisively to the left in London, too, but with more success. Ken Livingstone was at the head of the then Greater London Council, later abolished by Mrs Thatcher's government. It had been literally a divisive time for his party, with some former cabinet ministers splitting away to form the SDP. Meanwhile some of those on the left tried to unseat MPs they regarded as too right-wing, but who hadn't jumped ship. Corbyn had backed Tony Benn's unsuccessful attempt to become the party's deputy leader - he was very narrowly defeated by Denis Healey. So what had he learned from that period of division? "It taught me in London we achieved a great deal - on transport, on the environment - but it also taught me the formation of the SDP was catastrophic to the electoral chances of Labour. "The Conservative so-called triumph in 1983 owed more to the division of the opposition vote than a move to the left. But it also taught me that you have to take communities with you." There has been a lot of focus on Jeremy Corbyn's disloyalty to his own party. He rebelled on a quarter of all votes during the 2005-2010 government. But I wondered why he had stayed loyal to Labour rather than moving to any of a myriad of parties to its Left when some of the policies he held dear - on nuclear weapons and re-nationalisation - had been ditched? "I want to see a more equal, more just society and the Labour Party has always been the vehicle to achieve that, especially with its organic link to the trade unions. I have argued my case on lots of issues and I think things are changing." And this is his verdict on the 2015 election: "One of the reasons we lost is we weren't offering anything sufficiently different." Well, you certainly couldn't accuse him of not wishing to put that right. He tells an appreciative if not overly enthusiastic audience in Essex that the government's welfare bill "is absolutely brutal" and he will oppose the benefits cap. The cost of welfare is so high, he says, in part because of high rents - which in turn are a symptom of not building enough affordable homes. He rebelled against his party's abstention on the welfare bill while Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, despite their doubts, stuck with collective shadow cabinet responsibility. They see that episode as the catalyst for Corbynmania. He rails against tuition fees, but also opposes those in his party who want to see a graduate tax. He said that "wise" old Tony Benn had told him: "you should tax people because they are wealthy, not because they are educated." And he defends his policy of using quantitative easing - whereby the Bank of England would increase the supply of money in the economy - to fund infrastructure projects. His critics say it would push up inflation and erode living standards. He responds: "If you said to people in Germany I have a radical new idea of a National Investment Bank they would just shrug their shoulders and say we are doing that already. What's extreme about that?" And on challenging the agenda of austerity, he says his party has to be bold. The debt ridden government of 1945 - when, after a by-election, even Chelmsford briefly had a Labour MP - "didn't retrench, it invested". There is a feeling, though, that if his campaign isn't running out of steam, he to some extent is - cramming in public meetings, rallies and media appearances. "That's socialism," he says as he is handed, without asking, a glass of water mid-speech as his voice finally falters. He finishes by denouncing the legacy of the Iraq War and promises "whatever the result of the leadership election" that the party's grass roots will be empowered. Mandate for change And he does go on to get a standing ovation. But I ask him how he could be at the head of a shadow cabinet that disagrees with him on fundamental issues - such as the renewal of Trident - or indeed lead a party whose policies in some key respects are very different from his own? "Whoever is elected leader will have a very large mandate from the members and the Parliamentary Labour Party - important as it is - I hope will recognise there is at the very least a mandate for a full debate within the party." Andy Burnham has said he would not be part of a shadow cabinet that didn't commit to renewing Trident. Jeremy Corbyn sees this as a matter of party democracy: "I feel strongly about nuclear weapons. We have to have that debate fairly soon as the government might reach a decision in 2016." Possibly as soon a this month's Labour Party conference. Jeremy Corbyn is the front-runner in the campaign but his critics will say that his leadership would be dominated by those internal debates within Labour that would leave little time - even with the best will in the world - to take the fight to the government. But Corbyn insists "there is a thirst for doing politics differently". We will find out just how many people are drinking in his ideas a week from now.	In the third of a series of in-depth profiles of the four Labour leadership candidates, Iain Watson catches up with Jeremy Corbyn in Essex at the latest of his campaign rallies.
Although Gillian McCusker had fallen out with Rachel and Nyomi Fee just before the two-year-old's death she had been very close friends with the pair. She said she never suspected any wrongdoing during the time she knew the Fees. The couple were convicted of killing Liam at his Fife home in March 2014. They had blamed another boy for the murder. Ms McCusker said she would now change a "friends forever" tattoo, that she had done with the Fees, so she would not have a daily reminder of the women. She said: "I was shocked, totally shocked when everything happened. "I looked out of my window and I saw a load of ambulances and I saw them standing in the street shouting 'help'. "I didn't know what to do at the time as we weren't talking." Ms McCusker said she regretted that "nothing" could be done now that Liam was gone. Ms McCusker said that when she went into the Fee's house to feed their snakes when they were on holiday in St Andrews there was "nothing out of place" to make her suspect the pair were doing harm. She said: "They are going to be in jail for sometime but they don't even deserve a place in prison because they are still going to get everything paid for them and they are still going to get every day of their lives. "It's not fair because they are going to come out and they are still going to have their own lives to lead and little Liam, where is he? Nowhere. "He's not got a life. So it's never going to be enough, never." She said there was nothing she could have done to stop the couple as she was unaware there were any problems. The former friend also said she did not think social services could have done any more to help the children.	A former friend of the women who murdered toddler Liam Fee has told the BBC that "no sentence" could ever be enough for their crimes.
The 37-year-old, a podium regular in the Grand Tours, says Rio 2016 will be one of his last competitions. Rodriguez lies fifth overall after nine stages of this year's Tour de France, 37 seconds behind leader Chris Froome. "I have no idea what will be my last race," the Katusha rider said. "In theory, Rio and the Vuelta a Espana are still on my programme." He added: "I still enjoy this sport so much but I am 37 years old. One day, I will have to stop anyway and I prefer to do this when I am still riding at a high level.'' In a 17-year career, Rodriguez's best results include a third-placed finish in the 2013 Tour de France, while he came second in the 2012 Giro d'Italia and at last year's Vuelta a Espana. Rodriguez, nicknamed 'Purito' ('Small Cigar' in Spanish), made the announcement during a rest day on the Tour de France.	Spanish cyclist Joaquim Rodriguez says he will retire from the sport by the end of this season.
Steven Walters, 48, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault at Stafford Crown Court in September. Chief Constable David Thompson said the case represented "one of the worst violations of policing integrity I've ever seen". Walters was also found guilty of gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing on Monday and dismissed from the force. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country The crimes took place between February and April 2015. Walters, who was based at Sutton Coldfield, approached a woman in her 20s, who he offered a lift home in his patrol car in the early hours. After a colleague asked the woman "what she was doing at that time of night in that dress", Walters placed his hand on her thigh when she was in the car, leaving the victim feeling "creeped out". In the second assault, the court heard he touched the victim under her skirt in her own home while her children were in other rooms. He attempted to kiss her face and neck, and also asked to be taken to a bedroom. Sentencing, Judge Paul Glenn said Walters had shown no remorse, adding: "The public are entitled to have faith in police officers and to trust them in the discharge of their powers and responsibilities. "You exploited that trust and you have brought disgrace on yourself and indeed the force you served." Derrick Campbell, from the Independent Police Complaints Commission, praised the victims for their "courage and bravery" in reporting his crimes. "[Walters] completely abused his position of trust by targeting and taking advantage of vulnerable women for his own sexual gratification," he said.	A West Midlands police officer who admitted sexually assaulting two women has been jailed for four years.
Northumberland County Council said the weather was now warm enough for its Jetpatcher machines to tackle the holes. It is hoped that 145 potholes each day will be "filled in" over the next four months, the council said. Extra staff will also be out repairing drainage systems damaged by heavy rain and to clear debris from gutters.	A county council has set aside £1m to fix almost 3,000 portholes created during Storm Desmond flooding.
The boy had lived with the twin in his stomach his whole life, but went to hospital after complaining of pain. His mother told Bernama the foetus "was formed with organs like those of a baby". It is believed to be the first reported case of the condition, known medically as "fetus in fetu", in Malaysia. The boy's mother, 38, said funeral rites had been performed on the foetus and it was buried at a local cemetery. Reports said the foetus had legs, hands and genitals. "Only the nose and mouth were not complete," she said, saying she had accepted his fate. The teenager had been admitted to a local district hospital before being referred to the Sultan Abdul Hamid Hospital in Kedah for the operation to remove the twin. The hospital and Malaysia's government health officials would not comment on the case to the BBC. What is fetus in fetu? Dr S Raman, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist at Pantai Hospital in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, told the BBC it is when an "additional twin gets absorbed into the body of the living twin". "It's almost like a vanishing twin, or sometimes called a parasitic twin," he said. "I have actually seen a case of the foetus being attached to the outside of the living twin, so it's possible for the twin to be both inside or outside the body." There have also been cases of two twins found inside the abdomen of one child, in the case of a triplet pregnancy. What causes it? There is no known trigger, but it occurs in the early stages of development when one foetus wraps around the other. The enveloped twin then does not fully form but becomes a "parasite", relying on their host twin for their survival. Such twins usually die before birth. The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births. Is it unusual to live so long with the twin? One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing. In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman. The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.	A 15-year-old Malaysian boy has had the parasitic foetus of his twin removed from his stomach, Malaysia's Bernama state news agency reports.
Media playback is not supported on this device Team GB won four medals in Sochi, which matched their total from the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924 in France. Six sports shared a fund of £13.4m over the past four years, but that pot could now be boosted for the 2018 Olympics. We should shed this idea of not being a winter nation. Actually it's not true - we can be "It's been an outstanding Games and the athletes need and deserve the support," said UK Sport chief Liz Nicholl. "I can't say what the investment will be from sport-to-sport as we'll discuss that with them over the coming weeks and months, but I am anticipating more investment in winter sport." Lizzy Yarnold continued Britain's proud tradition of winning a medal at each Olympics in which the sport of skeleton has featured by claiming gold in Russia. The men's curling team took silver and the women bronze, while snowboarder Jenny Jones finished third in slopestyle's Olympic debut. Great Britain finished 19th in the medal table, but the plan - based on the sort of "no compromise" funding policy applied to summer sports post-2006 - is to be higher in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in four years. "We're anticipating building on it and will be going for more medals in 2018," said Nicholl. "The success has shown that the approach we have taken to athletes, and supporting sports with medal prospects, is working. Media playback is not supported on this device "It gives us a huge amount of confidence in the system." Four-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Matthew Pinsent, who has covered both the Vancouver and Sochi Games for the BBC, believes now is the time for winter events to receive the same support as the summer sports. "I think some of the winter sports, like curling, freestyle and short track are performing like summer sports, so why offer different support?" he said. "Germany and Norway don't make this distinction and I think we should shed this idea of not being a winter nation. Actually it's not true - we can be." 1924: Men (curling) 1936: Men (ice hockey) 1952: Jeannette Altwegg (figure skating) 1964: Tony Nash & Robin Dixon (two-man bobsleigh) 1976: John Curry (figure skating) 1980: Robin Cousins (figure skating) 1984: Jayne Torvill & Christopher Dean (figure skating) 2002: Women (curling) 2010: Amy Williams (skeleton) 2014: Lizzy Yarnold (skeleton) * Madge Syers won figure skating gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London Nicholl said that the funding award would not be anywhere near the £272m divided between 19 summer Olympic sports but insisted that did not mean Team GB could not continue to make improvements. "We'll never be topping the table with the Russians and Canadians, but we can make gains and that is what our investment principles are based on," she said. Having achieved a bronze medal and a record six top-10 finishes, the British freestyle skiing and snowboarding team are well placed for a significant increase on the £1.5m they have received since 2012. "We have big plans on how we can develop and grow the freestyle programme and are hopeful UK Sport will help invest in that alongside commercial partners," Lesley McKenna, British Park and Pipe programme manager, told BBC Sport. The British bobsleigh duo of Paula Walker and Rebekah Wilson were the only team to miss their UK Sport performance target, finishing 12th when seeking a top-eight result. Success does cost money but we are committed to investment However, the men's four-man bobsleigh came an impressive fifth, just 0.11 seconds off the podium. GB Bobsleigh performance director Gary Anderson is hopeful that the set-up - which received £3.3m leading into Sochi and has invested heavily in new technology - will continue to be backed. "We are only halfway through an eight-year programme and with support through to 2018 I'm convinced we can challenge for not just one medal, but in all three events [men's two- and four-man and women's two-man bob]," he told BBC Sport. UK Sport recently axed funding for basketball, synchronised swimming, water polo and weightlifting but Nicholl insisted this announcement was not related to the performances of winter sport athletes in Sochi. It will now enter a series of meetings with officials from all British Winter Olympic disciplines about performance targets over the next four years and reveal its decision in June.	UK Sport says it expects to increase funding for winter sports following Great Britain's record-equalling Winter Olympic performance in Sochi.
The FBI has ordered Apple to disable the security software on a dead murderer's iPhone but the tech giant has refused. Mark Zuckerberg said he did not believe the authorities should have backdoors to bypass encryption protection. However, a lawyer representing some of the gunman's victims has backed the federal bureau. Stephen Larson, a former judge, said he intended to file legal paperwork next month telling Apple to co-operate. "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," he added. He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee. Mr Zuckerberg made his comments at the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona. "I don't think that requiring back doors to encryption is either going to be an effective thing to increase security or is really the right thing to do," he said. "We are pretty sympathetic to Tim [Cook] and Apple." He added that Facebook was committed to doing all it could to prevent terrorism but his company was in favour of encryption. The social network had previously issued a statement saying that the court order could create a "chilling precedent". Leaders at Google and Twitter also voiced support for Apple last week. Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in California last December. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has described the FBI's order as "dangerous" and "unprecedented". He has said the firm would have to build a new operating system in order to comply. "We strongly believe the only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn't abused and doesn't fall into the wrong hands is to never create it," the firm stated in a Q&A on the Apple website. In a statement published on Sunday, the FBI Director James Comey said the demand was "about the victims and justice". "We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly," the FBI director wrote. "That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land. "Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn't. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead." Last week anti-virus creator John McAfee offered to unlock the iPhone for the FBI. "It will take us three weeks," he told Business Insider, adding that he would eat his shoe on television if his team failed.	Facebook's chief executive has said he is sympathetic to Apple's position in its clash with the FBI.
CIA code that obscures malware's origins was detailed in the latest release by the whistle-blowing site. The code could be used to create a "signature" for CIA malware, said one virus hunter. The information is part of a larger cache about CIA hacking tools that started to be released last month. The release of the information could be "one of the most technically damaging" said Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California in Berkeley, in an interview with the Washington Post. "It seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations and attribute previous operations," he said. Before now, the information released about the CIA's hacking tools by Wikileaks has largely been only text describing many different ways the agency spies on targets. The latest release differs as it involves actual code used to hide the ultimate origins of malware used by the US organisation. It shows the obfuscation techniques used to make it harder to reverse engineer malware to unmask who made it. Included in the code library are fragments of Chinese and Farsi that are intended to be used in malware, as well as methods of moving data around that seek to thwart tools examining whether different samples have anything in common. Jake Williams, founder of security firm Rendition InfoSec, said the release was "significant". "It allows the attribution of previously discovered malware to the CIA specifically," he wrote, adding that the code samples could add up to a signature for spotting agency work. "It is likely that malware has been discovered previously which was not attributed to CIA then, but can be today thanks to the release of the code," he said. The CIA would not comment on the authenticity of the information released by Wikileaks, but a spokesman said Americans should be "deeply troubled" by the organisation's actions. "Dictators and terrorists have no better friend in the world than Julian Assange, as theirs is the only privacy he protects," said the spokesman.	Current spying campaigns run by the CIA could be disrupted, say experts, after more data on the agency's hacking techniques was released by Wikileaks.
Speaking in Athens, Moshe Yaalon said IS had "enjoyed Turkish money for oil for a very, very long period of time". Turkey denies allowing IS smuggling and the US recently rejected Russian claims that Turkish government officials were in league with the militants. IS has captured swathes of Syria and Iraq, including operational oil fields. "It's up to Turkey, the Turkish government, the Turkish leadership, to decide whether they want to be part of any kind of cooperation to fight terrorism," Mr Yaalon told reporters after a meeting with his Greek counterpart. "This is not the case so far. As you know, Daesh [Islamic State] enjoyed Turkish money for oil for a very, very long period of time. I hope that it will be ended." Mr Yaalon also alleged that Turkey had "permitted jihadists to move from Europe to Syria and Iraq and back". US state department officials last month rejected Russian allegations of Turkish government involvement but a state department spokesman said IS oil was being smuggled into Turkey via middlemen. Efforts by Israel and Turkey to repair damaged ties already hit a setback this month over demands for compensation for the deaths of 10 Turkish activists on a ship carrying pro-Palestinian activists in 2010. They were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who intercepted a flotilla trying to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. Senior Israeli and Turkish officials met in December to try to repair relations, raising hopes of progress in negotiations to import Israeli natural gas. Q&A: What happened on the Gaza flotilla?	Israel's defence minister has accused Turkey of buying oil from the so-called Islamic State (IS) group, thereby funding the militants' activities.
Andrew Travers left the authority by "mutual agreement" after the error, officials said. Voters were initially turned away from all 155 polling stations in the borough because their names were missing from the poll list. An independent investigation has been launched, the council said. In a statement issued through the council, Mr Travers said: "I have enjoyed my time at Barnet and I believe the changes we have put in place and the continued programme of growth and transformation will enable the borough to continue to thrive." A council spokesperson said Mr Travers had "made a valuable contribution to the council during his three and half years as chief executive." Deputy chief executive John Hooton will take over temporarily while longer term arrangements are put in place, the council said. On election day, staff at one station said just three of the first 30 voters to show up were on the register. The rest were told to come back later. Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected. But voters in the area questioned how the result could be "fair" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box. A statement released by Mr Travers on Thursday blamed electoral registration lists for the problems. The council's review will conclude by the end of May and the findings will be presented publicly to the General Functions Committee. It will look at the "appropriateness" of arrangements in place for the EU Referendum in June. A spokesman said it was currently in discussions to establish who would lead the investigation.	The chief executive of Barnet Council has left his role after a blunder led to some voters being turned away from polling stations on Thursday.

Mohit Dupar, 36, attempted to reach Gustavo Silva Da Cruz, 19, after he got into difficulty at Camber Sands, East Sussex, on 24 July. Mr Silva Da Cruz died at the scene. Mr Dupar died in hospital four days later. East Sussex coroner Alan Craze said he would be looking at what public safety measures could be used at the beach. More news from Sussex The inquest in Hastings was told Mr Dupar, from Hayes, west London, died from a brain injury caused by cardiac arrest due to drowning. His 17-year-old son Ankush was also pulled from the sea, and remained in a coma for three weeks. Mr Silva Da Cruz, a Brazilian national who had been visiting family in Croydon, south London, died from drowning with his asthma possibly an exacerbating factor, the inquest heard. Robert Cass, of Rother District Council, said he believed the incoming tide meant the men became stranded and unable to get off a sandbar . Mr Craze adjourned the hearing and said he was considering verdicts of misadventure. A pre-inquest review into the deaths of five men from London was also held in Hastings. Kenugen Saththiyanathan, 18, known as Ken, and his brother Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, known as Kobi, both of Normandy Way, Erith, south-east London, were among the friends who died in the sea at Camber Sands on 24 August. Nitharsan Ravi, 22, of Admaston Road, Plumstead, south-east London, Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, of Chadwell Road, Grays, Essex, and Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, of Elsa Road, Welling, south-east London, were also in the group. A date for a full inquest was not formally fixed, and a decision on whether the inquest would be heard in front of a jury was deferred. The coroner said he would want to hear expert evidence into what public safety measures would be practical and recommendable, including the possibility of having sections of the beach for swimming only. "The provision of safety for the vast numbers of people that go to Camber is now an extremely important matter, and I owe it to the community as a whole to investigate as far as I conceivably can do," Mr Craze said.	A man died after trying to rescue a day-tripper from the sea a month before five young friends died at the same beach, an inquest has heard.
Education Workforce Council figures showed 13 of 34 staff were barred for such conduct from August 2013 to 2015. Two more were suspended, while three others were banned for other misconduct involving sexual content. The National Union of Teachers said it was not a common occurrence in schools. David Evans, secretary of National Union of Teachers Cymru, said: "We have to be mindful when reviewing these figures that this is a very small number of teachers across the whole profession over a period of a few years. This is by no means a common occurrence in our schools." He added the union often dealt with malicious and false allegations against teachers, which remained a concern, but said it was right allegations were investigated and any teachers found abusing their positions should face the full consequences. Donald Findlater, of child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, said the changing online environment and social networking in recent years had introduced "massive challenges and risks". He said some staff got into trouble out of naivety, rather than malice, and schools must ensure adequate training is given so teachers know the boundaries. A spokeswoman for child abuse charity NSPCC Cymru said: "Schools need to be rigorous in their recruitment and checking processes and provide regular training about appropriate behaviour, making it absolutely clear that crossing the line will never be tolerated." During the same period, other teachers were disciplined after being convicted of driving, alcohol, drugs, harassment and fraud offences. Others were punished for assaulting pupils, helping children cheat during tests, failing to achieve required standards, not following health and safety procedures, and failing to investigate bullying.	Nearly 40% of teachers banned from the profession in Wales in the last two years have been struck off for having "inappropriate" relationships or conversations with pupils.
The portal, for the match against Poland, will be open to supporters on a priority list who were were informed they had missed out on Tuesday. UEFA is to make about 1,000 extra tickets available to Northern Ireland fans. Northern Ireland are  to play Poland, Ukraine and Germany in France in June. On Tuesday, the IFA said it was "inundated" with calls from angry Northern Ireland fans unable to purchase tickets. Some fans who said they ranked near the top of the IFA's 'priority list' missed out on tickets for the Poland game. Particularly affected were fans who applied for category 3 tickets, the second cheapest kind. "We discovered there was an issue yesterday morning on this with quite a number of people finding they hadn't got tickets in category 3 for the Poland game," IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson said. "We got straight onto Uefa and with Uefa's senior management team, we've worked through that issue now. We've identified with Uefa that there's almost another 1,000 tickets that they're going to make available for us, particularly for those fans. "The 900 or so fans that we're talking about here will have priority access, in fact specific access, to a portal that Uefa are setting up and they should be able to buy tickets. "We've been talking to Uefa for not quite the last 24 hours, but probably 21 of the last 24 hours over this and we're fairly confident that Uefa will manage this in the right way." A points system had been put in place for the games to establish a priority list for tickets, favouring fans who had attended the most matches at home and abroad. However, on Tuesday Gary McAllister from the Amalgamation of Official NI Supporters Clubs said many fans were now asking whether the loyalty scheme has been implemented correctly. He missed out on a ticket to the Poland game, despite having 27 loyalty points out of a possible 29. In the Republic of Ireland, fans have not yet heard if they have been successful in securing tickets. Irish Times chief football writer Emmet Malone said the experience of Northern Ireland supporters has worried fans in the Republic of Ireland. Speaking to BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Wednesday, Mr Malone said there was "a lot of pessimism" among Ireland fans. "The FAI [Football Association of Ireland] is supposed to start informing people, possibly as early as this afternoon, as to who got tickets here," he said. "But our applications were far more oversubscribed than the IFA's, so a lot of people are very concerned about what will happen." Mr Malone said there was particular concern that the FAI's loyalty scheme was only introduced in 2015, so is it relatively new. "The FAI have  been quite vague with fan groups over requests to publish the points that everybody has, how the categories break down, who's going to be compared with who in terms of pecking order. "That vagueness is going to lead to an awful lot of bad feeling here over the next few days."	The Irish Football Association has said Uefa will set up a portal for Northern Ireland supporters to apply for extra European Championship tickets.
The fields affected, and another eight associated platforms, produce about 10% of the UK's oil output. Hydrocarbons were detected inside a leg of the Cormorant Alpha platform. Its operator, Taqa Bratani, has removed non-essential workers as a precaution and said the leak had been contained. Shutting down the platform affects the whole Brent pipeline system. The oil leak at Cormorant Alpha was discovered on Monday and non-essential crew were taken off the installation by helicopter. Taqa, also known as Abu Dhabi National Energy, said nothing had leaked into the sea and a technical team was investigating the source. Taqa said on Wednesday afternoon that it was "currently evaluating plans to restore the throughput of an estimated 80,000 barrels per day in the Brent pipeline, excluding any Cormorant Alpha production." A spokesperson said: "This action would occur after thorough technical assurance has established that it can be undertaken safely and without any increased risk." The BBC understands the rest of the Brent pipeline system can no longer operate because Cormorant Alpha, which is situated some 94 miles from Lerwick in Shetland, is a crucial pumping station. Eight other platforms have shut down with up to 27 North Sea fields affected. The Dunlin, Thistle, Northern Producer, Murchison, North Alwyn, Tern, Eider and North Cormorant platforms are also affected. Oil and Gas UK - the offshore industry body - said oil transported through the Brent pipeline system represented 10% of the UK's North Sea oil production. The amount of output affected is 90,000 barrels per day. It is not yet known what potential impact the shut down could have on petrol station prices. However Prof Alex Kemp, an oil economist at the University of Aberdeen, said the closure would have a limited impact on oil prices. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "What we have is an incident which impacts on the Brent pricing system which is used as a marker price for a lot of the world's production. "If it continues one would expect a limited affect on the Brent price. "But the Brent price doesn't just depend on Brent production, it depends on production from a lot of other fields. "The effect should be limited because although the Brent price is the marker for a huge volume of oil in the world market, Brent production constitutes not all that big a proportion of the total." Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing said: "The Scottish government, including Marine Scotland, are monitoring this situation closely. "No release of hydrocarbons has been reported and all non-essential staff on the platform have been safely removed. "The Health and Safety Executive are investigating and will determine when the pipeline system can be opened again subject to any relevant safety measures being put in place." He said the loss "does not impact security of supply at this time".	A pipeline system servicing up to 27 oil fields has been shut down after a leak on the Cormorant Alpha platform, north-east of Shetland.
However, there is an increased risk in certain groups, the University of Glasgow research found. Overall, veterans were at no greater risk than the general public, whilst both Falklands and Gulf War veterans had a lower risk of suicide. The team studied veterans in Scotland who served between 1960 and 2012. The study compared suicide risk among 56,205 veterans born between 1945 and 1985 with 172,741 matched non-veterans. While overall there was no significant difference in the figures for veterans and non-veterans, the risk increased for: Young veterans were not found to be at increased risk - a finding at odds with an earlier study by the Centre for Suicide Prevention which suggested that ex-servicemen under the age of 24 had a much higher rate of suicide. Asked to explain the differences, lead researcher Dr Beverly Bergman said the two studies used different data and methodologies. She said: "We have a smaller number of veterans but have studied them over a longer time period. "In our study we had only two veterans under the age of 25 who died by suicide. The two studies are not directly comparable." Dr Bergman said there was growing evidence that there is no overall difference in long-term risk of suicide between veterans and non-veterans in the UK. She added: "This is an important study which provides reassurance that military service in the last 50 years does not increase people's risk of suicide overall, but it draws our attention to those people whose increased risk may be overlooked, such as older veterans and women veterans. "It also confirms that early service leavers have a slightly increased risk but that may not manifest itself until middle age." The study, which used data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to examine deaths classified as due to suicide or self-harm, is published in Occupational Medicine.	People who have served in the armed forces in the past 50 years are not at greater risk of suicide than those who have not, according to a new study.
A proposed amendment to the Finance Bill by the SNP and Plaid Cymru, which would have prevented the increase, was defeated by a majority of 295. A Labour-backed amendment calling for the move to be delayed pending an assessment of its impact on vulnerable groups was also defeated. Ministers have said the tax rise is "unavoidable" to reduce the deficit. In a further vote, MPs approved the VAT rise by 321 to 246, a government majority of 75. The votes came during a lengthy debate on the bill, which enacts last month's Budget, in the Commons. Chancellor George Osborne has said the planned rise in the main rate of VAT from 17.5% to 20% is estimated to raise Â£13bn towards reducing the Â£155bn deficit. The move was controversial as the Conservatives said they had "no plans" to raise it during the election while the Lib Dems attacked the Tories - now their now-coalition partners - saying their plans would necessitate a "VAT bombshell". But neither the Conservatives, Labour nor the Lib Dems ruled out raising VAT before the general election. MPs discussed a group of 16 opposition amendments - including a bid by the SNP to scrap the rise altogether and several Labour amendments, including one which would delay the VAT rise until the government has assessed its impact on pensioners, children and those on low fixed incomes. The SNP amendment was defeated by 316 votes to 21. Another Labour amendment, which was also defeated, would have exempted groups such as charities, local authorities and other groups from the VAT rise. A Lib Dem MP, Andrew George, tabled an amendment to peg the rise to just 0.5% - from 17.5% to 18%. "Of all the measures to restore the public finances it seems to me that a VAT rise has to be among the least welcome of all of the alternatives," he told MPs. Treasury minister David Gauke said VAT was "one of the few levers available" to the government to address the shortfall in the public finances. "Any sensible government would consider it. And, given the circumstances we're in, any government would do it." He added: "We had to raise VAT because there was no money left." But shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne said Britain's pensioners may face "an Â£8bn VAT bill over the course of this Parliament". In an interview with the BBC's Daily Politics earlier, shadow chancellor Alistair Darling confirmed Labour had looked at raising VAT to 18% or 19% and said he did "not have a philosophic problem with that" as long as "you do something to help people on low fixed incomes" like pensioners and to ease the effect of spending cuts. He said Labour's amendment was not a "blanket refusal to put up VAT" but a "reasoned and considered amendment" which was calling on the government to do more to help those worst hit by a VAT rise.	The government has seen off calls in Parliament to scrap its planned rise in VAT to 20% from next January.
He said he allowed the girl to marry a 26-year-old Lebanese man, in a ceremony in New South Wales, because he did not want her to have sex outside marriage. The 63 year old was found guilty in April of procuring a child under the age of 14 for unlawful sexual activity. During sentencing in Sydney the judge told him he had "failed" his daughter. She said she hoped the punishment would act as a deterrent to others. The father, who cannot be named to protect his daughter's identity, told Downing Centre District Court that he considered sex outside marriage a sin, so when his daughter reached puberty he decided she should marry. When the Lebanese man, who was in Australia on a student visa, showed an interest, he arranged for a local sheikh to carry out the ceremony. It took place last year in the Hunter Valley region, around 250km (150 miles) north of Sydney. The marriage, which is not recognised under Australian law, was consummated at a hotel on the night of the wedding with the father's permission. The pair also had sex at the father's home the following weekend. The court heard that the girl later had a miscarriage. The man was jailed for seven and a half years in March for the sexual abuse of minor. Australian authorities are now looking after the victim. The judge told the court that religious beliefs did not justify the father's actions. "They were linked in the purpose that (the man) would have sex with his daughter," she added.	An Australian man has been jailed for eight years for arranging an Islamic marriage between his 12-year-old daughter and a man twice her age.
Elderly World War Two veterans lead the crowd. And many of the participants are carrying flowers to lay at the Freedom Monument, Latvia's symbol of national independence. They have come here to commemorate those who died defending Latvia against the Soviet Union in the war. But with Russian troops now in nearby Ukraine, many in the Baltics are alarmed that history may be about to repeat itself. "If Ukraine falls, then Russian ambitions won't stop with this. I believe we will be next in Russia's list of actions," said one young man who had come to take part in the procession. "It shows the attitude of Russia - how it goes into another country very easily and acts in an aggressive manner," said another. But this annual memorial service is highly controversial. These elderly veterans fought against Russia - but for Nazi Germany. The Baltics have spent much of their history being buffeted between neighbouring imperial forces. And in WWII, having already suffered severe oppression under Stalin, many Latvians saw Hitler's forces as the lesser of two evils - Latvia's only chance of not slipping back into Stalinist oppression. But the veterans and their supporters are accused of being Nazi sympathisers - particularly by Latvia's large Russian-speaking community. About 1,000 Russian-speakers have gathered behind police barricades near the monument to protest. "Fascists go home!" shout some. "Shame! Shame!" shout others. This year security is particularly tight, with as many police officers as participants, amid fears that the instability in Ukraine will spark ethnic tensions here. It is a similar dynamic to Ukraine: pro-Moscow local Russian-speakers accusing pro-Western nationalists of being right-wing extremists. And like Ukraine, some Russian-speakers here say they are discriminated against by mainstream society. "I feel like a person who is second-class," says Aleksandr Gaponenko, a Russian-speaker who moved to Soviet-era Latvia with his parents 59 years ago, when he was a one-year-old. "We want equal rights for our languages, and we want equal social and economic rights." Latvia country profile According to the Latvian authorities, throughout the 20th Century people from elsewhere in the USSR were resettled in the Baltics as a deliberate Soviet policy to water down Baltic culture and destroy local national sentiment. And still today Russian-speakers are sometimes pejoratively called "occupiers". So when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Mr Gaponenko, like many Russians, was not automatically granted Latvian citizenship, and lost his job in Riga city council. Today he is classed as a "non-citizen" - which means he is still not allowed to work for the state and does not have the right to vote. Around 300,000 Russian-speakers, or 13% of Latvia's population, are so-called "non-citizens". And they live in an EU member state and member of Nato. To become Latvian, they have to prove their knowledge of the Latvian language and culture in a citizenship test - even if they were born here. Some Russian-speakers, such as Mr Gaponenko, refuse to take the test, saying that the country where they have spent all their lives should grant them citizenship automatically. Others, particularly older people, say they do not speak Latvian well enough to pass the test. But the Latvian government says it is encouraging all residents of Latvia to become citizens. And it accuses the Kremlin of using the issue to stir up resentment within the local Russian-speaking population and create political instability. "There's massive propaganda, even an information warfare - not only here, and not only using Russian-speaking media, but also using other channels," says Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics. Russian-speakers often live very separate lives from their Latvian neighbours, living in different neighbourhoods, often socialising in different places. In Riga city centre, one bar might be full of local Russian-speakers, next door packed with ethnic Latvians. Estimates of numbers of Russian-speakers vary. According to Latvian pollster SKDS, Russian-speakers make up 42% of the population in Latvia, with 58% described as ethnic Latvian. This split in society is exacerbated by the political system. The parties popular with ethnic Latvian voters manage to form convoluted governing coalitions to stay in power. Meanwhile Harmony Centre, a party voted for mainly by Russians-speakers, is stuck in opposition - despite having won more votes than any other single party in the last parliamentary elections of 2011. Most problematic, says political analyst and pollster Arnis Kaktins, is that Russian-speakers often consume all their news from media produced in Moscow, while ethnic Latvians tend to get their information from Latvian or Western news outlets. So the two communities are developing opposing views about who is to blame for the crisis in Ukraine. "When so many people rely heavily on Russian news sources, it means that Russia has an instrument to change their minds if it would like to," says Mr Kaktins. There is a fear that the Kremlin could encourage Latvia's predominantly Russian-speaking border regions to follow Crimea's example and break away from Latvia to join Russia. All three Baltic States are in Nato, so it is seen as unlikely that the Kremlin would send in troops, and start a conflict that the West would feel obliged to respond to militarily. The real worry is that the crisis could increase divisions within Latvian society. Since independence in 1991, Latvia's two communities have lived side-by-side peacefully. But if the conflict in Ukraine gets worse, the rift could grow between Russian-speakers who support Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and ethnic Latvians who support the West.	A mournful procession of about 1,500 Latvians winds its way through Riga's medieval Old Town singing traditional Latvian songs.
The repeal bill, published earlier, is also facing opposition from Labour and other parties in the Commons. Ministers are "optimistic" about getting it through and have promised an "ongoing intense dialogue" with the devolved administrations. No 10 said it had to be passed or "there will be no laws" after Brexit. Brexit Secretary David Davis called it "one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament". He rejected claims ministers were giving themselves "sweeping powers" to make changes to laws as they are repatriated. It will be up to MPs if they want a say on the "technical changes" ministers plan to make to legislation, he told the BBC. Labour says it will not support the bill in its current form and is demanding concessions in six areas, including the incorporation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights into British law. The party wants guarantees workers' rights will be protected and also want curbs on the power of government ministers to alter legislation without full parliamentary scrutiny. Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was in Brussels earlier for a meeting with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, said: "Far too much of it seems to be a process where the government... will be able to bypass Parliament. "We will make sure there is full parliamentary scrutiny. We have a Parliament where the government doesn't have a majority, we have a country which voted in two ways on Leave or Remain. "The majority voted to leave and we respect that, but they didn't vote to lose jobs and they didn't vote to have Parliament ridden roughshod over." The Conservatives are relying on Democratic Unionist Party support to win key votes after losing their Commons majority in the general election, but could face a revolt from Remain supporting backbenchers. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there could be "parliamentary guerrilla warfare" on the bill, as opposition parties and "Remainer Tories" try to "put their version of Brexit, not Theresa May's, on to the statute book". The repeal bill is not expected to be debated by MPs until the Autumn, but will need to have been passed by the time the UK leaves the EU - which is due to happen in March 2019. But the Scottish and Welsh governments have to give "legislative consent" to the bill before it can become law - something they have said they are not willing to do. In a joint statement, first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, who also met Mr Barnier, described the bill as a "naked power-grab" by Westminster that undermined the principles of devolution. They say the bill returns powers from Brussels solely to the UK government and Parliament and "imposes new restrictions" on the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Ministers at Holyrood will not be able to amend EU rules in devolved areas such as agriculture and fisheries after Brexit until the UK Parliament and Scottish government have reached an agreement on them. UK Scottish Secretary David Mundell claimed the repeal bill would result in a powers "bonanza" for Holyrood - a comment described as "ludicrous" by the SNP. Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the repeal bill was a "hugely important piece of legislation" because "we need to have a functioning statute book on the day we leave the EU". The spokesman said First Secretary of State Damian Green had contacted the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the government was confident of gaining their consent. Asked if there was a contingency plan if he didn't win their backing, the prime minister's official spokesman said "not that I'm aware of". Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose party is seeking to join forces with Labour and Tory rebels, said he was "putting the government on warning", promising a tougher test than than it faced when passing legislation authorising the UK's departure from the EU. "If you found the Article 50 Bill difficult, you should be under no illusion, this will be hell," he said. Steve Baker, a minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union, said the government was "ready" for a fight over the bill but would also to "listen to Parliament". Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davies predicted the bill "may get amendments here and there", saying he was open to suggestions from other parties for things that should be included. "If we've missed something and got something wrong, then we'll debate that in the House of Commons," he said. "That's how this works." Mr Davis also insisted contingency plans were being made in case the UK and the EU cannot agree a Brexit deal. "We are planning for all options," he said. "The ideal outcome... right through to it not working at all and not getting a negotiated outcome at all." Asked why Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had said the government had "no plan" for such a scenario, he said: "That's possibly because it's my responsibility to plan for it."	The Scottish and Welsh governments have threatened to block the key Brexit bill which will convert all existing EU laws into UK law.
The Seasiders' Andy Taylor came close to the opening goal after five minutes, curling just over from 20 yards. Wycombe were denied by the woodwork in the 25th minute as Michael Harriman's looping 20-yard strike came back off the crossbar. Harriman came close again nine minutes later but sent a header straight at goalkeeper Sam Slocombe, while at the other end Brad Potts met Mark Cullen's cross but nodded wide from three yards. Wycombe started the second half on the front foot as Adebayo Akinfenwa brought the ball down and unleashed a powerful 25-yard strike which was inches over the bar. On the hour mark, a cleverly-worked low corner created a chance for Blackpool but Potts fired over from eight yards. The hosts almost snatched a winner in the 81st minute, forcing Blackman to produce a fingertip save to deny Cullen from 12 yards before the on-loan Chelsea youngster pushed Jim McAlister's 25-yard strike wide.

The former Oceana nightclub building will be demolished in October and replaced with a new office block. It forms part of the council's plans to transform the Kingsway into a business district. The authority is moving from its seafront location as part of a wider regeneration of the city centre. Work is due to start in 2017. The current civic centre site is likely to be replaced with public spaces, tourist attractions and homes. Swansea council bought the Oceana building - which was once at the heart of the city's nightlife - in May and it is understood it has been earmarked as the potential new home for the civic centre and central library. Demolition is due to take until March. "Once we have control of that site we will look at the development and possibly start construction in 2016 to build offices which could be home for the council offices and Swansea library," said Swansea council leader Rob Stewart. The building, originally constructed by the Rank Organisation in 1967 for a cinema, has accommodated a number of nightclubs over the years, including Ritzy and Icon, Time and Envy, and most recently, Oceana. It also previously housed an Odeon cinema and Tesco before they were turned into a different club and bar respectively. But it is no longer fit for purpose and a council move is one of a number of options being considered for the site.	The site which used to house Swansea's biggest nightclub could become the new home for Swansea council and library.

Chasing 268 in the first Test, Australia were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia - the world's top-ranked Test side - had a first-innings lead of 86. But Kusal Mendis' superb 176 - his first Test century - and 5-54 from Rangana Herath proved decisive. Australia captain Steve Smith made a gritty 55 before tail-enders Steve O'Keefe and Peter Nevill resisted for 178 balls, scoring four. The second Test of the three-match series takes place in Galle, starting on Thursday, 4 August. O'Keefe and Nevill's ninth-wicket stand came at just 0.13 runs an over, before debutant Dhananjaya de Silva had Nevill caught behind. The previous record for a partnership lasting 100 balls or more was 0.64 by South Africa's Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers against India last December. Australia survived just 15 further deliveries before Herath claimed his ninth wicket of the match to secure Sri Lanka's first win over the Baggy Greens since 1999, and second in 27 attempts.	Sri Lanka beat Australia by 106 runs in Pallekele to claim only their second Test victory over the tourists, who set a Test match record in defeat.
Twenty-five suspects were released because of a lack of evidence. It is the latest batch of death sentences passed in connection with the killings - 36 men were hanged a year ago for their part in the massacre. IS filmed the killings, at the former US base of Camp Speicher, near Tikrit, in an early piece of shock propaganda. Most of the victims are believed to have been young Shia recruits who were based at the camp when Tikrit was overrun by IS. Photos and videos published by IS at the time showed soldiers being lined up and shot at various locations. Some bodies were pushed into the River Tigris, while others were buried in mass graves that were found after government forces recaptured the city a year later. The condemned men have the right to appeal against the sentences.	An Iraqi court has sentenced to death 27 men for their involvement in the massacre of up to 1,700 soldiers by so-called Islamic State (IS) in June 2014.
Christopher Clarke, 29, contacted girls, aged 15 and 16 at the time, via Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter. He also bought the Ysgol Bro Dinefwr pupils gifts including T-shirts, earrings, sweets and games consoles. An Education Workforce Council hearing concluded his actions amounted to professional misconduct. One girl told how Mr Clarke sent her a message saying: "I kept having the same thought over and over again. How much I wanted to grab you, kiss you..." The girl, now 19, said he also invited her to one-on-one sessions in his chemistry office and told her not to show anyone the gifts her gave her. Another girl, now 17, said his actions made her feel uncomfortable and he was "acting in a creepy nature". A third student said she told Mr Clarke she thought his messages were inappropriate and he later asked her to delete their conversation. Police investigated but no charges were brought against Mr Clarke. The school also began an investigation but he resigned before any findings were made. Education Workforce Council chairman, Steve Powell, said Mr Clarke's conduct "clearly breached boundaries between teachers and pupils". "His actions fell very short of the standards expected of a registered person and amounted to unacceptable professional conduct," he added.	A Carmarthenshire teacher who sent thousands of sexual messages to three pupils has been banned from teaching for five years.

Nottinghamshire Police said it would expand its categories to include misogynistic incidents. It means abuse or harassment which might not be a crime can be reported to and investigated by the police, and support for the victim put in place. Nottingham Women's Centre said it hopes it will help give more victims the courage to report incidents. Chief Constable Sue Fish claimed it will make the county a safer place for women. "What women face, often on a daily basis, is absolutely unacceptable and can be extremely distressing," she said. "Nottinghamshire Police is committed to taking misogynistic hate crime seriously and encourages anyone who is affected by it to contact us without hesitation." Work on the idea first started with the Nottinghamshire Safer for Women Conference last year, co-hosted by the police with the Nottingham Women's Centre. BBC TV reporter Sarah Teale was harassed in the street while reporting on the conference. The force defines misogyny hate crime as: "Incidents against women that are motivated by an attitude of a man towards a woman and includes behaviour targeted towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman." The classification now means people can report incidents which might not be considered to be a crime and the police will investigate. Nottingham Women's Centre has been helping train call centre, force control staff and officers on the beat to recognise misogynistic hate crime and ways to tackle it. These officers will also examine if and how a victim can be supported or if anything can be done to help prevent them being targeted again. Domestic abuse will not be recorded as a misogyny hate crime because it has its own procedure, the force said. Melanie Jeffs, centre manager at Nottingham Women's Centre, said: "We're pleased to see Nottinghamshire Police recognise the breadth of violence and intimidation that women experience on a daily basis in our communities." She added: "Recording this as a hate crime will give us a detailed picture of how often, when and where it is happening. It has been very difficult to build that picture before but we will now get detailed data to analyse. "Showing that the police take it seriously will also give people the confidence to come forward and report offences." A crime that the victim or any other person perceives to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards any aspect of a person's identity. Police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland annually monitor five strands of hate crime: Forces can include their own definition of a hate crime with several recently adding sub cultures.	Harassment of women is to be recorded as a hate crime in a bid to tackle sexist abuse.
The Australian author died in the coastal town of Byron Bay in New South Wales state surrounded by family. Oz often covered taboo topics including homosexuality, abortion, police brutality and censorship. The magazine was caught up in a high-profile obscenity trial in the UK in 1971.

The child's story captured the attention of the Northern Ireland public as each step of his cancer battle was followed on social networking sites. Neville's solicitor told the court his 33-year-old client was "utterly ashamed" of his actions. The lawyer said he had got into financial difficulty and was under threat of eviction from his home. He added that Neville had written a letter of apology to the the Knox family. Sentencing him to eight months in prison, the judge said it was absolutely shocking he would use circumstances such as a child's death for financial gain. Neville, who is currently in prison for other offences, was told his term will run concurrently with his sentence. The Knox family set up the Oscar Knox Appeal and still use the networking sites to raise awareness and funds for organisations helping children with Neuroblastoma.	A disc jockey has been jailed for eight months for stealing money from a children's cancer charity linked to the Oscar Knox appeal.
In a study on mice, Hsp90 inhibitors were found to strip cancer cells of defences against hormone treatments. This makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug-resistant cancers, the research team said. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK. About one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives. It mainly affects men over the age of 50. The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments, which target androgen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called androgens. But some prostate cancers don't work that way. Instead they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment. This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive, difficult-to-treat cancers. The latest research, published in the journal Cancer Research, found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors. Professor Paul Workman, study author and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, said it was an exciting discovery. "We call Hsp90 inhibitors 'network drugs' because they tackle several of the signals that are hijacked in cancer all at once, across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway. "These drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein, and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance." Prof Workman said the next step was to test the Hsp90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive, drug-resistant prostate cancer. Prof Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: "These drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options."	A new type of drug could benefit men with aggressive prostate cancer that is no longer responding to treatment, researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research have said.
Media playback is not supported on this device Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine. Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season. Media playback is not supported on this device	Of his last 30 matches in 2016, Andy Murray won 28 and lost just two.
The Giants got a short-handed opener through player-coach Derrick Walser but Jeff Dimmen pulled the Panthers level. In the second period Mike Forney's powerplay breakaway goal make it 2-1 with Andy Bohmback equalising. Mike Radja scored from an acute angle and James Desmarais made it 4-2 before Nottingham's David Ling got one back. The teams meet again on Saturday night in the second match of their double-header. Nottingham lead the league on 28 points, with Sheffield Steelers on 27 and Belfast 25.	The Belfast Giants shaded a 4-3 win over Nottingham Panthers on Friday night to close the gap on the Elite League leaders to three points.
Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) found items including a tiger's head, monkey skulls, reptiles and stuffed birds of prey during raids in Newton Abbot, Devon. The man, 40, was arrested on suspicion of breaking laws protecting endangered species and bailed until September. It follows the seizure by the UK Border Force of a chameleon preserved in formaldehyde at Heathrow. The reptile, found last month, had been shipped from the United States. As a controlled species, there were strict rules in place to prevent its illegal importation. The discovery led NCA officers, supported by UK Border Force officers, to a Newton Abbot business address on Thursday. Dawn Cartwright, from the NCA's Border Policing Command, said: "Unregulated imports or exports of rare species can have a devastating impact on their survival, which is why the law around moving them is so strict and we take potential breaches of that law so seriously. "Working with Border Force and our law enforcement partners, we will continue to target the international criminal trade in endangered species."	A man has been arrested after a haul of exotic animal parts was seized.
A fire was started when the building was broken into sometime between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning. The museum is located in the Bogside, close to where some of the 14 victims of Bloody Sunday were killed in 1972. John Kelly, whose brother, Michael, was killed said the damage to the building could have been a lot worse. "I looked at it and thought: "Good God, if that had really caught fire, we could have had an explosion". A Â£2.4m reconstruction of the Glenfada Park museum began in 2015 and is now close to completion. Mr Kelly has been working on the project for the past 10 years. "It shows total disrespect for my brother and all those who died during Bloody Sunday and all the others who lost their lives in that period of time, total disrespect for our family members and their memory," he said. "The police told me there was a fire and it was in the back store, that's where we have the gas mains and electronic equipment as well. "The building is next door to people's houses and everyone could have been affected by it. It didn't travel any further, thank God, and we still have an intact building," Mr Kelly added. Building site foreman Dermott McGrotty said they have now improved security at the site. "They had to climb over an eight foot fence to get in, so overnight security has now been arranged and we're making sure the doors are well secured." The Northern Ireland Fire Service is treating the fire as deliberate. The police have appealed for information.	An arson attack on the site of the new Museum of Free Derry shows "total disrespect" for victims, a Bloody Sunday relative has said.
US experts found B3, also known as nicotinamide, boosts the ability of immune cells to kill Staphylococcus bacteria. B3 increases the numbers and efficacy of neutrophils, white blood cells that can kill and eat harmful bugs. The study, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, could lead to a "major change in treatment", a UK expert said. B3 was tested on Staphylococcal infections, such as the potentially fatal MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Such infections are found in hospitals and nursing homes, but are also on the rise in prisons, the military and among athletes. The scientists used extremely high doses of B3 - far higher than that obtained from dietary sources - in their tests, carried out both on animals and on human blood. And the researchers say there is as yet no evidence that dietary B3 or supplements could prevent or treat bacterial infections. The researchers say B3 appears to be able to "turn on" certain antimicrobial genes, boosting the immune cells' killing power. Prof Adrian Gombart, of Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute, who worked on the research, said: "This is potentially very significant, although we still need to do human studies. "Antibiotics are wonder drugs, but they face increasing problems with resistance by various types of bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus. "This could give us a new way to treat Staph infections that can be deadly, and might be used in combination with current antibiotics. "It's a way to tap into the power of the innate immune system and stimulate it to provide a more powerful and natural immune response." Prof Mark Enright, of the University of Bath, said: "Neutrophils  are really the front line against infections in the blood and the use of nicotinamide seems safe at this dose to use in patients as it is already licensed for use. "This could cause a major change in treatment for infections alongside conventional antibiotics to help bolster patients immune system. "I would like to see in patient clinical trials but cannot see why this couldn't be used straight away in infected patients."	Vitamin B3 could be the new weapon in the fight against superbugs such as MRSA, researchers have suggested.
Malaysia's attorney general cleared Mr Najib of allegations of corruption on Tuesday after ruling that the money was a donation from the Saudi royal family. Mr Najib had denied that the money came from state investment fund 1MDB. The Saudi source said the donation was made amid concern in Riyadh about the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood. At the time, Malaysia's opposition alliance included the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Its founders were inspired by the Brotherhood, although there is little evidence the Brotherhood actually has much support in Malaysia. Mr Najib's coalition went on to win the election, but with one of its poorest showings in more than 50 years in power. Malaysia's 'mysterious millions' - case solved? 1MDB: The case riveting Malaysia Profile: Najib Razak The secretive donation to Mr Najib was allegedly paid over in several wire transfers between late March 2013 and early April 2013, just ahead of the election on 5 May. The well-placed Saudi source, who has asked not to be named, told the BBC the payment was authorised from the very top - from Saudi Arabia's late King Abdullah - with funds coming from both his personal finances and state funds. Prince Turki bin Abdullah, one of the king's sons, is reported to have had extensive business dealings in Malaysia. The purpose of the donation was simple, said the Saudi source - it was to help Mr Najib and his coalition win the election, employing a strategic communications team with international experience, focusing on the province of Sarawak, and funding social programmes through party campaigning. But why should the Saudis care about an election in a non-Arab country more than 6,000 km (3,700 miles) away? The answer, the source said, lay in their concerns over the rising power of the Muslim Brotherhood, which they consider a terrorist organisation. The Saudis were already upset at events in Egypt, where President Mohammed Morsi was busy consolidating the Brotherhood's hold on the country. It would be another three months before Mr Morsi was to be deposed by the army, and the Saudis were convinced that the opposition was being supported by the Brotherhood and Qatar, which backed the Brotherhood and other Islamist groups in the Middle East. So how unusual is it for the Saudi royal family to hand over this amount of cash in a personal donation? Not at all, said the Saudi insider, adding that Jordan, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan have all been beneficiaries of multi-$100m donations from the Saudi royal purse. "There is nothing unusual about this donation to Malaysia," he said. "It is very similar to how the Saudis operate in a number of countries." Saudi Arabia was quick to support the overthrow of Mr Morsi in Egypt, providing the military-backed government with billions of dollars in aid and loans. Jordan has been the beneficiary of more than $1bn in Saudi development funding, while Riyadh has deposited more than $1bn in Sudan's central bank and signed deals to finance dams on the Nile. Morocco has been provided with oil, financing, investments and jobs in recent years. However, questions are still being asked about the secretive and convoluted nature of the money transfer, and the fact that Malaysia's prime minister returned 91% of it just four months later. The remaining $61m has not been accounted for. A British corporate investigator with extensive experience of the Middle East told the BBC that the $681m was paid through the Singapore branch of a Swiss bank owned by the rulers of Abu Dhabi. "It is very murky", he said. "This case will never be fully cleared up until the Saudis and the Malaysians release all the transaction data, and that has not happened." There has been growing outrage in some circles in Malaysia that the attorney-general has closed the file on this case and cleared the prime minister of any offences. Clare Rewcastle Brown, who has reported extensively on the issue for the Sarawak Report, said the claim that the payment to Mr Najib was a Saudi royal donation for political purposes needed to be treated "with considerable caution". She told the BBC that the $681m was far more likely to be connected to money raised by 1MDB, much of which is reported to have gone missing.	The $681m (Â£479m) deposited in the bank account of Malaysian PM Najib Razak by Saudi Arabia was to help him win the 2013 elections, a Saudi source says.
He told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, that he had heard "more and more" that the contest would be unfair. He offered no immediate evidence. At another event he called Democratic rival Hillary Clinton "the devil". Mr Trump has come under fire from across the political divide for remarks he made about the parents of a US Muslim soldier killed in action. On the forthcoming vote, he told supporters "I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest". He later repeated the claim on Fox News, adding "I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.". Mr Trump has made similar comments before in relation to the Democratic race, suggesting the party fixed its system to favour nominee Hillary Clinton over her challenger Bernie Sanders. Earlier this year, he also complained the Republican primary system was also "rigged" amid party efforts to stop his march to the candidacy. Correspondents say Mr Trump could be trying to capitalise on voters' distrust of establishment institutions, or lay the groundwork should he lose the election. At another rally in Pennsylvania, he took the unprecedented step of directly calling Mrs Clinton "the devil". He attacked Mr Sanders for capitulating in the Democratic race, saying he "made a deal with the devil. She's the devil." Democrats and Republicans alike have condemned Mr Trump for his remarks about the parents of US Army Capt Humayun Khan, who was killed by a car bomb in 2004 in Iraq, at the age of 27. Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain became the latest senior figure in the party to criticise Mr Trump for his attacks. Senator McCain, a veteran of the Vietnam War, said in a strongly worded statement that Mr Trump did not have "unfettered licence to defame the best among us". The soldier's parents, Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala, told the BBC it was time to stand up to Mr Trump but he accused them of "viciously" attacking him. Mr Trump had caused controversy by suggesting Ghazala Khan had been prevented from speaking alongside her husband at the Democratic convention last week. In another development, American billionaire businessman Warren Buffett challenged Mr Trump to release his tax returns. Mr Trump has said that they cannot be made public until the financial authorities have completed an audit. But Mr Buffett said there were no rules against showing tax returns and allowing people to ask questions about them.	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested that the November election could be "rigged".
Gareth Southgate's side went out in the group stage in the Czech Republic. "We made the decision and I back it," Ashworth told the BBC's senior football reporter Ian Dennis. "Youth teams are there to help develop players and give them experience to get into the seniors." Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, Arsenal midfielders Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere and Manchester United defender Phil Jones were among those eligible but not called up. Media playback is not supported on this device Ashworth added: "Those players are established internationals. It's like being a first-team player and asking them to come back and play in the U21s. It's not necessarily the right thing to do. "The players who hadn't competed in the two-year cycle and lead-up to the European Championship wouldn't be considered. "The debate will be reopened now but we stand by the decision Gareth and I made. You never know when you drop players into a new group whether it'll be the right thing to do." England, who had Premier League quality in Tottenham striker Harry Kane, Everton defender John Stones and new Liverpool forward Danny Ings, lost 1-0 to Portugal, beat Sweden by the same score but then lost 3-1 to Italy. Ashworth had a key role in the FA introducing proposals - the 'England DNA programme' - in December aimed at improving England's prospects at major tournaments. The plan is to co-ordinate the style, formation and tactics from the under-15 side upwards. And he believes improvements can be seen already. "I don't want to hide behind the fact we're devastated to have been eliminated in the group stages," Ashworth said. "We're disappointed with the group that we hoped and thought might go a bit further. But there are some success stories. "In order to win things at senior level, we need to develop players who can deal with the ball in all areas of the pitch. We have to prioritise that in the development teams. "They're young players and they'll make mistakes - it will cost us games. We have to accept that. We can't after six months say that's wrong, let's just crash it down the other end as quickly as we can. "We're starting to see a different kind of player come through the system now. Three years into EPPP [Elite Player Performance Plan] we're seeing players more capable with the ball. I believe it will stand us in good stead in years to come. Is it too soon now to see that? Yes, perhaps." Media playback is not supported on this device FA chairman Greg Dyke set a target in 2013 for England to win the World Cup by 2022 and Ashworth is adamant that this remains a realistic goal. "Yes I do believe that," he said. "I genuinely believe we have a lot of good young players in the system. We have the pathways getting better at clubs and international level. "We've introduced an Under-15s, 18s and 20s in the past 12 months because we recognise we need to give our players more big-game experience. "You've seen at this tournament we need players who are able to make decisions at the top level in the big games in order to win tournaments. But that takes time - it doesn't happen overnight. "We're all doing the right things but we need to sit tight and be a little patient and let it run its course. I'm convinced it will." Match of the Day pundit Gary Lineker criticised the "exasperatingly amateurish approach" not to select players such as Sterling, Wilshere and Barkley for the tournament. "We never learn. What a wasted opportunity to gather invaluable international experience," the former England captain added on his Twitter page. Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who won one cap for England, said the "culture is rotten" in English football, and criticised the power of the Premier League clubs. "There doesn't seem to be the pride there once was at representing England at any level or a major tournament," he told BBC 5 live. "We have a talent pool to match any nation. It's not the players or coaching staff. It's not one thing, it's an accumulation of many things. "The culture in English football isn't changing. No St George's Park, no massive spend, no changing coach will change it. The culture is rotten from top to bottom. The England national team will underperform at every single tournament for this reason. "The players think 'I'm too good for the under-21s, I've been in a senior squad - I don't want to go to a major tournament. I need to rest because I want to play in the Europa League or Champions League next year'. "Or 'hang on it's better for my career not to go to this tournament'. Or their managers are saying it. That's the problem with the Premier League being stronger than the FA. It's impossible for England to build good teams. "The FA should say to them if you don't make yourself eligible for the under-21s, then you won't be considered for the national team for however many years. "I feel for Dan Ashworth, I feel sorry for Gareth Southgate, I feel sorry for Roy Hodgson. What they are trying to do is so difficult until they get the Premier League back in line." Former England defender Danny Mills has been on an FA commission set up to assess potential improvements to English football. He said it could take a decade for major improvements to come to fruition, and also suggested English players earning too much is to blame. "We looked at this as a commission and decided things needed to change. Gareth has only been in the job two years. Things don't change overnight. Changing the way England play and players develop will take 10 years at least. That's what the Germans had to do before becoming very successful. "Do they get too much too soon? It's very difficult for the coaching staff. Raheem Sterling doesn't want to play for Liverpool - he certainly would have caused more problems for the under-21s than he would have done them good. "When me and Joey were coming through, playing for the under-21s and national team was massive kudos. "That doesn't happen now, they're given so much so early in club football that England Under-21s has become secondary. There isn't the same desire to play for them. Spain and Germany still have the desire to play for their Under-21s - they get paid an awful lot less than our players. "English players are paid too much and clubs put pressure on them not to go to the tournament - 'We want to save you for next season'. We have to change this culture. "I can't believe players even consider not playing for the under-21s. Those players like Barkley or Sterling could have called Gareth up and said 'I want to be in your side'." You can listen to BBC Radio 5 live's Dan Ashworth interview and the reaction to the England Under-21s' performance from Joey Barton and Danny Mills here.	England made the right decision to omit some of their Premier League players in the European Under-21 Championship, says Football Association director of elite development Dan Ashworth.
The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their captain and colour sergeant.  It took place in February while on exercise in Kenya. Fifteen were sentenced to detention, one of whom was dismissed from the Army. A 16th was also dismissed. All the soldiers pleaded guilty to disobeying a lawful command - an offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. The soldiers complained of being "led by muppets", the court martial heard. The prosecutor at the court martial said members of the platoon had been seething at the way they were being managed, and felt that they were "not appreciated". The court heard a captain and sergeant apparently got drunk before a lengthy training march in the Brecon Beacons last winter. The troops were said to have been furious at finding their two commanders asleep, rather than greeting the soldiers as they crossed the finish line. Tensions came to a head at the end of a training exercise in Kenya in February, when 16 soldiers decided to protest. Ahead of a parade, a ringleader shouted "sit down" and members of the platoon did so. The commanders ordered each man in turn to stand up, but were ignored. Corporal Anthony Brown, said to be the ringleader, was stripped of his rank, dismissed from the Army and sentenced to 60 days' detention. Two lance corporals were reduced to privates and sentenced to 60 days' detention, while a third was reduced to private and dismissed without detention. Twelve privates were sentenced to 40 days' detention. The soldiers were in the 1st Battalion at the time of the protest. However, the 1st has now become the 2nd, following Army restructuring. John Wilson, a retired colonel and former editor of the British Army Review who lectures in military history, described the nature of the soldiers' protest as "unprecedented". The sentences given to the troops at the court martial were "strong enough to make the point", added Col Wilson. "I don't think a corporal, whatever his grievances, can expect to orchestrate such a public protest in front of the entire battle group parade and get away with it." An Army spokesman said it was "not appropriate" to comment on the sentencing.	Fifteen soldiers have been jailed after a court martial for staging a "sit-in" in protest at being "led by muppets".
Byron Davies asked if a message from William Graham supporting the so-called "black route" for a Â£1bn Newport relief road came from a "spoof" account, as party policy was to review the options. Antoinette Sandbach accused Mr Graham of "not willing to put his vote where his principles allegedly are". Group leader Andrew RT Davies said the online row would "not be repeated". Mr Graham backed a Conservative motion in the Senedd in January calling for a review of the possible routes for an M4 relief road. But following the debate he tweeted: "I am confident that when the public inquiry is held the 'black route' will be chosen", referring to the Welsh government's preferred option. Some critics have claimed other routes would cause less environmental damage. It prompted responses from two of Mr Graham's colleagues asking whether he supported or disagreed with Conservative policy to review the alternatives. Group leader Andrew RT Davies told journalists on Tuesday he had "spoken to" each of the members who were "all signed up to the group position". "If people want to go on to Twitter to have a tittle-tattle that's neither here nor there," he said. "The people involved know my views on it and I'm confident it won't be repeated."	Three Welsh Conservative AMs have been "spoken to" by their leader for arguing about the party's M4 policy on Twitter.
As part of the Welsh Government plans, councils will need to have a "public toilet strategy". Rob Poultney of Criccieth, Gwynedd who has Crohn's disease, said it was vital for people to be able to access adequate toilet facilities. And the British Toilet Association called for more clarity on the plans. But the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the plans placed an "unnecessary and disproportionate burden" on local authorities. Mr Poultney, 23, whose condition causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system, said the disease and a lack of public toilets facilities made "it really difficult for him to leave home". "It causes bowel problems and and discomfort, and it could lead to an accident... it would be very embarrassing for me." He said it was essential for him to be able to access disabled toilets which often have a sink in the cubicle and called for each Welsh council to be ordered to provide a set number of toilets per population area. "If this bill is legally binding, then councils haven't got a choice and it's a great thing," Mr Poultney added. Meanwhile Ray Martin, managing director of the British Toilet Association, called for "one strategy across all 22 councils". He said authorities should be legally obliged to provide toilets in truck stops, heritage sites, and major junctions, as well as in towns and villages. "It's great that the councils will have to have a strategy - but we don't know exactly what that will be yet," he said. "Going to the toilet is like eating and breathing. It's something we all do every day. It's vital we have the right facilities." Public toilets across Wales have been closing as councils face budget cuts. Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales has no council-run toilets at all. In March, seven public toilets closed in Cardiff, with costs estimated at Â£16 per use. Earlier this year, Gwynedd council proposed shutting down two-thirds of all council-run toilet facilities to save Â£244,000. But in June, the council's cabinet agreed to ask community and town councils to help fund public toilets in the county. Anglesey council took the same approach. Mr Poultney said handing toilet facilities over to community councils did not protect their future in the long term. Mr Martin agreed, and said: "What happens in five years time, or when councillors retire?" The WLGA said it was against the plans, unless they were accompanied by "adequate funding arrangements". It warned that the proposed new duty was "unrealistic", and fears it would force councils to move funds away from services that are "of equal or greater priority". More facilities could instead be provided through community toilet schemes; the community toilet grant scheme; more user charging and better planning. A spokesperson added: "No doubt such proposals would require local authorities to regularly review their strategy; put in place action plans to secure their delivery and allow the Welsh Government to monitor progress with their delivery. "This is clearly unrealistic in the current financial climate."	Rules on public toilets should be Wales-wide and not up to individual councils say campaigners as the Public Health Bill is reintroduced.
John Stevenson Wright was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to 18 months for sexually abusing Darren Kenny. The court heard the offences took place when Wright worked at a pub run by Mr Kenny's parents in Rochdale. Wright, 68, abused Mr Kenny as a teenager when he used to sleep over at the pub. He was convicted of gross indecency, indecent assault and inciting a child under 16 to engage in a sexual act between 1978 and 1981. Wright's sentence will be added to the 22 years he is already serving for sexually abusing boys. Mr Kenny, 50, an officer with Greater Manchester Police in Tameside, was repeatedly abused as a teenager and thought Wright was dead until he typed his name into an internet search engine. While looking for his abuser's obituary, he was "horrified" to learn Wright had been jailed for child sexual abuse in Rochdale. He added: "We had been told he had died - I had my closure and then when we found out he wasn't dead I had no closure any more and I needed it back." Mr Kenny, who has waived his right to anonymity, contacted the officer who had investigated Wright and said: "I've got another victim - me. "Even if wasn't a policeman I would have come forward. "The length of sentence isn't important... returning the guilty verdict is what is important." Mr Kenny encouraged other abuse victims to speak out. "Look at me - I'm here, I'm a 50-year-old cop, and if I can do it I'm sure they can."	A police officer who thought his childhood abuser had died before he chanced across him online has said the man's conviction brought him "closure".
One of the few women to receive a mention is Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who basically discovered radiation and helped apply it in the field of X-rays. She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize. The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community. The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964. Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as "Oxford housewife wins Nobel". But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness. Here are just a few. Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics. She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work. Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award. The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer. Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work. Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics. It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table. She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium. But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre. Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory. Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission. Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two. This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb. After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades. But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author. And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom. Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century. She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today. In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head. This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played. Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe. She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women. Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth. This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness. The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president. It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation. Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity. It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women. That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.	A quick web search for the world's most famous scientists lists, among others, Galileo, Einstein, Newton, Darwin, Stephen Hawking and Alexander Fleming.
Mr Roache, who is secretary of the union's Yorkshire region, won 56.7% of the vote, while the only other candidate, Paul McCarthy, from the North West region, had 43.3%. The union is the third largest in the UK with more than 600,000 members. Current general secretary Paul Kenny announced in the summer he was standing down after almost a decade in the job. Mr Roache has 35 years experience at the GMB and led the Leeds City Council 13-week refuse and street cleaning strike in 2009 - the longest in the union's history. He said he was "proud and humbled" to have been elected. "I will repay GMB members' faith in me by leading a 21st Century union that fights for our members, their families and communities, every hour of every day." Mr Roache also paid tribute to Mr Kenny for his work "that has made GMB the envy of the union movement". Details of the handover date have yet to be agreed. The GMB is one of the three largest affiliates to the Labour Party and is a significant financial contributor to the party locally and nationally.	Regional official Tim Roache has been elected to become the new general secretary of the GMB union.
The Phab2Pro's sensors allow it to make sense of objects and close-by spaces, allowing graphics to be intelligently added to real-world views. The Moto Z uses magnets to add optional hardware modules to the phone's rear including a speaker and a projector. Analysts said the innovations might prove a tough sell. That would complicate Lenovo's efforts to turn around sales of its own phones and those of the Motorola division it bought from Google for $2.8bn in 2014. "There's a delicate balance between being on the leading edge and the bleeding edge, and Lenovo skirts that line," said Ramon Llamas from the tech research firm IDC. "If these products prove to be a hit - and that's a big if - then Lenovo emerges as a leading edge vendor. "The Phab2Pro has a lot of promise, showing immediate value creation within certain use cases. The Moto Z is certainly innovative, but I'm not sure how much consumers can wrap their brains around modular devices." The announcements were made at an event in San Francisco, where bendy smartphone and tablet prototypes were also revealed. Lenovo is currently the world's sixth bestselling smartphone-maker, according to IDC, after being overtaken by two other Chinese brands, Oppo and Vivo towards the start of the year. The Beijing-based company reported in May that it had swung to a loss of $128m (Â£89m) in its last financial year. It acknowledged at the time that it was having problems integrating Motorola. The Phab2Pro is the first device to use Google's Tango technology. The search firm has developed a system that adds depth-sensing and motion-tracking cameras to the normal front and rear photo lenses. Lenovo suggested this opened up several possibilities, including: However, an on-stage demo proved problematic. A game of virtual dominos - seen superimposed over a view of a real desk - saw the pieces repeatedly freeze part way through their intended run. And an effort to use the sensors to get the dimensions of a real-world table took several attempts to get the software to lock onto the object. This raises questions about whether the tech is ready to go on sale as planned in September. "In real life you're just going to use a tape measure" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy. "It's just a classic example of a solution looking for a problem. "Yes, you can envisage some lovely use cases - for example a DHL app that would let you hold up a parcel and give you its dimensions and the approximate cost to send it. "But that doesn't exist yet, and what you end up with is an underwhelming measuring demo." The Moto Z introduces the concept of Moto Mods - snap-on parts that connect to the back of the phone via 16 small metal pins. Examples of modules it plans to offer alongside the phone include: Lenovo said it was working with others to create new modules and also urged developers to create more following the phone's release later this summer. LG already has an alternative modular handset on sale - the G5 - and Google is working on Project Ara, a design that will allow several parts to be added at once. They mark a break with a trend that has seen phone manufacturers integrate components as closely together as possible to maximise battery life and computing power. One industry watcher questioned the appeal. "Consumers just do not want another item to carry with them," said Carolina Milanesi from the market research firm Creative Strategies. "When we do chose to carry something separate, it serves a very specific purpose or it is made by a brand that we want to carry because it is the best in that segment. "While Lenovo talked about wanting to limit compromise it seems to me that you are still left with one." Lenovo also showed off several concept devices at its presentation. These included a smartphone and tablet with flexible screens. This allowed the handset to be wrapped around a person's wrist so that it did not have to be held, and a tablet to be folded in half, making it easier to use one-handed. In addition, the firm briefly showed off a revised model of its smart shoes. It said the Intel processor-equipped footwear could track its wearer's movements and calorie burn. The firm did not, however, say when any of these might go on sale. Motorola's Razr - the thin flip phone from 2003 - was an iconic piece of design, something the company has been trying to replicate ever since. Today, Motorola - now part of Lenovo after a brief stint being owned by Google - thinks Moto Mods might be its next design masterstroke. I don't. The firm has been working on a modular phone for some time, and the idea of swapping components is appealing - strapping on a projector when you need it, or souped-up speakers, could be very useful. But there are already battery packs out there. And Bluetooth accessories that will give you much the same functionality. They may not be as easy to "snap", but I can't see it being enough to tempt people into ditching what they already have. In the same vein, the Phab2Pro, the smartphone with Tango built in, offers some promising new applications worth thinking about, particularly for retail. But the question isn't whether Tango is cool. It clearly is. The question is whether Tango is the sort of feature that would alter your smartphone buying choices. And that's where the technology falls well short. It's a luxury, not a necessity, and when up against its cheaper rivals, a Lenovo phone with Tango won't ever be more appealing to the masses than a cheaper smartphone from Xiaomi or ZTE. That's why Lenovo has dropped out of the top five smartphone makers in the world.	Lenovo has announced two unusual smartphones - a model that uses special cameras to scan its surroundings and a handset with optional snap-on parts.
After beating France 19-10, Wales have two wins and a draw as they travel to face unbeaten England at Twickenham in round four. But the style of their fifth consecutive win over the French has been criticised in some quarters. "It's a bit baffling, but it is Wales isn't it, it [the reaction] does happen doesn't it?" said Jenkins. "I'm not going to lie, it was a funny feeling after the game - but we've just won a test match and we've beaten France, five times on the bounce. "The most important thing for us to keep doing what we're doing, keep trying to improve, keep winning if we can- that's the be-all and end-all isn't it?" The victory over France was Wales' seventh consecutive Six Nations match without defeat. Kicking coach Jenkins, Wales' record points scorer, was a member of a Wales team that endured a 51-0 hammering against France in 1998. And between 1982 and 1993 France won 12 consecutive internationals against Wales. But even captain Sam Warburton admitted that Friday's win was a not the most exciting. "I remember thinking on the pitch 'the fans are going to start a Mexican wave in a minute - it's pretty boring'," he said. The flanker believes the best is still to come from his side, who face unbeaten England at Twickenham on 12 March. Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb, who was first-choice in the 2015 Six Nations, could be called up for training next week. Webb missed the World Cup and the start of the current campaign with a foot injury. His replacement for Wales, Scarlet Gareth Davies has scored six international tries this season. Webb scored a try in his first start for Ospreys this season in Connacht and is set for another appearance away to Leinster on Saturday. "Rhys is a quality player, ideally (he'll get) some more game-time this week and I think they'll re-assess from there. If he can get up and running, he's surely going to be there or thereabouts for us," Jenkins told BBC Wales Sport. "I'm not saying (he could be in the squad) against England, but he could well come into the equation in terms of the wider squad." Wales do not yet know whether lock Luke Charteris will recover from a knee injury in time to play for Racing 92 against Agen on Saturday, or to be back in contention for the England game. Meanwhile, Jenkins has defended Wales's achievements in the Six Nations, as they head to Twickenham still unbeaten.	Neil Jenkins says he is baffled by some of the criticism of his team's style in the Six Nations.
The Paris St-Germain striker scored twice against Portugal on Tuesday but Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick took his side through 4-2 on aggregate. Ibrahimovic, 32, said: "It was probably the last attempt to reach the World Cup with the national team for me. "A World Cup without me is nothing to watch so it is not worthwhile to wait for the World Cup." The play-off between Sweden and Portugal, who had both finished second in their qualifying groups, had been billed as a showdown between Ibrahimovic and Ronaldo - two of the best players in the world. At the age of 32, Sweden skipper Zlatan Ibrahimovic may not have another opportunity to play in a World Cup finals. And the tournament would represent a nadir in the Paris St-Germain striker's career. He has never scored at a finals having made two substitute appearances in 2002 and three starts in 2006. They ended up scoring all six goals between them as Portugal won 4-2 on aggregate. Former Inter Milan forward Ibrahimovic, who has played in two World Cups, scored eight times in qualifying, including the play-offs, and assisted another six goals - having a hand in 14 out of Sweden's 21 goals. He told Uefa's website: "Why did we lose? To be honest, they were better than us. We should be proud. We couldn't have done better than we did. "Of course, we could look back at our mistakes, but these things happen. They punished our mistakes. After making it 2-1 it felt like we were on a roll, our hopes grew, but unfortunately they made it 2-2 soon afterwards." Real Madrid forward Ronaldo, who has scored 34 goals in 24 games this season for club and country, said: "I just did my job, as I have been doing lately. I always try to give my best - that is always my goal." He is now Portugal's joint-top scorer, along with retired former Paris St-Germain striker Pauleta on 47. "It was not a priority for me to break Pauleta's record," the 28-year-old said. "I knew Portugal needed me and I stuck to the task at hand. Now we have some time to rest and to do our best for our clubs before starting to think about the World Cup finals."	Sweden captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic says the World Cup is not worth watching without him after their play-off loss.
Media playback is not supported on this device Craig Cathcart put the visitors ahead before substitute Simon Church won and scored an 89th-minute penalty. "There were lots of positives out of it even if we'd have come off and lost 1-0. They had a good mentality and attitude," said Coleman. Wales face another Euro 2016 warm-up game against Ukraine in Kiev on Monday. "We look forward to our next challenge now," added Coleman. "The team will change up again, and we'll see how they go again." Striker Church, currently on loan at Scottish Premiership side Aberdeen from Reading, was delighted with his equaliser from the spot. "Northern Ireland were a tough side to play against. They've obviously done well to get where they are and it was a tough game," he said. "We wanted to do well because it was the last time a Wales crowd would see us before the Euros and we wanted to put in a good performance. "I've just got to keep going now and hopefully score some goals. This is a great squad to be part of."	Wales manager Chris Coleman said he was pleased with his team's performance after they came from behind to draw 1-1 with Northern Ireland in Cardiff.
Italy, Wales' first opponent in the 2017 tournament, have finished bottom of the table 11 times, and Georgia and Romania have been pushing to be included in the top tier. But the 30-year-old, set to win his 46th cap in Rome, believes that would be a premature move. "I think it's a debate to be had in a couple of years time," he said. Italy's captain and talisman Sergio Parisse reacted angrily when the suggestion was put to him during the 2016 tournament. And Six Nations chief executive John Feehan has said relegation will not be introduced in the short to medium term and dismissed criticism of Italy as unfair. Owens expects the Azzuri to pose a serious challenge in Rome, where Wales have lost twice and believes that if relegation is eventually introduced, the teams and players will deal with the issue. "I don't think any team goes into the competition to finish bottom," he said. "If [relegation] comes, it comes and the focus wouldn't change because no side goes into the Six Nations wanting to win the wooden spoon." Italy coach Conor O'Shea has made five changes from the team which lost against Tonga in November for the game against Wales. It is also the first time Wales have faced the Italians since the appointment of their new coaching team. "It's a tough away game, especially Italy first up," he added. "They'll be wanting to build on a good autumn campaign after beating South Africa and they'll have been disappointed losing the last game against Tonga. "But they've had time now with Conor O'Shea, Mike Catt and Brendan Venter in camp. "We know hard it's going to be out there and it's all about getting a good performance first up."	Wales hooker Ken Owens has backed the decision not to introduce relegation from the Six Nations.
Well, it is because the government's forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has increased its prognosis of how much the Treasury will raise from existing taxes (not new ones) and reduced what it thinks the chancellor will shell out in interest on its massive debts. In total the OBR thinks the national debt, the aggregate of the annual deficits, will be £23bn lower over the four years to 2020, and just because it is more optimistic about tax revenues and assorted costs. Or to put it another way, George Osborne is today £23bn better off than he thought in July, and without doing anything at all. Windfall So what is the chancellor doing with this very useful £23bn that the OBR has found at the back of the sofa? Well he is using £19bn of it to cover the £4.4bn annual cost of not slashing tax credits, and making about £8bn a year less than expected in departmental savings. So on paper it looks as though the chancellor is actually being a bit more prudent than he was in July, even though some would say he is expensively moving his party nearer to the centre-ground of British politics - which he thinks has been vacated by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. To labour the point, George Osborne is not deploying quite all of his windfall to buy off his critics by taking the teeth out of austerity. But that does not mean there is no risk for him. The OBR's fiscal optimism could well be misplaced - especially since only last week we saw government borrowing figures hideously worse than expected. But presumably, if tax revenues turn out lower and interest payments higher than the chancellor is now banking on, he can attempt to blame and kick the forecasting agency, the OBR, which he created. And he'll hope, presumably, that voters won't see double standards in his years of bashing his Labour predecessors for spending tax revenues that never looked sustainable. George Osborne has not quite morphed into his former opposite number, Ed Balls. But he is, in a more Ballsian way, counting on economic recovery to mend his overstretched finances. UPDATE 20:21 I have had a quick word with Robert Chote of the OBR, and he says that even if he had seen October's lamentable borrowing figures he would not have changed his deficit projections. His expectation is that revenues will rise for the government because of measures already taken, but which have not yet led to a higher tax yield.	So how has George Osborne pulled off the magical trick of maintaining spending on the police, imposing smaller than anticipated departmental spending cuts in general, and performing an expensive u-turn on tax-credit reductions, while remaining seemingly on course to turn this year's £74bn deficit into a £10bn surplus in 2020.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Lionesses showed grit in a game of few chances in Tilburg, notably when Lucy Bronze blocked from Ellen Jansen. Mark Sampson's side improved after the break, and Toni Duggan produced a low save from Loes Gurts. And after a spell of Dutch pressure, Jordan Nobbs' long ball sent Taylor racing clear to lob the winner. Relive England's gritty win in Tilburg See the full Euro 2017 draw Sampson joined his squad late for the fixture having returned from the birth of his first child. The England boss had explained he wanted this fixture to test his side - who do not play again until a friendly with Italy in April - as they prepare for the European Championship in July. His decision to introduce Taylor to offer more support to the often-isolated Duggan proved key, and he should be pleased with how his defenders restricted a side seeded ninth for next summer's tournament. England have now conceded just one goal in eight matches, defensive form which has set up their best run since an 11-game unbeaten sequence between March 2012 and June 2013. England, seeded third, will be heavy favourites to progress from a Euro 2017 group also featuring Scotland, Spain and Portugal. The fact Sampson made just two changes from October's friendly win over Spain suggests he is getting closer to knowing his best side but still there are some questions to be answered. In deploying Karen Carney behind lone striker Duggan, England lacked cutting edge and it was only when Taylor came on as a second striker that they created their best two openings. Chelsea striker Eniola Aluko's omission from the squad also prompts questions. The Women's Super League's top-scoring English player has not added to her 95 England caps since April. England's players must also get used to a new schedule next year, in preparation for the domestic season switching to September-May. But the national side's excellent form leaves them well placed to perhaps end Germany's run of six straight European titles. Former England forward Sue Smith on the BBC Red Button: "I think England can be happy, given they have a lot of key players missing. I think they are in a good position going into the Euros. "The Dutch made it hard for them, but England managed to solve the problems the Dutch created. They have ground out a win, which is sometimes what you need to do, especially in tournament football."

Venera Minakhmetova died when she was struck by lorry at Bow Roundabout, on Wednesday. The Russian, who had been on the Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) just before the collision, was the fourth of five cyclists to die in London in nine days. Her sister Dina said: "If you know something, if you witnessed it, please come forward and contact police." She also thanked people for their support following her sister's death. Ms Minakhmetova had worked at London-based Edelau and investment bank Merrill Lynch and was living in the Bethnal Green area to develop her financial services business. So far this year, 13 cyclists have been killed, eight of which have involved HGVs. The leader of Southwark Council, Peter John, has called for HGVs to be banned during rush hour to protect cyclists. Currently, the movement of HGVs are restricted in London between 21:00 and 0700 on weekdays, and between 13:00 on Saturdays through to 07:00 on Mondays. Speaking to BBC Sunday Politics London Ben Plowden, of Transport for London, said the Olympics showed it was possible to achieve a very significant change in when and how deliveries take place. "Something like a fifth of freight activity moved out of the busiest times in the day and that was because we worked closely with the boroughs and the councils, the freight industry and the supermarkets and other people to make that happen," he said. "So what that shows is you can make a big change, the question is how do you make that part of everyday life rather than a one-off thing for the Olympics?" Catherine West, head of transport on London Councils, said a balance was needed so that Londoners could get a good night's sleep. "A lot of people live on busy roads and they live above shops. We just have to be mindful that a lorry delivery at 4am may not be great for residents," she said.	The sister of a cyclist who was killed in east London last week has urged witnesses to contact police.
At least 44 more have been injured in the crush, which was reportedly triggered by a road accident. The pilgrims were returning from the Hindu shrine of Sabarimala, which is in a remote, mountainous, densely-forested area. Kerala Governor R S Gavai has said he is "deeply shocked and saddened". "We have recovered 102 bodies. The rescue work is almost over," local police official Sanjay Kumar told the Associated Press news agency. The stampede happened at Pulmedu, near the town of Vandiperiyar in Idukki district, Indian media reported. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims had gathered at the hill shrine on Friday, the last day of an annual festival. The festival runs for two months and attracts millions of visitors every year. Reports differed as to exactly how the deadly crush was triggered. The Indian PTI news agency said a jeep carrying pilgrims had driven into a crowd returning from the shrine, starting a panic. However, the Times of India reported that the incident happened when the jeep broke down and overturned as pilgrims tried to move it. It crushed a number of people and caused others to stumble, which then triggered the stampede, the report said. Correspondents say deadly stampedes are not unusual at Indian temples, where huge crowds gather in small areas with few safety measures or crowd controls. A similar tragedy happened at Sabaramila in 1999, when more than 50 people died in a stampede after a landslide on a crowded hillside.	Officials say 102 pilgrims have been killed in a stampede at a religious festival in the southern Indian state of Kerala.
Pedro, 25, had been training with the Cumbrians and impressed in reserve games against Barrow and Burnley. The Angola-born wide-man has spent much of his career in the Dutch league with teams such as Feyenoord and Heracles, plus stints in Bulgaria and Romania. "We've seen enough to know that he adds something different to the group," said head of recruitment Lee Dykes. He told the club website: "This is a chance for him to show everyone what he can do." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Carlisle United have signed free-agent winger Louis Pedro on a short-term contract that will expire on 21 May.
His signing follows the news that the Stags could be without injured striker Alex Fisher for four weeks. Oliver, 23, signed his first professional contract with his hometown club Sheffield Wednesday. He left the Owls in 2012 and made an immediate impact at Lincoln City, scoring 14 goals in 41 matches, before joining Crewe last summer. Oliver could make his debut at York on Saturday.	Forward Vadaine Oliver has joined Mansfield Town on an emergency one-month loan from Crewe Alexandra.
Chief inspector of schools Meilyr Rowlands told AMs it was partly due to the "unintended consequences" of how schools' performance is measured. Another Estyn witness said more able learners' progress had been "stifled". Ministers agreed they needed "to do more to push our most able students" and were introducing changes to raise standards "for all our young people". The Welsh Assembly's Children, Young People and Education Committee was quizzing Estyn about its annual report, on Wednesday. Mr Rowlands said that schools focused on a performance measure which requires pupils to get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English or Welsh and maths. That, he said, encouraged schools to focus on the borderline between C and D grades "and possibly not giving enough support for those who could get As and A*s". But he said that evidence from primary schools, further education and the PISA international tests also suggested that able and talented pupils were not given enough support in the education system. "I don't think schools and the education system more generally have done enough," he said. Claire Morgan, Strategic Director for Estyn, said the focus on particular performance indicators meant there is "some gaming, [and] early entry that hasn't helped to stretch the more able". "I think this has stifled the progress of more able learners," she added. A Welsh Government spokesman said ministers recognised "we need to do more to push our most able students to reach their full potential". "Through programmes such as the Seren Network, we are already supporting our brightest students to reach our leading universities. The spokesman said changes were being introduced to the system used to measure schools' performance for 15 to 16 year olds, following a review of qualifications for 14 to 19 year olds. The changes were intended to "raise standards and extend opportunities for all our young people no matter what their background", he added.	More able children are not getting enough attention in Wales' education system, the schools watchdog has said.
The Court heard that a further pregnancy would be a "significantly life-threatening event" for both the mother and child. Mr Justice Cobb said the woman had the "same human rights" as everyone else and this was not a case of "eugenics". He has authorised health and council services to intervene and perform the sterilisation. The name of the woman has not been released, to protect the identify of her children. The Court of Protection, which rules in cases when people are unable to make decisions for themselves, heard the woman has no contact with any of her six children. All are being raised by carers. The 36-year-old's history was described as "extraordinary, tragic, and complex". Two of the children were born at home in conditions described as "unhygienic and overrun by pets". There is evidence that barbecue tongs were used as forceps, although this was denied. In another birth, the woman - known only as DD - contested there was no father and the pregnancy resulted from a "tablet from a health food shop". Mr Cobb's judgement said: "The ethical, legal and medical issues arising here are self-evidently of the utmost gravity, engaging, and profoundly impacting upon DD's personal autonomy, privacy, bodily integrity, and reproductive rights." It said there were considerable concerns about the woman's safety. Doctors said the wall of her uterus was "tissue-paper thin" and likely to rupture in childbirth, leading to almost certain death of the infant. Mr Cobb insisted: "Those who lack capacity have the same human rights as everyone else. "This case is not about eugenics, this outcome has been driven by the bleak yet undisputed evidence that a further pregnancy would be a significantly life-threatening event." He has authorised a sterilisation operation, but there will be no notice given to the woman or her long-term partner, who also has learning disabilities. Rebecca Schiller, the co-chairwoman of the human rights in childbirth charity Birthrights, said: "Taking away a person's ability to have a child is truly draconian. "It may be justified in extreme circumstances, but immense care must be taken to safeguard the rights of people with mental health conditions."	A mother of six with an IQ of 70 should be sterilised for her own safety, the Court of Protection has ruled.
Two were picked up by a coastguard helicopter high up on the 3,196ft (974 metre) Munro. Lomond Mountain Rescue Team located two others on the lower slopes. Mountain weather forecasters were predicting winds of up to 80mph with frequent snow showers at summit level in western Scotland for Wednesday.	Four hillwalkers who got into difficulties during severe weather on Ben Lomond have been rescued.
Catherine Seeley was subjected to the abuse after she was co-opted as a Sinn Féin councillor in Craigavon, County Armagh. She thanked pupils at the Boys' Model School in the loyalist Ballysillan area for their "full support". Ms Seeley was speaking at Sinn Fein's annual conference in Wexford. She said: "In the past few weeks, in my role as a teacher, I have been subjected to a campaign of sectarian intimidation. "I have already expressed my warm thanks to all who have offered me support, including family, friends, colleagues, educationalists and politicians from various parties. "I want to take this opportunity to publicly send a message of gratitude to those pupils of the Boys' Model School in north Belfast who have courageously offered me their full support. "They are a testimony to the values that should permeate not just education but every aspect of society.  They inspire hope and confidence in me for the future." She added that her recent experience had shown "that students can be much wiser, more mature, more responsible and more respectful than some who claim to speak on their behalf". Ms Seeley's decision to leave her post was announced on Friday in a joint statement by the school's board of governors and the Belfast Education and Library Board. She is to move to another education board area. The Protestant Coalition group had objected to her employment at the school. It said her role at the school should be looked at because of her political views. During his speech, the Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness contrasted the response of Miss Seeley's pupils to that of some unionist politicians. "If this situation was reversed and a young Protestant teacher who was also a member of the DUP was being forced from her job in a Catholic school, I would be at the door accompanying her to her work," he said. Mr McGuinness also called on those he described as "sensible people within unionism" to use their influence to secure a deal on flags, parades and the past. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams told delegates during his address on Saturday evening that the issue of contentious Orange parades still needed to be resolved. "While there may be obstacles, be sure of one thing - change will not be stopped," he said. "I am happy to meet with the Orange Order at any time to discuss these matters. "I want to see the Orange treating its Catholic neighbours with respect. "I want to see it upholding law and order. "The Orange Order of Ireland is one of our national traditions. "And Sinn Féin wants all our traditions freed up from sectarianism from any quarter, to live together in peace and respect and with tolerance from everyone for everyone."	The teacher who quit her job at a north Belfast school after being targeted by online sectarian abuse has spoken publicly for the first time.
But archaeologist Steve Clarke believes this fortified farmhouse once stood on stilts on a manmade island in an Ice Age lake 4,900 years ago. The "crannog's" timbers survived and carbon dating said they were built on Jordan Way, Monmouth, 2,917 years BC. A slab of timber was discovered when the estate was constructed in 2003. It is the second crannog discovered in Wales. But the first, at Llangorse Lake, in the Brecon Beacons, is thousands of years younger than the recent discovery. "This is very important, it was a huge lake that was here until the Iron Age," said Mr Clarke, 70. "This will tell us what was happening here in the Stone Age - we know so little about that period."	This ancient fort could not look more different to the red brick housing estate currently occupying suburbia in Monmouthshire.
The British Hen Welfare Trust said 240 of the birds were in need of new homes in Wrexham. The trust said the birds had spent the last 18 months laying eggs for supermarkets but their ability to lay had slowed down. It said they were healthy and "will soon become much-loved pets". The trust will hold a rehoming day on Sunday but said it could not save the hens if they did not have homes to go to. Gaynor Davies, the charity's head of operations, said: "There is no better feeling than watching these girls flourish after they emerge from the commercial system. "With a bit of TLC they become incredibly tame, and they're often described as cats and dogs with feathers."	Hundreds of ex-commercial hens considered too slow at laying eggs face slaughter unless they can be rehomed in north Wales, a charity has said.
Labour's new leader said he wanted the weekly sessions to be less "theatrical" and Mr Cameron agreed there should be more focus on "substantial issues". Mr Corbyn asked about housing, tax credits and mental health service cuts. The BBC's Norman Smith said it was much calmer than normal but the PM had not been put under any real pressure. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg later on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted he would not campaign for the UK to leave the European Union, while vowing to fight any moves towards a more free-market relationship. Mr Corbyn was cheered by Labour MPs as he got to his feet at his first PMQs, before launching into a lengthy pre-amble in which he thanked supporters for his Labour leadership victory, vowed to make PMQs less "theatrical" and explained his decision to crowd source his questions. He said: "I thought at my first PMQs, I would do it in a slightly different way... So I sent out an email to thousands of people and asked them what questions they would like to put to the prime minister and I received 40,000 replies." The prime minster congratulated Mr Corbyn on his "resounding victory" in the Labour leadership contest and welcomed him to the frontbench. Mr Cameron, who began his own career as opposition leader in 2005 promising to end "Punch and Judy" politics, then said "no one would be more delighted than me" if PMQs could become a "genuine exercise in asking questions and answering questions". Mr Corbyn's first question "from a woman called Marie" was on the "chronic lack of affordable housing" and "the extortionate rents charged by some private sector landlords" - something the new Labour leader has said will be his top priority. Mr Cameron said the government had delivered more affordable homes but recognised "much more needs to be done". Before Mr Corbyn began his second question, on job losses at housing associations, he thanked the prime minister "for his commitment that we are going to do Prime Minister's Questions in a more adult way than it's been done in the past". He then asked about "absolutely shameful" cuts to tax credits voted through by MPs on Tuesday, on behalf of  "Paul," and about cuts to mental health services, prompted by a question from "Gail". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's verdict As promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit, no where to be seen.  It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions. What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs, the new Labour leader's first ever outing at the despatch box. Read Laura's full analysis Mr Cameron struck a consensual tone in his replies, agreeing that more needed to be done to improve mental health services, and paused to scold Labour MPs who were jeering him over his claim that the lowest paid would be Â£20 a week better off next year thanks to an increase in the minimum wage. "I thought this was the new Question Time. I'm not sure the message has fully got home," he told them. The prime minister took a couple of swipes at the new Labour leader when answering questions from backbenchers, as noise levels in the chamber returned to normal levels, although Tory MPs still appeared to be following instructions to avoid triumphalism. In response to a question on Northern Ireland from DUP MP Nigel Dodds, Mr Cameron paid tribute to former Conservative MPs Airey Neave and Ian Gow, who were murdered by Republican terrorists. He did not directly refer to controversy over Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell's previous comments on Northern Ireland, but said: "I have a simple view, which is the terrorism we faced was wrong, it was unjustifiable, the death and the killing was wrong. It was never justified and people who seek to justify it should be ashamed of themselves." He held back from attacking Mr Corbyn over his much-criticised decision not to sing the national anthem at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, saying in response to a question from a Tory MP that the St Paul's Cathedral event had been "a reminder of how proud we should be of our armed forces, then, today and always." Minutes before the session began Labour sources confirmed that their leader, who believes in the abolition of the monarchy, would join in with the anthem at future official engagements. Labour denied that Mr Corbyn's new approach - asking six different questions rather than pushing the prime minister on a single point - gave Mr Cameron an easy ride. "The questions were very direct and they demanded clear answers," a Labour source said. Asked about policy differences that appear to have emerged between Mr Corbyn and his front bench, on welfare cuts and Europe, a Labour source said "lots of listening" would be done and some policies would be reviewed under the new leadership.	Jeremy Corbyn asked David Cameron questions emailed to him from the public as he tried what he called "a different" style for his debut PMQs.
The RNLI says six crew members have been brought in from the UK to staff the St Helier station in Jersey. The charity said the decision to remove coxswain Andy Hibbs was made due to a "serious risk to its ability to run a safe and effective lifesaving service". Mr Hibbs denies the claim he broke the volunteers' code of conduct. More on St Helier lifeboat and other Channel Island stories here The St Helier station was unmanned for the weekend and members of the public attended a silent protest on Sunday. The charity says the new crew members have come from various parts of the UK, and will remain until the dispute is resolved.	A lifeboat station is back in service, four days after 25 volunteers resigned in protest against the sacking of a senior crew member.
Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK imposed no migration controls on eight central European and Baltic nations joining the EU in 2004 and the new proposals would "address the consequences" of that. But he said the emergency brake would only apply in "exceptional cases". Eurosceptics say it is ineffectual and could make the situation worse. Speaking in the European Parliament, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan was a "handbrake turn" by David Cameron. The prime minister has hailed a plan to allow the UK to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years as one of the key elements of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU - the details of which he will set out to the UK Parliament later. He has said the emergency brake, which would take effect if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system, could be triggered almost immediately. But many Tory MPs have criticised the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive "graduated" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. They are also unhappy that the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally. Defending the proposals and the rest of the draft deal in the European Parliament, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that the entire package - which must be approved by the EU as a whole, was "fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states". On welfare, he said: "We propose to create a safeguard mechanism tailor-made to the concerns of the UK, that would allow it to restrict the excess of EU workers newly entering its Labour market to in-work benefits in a graduated manner for a period of up to four years. "The duration of the mechanism will be limited in time - that is a crucial characteristic of a safeguard mechanism, necessary to make it compatible with the (EU) treaties. It will apply in exceptional cases as all derogrations from the freedoms (of movement rules) should." Mr Juncker pointed out that the then Labour government had had the option to introduce transitional controls on migration when countries such as Poland and Hungary entered the EU in 2004 but, unlike Germany, decided against doing so. One of the most controversial decisions of Tony Blair's time in office, several former Labour ministers have since said it was a mistake and acknowledged the government hugely underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK. Mr Juncker said "as a result" of that decision "over the past decade, the UK attracted a record number of mobile EU citizens". He added. "In effect, we will enable the UK to use the safeguards mechanism to address the consequences of that decision." But UKIP leader Nigel Farage, also speaking in the European Parliament, said the safeguards were totally insubstantial and would not allow the UK to reduce levels of annual net migration, which rose to 336,000 in the year to June 2015. "We have an emergency brake on migrants benefits. Wow. It was supposed to be a total ban on migrants benefits for four years. So it is hardly an emergency brake, it is more of a handbrake turn." Mr Farage said Mr Cameron would not be able to get any further concessions out of the EU and the forthcoming referendum on the UK's future in the EU would be a battle between "vested self-interests and people power". Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is now a leading MEP, suggested that if the UK voted to leave the EU, it would be a boost for Russia and China. "I think Britain without Europe - ok it's a dwarf, let's be honest," he claimed. "We Belgians, we know that we are dwarfs but maybe they're going to know it also. And at the other hand Europe without Great Britain, yes, doesn't count, is not a counterweight against China, against Russia, against the United States. "It is Vladimir Putin, in fact, who wins in this game in the end because Putin likes a divided Europe."	Limiting in-work benefits to new EU arrivals will help tackle the effects of record migration to the UK since 2004, the EC's president has said.
The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community. Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. "Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes," he was once quoted as saying. And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts. But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process. After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form. Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science. Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict. As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive. This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted. "Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from," he said. During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes. But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough. Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally. He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates. His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work "any monkey" could do. The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research. And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis. His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme. Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles. Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure. In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal. But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt. The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins. The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that. "I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution," he said of the synthetic microbes. "If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide."	"Maverick" is a word that seems to follow Craig Venter around.
The price of Brent crude oil fell below $39 a barrel at one point, its lowest since December 2008. The IEA said demand in the current quarter was growing by 1.3 million barrels a day, down from 2.2 million barrels in the previous quarter. The IEA predicts that will slip back to 1.2 million barrels a day next year. The price of Brent crude fell to $38.90 a barrel at one point, before recovering slightly to $39.13 - still down 60 cents in the trading session. US crude oil also fell, down 50 cents to $36.12 a barrel. Oil prices are down more than 10% over the week. The trigger was a meeting of oil producers' cartel Opec late last week, which broke up in disarray as the member countries failed to agree to put a lid on production. Opec producers pumped more oil in November than in any month since late 2008, almost 32 million barrels per day. That comes at a time when the world's economic growth is slowing, blunting demand for raw materials. The IEA said that although consumption was likely to have peaked in the third quarter, demand growth of 1.2 million barrels a day was still healthy. Earlier this week, the US Energy Information Administration forecast that US shale oil production, now a major source of oil supply, would fall in January for the ninth month in a row. Sustained falls in output could help to stabilise the price of oil, although some market forecasters suggest the price could continue to fall to as low as $20 a barrel.	The oil price has fallen to a new seven-year low after the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecast a slowdown in growth in demand for oil.
The men, aged 26 and 24, were in a house in Melrose Street when three men armed with a knife, hammer and batons forced their way into the property just before midnight on Saturday. After assaulting the men, the gang left with a sum of cash and personal items. They also smashed a number of windows. The men in the house received medical treatment for their injuries. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.	Two men have been assaulted by an armed gang in south Belfast.
The stone got past the elephant's fence and a ditch separating the animal and visitors, the zoo said in a statement. The girl was taken to hospital and died within a few hours, the zoo added. The zoo statement said the enclosure met international standards and said "this kind of accident is rare, unpredictable and unusual". Africa Live: More on this and other stories The statement went on (in French) to point out two other recent incidents in the US: Phyllis Lee, Scientific Director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, says that targeted throwing of stones and branches by elephants is very unusual. "It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do." The moments after the girl was struck at Rabat Zoo on Tuesday were filmed by a bystander and uploaded onto YouTube. The video shows the elephant waving its trunk behind a fence and swerves round to show a stone on the ground. Metres away people are gathered around the girl, holding her head and stroking her leg.	A seven-year-old girl has died after being hit by a stone thrown by an elephant from its enclosure at Rabat Zoo in Morocco.

Here we present the winning images from the four categories. This year there was a special category to recognise the creativity of the Dronestagram community.	All photographs courtesy dronestagr.am.
The live broadcast of John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer was scheduled for 15 November. The opera set to be performed this autumn portrays the hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship by the Palestine Liberation Front in 1985. Jewish American passenger Leon Klinghoffer was killed in the attack "I'm convinced that the opera is not anti-Semitic," the Met's General Manager, Peter Gelb, wrote in a statement. "But I've also become convinced that there is genuine concern in the international Jewish community that the live transmission of The Death of Klinghoffer would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe." The decision was taken after discussions between Mr Gelb and the Anti-Defamation League, which represented Klinghoffer's children. Mr Adams criticised the decision, telling Associated Press news agency the opera "in no form condones or promotes violence, terrorism or anti-Semitism". The Achille Lauro had been sailing the Mediterranean on 7 October 1985 when the gang - members of a splinter group of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organisation - attacked. During a two-day standoff, the group demanded the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners and killed Klinghoffer, 69, before throwing him overboard. The Palestinian militants initially escaped after allowing the Achille Lauro to dock in Egypt. Later, the US military intercepted an Egyptian plane which the hijackers were using to flee and forced it to land in Sicily, where the four hijackers were arrested. Youssef Magied al-Molqui, the leader of the group which overtook the Achille Lauro, was released from an Italian prison in 2009 after serving nearly 24 years.	New York's Metropolitan Opera has cancelled plans for a global HD broadcast of a performance amid fears it could spark anti-Semitic sentiment.
It is hoped the sale, to be handled by estate agent Knight Frank, will cover the Â£502m debts accrued by a firm which tried to redevelop the landmark site. The 39-acre property is on the Thames and a new public park is planned there. Chancellor George Osborne has confirmed government backing for plans to extend the London Underground's Northern Line into the heart of the area. Stephan Miles-Brown, head of residential development at Knight Frank, said: "This is the first time Battersea Power Station has ever been offered for sale on the open market. "As one of the UK's most recognisable landmarks, Knight Frank anticipates considerable interest in a scheme that is among the most exciting in the world today. "Battersea Power Station is as iconic as the Chrysler Building in New York or the Eiffel Tower, and familiar to people who may have never even been to London." The Grade II listed building opened in 1933 and generated power until 1983. As such any building work would require listed building consent - even minor works, such as painting. It was acquired by Real Estate Opportunities, the majority owner of the holding company, in 2006. Last year its debts on the project were called in by creditors.	Battersea Power Station is being offered for sale on the open market for the first time.
John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained "absolutely committed" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. "Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign'," he said. "Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. "Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. "I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people." The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were "not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament". And they said the legislation made it "perfectly possible" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a "wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust. The Scottish government has said previously it would not commence the legislation until the problems were fixed.	The deputy first minister is due to make a statement on the Scottish government's Named Person scheme later.
Ex-French Minister for Health and Sport Roselyne Bachelot said Nadal's seven-month absence in 2012 was "probably due to a positive doping test". Nadal, 29, has denied ever doping and the Spanish Olympic Committee said he had passed "countless doping tests". Real Madrid have defended Nadal from "the attacks made on his person". A club statement said: "Rafa Nadal represents the fundamental values of sport. "His greatness and his incredible achievements have always been based upon a foundation of exemplary conduct, unwavering work, talent and astonishing levels of commitment. "This being the case, our institution considers the attacks made on his person by former minister Roselyne Bachelot to be unjustifiable and unacceptable." Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane added: "I feel bad for Rafa Nadal because he is a gentleman, a person that has shown the values he has and that everyone loves. "He is a professional and I know him a little. I feel bad for what they have said. "He has to leave all this to one side and think that everyone who loves sport, loves Rafa Nadal, whether they be French, Spanish or American." Nadal, who has won 14 Grand Slam titles, was out for seven months from July 2012 with tendinitis and then a stomach virus. The Spaniard was asked on Wednesday about the subject of doping, in the light of Maria Sharapova's admission last week of a failed test. "I am a completely clean guy," said the former world number one. "I have never had the temptation of doing something wrong."	Real Madrid backed "exemplary" club member Rafael Nadal after the tennis star was accused by a former French minister of failing a drugs test.
The 22-year-old Algeria international moved to the German side on a season-long loan in August and has made 20 Bundesliga appearances. He has agreed a four-year deal with the Gelsenkirchen team, although neither club has revealed details of any fee. Bentaleb had made 66 appearances for Spurs since joining as a teenager.	Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Nabil Bentaleb will join Schalke on a permanent deal at the end of his loan spell this summer.
An image of one of the victims - a young boy lying face down on the beach - has sparked an international outcry over the human cost of the crisis. The picture, released by a Turkish news agency, is trending worldwide on Twitter under the #KiyiyaVuranInsanlik ("humanity washed ashore") hashtag. Thousands of migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe by sea. Warning: This article contains a distressing image The Turkish coastguard said the migrants had set off from Turkey's Bodrum peninsula for the Greek island of Kos in the early hours of Wednesday morning, but the two boats they were in sank shortly afterwards. Twelve bodies, including five children, were recovered. Of 23 people on board the two boats, only nine people are thought to have survived - some made it to shore with life jackets. The image of the young boy, shown wearing a red T-shirt and lying face-down on the beach near Bodrum, was published shortly after the bodies washed up on shore at about 06:00 local time. Turkish news agency Dogan said he and the rest of the group were Syrians from the besieged town of Kobane who had fled to Turkey last year to escape advancing militants from the Islamic State (IS) group. Turkish media describe relatives breaking down as they identified the bodies. The pictured boy is reported to be three-year-old Aylan, who drowned along with his five-year-old brother Galip and their mother, Rihan. Their father, Abdullah Kurdi, survived. He and his family reportedly sought asylum in Canada before attempting the journey - but their refugee application was turned down. Teema Kurdi, Abdullah's sister who lives in Vancouver, told Canada's National Post newspaper that she had been trying to help them leave the Middle East. Abdullah is reported to have been kidnapped and tortured during the siege of Kobane by Islamic State or another jihadist group. "I was trying to sponsor them [...] but we couldn't get them out, and that is why they went in the boat," she said. The family is believed to have no other option because Syrian Kurdish refugees in Turkey find it almost impossible to get an exit visa unless they have a passport, which few do. A local fisherman who discovered the bodies on the shore said: "I came to the sea and I was scared. My heart is broken." According to the BBC's Fergal Keane, the beach where the bodies were found has become suddenly notorious, but on any day there you will find the debris - deflated dinghy parts, abandoned belongings - of the desperate. The BBC has chosen to publish only one photograph of Aylan, in which he is being carried by a Turkish police officer and is unidentifiable. However, several news organisations have published more graphic images of the boy. UK newspaper The Independent said it had decided to use the images on its website because "among the often glib words about the 'ongoing migrant crisis', it is all too easy to forget the reality of the desperate situation facing many refugees". Despite the reaction to the image online, there has been little reaction from European leaders. The dead boy's father desperately tried to save his family, his aunt Teema Kurdi told Canadian journalist Terry Glavin. "He made it, but his wife didn't and there's a terrible story he told about swimming from one to the other," Mr Glavin said in an interview with BBC Radio 5 live. Abdullah found both of his sons and his wife dead  - although initially he was not able to recognise her because her body had been so badly damaged by the rocks. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of the charity Save the Children, said the "tragic image" was a reminder of "the dangers children and families are taking in search of a better life". "This child's plight should concentrate minds and force the EU to come together and agree to a plan to tackle the refugee crisis," he added. Some 350,000 migrants have made the perilous journey to reach Europe's shores since January this year, according to figures released by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday. The IOM said more than 2,600 migrants had drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean in the same period. Earlier this week, the Turkish government said its coastguard had rescued over 42,000 migrants in the Aegean Sea in the first five months of 2015 and more than 2,160 in the last week alone.

Charli XCX, Ella Eyre and Lianne La Havas will appear alongside The Chemical Brothers and Underworld. Other festivals have been criticised for the lack of women on their bills. Last week, music blog Crack in the Road posted images of edited posters removing all the names of male performers. The rather blank-looking page was shared on social media, with the bills at Reading and Leeds, Download and T in the Park also a focus for criticism. Neneh Cherry, Andreya Triana and Radio 1 DJ B.Traits are among other female acts to be announced by Bestival. Organiser Rob da Bank said: "There are shed-loads of amazing people making some startlingly good music at the moment and look, lots of them are female." This year's Bestival theme is Summer of Love. It takes place at Robin Hill Country Park on the Isle of Wight between 10 and 13 September, with 25 stages on offer. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	Bestival has revealed an all-female line-up in its second wave of announcements for this year's Isle of Wight event.
The new deal will see the 20-year-old striker stay at the club until 2019. Mead has netted 11 times in WSL 1 so far this season, including a hat-trick against leaders Chelsea, to help put her side in contention for the title. Despite being tipped for a first senior England call-up, she was not included in the squad to face Estonia in a Euro 2017 qualifier on 21 September. Sunderland have reportedly turned down a bid from Arsenal Ladies for Mead. "We're delighted that Beth has signed a new deal - she is one of the best young players in the country," Sunderland manager Carlton Fairweather told the club website. "Naturally, with a player like Beth, there has been interest from other top-flight clubs. So for us to secure this signing shows exactly where we want this club to be."	Beth Mead, the leading scorer in Women's Super League One, has signed a new four-year contract with Sunderland.
The Ports occupy bottom spot and they are 11 points adrift of Carrick Rangers with four games left. "We look forward to it and we'll have a good chance against Ballinamallard," said Ports boss Niall Currie. Ballinamallard are 11 points clear of Rangers, who sit in the relegation play-off place, so they will retain their Premiership status with a win. Carrick are not in action until Saturday, when they take on Ards, but their destiny may already have been decided by events at Shamrock Park. Portadown came from behind to beat Carrick 2-1 last weekend and Currie is hoping for a repeat display. "We've a lot of kids playing at the minute and if they play like they did against Carrick then we have every confidence for this game," he added. Media playback is not supported on this device "All our remaining matches are ones we can really challenge for." Ballinamallard will be without the suspended Ryan McConnell but Stuart Hutchinson is set to return. "It will be a massive challenge as they are fighting for their lives - it's going be a tough game," said Mallards manager Gavin Dykes.	Anything less than victory against the Mallards will see Portadown relegated from the Irish Premiership.
Declan Paul Butcher from Roe Park Court committed the 'single punch' assaults on Market Street in Limavady on 2 October 2014. CCTV footage showed his first victim being knocked unconscious. A second man suffered a double jaw fracture. Butcher appeared at Londonderry Crown Court on Thursday. He was sentenced to 14 months in prison. The court heard that the defendant had 51 previous convictions including eight assaults. He had also been assessed as presenting a high likelihood of reoffending. The judge told Butcher he had inflicted "gratuitous violence" on two" completely innocent" members of the public. The second man was punched and knocked out when he came across the first victim lying unconscious on Market Street. Both men later regained consciousness in hospital.	A 25-year-old man from Limavady has been jailed for knocking out two men in separate attacks on the same night.
Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club: "I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session. "The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches. "At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times. "I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there. "The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them. "They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them. "I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool. "The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff. "As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous. "It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage. "They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern. "They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose. "That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them. "Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work. "Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again. "They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them. "They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal. "I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me." Alex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs. The Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday. A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.	It was 50 years ago today that The Beatles played their first gig at the Cavern Club in Liverpool - the venue where the band built their reputation and where Beatlemania was born.
G4S provides healthcare for the UK's Yarl's Wood immigration detention centre, deemed a "place of national concern" after it was found to be failing vulnerable women. Emerging markets' revenue rose 5.7% to £1.18bn but UK revenue fell by 3.2%. G4S's operations span 110 countries and it employs 611,000 staff. Its operations include providing services for airports and restocking cash machines. It also has outsourcing contracts from companies and governments to place, for example, police and prison officers where there are shortages, and "supports justice and security strategies" for governments of countries in conflict, says G4S. Revenues were £3.2bn, up 2.8% compared with the same period last year. However, the company said that during the period, it took a charge of £16m for restructuring. New contract sales were £1.4bn. Chief executive Ashley Almanza said: "Demand for our services was robust, particularly in North America, Latin America and Asia Middle East. As anticipated, revenues were lower in UK & Ireland."	Security firm G4S has reported a £4m rise in profits to £185m for the first half of 2015 due to new contracts and growth in emerging markets.
The Academy Selsey suffered extensive damage and much of its contents was destroyed in the blaze on 21 August. The school's 453 pupils are currently being taught at four locations in the Selsey area. As well as classrooms, the temporary buildings will house science labs, workshops and food technology areas, the school said. The buildings, some of which have already been placed on the site by two large cranes, had previously been used to house staff and students from Bohunt School in Worthing while building work was carried out. Tom Garfield, head teacher of the academy, said: "We are absolutely delighted to see the first temporary school buildings arrive on site. It's a great milestone for us, the staff and students alike." He said once the remaining structures had arrived over the next few days the school would begin preparing the rooms for teaching.	Temporary classrooms are being set up at a school that was damaged by fire.
Trams ran in the city between 1904 and 1953 before being replaced by buses. In December, they returned to the streets with the opening of the Midland Metro service - the first part of a Â£128m project. Once complete, trams from Wolverhampton will continue in to Birmingham, terminating at New Street station. Roger Lawrence, chairman of the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority said: "This is an opportunity to expand. Not just into the city centre but out to the airport. "We will have a network to rival the best ones, like Manchester and Nottingham and even south London. Our network will equal those". At its peak, the original tram network ran 230 million passenger journeys every year from Yardley to Dudley, and from Erdington down to the Lickey Hills. Elsie Field, now 91, began working on the trams as a conductress when she was 18. Part of her job was using a pole to connect the tramcar to the overhead power lines. She said although she was short-sighted she was "too proud to wear her glasses, so the connection was sometimes a bit hit-and-miss". Tram enthusiast Geoffrey Claydon grew up in Birmingham and said he was disappointed when his regular commute was replaced by a bus service. "I said why have the trams gone and was told 'Oh, they're old fashioned'. From that moment I thought I would be very supportive of trams, I would do my best to try and keep them where I can for the rest of my life". When working as a government lawyer, Mr Claydon helped design the Transport and Works Act of 1992, which paved the way for the Midland Metro Line. "I can now feel quite smug. It was an immense satisfaction that I've lived long enough to see trams back and the poor souls who got rid of them have been proved wrong". Inside Out West Midlands has a full report on the history and reintroduction of trams in Birmingham on BBC One, Monday at 19:30.	The reintroduction of trams to Birmingham will "give the city a network to rival the best", a transport official has said.
LGBT Youth Scotland said its research suggested more needed to be done to ensure LGBT young people felt safe. It urged those affected to understand their rights and report discrimination. The charity said not every young person was aware of what constituted a criminal act under hate crime legislation . In an online survey of LGBT people aged 13 to 25 conducted by the charity, 49% of the 273 respondents said they felt safe and supported by the legal system. The figure fell to 40% among those who identified as transgender. Half of those surveyed said they were aware of their rights, while a similar proportion (53%) said they would feel confident in reporting a crime they experienced to the police. Among transgender young people the figure dropped to 48%, while bisexual women were the least likely to feel confident reporting a hate crime at 46%. Just over half (51%) of transgender young people said they felt safe using public transport. While the charity has welcomed an increase in the reporting of hate crimes, YGBT Youth Scotland has recommended that campaigns, activities and lesson plans be developed for use in schools, with specific reference to hate crime. Chief executive Fergus McMillan said: "In Scotland, we are fortunate to have strong hate crime legislation that is inclusive of transgender identities yet the safety report shows a gap in knowledge and confidence for transgender young people in particular. "When young people know about their rights, and have confidence in the process, they are more likely to be willing to report. "An increase in reported crimes since the introduction of the legislation is certainly positive, yet more must be done to ensure that LGBT young people feel safe in their communities, understand their rights and how to report discrimination and harassment, and have the confidence to report."	Many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) young people still encounter harassment in public spaces, according to a Scottish charity.
Sharbat Gula, whose haunting green eyes made her famous, fled Soviet-occupied Afghanistan as a child and was pictured in 1984 in a refugee camp in Pakistan. Mrs Gula has been accused of living in Pakistan on fake identity papers and faces up to 14 years in jail. Pakistan recently launched a crackdown on fake IDs. There are strict restrictions to getting a Pakistani ID card, which is needed for opening a bank account or to buy property. Why Now?: M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad Technically, Sharbat Gula cannot deny she committed fraud. But on a humanitarian level, many believe she is just one among thousands of Afghan refugees who committed the same offence. Unfortunately for Mrs Gula, she has become the victim of a rather sudden turn in Pakistan's policy towards refugees.  It wants them out of the country in the shortest possible time. Pakistan's decision has come amid its rapidly deteriorating relations with India and Afghanistan. Officials say militants have been using hideouts in refugee settlements to launch attacks in Pakistan. Another reason, according to some quarters, may be Islamabad's likely desire to inflict economic pain on Kabul for co-operating with India. The Afghans forced to go home Afghanistan's looming refugee disaster Mrs Gula was arrested in Peshawar, near the Afghan border after a two-year investigation. She allegedly applied for an identity card in April 2014, using the name Sharbat Bibi. On Sunday Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said she should be granted bail, but a judge denied her application, saying she had failed to make her case. If the fraud claims are true, she is one of thousands of Afghan refugees deploying desperate measures to avoid returning to their war-torn homeland. The celebrated "Afghan girl" picture was taken by photographer Steve McCurry in 1984 in a refugee camp in north-west Pakistan, during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. It led to one of the most recognisable magazine covers ever printed. He tracked her down 17 years later, living in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. Mrs Gula later moved back to Pakistan and he kept in touch. He told BBC Newsday on Wednesday that he had hired a lawyer for her. He added that he believed the Pakistani authorities may have singled her out because she is so well known. "Perhaps they are trying to send the message to other Afghan refugees that 'we couldn't care who you are, we are going to hunt you down and drive you back into your country'." Recent UN figures show that Pakistan hosts 1.4 million registered Afghan refugees. A further one million unregistered refugees are believed to be in the country. Pakistan recently started cracking down on fake IDs. It has been illegal for non-Pakistanis to have IDs since they were first issued in the 1970s but the law was not enforced, says our reporter M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. At first, the procedure was for a village council member to endorse a citizen's application. Few village councillors objected to endorsing an application for someone who, to them and to the rest of the village, was no longer a refugee but a neighbour, he adds.	An Afghan woman immortalised on the cover of National Geographic magazine has been denied bail after being arrested on fraud charges.
President Xi Jinping said China's "territorial sovereignty and marine rights" in the seas would not be affected by the ruling "in any way". But he insisted China was still "committed to resolving disputes" with its neighbours. The Philippines brought the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The tribunal, based in the Hague, ruled that there was no evidence that China had historic rights to the waters or resources that fell within its "nine-dash line", and was violating the Philippine's sovereign rights with its operations there. The ruling was made by an arbitration tribunal under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It is binding but the Permanent Court of Arbitration has no powers of enforcement. The Philippines has had diplomatic spats with China over the Scarborough Shoal and Spratlys in particular. It says China's "nine-dash line", which China uses to demarcate its territorial claims, is unlawful under the UNCLOS convention. Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei also have competing claims in the region. Although these islands are largely uninhabited, they may have reserves of natural resources around them. There has been little detailed exploration of the area, so estimates are largely extrapolated from the mineral wealth of neighbouring areas. The sea is also a major shipping route and home to fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region. Chinese media were quick to take the official line that Beijing would not recognise the ruling. China's state news agency Xinhua said that "as the panel has no jurisdiction, its decision is naturally null and void". The Philippine government welcomed the ruling as a "milestone decision", but there was little outright celebration. The BBC's Jonah Fisher in Manila says this may be due to a recent change of government - many Filipinos believe newly-elected President Rodrigo Duterte may have sought promises of Chinese investment, in return for a quiet, dignified response. There was more delight among Philippine social media users, who dubbed the ruling #CHexit. Both the US and Japan urged both sides to abide by the ruling. The US called it an "important contribution to the shared goal of a peaceful resolution to disputes in the South China Sea". But Taiwan rejected the tribunal's findings on an area it administers, saying the ruling had "seriously damaged" its rights and would "definitely not accept this ruling". The US sent an aircraft carrier and fighter jets to the region ahead of the decision, while the Chinese navy has been carrying out exercises near the disputed Paracel islands. This result represents a major loss of face for China, and yet the first response from Beijing to the UN tribunal's demolition of its claims seems be rather conciliatory. On the one hand, the Chinese government has re-stated that it has territorial sovereignty and maritime rights in the area and that the activities of its people there date back to over 2,000 years ago. However, it then goes on to talk about "consultation with the states directly concerned" and proposes "joint development in relevant maritime areas". Airlines and shipping companies will be pleased to hear that China has also restated that it respects "freedom of navigation and over flight enjoyed by all states under international law in the South China Sea" and that it stands ready to ensure "unimpeded access to international shipping lanes". All this seems to point towards Beijing possibly seeking some sort of negotiated settlement rather than ramping up the pressure on the Philippines following Manila's comprehensive victory in The Hague.	China has firmly rejected an international tribunal ruling that its claims to rights in the South China Sea have no legal basis.
No-one here is in any doubt that Boko Haram did it. It seems people do not know where to vent their anger now but hostility hangs in the air. Inside the mosque, the sight is shocking. Beyond the blood-soaked steps, the floor is strewn with debris: scattered prayer mats, beads, smashed spectacles and pages from the Koran. There are bullet marks on the pillars and the suicide bombers' blood can be seen splattered across the walls and right up inside the dome. "We heard a loud sound outside, but people said let's continue praying," said Adamu Magashi, who was inside facing the imam who had just finished his sermon at the time of the attack. "Then a bomb went off right inside the mosque and somebody started shooting. We tried to move towards the imam and there was another blast - we couldn't even see each other as we tried to escape," he told me after returning to the scene. Outside, a large crowd stands over the twisted remains of the motorbikes and bicycles that were engulfed in the flames when the first bomber struck, driving a car into the assembled worshippers. Policemen occasionally disperse the agitated throng. Another crowd stares at a collection of blackened shoes that has been gathered up in the large open sandy area in front of the green domed mosque. "This was the first time ever the five daily prayers were not observed in this mosque," one shocked man, who has often prayed here, told me, describing the attack as unimaginable. On Friday, the terror swiftly turned to fury when three of the gunmen were overpowered right outside the mosque. They were beaten and burnt to death. Had their lives been spared, they could have provided useful intelligence on the group behind the violence - not that the police have a good record of investigating and prosecuting. Boko Haram's former leader Mohammed Yusuf was killed when in police custody in 2009. At one of the hospitals, where the hundreds of injured are being treated, the police had to intervene to stop a mob lynching a man who had somehow caused fury by taking a photograph. By targeting such a prominent place of worship, the jihadists have sent shockwaves right across Nigeria. This was not just another attack - Boko Haram seemed to be stating it had no respect for the way Islam is practised here. The people of Kano have been shocked and traumatised before by bombers and gunmen working in tandem. This was by no means the first Boko Haram attack on a mosque. But it was possibly the most devastating. And whilst some have portrayed the Boko Haram insurgency as a war on Christianity, this attack is yet another stark reminder that the vast majority of victims in the conflict have been Muslims. Back in April 2007, a high-profile Muslim cleric was killed in Kano.  Sheikh Ja'afar Mahmoud Adam, was gunned down as he prayed at a mosque here after criticising the group's hardline ideology. Seven years on and the list of targets has grown to include policemen, soldiers, government workers, schoolchildren, teachers, vigilantes, entire barracks as well as towns and villages that have recently been captured by the Islamist insurgents. Anyone who does not subscribe to Boko Haram's own interpretation of Islam is a potential victim. The mosque is situated right next to the emir of Kano's palace and is where the outspoken Mohammed Sanusi II regularly preaches. Some people suggest it is no coincidence that the jihadists chose this mosque. Just last week, in the very same building, the emir warned people not to rely on protection by the military, urging them to defend themselves against attacks by the insurgents. "If people flee the villages, the terrorists slaughter our male children and abduct our girls to force them in to slavery," he said. He was out of the country when the gunmen and bombers struck, but he returned on Saturday, visited the mosque twice and sounded defiant. "We will never be intimidated into abandoning our religion, which is the intention of the attackers," he said. He later lead evening prayers at the bloody scene. As trucks take away the debris, people are now cleaning up the mosque ready to pray again. But the jihadist attacks are so relentless that no-one knows where they will strike next. In the 10 days prior to the Kano attack, 188 people were killed by Boko Haram in four separate attacks.  And those are just the incidents we heard about. The loss of life here is on a staggering scale, but the politicians hardly mention it.  There's a presidential vote in February, and election fever takes precedence.	The tension is palpable in Kano, after bombers and gunmen struck killing more than 100 people at the central mosque.
The blaze at Wythenshawe Hall, which broke out at about 03:30 GMT, destroyed the roof and caused extensive damage to an upper floor. Insp Luke Breakspear, of Greater Manchester Police, said the fire investigation was in its infancy. More than 50 firefighters tackled the fire at the timber-framed Tudor hall, which was built in 1540. Wythenshawe was home to the Tatton family for about 400 years. It was donated to local people in 1926 and was previously run as a museum and art gallery. Peter Lamb, Incident Commander with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said having a sprinkler system would have made a difference to quenching the fire. "We recommend sprinklers in all buildings where possible - it did have an automatic fire alarm system and thankfully that gave us the early warning which got us here within minutes, whereas if it hadn't had that would have been in serious trouble," he said. Paul Selby, vice-chair of the Friends of Wythenshawe Hall, said: "As a result of the amazing work of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service the hall is safe - obviously it will need a new roof and some cosmetic work inside." Source: Friends of Wythenshawe Hall	A fire that badly damaged a 16th Century hall in Manchester is "suspicious", police have said.
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a charity worker accused of security offences - was detained while trying to leave the country with her baby daughter after visiting relatives in April 2016. Her family denies she broke any laws. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who is from London, said his wife's detention was a "stain" on Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been detained in Iran since her arrest last year. The couple's two-year-old daughter has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport, and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in September that a Revolutionary Court had handed down the five-year term. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her were not made public. According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife's appeal was dismissed in a secret hearing of an Iranian Revolutionary Court on 4 January but only announced on 22 January. In a statement, her husband said the precise charges against her remain secret, but that two new accusations were made at her appeal. One was that she had been head of recruitment for the BBC's Farsi service when it was launched in 2009. Her family say she worked on a BBC training project for youth in Afghanistan and Iran, but never worked for BBC Farsi. The other charge was that she was married to a British spy. Mr Ratcliffe is an accountant. Monique Villa, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Foundation said she is "outraged by this new mockery of justice", and reiterated Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe never worked for BBC Farsi and that her husband "is not a spy but a reputable accountant". "I am fully convinced of Nazanin's innocence," she added. Francesca Unsworth, BBC World Service Group director, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had briefly worked for charity BBC Media Action in a "junior administrative capacity" but had never worked for BBC Persian. "In any case, to suggest that being employed by BBC Persian is tantamount to 'acting against national security' is patently ludicrous," Ms Unsworth added. Mr Ratcliffe said: "The lack of justice in Nazanin's case continues to be a stain on Iran. The continued attempt to frame Nazanin behind secrets and lies brings shame. "It is a needless waste of a mother and child's life for their own political bargains and economic interests." Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance. Since her imprisonment, her family have campaigned on her behalf, highlighting her deteriorating health while in jail and her anguish at her separation from her daughter.	A court in Iran has rejected an appeal against a five-year prison sentence given to a woman with dual British and Iranian citizenship.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 30-year-old Celtic midfielder will win his 50th cap if he features in a friendly against Denmark on Tuesday, when six players could earn first caps. "He's not only been a good footballer, but he's been a good help to young players now," said Strachan. "He's been a big part of my career over the last 10 years." Brown was signed from Hibernian by the Scotland coach when he was in charge of Celtic and also made him captain while Darren Fletcher was absent through prolonged illness. "He is good with people, he likes being with people, he makes everyone welcome here and then he trains to the maximum," said Strachan. "He is a leader and Darren Fletcher is too." Aberdeen midfielder Kenny McLean won his first cap after starting in Thursday's 1-0 friendly win over the Czech Republic in Prague. Tony Watt, the Charlton Athletic striker currently on loan with Blackburn Rovers, and Birmingham City full-back Paul Caddis also made their Scotland debuts from the bench. On Tuesday, it could be the turn of Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney and Nottingham Forest midfielder Oliver Burke to earn their first senior caps at the age of 18. Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain, Leeds United defender Liam Cooper, Hibs midfielder John McGinn and Brighton winger Jamie Murphy are also possible debutants. Burke has only made six starts and come off the bench 13 times for his English Championship club. However, Strachan said: "I've seen him a right few times now and seen his debut and he impressed and I've got to say he has impressed everyone here so far. "If you are playing in a successful team, you are ready for international level. "It doesn't matter to me if you are Gordon Greer at 34/35, or Oliver Burke at 18." Tierney has ousted Honduras international Emilio Izaguirre from Celtic's starting line-up this season. "He has played European football against top sides, so that's been a benefit to him and to Celtic and to us," said Strachan. "He did not look out of place in the games I seen him and he's got a good way about him - determined and he's got a bit of humility about him. "I think it's helped that Scott Brown's been round him and people like that." Brown, who thinks Tierney's progress this season "has been exceptional", was looking forward to matching the feat of Alan Hutton, the Aston Villa right-back having earned his 50th cap on Thursday. "It feels like I'm getting old," said the Scotland captain. "I was told that Kieran was eight years old when I had my first international cap." Brown praised Strachan for his role in his own progress when asked how he had changed since that debut against United States in 2005. "I was a bit of a hothead from Hibs at the time and now I'm a hothead at Celtic, so not too much," he joked. "He has put a lot of faith in me and I've got a lot to thank him for over my career, for signing me and making me a better player since signing from Hibs. "He understands the game way more than anyone I have ever worked with." Goalkeepers: Scott Bain (Dundee), Craig Gordon (Celtic) Defenders: Ikechi Anya (Watford), Paul Caddis (Birmingham City), Liam Cooper (Leeds United), Gordon Greer (Brighton), Grant Hanley (Blackburn Rovers), Charlie Mulgrew (Celtic), Kieran Tierney (Celtic), Steven Whittaker (Norwich City) Midfielders: Liam Bridcutt (Leeds United, on loan from Sunderland), Scott Brown (Celtic), Oliver Burke (Nottingham Forest), James Forrest (Celtic), Shaun Maloney (Hull City), John McGinn (Hibernian), Jamie Murphy (Brighton), Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth) Forwards: Steven Fletcher (Marseille, on loan from Sunderland), Leigh Griffiths (Celtic), Chris Martin (Derby County)	Captain Scott Brown has been a "terrific influence" on players looking to make their Scotland debuts, according to coach Gordon Strachan.
If the bill is adopted, the lyrics would change from "in all thy sons command" to "in all of us command". The initiative is backed by the Liberal government and will reach the Senate soon, having passed two readings in the House of Commons. The fight to change two words to O Canada has stirred a passionate debate. Who wants to change the lyrics? A similar idea to change the lyrics was rejected in 2010 by Conservatives, who held the majority in parliament. Longtime liberal MP Mauril Belanger started the initiative this time with Bill C-210, and many in Parliament view the bill as his legacy project. Mr Belanger is sick with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and uses a computer with a voice generator because he can no longer speak. The Ottawa Citizen reports that there has been a push by Liberals and New Democrats to move the bill for Mr Belanger's sake, while some Conservatives want more time to debate the bill because of the anthem's significance to Canadians. What's the case for a gender-neutral anthem? In May, Mr Belanger presented the case for his bill: "On the eve of the 150th anniversary of our federation, it is important that one of our most recognised and appreciated national symbols reflect the progress made by our country in terms of gender equality." "We are in 2016. The Canadian population will understand why we want to make the change," New Democrat MP Christine Moore said. "It is not a big change, and there will not be a big difference in the national anthem, but the difference is significant for women all across Canada." Liberal MP Greg Fergus said it "would be nice if [Canada] stops excluding women from the national anthem", according to the Ottawa Citizen. Why stick with tradition? Some Conservative MPs have voted yes to the bill, but others want more time to debate the issue. "It is tragic that this is being done in a fashion where Canadians are being shut out," Peter Van Loan, a Conservative MP, said in committee last week, the National Post reports. "Their national anthem is being changed. They have been singing it for decades, millions of Canadians. It belongs to them, it is not a plaything of us." "We are telling Canadians, 'Guess what, you don't have a say in your national anthem. It belongs to us as politicians ... for us to deliver our worldview to you and impose it upon you'." O Canada, originally composed with French lyrics, became the country's national anthem in 1980. The first English version included the lines "Our home, our native land, True patriot love thou dost in us command". But during World War 1 that phrase was changed to "in all thy sons command" in an effort to stir patriotic feelings. Other countries have changed their national anthem lyrics to make them more inclusive. In Austria, for example, a lyric about "sons" was changed to "sons and daughters" and a lyric about "fraternal choirs" was changed to "jubilant choirs". In Switzerland, a contest was held to replace the country's national anthem in 2015, but the government has not decided on a winner yet.	The Canadian parliament is considering passing legislation that will make the English version of the national anthem gender-neutral.
He said he was to blame for the team's season, in which they narrowly avoided Premier League relegation on Sunday. Asked of his intentions, he said: "To win something. By the way, I shan't be selling until I do. Not at any price." Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer told Match of the Day that Ashley must "stop selling their best players". Shearer added: "There was a time when they didn't sign anyone for 18 months, which is not acceptable. "I know the city and I know the football club and I haven't got a clue what Mike Ashley is going to do. Actions speak louder than words. "Fans are going to games out of habit, not out of hope. That has to change." Interim manager John Carver said he hoped to remain in charge. "From day one I've wanted this job and I still want it," he said. After the 2-0 win over West Ham, Carver added: "The fact Mike's saying he wants to win something is fantastic. "We've seen how good our fans are, we've seen what kind of performances we put in altogether and we all have to be together. "If Mike's come forward then fair play to him because he wants this club to be united. It's a big, big summer for this club, we have to invest and hopefully we will." Sunday's victory at St James' Park, which guaranteed the Magpies safety, was their first in 11 league games. They experienced a dramatic slump after ex-boss Alan Pardew left the club to manage Crystal Palace when Newcastle were 10th in the table, at the start of 2015. "I didn't envisage us being in this position at Christmas," added Ashley, in the pre-match interview with Sky Sports. Earlier on Sunday, former Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan told Sportsweek that Ashley "runs the club from another planet". But the Newcastle owner on Sunday promised to "continue the policy of investing in the football club", arguing that they are on a "very sound financial footing" after a fourth consecutive year of making a profit. Ashley added: "We may have the cart, financially, but we now need to bolt the horse on, and we are going to." A number of fans stayed behind after the match in a protest planned by the AshleyOut.com group. It follows other demonstrations against the owner in recent weeks, which included a fans' boycott of the home game against Tottenham in April. Meanwhile, Carver said he was proud of how his side reacted to the pressure of the occasion on Sunday at St James' Park. Second-half goals from Moussa Sissoko and Jonas Gutierrez saw the Magpies finish the season in 15th. Hull were relegated following their 0-0 draw against Manchester United. "I think the adrenalin is still pumping, but I have to say I think we dealt with our emotions and the game very well," he said. "In the first half there weren't too many chances and we knew it might take the last five minutes of the game before we could break them down. "Sam [West Ham boss Allardyce] put his strongest team out and they came and were resolute, but it was all about what we were going to do and I think we put in a performance that was worthy of the victory."	Newcastle owner Mike Ashley said he will be staying at the club until they win a trophy or qualify for the Champions League.
The Bluebirds are seven points adrift of the Championship play-off places and have been placed under a transfer embargo. Slade has insisted he is still the man to lead the club but Dalman says his position is under scrutiny. "He knows the pressures; he's done this job before," Dalman said. "Russell knows the score. I talk to him on a regular basis and he knows what's ahead. "He has been here for a while with us and of course his position comes under scrutiny, it always has been. To say it never has been would not be true. "The jury's out on every single one of us every time we have to deliver something." Cardiff have been placed under a transfer embargo by the Football League following a breach of Financial Fair Play rules. The Bluebirds have become the fourth Championship club currently under a transfer embargo, joining Bolton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest. The embargo will be in place for the rest of the January transfer window. Slade confirmed he had spoken with club owner Vincent Tan but said there would be no talks over a new contract for him this month. The former Leyton Orient manager says Tan is still as committed as ever to the club and denied suggestions the Malaysian's scaling-back of club finances showed a lack of backing. "You see bigger clubs building castles and thinking the investment they put in will give them a great chance, but it doesn't guarantee it," Slade said. "You've got to cut your cloth accordingly. There are rules in place." Slade continued: "You can't just go spending £5m here or there. Whatever we do it will have to be under financial constraints."	Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman says the "jury is still out" on manager Russell Slade.
However, the resolution is non-binding, with Nigeria and Senegal opposing a withdrawal. South Africa and Burundi have already decided to withdraw, accusing the ICC of undermining their sovereignty and unfairly targeting Africans. The ICC denies the allegation, insisting it is pursuing justice for victims of war crimes in Africa. The AU took the decision on Tuesday following a divisive debate at its annual heads of state of summit in Addis Ababa. Part of the resolution also said the AU would hold talks with the UN Security Council to push for the ICC to be reformed. After being discussed in several previous summits, this was a huge announcement showing how frustrated the AU was with the international court. But the debate itself showed how divisive the whole issue is. The resolution isn't as strong as many who are opposed to the court would have liked. It only calls on countries to consider how to implement the decision but does not bind them to it. It's a victory for human rights activists who insist the court still has a very important role to play in the continent where many countries have weak judicial systems. The resolution also calls for African countries to continue pushing for reforms of the court - another clear indication that ditching the court en masse isn't such a popular decision. The likes of South Africa and Kenya, which have pushed for withdrawing, will be disappointed that the discussions about completely severing ties with the ICC will have to wait another six months for the next summit. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the court on charges of genocide in Darfur, was at the summit. In 2015, a South African court criticised President Jacob Zuma's government for failing to arrest Mr Bashir when he attended an AU meeting in the main city, Johannesburg. The government later announced that it was withdrawing from the ICC because it did not want to execute arrest warrants which would lead to "regime change". A total of 34 African states are signatories to the Rome Statute, which set up the ICC. The ICC and global justice: What does the ICC do?	The African Union has called for the mass withdrawal of member states from the International Criminal Court (ICC).
The Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust was given the rating following an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in September. Chief Executive Heather Tierney Moore said she was "proud" of the progress made since its previous inspection. The trust was told to focus on issues including staff training, safety and risk assessments in mental health. The trust, which provides services in district nursing, offender health, and mental health and community services such as wellbeing, had been told it "required improvement" in November 2015. Ms Moore said the improved rating was "a fantastic achievement solely down to hard work and effort" it has put into improvements. "This fills us with pride and shows that we are a truly compassionate organisation," she said. Ms Moore said a theme through the report was that patients were treated "with dignity and respect". The trust said the issues highlighted were already being addressed and the relocation of Hurstwood Ward (formerly ward 22) from Burnley to Royal Blackburn Hospital has been completed. The trust was set up in 2002 and has almost 7000 staff across 400 sites. In October, a whistleblower who worked at the trust as a therapist claimed that dozens of prison inmates with serious mental health problems were being left untreated. The trust denied the claim and said severe cases were treated.	A care trust that was told to improve its services has now been classed as "good" overall by health inspectors.
JP Nadeau was reportedly struck by lightning mid-sentence in his apple orchard in New Brunswick, Canada. "And just as I told my new son-in-law 'You're a lucky guy' - Boom!" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Aside from a small scar on his thumb, Mr Nadeau says he was unscathed and the wedding proceeded. Storm clouds had gathered behind him at the ceremony on 8 July, he said, and his daughter saw lightning strike the ground nearby. "I had the microphone and the shock jumped into the sound system and my hand just lit up and I saw the spark," he told the CBC. "And I'm looking at my hand and it's all flared up… It was like I was holding a lightning bolt in my hand, it was amazing." Everyone was stunned at first, but that didn't stop the happy couple from continuing with the festivities. "It was a beautiful wedding," Mr Nadeau's wife, Maggy Thomas, told the CBC. "But that was pretty terrifying for a second." Mr Nadeau says he's a lucky-unlucky man - in 2015, a cruise ship he was working on near the Falkland Islands caught fire, and he was rescued by the British Royal Air Force. "I've had lots of brushes with death," said Mr Nadeau. "But death keeps ignoring me."	No one likes a dull wedding, but one father-of-the-bride's speech was a little too electrifying at his daughter's ceremony last weekend.
Robinson led the club back to the Premiership in May, ending their seven-year stay in the Championship. But Bristol have lost all seven top-flight games so far this season, leaving them bottom of the table. The 52-year-old former England and Scotland head coach has been in charge at Bristol since 2013. Robinson only signed a new three-year contract with the Ashton Gate side in August, but they have since lost all nine of their competitive fixtures - including two in the European Challenge Cup. A club statement said: "Bristol Rugby have decided, following the extremely disappointing start to the season, to appoint Mark Tainton as acting head coach with immediate effect." Kicking coach Tainton, who joined Bristol prior to the start of the season, has previously worked at London Irish, Wasps and for the Ireland national team coaching staff. "This is clearly a very difficult time for the club, but we remain confident we can retain our position in the Premiership," added Bristol chairman Chris Booy. Since Bristol's long-awaited return to the top flight began with an encouraging 21-19 loss at Harlequins on the opening day, both results and performances have failed to meet expectations. A heavy 70-22 defeat at Wasps on 18 September set the tone for a defence which has conceded 34 tries in seven league games. Injuries have undoubtedly hampered Robinson's side, with 15 senior players ruled out of October's Challenge Cup loss at local rivals Bath. Long-term absentees have included influential former Wales centre Gavin Henson, who was forced off injured in both of his two appearances this season, including Sunday's 31-13 home defeat by Sale Sharks. BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter Chris Jones "Bristol spent seven seasons down in the Championship, so it's no surprise that they have acted swiftly following their chastening start to their Premiership campaign. "Although the club say Robinson is suspended, not sacked, it's hard to see him returning to take charge of team affairs, and it's likely the suspension is a case of negotiating severance. "Mark Tainton will be acting head coach while a review is carried out, with Bristol needing a dramatic upturn in their fortunes on the pitch to avoid an immediate return to the second tier."	Bristol have suspended director of rugby Andy Robinson pending a "review of their coaching needs", and placed coach Mark Tainton in interim charge.
Straker, 27, has been without a club since leaving York in January, where he made 27 appearances. He began his career at Crystal Palace and helped Aldershot Town win the Conference title in 2008, before moving to Southend United. Grimsby are currently third in the National League, having lost only one game in the league since October.	Grimsby Town have signed former York City midfielder Anthony Straker on a deal until the end of the season.
Wildsmith, a product of the club's academy, has made 18 appearances for the Owls in all competitions. The 21-year-old had a loan spell with then-League One side Barnsley in 2015, making two appearances. "I'm delighted to sign for the club long term, it's great that the club believe in me and see me as part of the future," he told the club website.	Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Joe Wildsmith has signed a new deal to stay with the Championship side until 2022.
Flanker Peter O'Mahony captains the side in Rotorua, with tour skipper Sam Warburton on the replacements' bench. Maro Itoje starts at lock in an otherwise unchanged pack from the one that beat the Crusaders last Saturday. "Even though it's a strong side we have to make sure we aren't fully showing our hand," said boss Warren Gatland. "We need to keep the All Blacks guessing a little bit about what the final squad [for the first Test] may be." Sexton, 31, has not started since the first match of the tour against the Provincial Barbarians, but came off the bench to good effect in the win over the Crusaders in Christchurch. He partners fellow Irishman Conor Murray at half-back. "Johnny needs some more rugby and he's got a bit of his mojo back, so we wanted to give him a start," Gatland added. Farrell is among the replacements, and Gatland says there is "every chance" he will play alongside Sexton at some point in the game. Gatland has previously played down the possibility of Farrell and Sexton operating in the same backline. "Owen Farrell has had quite a bit of rugby and he's pretty important to us at the moment," Gatland said. "We need to make sure he is fit for the following week, because he has been pretty crucial to us. "He is on the bench and he can come on and we could end up with a 10/12 combination [with Sexton], or we can end up with him coming on at 10. "At some point he will get some game time." Maori All Blacks: J Lowe; N Milner-Skudder, M Proctor, C Ngatai, R Ioane; D McKenzie, T Kerr-Barlow; K Hames, A Dixon (capt), B May, J Wheeler, T Franklin, A Ioane, E Dixon, L Messam. Replacements: H Elliot, C Eves, M Renata, L Price, K Pryor, B Hall, I West, R Thompson. Lions: L Halfpenny (Wales); A Watson (England), J Davies (Wales), B Te'o (England), G North (Wales); J Sexton, C Murray (both Ireland); M Vunipola, J George (both England), T Furlong (Ireland), M Itoje, G Kruis (both England), P O'Mahony (capt, Ireland), S O'Brien (Ireland), T Faletau (Wales). Replacements: K Owens (Wales), J McGrath (Ireland), K Sinckler (England), I Henderson (Ireland), S Warburton (Wales), G Laidlaw (Scotland), O Farrell, E Daly (both England). Gatland says Warburton is aware of the competition he faces in the back row if he is to start the first Test against the All Blacks on 24 June. Warburton returned from a minor ankle injury to play over an hour in the midweek defeat by the Highlanders in Dunedin. "He is fully aware that loose-forward trio went extremely well against the Crusaders," Gatland said. "This tour isn't about Sam Warburton, it's about putting the squad first, so if he isn't involved in the first Test he will fully understand that." Elswehere, Ben Te'o is alongside Jonathan Davies in the midfield, with George North, Anthony Watson and Leigh Halfpenny in the back three. Liam Williams does not feature in the matchday squad for the second successive game. Mako Vunipola, Jamie George and Tadgh Furlong continue their combination in the front row. Media playback is not supported on this device Gatland says a fixture against the Maori is one of the "unique spectacles in world rugby". The Maori starting XV features experienced All Blacks such as scrum-half Tawera Kerr-Barlow and wing Nehe Milner-Skudder. The potent backline also includes fly-half Damian McKenzie, Charlie Ngatai and Reiko Ioane, who scored against the Lions for the Blues and has been named in the New Zealand squad for the Test matches. "We experienced a powerful powhiri on Monday which really resonated with the boys and it's been great to be here in Rotorua and feel all the support," said Maori head coach Colin Cooper. "It's really lifted the team and helped bring them together as a unit. We recognise the challenge that is ahead of us on Saturday, but we're really excited as a group by the opportunity we have to represent New Zealand, Maoridom and the fans that will descend on Rotorua this weekend."	Johnny Sexton has been preferred to Owen Farrell at fly-half for Saturday's British and Irish Lions match with the Maori All Blacks.
The Board of Community Health Councils (CHCs) is refusing to say why chief executive Tony Rucinski was suspended. Emails show that before his suspension Dr Rucinski raised concerns the board's chair Mutale Merrill may have been influenced by a government minister to stop him doing media interviews. Ms Merill said she does not accept the emails' content is "factually correct". Dr Rucinski said he has been "instructed not to comment." The organisation describes itself as the "independent voice of patients" in Wales. It and the seven CHCs it oversees had an annual budget in 2015-16 of Â£3.8m. Dr Rucinski was appointed as chief executive of the Board of Community Health Councils in a newly-created role in July 2015. At the time, he told BBC Wales that he had been "put in place to make things happen". He said he wanted CHCs to become a "much more proactive and effective patient voice". Four months later the Welsh Government appointed Ms Merrill as the board's new chair. Dr Rucinski was then suspended in February 2016. Several sources have told BBC Wales that there was tension between Mr Rucinski and Ms Merrill prior to his suspension. In emails written to Ms Merrill before his suspension, obtained by BBC Wales, Mr Rucinski raises concerns about being stopped from doing interviews on a Welsh Government digital health initiative in December 2015 and on a report by the OECD think tank comparing UK health services in February 2016. In the emails Dr Rucinski stated that his job description involved doing media interviews and suggested he felt Ms Merill's instructions to him not to do interviews may have been influenced by a meeting with a Welsh Government minister. He wrote: "I am genuinely concerned about the comments you have relayed from your meeting with the minister." Following his suspension, a board meeting was held in which Ms Merrill appears to try to explain the disagreement over media coverage between her and the chief executive. The minutes state that Ms Merrill said a "media embargo" had "only been imposed on the chief executive regarding this one news item [the OECD story]", and "it was noted that there was some context behind this decision which could not be shared, however the board chair had required the chief executive to provide a briefing prior to the commenting on any issue in order to decide the best approach and deliver the message to the media". "A conversation regarding a need for a media protocol had been discussed with the chief executive," the minutes said. The document also said that the chief executive had shared a text message from Ms Merrill with staff "without her knowledge and without context of previous discussions". Following his suspension Dr Rucinski claimed in an email to the Wales Audit Office in April 2016 that Ms Merrill "informed me verbally that the minister had instructed her to not let me do any further media engagements or public appearances". In that email he also said he believed "the independent voice of patients and the public in Wales has been gagged during a crucial time for healthcare debate nationally". Alyson Thomas and Clare Jenkins are in "acting chief executive" roles. Dr Rucinski was previously chief executive of the Macular Society from March to November 2014. Ms Merill said: "I can confirm on behalf of the Board of Community Health Councils in Wales that there are ongoing personnel processes relating to the chief executive officer and due process is being followed in respect of those matters." Ms Merill added that she did not accept that Mr Rucinski's allegations in the emails were factually correct and said she was unable to provide further comment at this stage whilst internal processes are ongoing. Dr Ruckinski said: "I have been instructed not to comment." BBC Wales understands the Welsh Government was made aware of the suspension. A spokesman for Welsh ministers said: "The suspension of Mr Rucinski is wholly an internal matter for the CHC Board. "It is not appropriate for us to comment any further." A spokeswoman for public spending watchdog the Wales Audit Office said: "We have received correspondence on this matter but after careful consideration we have concluded that it seems to fall outside of the remit of the auditor general, though we will naturally keep a close eye on any developments."	The head of the patients' watchdog has been suspended on full pay since February 2016, BBC Wales understands.

Media playback is not supported on this device The British rivals meet in Group B at Euro 2016 on Thursday (14:00 BST). Last week, 26-year-old Bale said the Welsh had more passion and pride than England, who "big themselves up before they've done anything". "I've been in the game sufficiently long to know every opponent has got an opinion," said Hodgson. "The other day it was [Russia goalkeeper] Igor Akinfeev saying we were the worst seeded team and now it's Gareth Bale. "They can have those opinions but I don't have any doubts personally about our patriotism or desire and that's the important thing. "I would recommend anybody who does have any doubts about players in that respect to watch the game [against Russia] and come to me afterwards and show me where they've seen that lack of passion and lack of patriotism because I certainly didn't see it. "We know who we are, we know what we are. We don't have any doubts about ourselves in that respect." Media playback is not supported on this device England started their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Russia, while Wales beat Slovakia 2-1 in the their first game in a major tournament for 58 years. It was Bale who scored Wales' opener in Bordeaux, and England captain Wayne Rooney is aware of the threat posed by the Real Madrid forward. "I think he is a fantastic player, probably in the top five players in the world," said the Manchester United skipper. "He is the biggest threat for Wales, but I don't think we will go out and man-mark him. "I think we have to go out and play our game. They will have a lot to think about our team, too. I'm sure it will be a fascinating game." England were leading 1-0 against Russia thanks to an Eric Dier free-kick but they had to settle for a 1-1 draw after conceding an injury-time equaliser. The result means they have failed to win any of their last five matches at major tournaments, but striker Harry Kane insisted England fans should remain positive. "We have got great players, we ain't no mugs," said the Tottenham forward. "We are more than confident. We are not going to let this affect us. "On another day it could have been three or four nil. We limited Russia to very few chances and we had plenty. We have got to learn from it, take the positives and prepare for Thursday."	Manager Roy Hodgson says he does not doubt England's "patriotism or desire", in the wake of comments made by Wales striker Gareth Bale.
During his emotional testimony he said Ms Steenkamp died before the ambulance arrived while he was holding her. He said he tried to help her breathe and stem the bleeding from her hip. The athlete denies deliberately shooting dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year, arguing he mistook her for an intruder. Prosecutors contend he intentionally killed her in the toilet of his bathroom after a row. The 27-year-old Olympic and Paralympic sprinter, who is a double amputee, faces life imprisonment if convicted of murder. On Tuesday, he broke down in tears whilst describing the events leading up to the shooting and the actual event. If acquitted, South African law stipulates that the court must consider the separate, lesser charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, for which he could receive between six and 15 years in prison. Mr Pistorius also faces charges of illegally firing a gun in public and of illegally possessing ammunition, both of which he denies. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. On his third day on the stand, Mr Pistorius described the moments after paramedics had arrived at the scene. "They asked for some space to work so I stood up. Reeva had already died whilst I was holding her before the ambulance arrived. So, I knew there was nothing they could do for her," he told the court. He also described his distress as police and other officials arrived at the house. "I asked a policeman if I could wash my hands because the smell of the blood was making me throw up," he said. His lawyer Barry Roux also asked him to demonstrate how he would swing a cricket bat. Mr Pistorius said he was on his prosthetic legs when he used the cricket bat to break down the toilet door. He said the three sounds heard by witnesses at 03:17 local time was the cricket bat hitting the door - about five minutes after he shot at the toilet door. He said he was on his stumps, when he shot at the door. "I can barely stand on my stumps," he said. During his questioning, Mr Roux also mentioned statements from close neighbours who were listed by the state but not called by the prosecution. He said the statement from Kenny Motshoane's house described hearing "crying" and not "a woman screaming", as mentioned by other witnesses. Another woman living nearby also says she heard "loud crying" and not a woman screaming, Mr Roux said. Before Mr Roux ended his questioning he asked Mr Pistorius if he had intentionally killed Ms Steenkamp. "I did not intend to kill Reeva  or anybody else for that matter," he replied. On Tuesday, the athlete described how the couple had spent a quiet evening together on 13 February, Ms Steenkamp doing some yoga as he spoke to his cousin on the phone. He had then watched TV in bed with his head resting on her stomach and she would occasionally show him photos of cars she was looking at on her phone, he said. He said that they had bought Valentine's Day gifts for each other. Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, reality TV celebrity and law graduate, was hit by at least three bullets while in the toilet cubicle of Mr Pistorius's home in Pretoria. 1 2 5 4 6 3 Mr Pistorius said in his statement at the start of the trial that he woke in the early hours and  walked on his stumps to the balcony, pulled in two fans, closed the sliding door and drew curtains. He said that shortly before he had spoken to Reeva, who was in bed beside him. He said he rejected prosecution claims that a witness heard arguing coming from the house before the shooting. Mr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars. "Unbeknown to me, Reeva must have gone to the toilet in the bathroom at the time I brought in the fans," he said. Mr Pistorius said he approached the bathroom armed with his firearm, to defend himself and his girlfriend, believing Ms Steenkamp was still in bed. Both sides agree four bullets were fired. Ms Steenkamp was hit three times. Mr Pistorius said he fired his weapon after hearing a noise in the toilet which he thought was the intruder coming out of the toilet to attack him and Ms Steenkamp. He said he was in a fearful state, knowing he was on his stumps and unable to run away or properly defend himself. Mr Pistorius said he rejected claims that he was on his prostheses when he shot at the door. A witness told the trial she woke to hear a woman screaming and a man shouting for help. She said that after the screams she heard four shots. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom after shooting at the toilet door, still shouting for Reeva. Lifting himself up onto the bed, he felt over to the right hand side of it and noticed Ms Steenkamp was not there. Mr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bathroom but the toilet was locked, so he returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs, turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat. Forensics expert Johannes Vermeulen told the court that the height of the marks on the door caused by the cricket bat suggest Mr Pistorius was on his stumps at the time. Mr Pistorius's defence team say he then called security at the gated housing complex and a private paramedic service before carrying Ms Steenkamp downstairs. A security guard claimed it was the other way round, and he had called Mr Pistorius first after reports of gunfire. However, phone records shown to the court revealed Mr Pistorius called the estate manager at 3:19am, a minute later he called the ambulance service and at 3:21am he called estate security. A minute later he received an incoming call - estate security calling him back. According to police phone expert Francois Moller, Mr Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris a short time later and just after 4:00am he called his brother Carl.	South African athlete Oscar Pistorius is back in court in Pretoria describing events after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home.
Prof Colin Riordan, the chair of Universities Wales and vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, said the policy of paying the majority of Welsh students' tuition fees has to change. He wants it replaced with a means tested grant to help poorer students. The Welsh government said its tuition fee policy has been a "huge success". Prof Riordan told BBC Wales' The Wales Report TV programme: "If you took the same approach to the tuition fee grant, as you do with maintenance grants, you could free up considerable funding to allow Welsh universities to compete in the same way as other universities in the UK and that's really critical to the future of our country. "There is no limit to the number of students that can go to university which means there is no limit to the money that is needed to fund the tuition fee policy and that means there is not enough money to fund Welsh universities." Yesterday, First Minister Carwyn Jones defended the Welsh government's university tuition fees subsidy and rejected the idea that tuition fee support should be limited to Welsh students who study at universities in Wales rather than anywhere they study in the UK. He was responding to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood who said the current policy meant too much Welsh public money ended up going to English universities. On Sunday, outgoing Education Minister Huw Lewis told BBC Wales tuition fee grants would remain in place after May's assembly election if Labour retained power. Universities in Wales get the majority of their funding through the tuition fees paid by students. They also get an amount from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), around Â£90m a year, which has been cut this year by the Welsh government. Prof Riordan said it had seen a 40% cut to funding which would result in job losses and would affect students. "The critical part is that the government needs to make sure than enough money is still available to fund all the areas that the tuition fee grant can't fund and that means making sure that funding is available to ensure that Welsh universities can continue to be the great success they've been over recent years," he said. "The future prosperity of the people of Wales is in the knowledge economy and the universities are the building blocks of that economy". A Welsh government spokesperson said: "There is no doubt that we have had to make some tough decisions within this budget and we  recognise that the cut to HEFCW will present challenges. "We stand by our tuition fee grant policy which has been a huge success, has supported our learners to study a course and at an institution that is right for them, and has meant that Welsh graduates have left university with debts that are on average Â£22,000 lower than graduates from England." The Wales Report is on BBC1 Wales at 22:40 GMT	The Welsh government's tuition fee policy is threatening the future of higher education in Wales, according to the body representing its universities.
The Electoral Commission will decide whether to select Vote Leave, which Mr Johnson is backing or Grassroots Out, which has been endorsed by UKIP's Nigel Farage, as the official lead campaign. The winner will be able to spend up to £7m on TV broadcasts and advertising. The Mayor of London suggested the two groups would unite after the decision. Relations between the two groups have been strained amid arguments over campaign strategies and personalities. Asked whether a merger was now on the cards, he told LBC Radio that the "basic objective" should be to have a single campaign and the rival groups were "unified by the rightness of their arguments". Vote Leave has been endorsed by Mr Johnson and the five Conservative Cabinet ministers who want to leave the EU. It also has the backing of a number of Labour Eurosceptics, including Gisela Stuart, and business figures. Grassroots Out, which was formed in January, is backed by senior UKIP figures as well as Conservative and Labour backbenchers such as Peter Bone and Kate Hoey. Speaking on his monthly LBC phone-in, Mr Johnson rejected suggestions that having two separate groups was holding back the Leave campaign and was being exploited by their opponents. "I haven't noticed the other side making very much of this. Let's hold our fire and not get wrapped up in tiny issues about who is doing what on the Leave campaign. The thing that matters to me is getting the arguments out." Mr Johnson said he had spoken to the UKIP leader in recent weeks but his focus was on making the case to the British people. He added: "The Electoral Commission have to work out which of the various groupings should carry the flag for Britain to take back control of its borders, take back control of a huge amount of money and forge new trading relationships around the world. "I think it doesn't really matters too much who comes out on top in this one provided that we all get together and work to that end." Asked whether the decision would be a unifying moment for those backing EU exit, he replied "of course it will". The elections watchdog is expected to make its decision on which group will head the Leave campaign by the middle of April. It will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity. Whoever wins will get access to a grant of up to £600,000 and an overall spending limit of £7m for media, mailshots and campaign organisation. Conservative MP Tom Pursglove, one of the co-founders of Grassroots Out, said the designation would be a "watershed moment", after which all Leave campaigners should "put aside their differences, row in together and campaign as one". He said he expected there to be dialogue between the two groups in the run-up to the official decision and Boris Johnson was "spot on" to argue the issue could not be allowed to become a distraction. "There is just not the time to waste on bickering over the designation. We should be focused purely on leaving and winning this referendum." During the phone-in, Mr Johnson likened the Remain campaign's warnings about the risks of EU exit to fatalistic predictions about the Millennium Bug in 2000, saying talk of "bank accounts being wiped" and "planes falling out of sky" back then had been proved to be groundless. But he was challenged by the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who accused him of using the campaign for his own political ends and "inviting a media circus" to his house last month to announce he was backing EU exit. "What you need to understand is that this is not about you," Mr Umunna, who backs EU membership, said. "It is about our city and our country...If anybody has been talking down our country, it is you. You denigrate our influence within the EU." Mr Johnson said that what made people sceptical about the EU was listening to politicians such as Mr Umunna "droning on" about the economic benefits of EU membership. "This is about the prospects of the British people and their democracy," he insisted.	Boris Johnson has said it does not really matter which lobby group is chosen to "carry the flag" for EU exit in the up referendum campaign.
The 29-year-old joined the U's on a free in May 2015 but has made only six appearances for the League Two side. He spent part of last season on loan at Stevenage and has also spent time with Luton and Preston. "I'm very excited to be here. I've worked hard throughout pre-season and I'm desperate to get back playing football," Keane told the club website. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	League One Rochdale have signed midfielder Keith Keane on loan from Cambridge United until January.
The financial services firm said new rules, coming into effect next May, could see fines soar to 20m euros (£17.4m) or more. Fines for data breaches had already risen, from 18 in 2015, to 35 in 2016, amounting to £3.2m in total, said PwC. There were also 23 enforcement notices, where organisations were required to improve compliance - a 155% increase. According to PwC's research, the UK is one of the most active places in Europe for regulatory enforcement in this area, along with Italy. Penalties issued by the UK Information Commissioner's Office in 2016 included a record £400,000 fine for telecoms firm TalkTalk over security failings that allowed a cyber attacker to access customer data "with ease". In 2015 the online pharmacy Pharmacy 2U was also told to pay £130,000 after it sold details of more than 20,000 customers to marketing companies without their consent. However, PwC said that when the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becomes law across the EU next May, firms would face much tougher obligations and penalties. In particular, the Information Commissioner's Office will be able to issue fines of up to 4% of global turnover, or 20m euros - whichever is highest. The regulator can only issues fines of up to £500,000 at present. "UK organisations must use the remaining time to prepare for GDPR compliance before May next year," said Stewart Room, an expert in global cybersecurity and data protection at PwC. The UK is due to adopt the new rules before it leaves the EU, but PwC said it was unlikely to water down the protections after it left the union.	Companies must prepare for new tougher EU rules on data protection, or face big fines, PwC has warned.
The hosts saw left-back Alex Telles dismissed after two bookings in a 74-second spell, the second after a wild sliding tackle on Stephan Lichtsteiner on 27 minutes. His side spent long spells in their own half and survived a Paulo Dybala strike against the post before the interval. But Juve - who had 77% possession - broke through when Pjaca drove low into the net five minutes after coming on and Alves finished from six yards 80 seconds after his own introduction. The goals ensured Juve's fourth successive 2-0 win on the road in all competitions and their advantage now looks huge ahead of the return on 14 March. Other than a penalty shootout defeat to Inter Milan in December, the last time the Old Lady lost on home soil was in August 2015. In Porto the Italian side were bettering possession when Telles lost control, first fouling Juan Cuadrado before hacking Lichtsteiner down with no apparent danger. The left-back was clearly emotional as he walked to the tunnel with his shirt covering much of his face. It allowed Juve to totally dominate, though Nuno Espírito Santo's side improved after the break and looked like they may hold out, deploying a compact 4-4-1 formation to stifle the Serie A leaders. But with the game in its final quarter, Pjaca benefited from a ricochet off Miguel Layun - who came on at left-back after Telles' dismissal - to slam his first goal since joining the club in July past Iker Casillas. Alves chested down Alex Sandro's delivery and hooked in on 74 minutes to tighten Juve's grip. Massimiliano Allegri's side hold a seven-point lead at the summit of Italy's top tier and remain undefeated in the Champions League, increasing their hopes of a first win in the competition since 1996. Juventus midfielder Sami Khedira: "I think we can be happy tonight. It's a really good result. After the red card we had to win this game. We played 90 minutes with control and patience. "We are happy for tonight but in three weeks we have to be very careful for the game because now they are angry. We know football is crazy, anything can happen. "Sometimes you have a feeling and this year I have a really good feeling." Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri: "This team still has plenty of room for improvement but the lads showed great maturity tonight. "We're entering a crucial period of the season and we need to approach it with enthusiasm, determination and be as clinical as possible. "But we can't believe 2-0 is enough to see us through. We have to broach the return as if it's still nil-nil." Match ends, FC Porto 0, Juventus 2. Second Half ends, FC Porto 0, Juventus 2. Hand ball by Giorgio Chiellini (Juventus).

The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: "They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall." The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a "modern bungalow". "They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place," he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with "exotic" stones from outside the area. "There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire," explained Mr Jacques. "It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them." Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. "It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site," he said. "It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. "This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like." Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: "I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. "It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge."	A 6,000-year-old "eco-home" has been discovered close to Stonehenge, archaeologists have revealed.
Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch denied Jamie Adams in a first half of few chances before two quick fire goals put the visitors in control. El Bakhtaoui raced on to a Ryan Wallace ball to score his first, before scoring a stunning 30-yard volley from Michael Paton's cross. Craig Moore fired a late chance over for Ayr United, who remain third.	Faissal El Bakhtaoui netted a second-half double as League One leaders Dunfermline claimed victory at Ayr.
However, it said the "masterminds" behind the murder of Gen Adolphe Nshimirimana were still being sought. Prominent human rights activist Pierre Claver Mbonimpa was shot and wounded in an apparent reprisal attack following Gen Nshimirimana's killing last week. Mr Mbonimpa has been allowed to fly to Belgium for treatment. Heavy shooting was heard in the capital, Bujumbura, on Sunday night, but it was unclear who was behind it, the AFP news agency reports. Burundi has suffered serious unrest since President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision in April to seek a third term in office. Opponents argued this violated the constitution, and protests broke out in parts of the country. There was also failed coup attempt in May, as renegade generals demanded that Mr Nkurunziza steps down when his term ends. A presidential election was held last month which Mr Nkurunziza won. The result was rejected by the main opposition parties, but one of its leading members, Agathon Rwasa, agreed to take the post of deputy parliamentary speaker to promote reconciliation. The prosecutor's office said in a statement that a military vehicle was used by Gen Nshimirimana's attackers and it was subsequently burned. "The identities of the perpetrators are now known. A certain number have been arrested. The rest of them and the masterminds are being sought," it  said. The attackers targeted the general's car with machine guns and rocket launchers in the Kamenge district of Bujumbura. He was widely seen as the most powerful person in Burundi after Mr Nkurunziza. Meanwhile, Mr Mbonimpa's daughter said the authorities had allowed him to leave for Belgium, the former colonial power. "He will be treated there and they can do all the tests that we can't do here. We are also more reassured about his safety there," Amandine Nasagarare said, AFP reports. The government condemned his shooting by a gunman on a motorbike last week as an act of "terrorism". Mr Mbonimpa was a staunch critic of Mr Nkurunziza's bid to run for office again, and was said to be one of the few members of Burundi's civil society who had not fled the country. In April, he was held without charge for more than 24 hours by the intelligence services after he called for protests against the president's efforts to secure a third term.	Several people have been arrested in Burundi over the assassination of a powerful general, the prosecutor's office has said.
Peter Bunyan, 53, of Brooklands Road, Cosby, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Derby Crown Court. The court heard a witness saw him forcing entry into 84-year-old Brian Robson's house on 23 February. Police then found Mr Robson with fatal head injuries. Bunyan will be sentenced at a later date. Police told the court they arrived at the address to find Mr Robson in the hall and attempts to revive him failed. Bunyan had returned to his house next door and was arrested there. Det Insp Chris Barratt, from Leicestershire Police, said: "Bunyan's actions on that tragic day led to the death of a very much loved family man and devastated a family. "I would like to offer my condolences to the family and thank them for their co-operation and understanding throughout our investigation and subsequent court proceedings."	A Leicestershire man has admitted killing his neighbour after kicking down his front door.
In a statement in the official Granma newspaper, the government described the project as "a serious error". "The symbols of the Revolution are and will always be sacred," it read. The colognes - Ernesto and Hugo - were unveiled on Thursday by a state laboratory in the capital, Havana. Labiofam said Ernesto, the cologne named after the Argentine-born revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro take over in Cuba in 1959, would be a woodsy and refreshing citric scent with notes of talcum powder. Hugo, named after the late Venezuelan president, would offer a softer, fruitier fragrance with hints of mango and papaya. "They will be very attractive colognes, but the names also mean a lot to us," said Isabel Gonzalez, vice-president for research and development for Labiofam during the launch. But the project was mocked in the social networks and criticised by supporters of the Cuban Revolution, who considered it disrespectful. Labiofam had been in the process of developing stylised bottles and labels for the products before putting them on sale in Cuba and overseas. "We didn't want to create propaganda, but rather pay homage to them and help their names endure," said Cuban biochemist Mario Valdes, who led the scent design team, on Thursday. The company said it had obtained the agreement of the families of Che Guevara and Hugo Chavez to use their names in the colognes. But that has now been denied by the Cuban government. "The details of this irresponsible action were discussed in detail on Friday with the company's director and the employees who presented the products, which were still being developed," read the statement of the Executive Committee of the Ministers' Council, headed by Cuban President Raul Castro. "The appropriate measures will be taken to deal with this serious error. "Such initiatives will never be accepted either by our people or by the Revolutionary Government."	The Cuban government has said it will take disciplinary action against a state pharmaceutical company that created perfumes named Ernesto Che Guevara and Hugo Chavez.
All 57 seats were contested, of which the Tories took 43, compared to the 36 they won in 2013. Labour gained a councillor, taking their tally to 12, while the Liberal Democrats saw their number of seats fall from six to two. There will be no UKIP representatives on the council - all three of their seats were Tory gains. Turnout was up on 2013, at 33.7%. Heather Smith, Conservative leader on the council, said: "I'm very pleased. We've exceeded our number from four years ago and our target of 40 seats. "We expected turnout to be low because of the general election. "I can't foresee a bigger majority will make a difference [to how we govern]. We have to work within a certain budget." In Northamptonshire, the Conservative party gained 8,832 votes in the local election - 45.54% of the vote. It is higher than the national projected vote share for the Tories, which stands at 38%. The Liberal Democrats suffered a major blow when their local leader, Brendan Glynane, lost his Delapre and Rushmere seat to Labour. Asked about the increased Conservative majority, Mr Glynane said: "I think they will be emboldened by this. "The finances are not sorted, there is nothing left in the bank and I think you will see some severe cuts." As the declaration of results drew to a close, John McGhee announced he was to stand down as Labour group leader on the council. Mr McGhee won his Kingswood ward, but said: "It's been extremely difficult watching the destruction of public services in Northamptonshire. "I decided [to stand down] well before this election. I've been doing it so long. It has nothing to do with today's results."	The Conservatives have increased their control of Northamptonshire County Council.
Santa Cruz's WBA Super World featherweight title will be on the line at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn. Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights. The Belfast man has had to relinquish his IBF world super bantamweight belt ahead of his featherweight title bid. In February, Frampton beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout. It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held, but he has now vacated both crowns in order to challenge Santa Cruz in the higher weight division. He was stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux. On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez. Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests. "This is the fight I wanted - me and my team have been chasing it for a long, long time," said Frampton on his decision to move up a weight. "I'm 100% confident that the belt will be coming home to Belfast. It is the one my manager Barry McGuigan held 30 years ago. "Santa Cruz is a strong and aggressive undefeated champion but his style is made for me. "We know we have the tools to beat Leo. He throws a lot shots and is a proven operator. It is going to be a great fight. "I would like to say a huge thank you to the IBF for their professionalism during my time as their super bantamweight champion. "I have been a proud IBF World champion for nearly two years and I one day hope to once again become an IBF champion."	Carl Frampton's world featherweight title bout with defending champion Leo Santa Cruz will take place on 30 July in New York.
Real scored three goals in the first 16 minutes, with Karim Benzema heading the first from a James Rodriguez cross. Ronaldo then added a penalty before Rodriguez scored with a deflected shot. Ronaldo made it 4-0 by half-time with a fizzing effort before completing his hat-trick with a header, which was followed by a Oscar Duarte own goal. With Rodriguez filling in for the injured Gareth Bale in Real's front three, Espanyol were ripped apart. Ronaldo was the star as he moved level with Barcelona's Luis Suarez - on 19 goals - in the race to be La Liga's leading scorer. It was a testing debut for Espanyol's new goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis, signed on loan from Watford during the week. The Lithuania international faced England in a Euro 2016 qualifier in October, but his only previous start at club level this season was for the Hornets in a Capital One Cup defeat at Preston in August. Arlauskis saved well from Ronaldo's early free-kick and could not be blamed for Real's three quick goals. He also got a hand to Ronaldo's shot for his second goal, but the Portugal international's dazzling footwork deserved reward as he bamboozled the visiting defence to create space to score. The goal rout ended when Costa Rica international Duarte turned Jese's low cross into his own net. Both teams are in La Liga action next Sunday, with Real Madrid visiting relegation-threatened Granada, while Espanyol host Real Sociedad.	Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as Real Madrid thrashed Espanyol to cut the gap between themselves and La Liga leaders Barcelona to four points.
Dockery, who plays Lady Mary in ITV's hit period drama, will play Madame de Tourvel in the production, heading up the London theatre's autumn season. Janet McTeer and West co-star as ruthless former lovers Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont. Artistic director Josie Rourke will helm Christopher Hampton's play. Les Liaisons Dangereuses is based on the scandalous 1782 novel by Choderlos de Laclos, which told of sex, intrigue and betrayal amongst aristocrats in pre-revolutionary France. Its first theatre production 30 years ago starred Alan Rickman, Juliet Stevenson and Lesley Manville and won both the Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for best play. Hampton went on to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for the 1988 film version starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. "I have long wanted to direct Christopher Hampton's superb Les Liaisons Dangereuses," said Rourke, "and the cast we have drawn together is a testament to the brilliance of his play." Along with his stage work, West has appeared in TV dramas The Wire, The Hour and The Affair, while McTeer was recently seen in acclaimed drama The Honourable Woman and The White Queen. Other highlights at the 250-seat theatre this autumn include the first major London run of Abi Morgan's early play Splendour, which will star Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Fairley and Genevieve O'Reilly. Morgan has since gone on to write films such as The Iron Lady, Shame and the forthcoming Suffragette. Splendour tells the story of a photojournalist at the heart of a coup in an eastern European state and will be directed by associate director Robert Hastie. "One of the things that most excites me about this season is the strong leading roles for women," said Rourke. "It is a thrill to announce a season of work that features, in plays by living writers, women of the calibre and power of Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Dockery, Michelle Fairley, Genevieve O'Reilly and Janet McTeer, who returns to the Donmar and the London stage." The Royal Court's former artistic director Dominic Cooke will direct the UK Premiere of Teddy Ferrara, Christopher Shinn's play about a student tragedy which sends a campus into turmoil. This autumn will also see the transfer of Phyllida Lloyd's all-female Henry IV to St Ann's Warehouse in New York. Lloyd has just been announced as the theatre's new associate director. Theatre fans who missed out on Rourke's award-winning production of Coriolanus, starring Tom Hiddleston, will have the chance to catch it on screen in UK cinemas as part of the National Theatre Live Encore screenings.	Downton Abbey star Michelle Dockery and actor Dominic West will star in a 30th anniversary revival of Les Liaisons Dangereuses at the Donmar Warehouse.
Traffic and pedestrians have been banned from Deerness Bridge, between Ushaw Moor and New Brancepeth. Durham County Council said the closure would last at least a month and signed diversions were in place. Alternative arrangements were being made for buses, including services to Durham Community Business College and St Leonard's School. John Reed, the council's head of technical services, said: "We are now assessing whether we can undertake any temporary measures to address these issues and enable the road to reopen. "At this stage we anticipate that the bridge will be closed for at least a month but we will have a better indication of timescales once this assessment has been completed."	A bridge in County Durham has closed after inspectors identified "issues with its structural integrity".
Media playback is not supported on this device Platini wants to restore the image of world football's governing body in the wake of serious corruption allegations. "We want a reform candidate," said FA chairman Greg Dyke. "We believe he will reform Fifa in the way that reform is needed." Sepp Blatter has already announced he will quit as Fifa president, with an election set for 26 February. Frenchman Platini, president of European football governing body Uefa, is likely to face a number of challengers, among them Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan and Liberian FA president Musa Bility. Dyke added: "We understand there will be a number of candidates, which should result in a strong and healthy debate. "However, we should not underestimate how challenging it will be for anyone to lead an organisation that has been so tainted. The whole structure of Fifa must be reviewed and fundamentally changed." Platini has found himself at odds with the FA over Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. The 60-year-old championed the Gulf nation despite concerns over its human rights record and severe summer temperatures. But Dyke attempted to play down any differences for the time being, saying: "Mr Platini has always made it very clear that he voted for Qatar. "If all the other people who voted for Qatar had been quite as transparent it would have been more helpful." Not everyone shares the FA's confidence in Platini, a former France international who won the coveted Ballon d'Or three times. Just hours after confirming his candidacy on Wednesday, he was criticised by two potential presidential rivals. Prince Ali and Bility both claim Platini would be a bad choice as a successor. Prince Ali, who stood against Blatter in the last presidential election, said that "football's fans and players deserve better". A member of the Jordanian royal family, he added that Fifa needed a "new, independent leadership, untainted by the practices of the past". Bility agreed, telling the BBC's World Football programme that Platini would bring "chaos", "more division" and "more problems".	The English Football Association has given its backing to Michel Platini's bid to become the next boss of Fifa.
Heinrich Boere, who is in a wheelchair, was taken by ambulance from his nursing home in Germany to a prison hospital. He was sentenced in March 2010 after confessing to the killings. A German court rejected an appeal against his jail term and a medical expert said he was fit to serve his sentence at a "suitable" facility. During his trial, Boere had admitted to the killings in 1944, but said he had been acting on orders from his superiors. He shot dead Fritz Bicknese, a chemist and father of 12; Frans Kusters, a Dutch resistance member who owned a bicycle shop; and Teun de Groot, who helped Jews go into hiding. Boere argued that he risked being sent to a concentration camp if he refused to carry out the shootings. "At no time in 1944 did I act with the feeling that I was committing a crime," he told the court during his trial, but added that 65 years later he saw things from a different perspective. The presiding judge, Gerd Nohl, said all three killings had been carried out "on a totally random basis" and constituted murder. Boere was born in Germany to a Dutch father and a German mother but grew up in the Dutch town of Maastricht. He joined the Waffen SS when the Nazis overran his hometown in 1940. In 1947 he escaped from a prisoner of war camp in the Netherlands and returned to Germany. A tribunal in Amsterdam sentenced him to death for the killings in his absence in 1949, but this was later commuted to life in prison. He was never extradited and a German court ruled in the 1980s that the Dutch trial had been unfair because Boere had not been present. In April 2008, more than 60 years after the killings, he was indicted in Germany. After legal arguments about whether he was well enough to stand trial he was eventually convicted last year.	A 90-year-old man has begun a life sentence for shooting dead three Dutch civilians when he was a member of a Nazi SS hit squad during World War II.
Blackwell, 25, suffered a bleed on the brain in a loss to Eubank in March and was put in an induced coma. The offer comes despite Blackwell saying Eubank and his father were "inhuman" in how they reacted to his life-threatening injuries post-fight. "I ended the guy's career," Eubank Jr told ITV's Good Morning Britain. "He said everything was OK and that there were no hard feelings, but I've stopped him being able to make a living. "I wanted to come and see him because I had something for him, and that something is my British title belt." READ MORE: 'I could see no light at the end of the tunnel' - Blackwell's trainer Blackwell woke from his coma a week after the fight, which was stopped in the 10th round, without requiring an operation. Speaking to the Sun on Monday, Blackwell was critical of the Eubanks' decision to hold a news conference while he was still in hospital. "I was shocked when I first heard the things he had been saying because we had a little talk on social media," added Eubank Jr. "I believe that the belt is a goodwill gesture - I'm still ready to come and give it to him. "The guy's a true warrior, regardless of what's been said, the only thing that's important is that he is now OK, he's with his family and he can live a normal life with no restrictions."	British middleweight champion Chris Eubank Jr has offered to give his title belt to retired opponent Nick Blackwell as a "goodwill gesture".

Earlier this month Nick Gargan, 48, was found guilty of eight charges of misconduct but cleared of gross misconduct by an independent panel. Details can not yet be made public about what the panel ruled Mr Gargan had done, according to the police and crime commissioner's (PCC) office. He is returning to work but not yet in Avon and Somerset, the PCC said. Sue Mounstevens added he would be "carrying out some work with the National Police Chief's Council [NPCC]", although no further details were given. Mr Gargan, who joined the force in March 2013 will, officially remain employed as chief constable. According to its website, the NPCC develops best practice for different areas of police work in areas such as criminal justice, cyber-crime and drugs. Mr Gargan was initially investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission which found there was no case to answer for any criminal charges being brought against him. The commission then recommended his case be referred to an independent misconduct proceedings panel. Dorian Lovell-Pank QC chaired the panel, which included Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary, Wendy Williams, and independent member John Rickard. A private hearing, separate from Avon and Somerset Police, was held to discuss the matter and the findings of the panel are yet to be published. In the meantime, Mr Gargan and Avon and Somerset PCC Sue Mountstevens said they were not allowed to speak publicly about the case. Mr Gargan has told the BBC he wanted the details of his offences made public immediately, and could not see any reason why they should not be. However Ms Mountstevens said: "The misconduct process is not yet complete. I'm waiting for the misconduct panel's report. When I receive that I will hold a further hearing with the chief constable to determine his sanction."	Avon and Somerset's police chief has been temporarily moved away from his job following a misconduct hearing.
Hamilton is 33 points behind the German with 100 available in the last four races, the first of which is the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas on Sunday. The Briton said: "You can't win them all. Look at the great champions who lost titles. It's part of the game. "I'm going to give it everything I've got and everything is possible." Should he lose, Hamilton said "life would move on" and he would hopefully "come back stronger". The 31-year-old has won three of the four US Grands Prix held at the Circuit of the Americas since the event made its debut in 2012, and said he was "excited" about the weekend. Hamilton pointed out he has the worst of the reliability issues at Mercedes this year, with engine problems affecting his results at four separate races, including a failure while leading in Malaysia earlier this month. Without these problems, Hamilton would be leading the championship rather than trailing Rosberg, who has so far had only one reliability issue affect his points total, costing him three points at the British Grand Prix. Hamilton said: "We have always had close battles. If all things were equal, there would be a certain result. "This year has been a little different in terms of how our performances have been mechanically and there is nothing I can do about that. "When the car has been good, I have often done the job with it and there has been a few, especially in the first few seconds of the race, when I have not done that well. But that's motor racing." Hamilton has had five bad starts this year that have cost him positions, compared to three for Rosberg. He said he had been working on the problem again with Mercedes before coming to Austin. "It has been an ongoing thing all year long - perhaps more work than in other areas," he said. "I was working on it at the factory last week and we hope we have a better formula this weekend." Hamilton's behaviour in the pre-race news conference on Thursday was very different from his controversial performance in the same event in Japan two weeks ago. In Suzuka, he was relatively disengaged from the process, referring journalists to his social media outlets for answers to questions, and spent time posting pictures on Snapchat of himself and fellow driver Carlos Sainz with cartoon animal features. In Austin, he was polite and concentrated and gave long, considered, thoughtful answers - much more his normal self. He also explained why some journalists had been blocked from following him on Twitter, saying he had only recently found out about it. "I don't manage every single part of my social media," Hamilton said. "I have a couple of people doing it for me. It was a blocking spree. I don't even have the app on my phone." He said the general approach was for people to be blocked if they said something negative - and those affected had not just been journalists. Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel said Hamilton had every chance of ending the year with a fourth title. Asked if it was realistic for Hamilton to catch Rosberg, the four-time champion said: "Of course. He is quick enough and there are enough races. "I am sure he will go for it. Four races is a lot of laps to do, a lot of things that can happen. It is only over when it's over."

Lewis Hamilton says he will "take it like a man" if he loses this year's Formula 1 title to Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.
The prime minister said Labour had a "brass neck" to claim they were on the side of ordinary working families. Under the Â£350m Conservative plans, the amount of state-subsidised childcare for three and four year-olds would be doubled to 30 hours a week. Labour said it was "another unfunded announcement", accusing the Conservatives of "desperation". The Liberal Democrats said the plans "ignore working families with the youngest children". BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Cameron was attempting to switch the focus of the campaign to one of his party's key announcement after several days dominated by warnings about the SNP and a future Labour government. The party is likely to face questions about how it would ensure sufficient childcare places are available, she added. Currently, all three and four-year olds in England are entitled to 570 hours of free early education or childcare a year, which works out as 15 hours each week for 38 weeks of the year. The Conservatives said the 30-hour offer from 2017, announced a week ago, would result in more than 600,000 extra 15-hour free childcare places every year. They said the proposal would be funded by reducing tax relief on pension contributions. Labour has pledged 25 hours of free childcare a week and the Liberal Democrats 20 hours, although both parties also plan to extend the offer to younger children. Mr Cameron said his government inherited a "shocking" situation, "where couples were spending as much on childcare as one of them took home in earnings". He added that "for many second earners, work didn't pay because the cost of childcare was so high". A Conservative government would expand on the changes made in the last Parliament, Mr Cameron said. "If you're a working parent with one child you can rest assured that by the time they're three they'll be able to go to nursery for 30 hours a week completely free," Mr Cameron said. "And we have legislated also for tax free childcare for anything outside that - so if you spend ten thousand pounds on childcare you'll get two thousand pounds back for each child." But Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Hard-working families will not be fooled by the Â£600m gap in funding for this policy, as announced last week." He said Labour had a "better plan" including a "guarantee of access" to childcare between 08:00 and 18:00 for primary age children. And Liberal Democrat equalities minister Jo Swinson said: "Tory plans for childcare ignore working families with the youngest children, which could leave some parents locked out of the labour market for years on end." She said her party would extend early-years education to all two-year-olds and ensure free childcare support kicked in as soon as paid parental leave ended for working mums and dads. "This will help with the cost of childcare and ensure working parents have a genuine choice about when to return to work," she added. The UK Independence Party says it will continue to fund the current free 15-hour a week childcare scheme and in-coming tax-free childcare scheme - although they would de-regulate childcare provision "to address the shortage places and cut the cost to both parents and the state". * Subscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday afternoon.	David Cameron says he will create 600,000 extra free childcare places if he is returned to power next month.

Three people arrested after a man was found unconscious following a suspected assault in Brighton have been released without charge.
But the BBC drama - which celebrated its 30th anniversary last month - was beaten to the TV soap of the year award by its ITV rival Coronation Street. Ant and Dec were named TV personalities of the year for the third year running at the industry bash in central London. Susanna Reid, meanwhile, won best news presenter/reporter for the second year in succession. The event saw a number of last year's award recipients recognised again, among them Strictly Come Dancing (best reality programme), Channel 4's Gogglebox (best entertainment programme) and BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood (best weather presenter). Other winners included BBC One's popular teatime quiz Pointless (best daytime programme), Silent Witness (best crime programme) and Downton Abbey, which was named best drama over its ITV stablemates Cilla and Doc Martin. Capital Radio's breakfast show was named best digital radio programme, while Radio 2's Chris Evans won the digital radio personality prize. The event also saw the BBC's football highlights show Match of the Day honoured with a special Tric award. Dyer's EastEnders character, Mick Carter, made his first appearance on Albert Square on 25 December 2013. Speaking to chat show host Graham Norton last month, the 37-year-old Human Traffic star said he was "happy to sit back and be part of" a show he likened to "a retirement home". First presented in 1989, the Tric Awards are voted for by members of the TV and radio industries.	EastEnders' Danny Dyer has been named soap personality of 2015 at the TV and Radio Industries Club (Tric) awards.

President Barack Obama said it was a "step towards a more normal and productive relationship". But he may face a battle in Congress where some Republicans are opposed to his dealings with the communist island. The new ambassador, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, had been working at the new US embassy in Havana, which opened in July last year. President Obama said there was "no better-qualified public servant". President Obama and Cuba's President Raul Castro have begun to reignite the diplomatic relations that were broken off in 1961 after the Caribbean island's communist revolution. What next for Washington and Havana? What is behind the US-Cuba thaw? In pictures: US-Cuban relations Restrictions on flights have been lifted but the US embargo on Cuba remains in place. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who is Cuban-American, has previously said the improved relations will go "a long way in providing the economic lift that the Castro regime needs to become permanent fixtures in Cuba for generations to come''.	The US has appointed its first ambassador to Cuba in 55 years as relations between the countries thaw.
The vital vote focused on the proposed £140m plan - backed by £50m from businessman Sir Ian Wood - to transform the historic Union Terrace Gardens. In a referendum earlier this year, there were 45,301 votes in favour with 41,175 votes against. New proposals from the Independent Alliance Group were backed by 22, with 20 against and one abstention. Improvements to Union Terrace Gardens, and landmark buildings, are instead proposed. There were heated exchanged afterwards between some business leaders who supported the City Garden Project and councillors who voted against it. Sir Ian's £50m offer has now been withdrawn. He said he was dismayed. Callum McCaig, leader of SNP group, had called for the City Garden Project to be backed. He said he was "bitterly disappointed" at the decision. Conservative Alan Donnelly said the amendment was an "almighty fudge". However, Mike Shepherd, chairman of Friends of Union Terrace Gardens, said: "There is no doubt that our councillors made the correct decision. "This is the end of the City Garden Project debacle. "Union Terrace Gardens is at the heart of our city. Let's nurture them with the care and attention they deserve. We can restore them to a place of pride and glory. Let's go ahead and do it." The abstention was from Liberal Democrat Ian Yuill. Various delegations had addressed the full meeting of Aberdeen City Council during the day. One of the first to speak among earlier delegations was Leo Koot, managing director of oil firm TAQA Bratani, who said Union Terrace Gardens was a "dark hole". However, that claim was contested by Iain Richardson, from Common Good Aberdeen. Prominent Aberdeen hotelier Stewart Spence said the city needed to attract tourists, and required more than a spruce up. Dan McCroskrie, speaking on behalf of the young people who support the scheme, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity which would help attract more young people into the city. The cost of the winning Granite Web design was £140m. The council administration's senior coalition partner, Labour, had vowed to scrap the scheme.	Aberdeen's controversial City Garden Project has been narrowly rejected after a council debate.
Defence minister Mark Lancaster said 12,565 of the homes were "expected to materialise in this Parliament". He acknowledged this would impact on civilian and military staff but provisions were being made, he said. The sites include an RAF base, barracks, ex-World War Two airfields and a chaplaincy centre. They also include two golf courses at RAF Henlow and Southwick Park in Hampshire. Meanwhile, Network Rail has announced it will release land at almost 200 sites for 12,000 new homes by 2020. This includes 5,000 homes in London, 3,600 homes in Manchester and the north, 1,700 homes in the Midlands and the east of England and 1,400 homes in the south of England. The 13 military sites that will be sold by the MoD are: The MoD said the land at Venning and Parsons Barracks are the only sites that will not have housing built on them, as they will be used for commercial development at the request of Telford and Wrekin Council. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: "We are getting rid of land that we don't need to build homes that we do, generating hundreds of millions of pounds in the process. "Our commitment to protect and increase the budget for our armed forces means that every penny of that will be reinvested into defence, helping to keep Britain safe." But shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis said: "Affordable housing is desperately needed across the UK, particularly by service families, who have seen the cost of their housing go up as conditions get worse. "So it's disappointing that the MoD has failed to say how many of these potential new homes will be affordable, or how many could be set aside for service personnel. "In fact, they cannot even reassure us that these sites will be used to build new homes at all," he said. "What we're looking at is the double impact of 18,000 MoD staff losing their jobs and public land potentially being sold on the cheap for developers to profit from," a Public and Commercial Services union spokesman said. "The government must learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure any land sold not only realises its full value, but that house-builders are forced to ensure enough affordable homes are provided." In a written statement, Mr Lancaster said consultations will take place over the coming weeks with "stakeholders" including trade unions, to determine the future of each site and their occupants. "The release of land by the MoD has the potential to provide land for new homes and we will continue to engage with impacted local authorities to determine how the department's assessment of housing unit allocation against each site may be considered as part of the authority's Local Plan," he said. "I acknowledge that these moves will have an impact upon civilian and military staff; the department is making arrangements to provide for units and functions based at sites which will not have a future defence requirement." An MoD spokeswoman said it was too early to confirm how exactly it would affect staff at the sites, but she said "the majority" will be provided for and moved to accommodation elsewhere, for example. Mr Lancaster said the sales would contribute £225m towards the MoD's £1bn target for land release sales, as set out in its spending review last year. The release of the sites contributes to the government commitment to provide land for 160,000 homes by 2020, he said. The 2015 Conservative manifesto pledged that 200,000 quality Starter Homes would be built over the course of the Parliament, reserved for first-time buyers under 40 and sold at 20 % below the market price.	A total of 13 Ministry of Defence sites will be sold to provide land for up to 17,017 homes and will raise £225m, the government has said.
It has been a great experience for me to be involved with Melbourne and winning the Australian Women's Grand Final against Perth Glory is another career highlight. We made history by being the first team to retain their title and that is phenomenal. To fly away from home and win it 2-0 truly was one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. The big difference for me this year is being involved as a player-manager, rather than just a midfielder. Is it a hard adjustment to make? Absolutely. It's very hard to deal with. It's very mentally and physically draining, but it's equally very rewarding in different ways. When the final whistle went at the weekend it made every second of the season worthwhile. The juice was definitely worth the squeeze. Being a manager is a very difficult thing to do and you have to have a very good group of players and coaches for it to work. Thankfully and luckily we did have that. I have thought about getting into coaching, but the way this came about was more to do with circumstances than anything else. Our head coach (Jo Montemurro) went into our men's side as an assistant and I stepped up. It was a natural thing, really. We were so far into the season that it was probably going to be the least disruptive for everyone involved. I didn't think twice about it when the (Melbourne) City group asked me to do the job. Equally I knew that it would be OK with the group that we had, because we have a very, very good group of girls. For me, at the stage of my career, this is the best of both worlds. I want to learn how to coach and how to develop as a coach and I believe I'm in the best place for that. But I'm not anywhere near retiring right now so I'm still playing and loving my football. I believe coaching educates me as a player as much as me learning as a coach pushes me out of my comfort zone. After an absolutely amazing experience in Melbourne, I head home soon to meet up with Wales ahead of the Cyprus Cup. I'm going to stay with Wales for another campaign after briefly considering international retirement and am really excited to get back to prepare for our World Cup campaign that will start later this year. My experiences with Melbourne can stand me in really good stead for Wales and my American club side Seattle Reign. I just go as a player to those camps, but I do have experience in leading groups and being a good person who helps when they're in a bit of trouble or being successful. The experience of this whole campaign I've just had with City is probably one of a kind. I certainly want to continue in football beyond playing, but who knows if the opportunity will ever be there to coach in the men's game. I think it'll be a lot easier for women to go into the male game in the future, in the right environment, as I had in Melbourne. At Melbourne, everyone believes in and supports each other and the crossover between male and female is very similar and even. In that environment I can't see it being a problem. But that environment is not replicated all over the world. Some clubs would be very receptive to a female coach, other clubs less so. But luckily, that is not something I have to worry about for a good few years yet!	I have certainly had worse 24 hours in my life than winning the Grand Final with Melbourne City and then being named in the Wales squad for the Cyprus Cup.

Dozens of others remain in critical condition after the fire, apparently caused by fireworks set off by a heavy metal band. Officials say it is possible the number of fatalities could double. The news came as thousands marched silently through the Romanian capital in memory of the victims. People carried flowers and lit candles at a memorial outside the nightclub. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis has said safety regulations seem to have been ignored at the club. The fire broke out at about 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Friday at the Colectiv club, which was hosting a free rock concert by the band Goodbye to Gravity. Up to 400 people are thought to have been inside. Survivors say the fireworks caused the ceiling and a pillar to catch fire and produce heavy smoke. A stampede for the exit followed. More than 140 people are being treated in hospital, some with severe burns. On Sunday officials said all of the dead had been identified. Romania has declared three days of national mourning.	Two more people have died of injuries sustained in Friday's Bucharest nightclub fire, doctors say, raising the death toll in the disaster to 29.
Nintendo said such pixels were "normal and should not be considered a defect". But one analyst said if the issues were as bad as online photos suggested, it was "unbelievable" Nintendo had let them leave the factory. The Â£280 handheld console went on sale on Friday. Sales figures suggest it has become the fastest-selling games console in the Japanese company's history, with reports some shops have already sold out. In the UK, it has sold an estimated 80,000 units. The Switch can be played both on televisions and as a standalone device. It launched with a handful of games, with some critics saying there were too few. And now, thousands of customers have reported their new devices came with a screen problem. On a Reddit discussion thread, one user said: "I understand they're apparently common in devices, but in a handheld system it's a big enough annoyance for me I would not purchase a device with one." He said he had a similar problem with his Sony Playstation Portable. "My first one had dead pixels in the middle of the screen, and I brought it back to the store I purchased it in," he said. "Luckily, it was a big news story so they were allowing you to open up new boxes in the stores and turn on the device. "I went through three and on the fourth got one without any visible dead pixels." Nintendo responded on its support page, saying: "Small numbers of stuck or dead pixels are a characteristic of LCD screens." A similar pixel issue also affected Nintendo's DS, and the Japanese gaming company eventually allowed buyers to replace devices. Paul Gray, an analyst at research company IHS, said such issues should no longer be common. "In the early days of LCD screens there were lots of defects, but these days you see fewer and fewer of them," he said. "Some of the photos I've seen posted online, I cannot believe that Nintendo would have knowingly let them leave the factory like that. "Something doesn't ring quite true," he said, suggesting that some of the photos may have been doctored. Mr Gray advised anyone with a defective device to return it to the shop they bought it from. "If you are a consumer and you find it irritating, you should go back to the retailer and say that you are not happy," he said.	Thousands of owners of Nintendo's new console, Switch, have complained about dead or stuck pixels creating distracting and annoying dark squares on their screens.
It is the second successive time the area has been at the bottom of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), which is published every four years. Statisticians rate almost 7,000 areas in Scotland by standards including income, employability and health. Lower Whitecraigs in East Renfrewshire is classed as the least deprived. Glasgow has 56 of the 100 most deprived areas, down five on 2012. Edinburgh has six, up two on four years ago. The 10 most deprived areas in Scotland: The 10 least deprived areas in Scotland: Renfrewshire Council, which covers the area including Ferguslie Park, said a long-term plan to change the area's fortunes was already under way. Council leader Mark Macmillan said: "The council has adopted an innovative approach to tackling poverty, recognised as leading the way in Scotland - and the SIMD stats are based on data from last year which does not fully capture the impact of that. "The figures show the overall picture for Renfrewshire has improved and we believe we are making a difference on the ground. "In the four years since the last SIMD figures were released, Renfrewshire has seen a 10% real-terms drop in the cash coming our way from Holyrood. "The deprivation issues affecting Ferguslie and similar areas are long-term and deep-rooted - there are no easy solutions but through our unique approach, we believe we are on the right track." The Scottish government said the figures showed "why Scotland needs a government committed to tackling deep-seated deprivation, poverty and inequalities". Communities Secretary Angela Constance said: "This will not be an easy job while we do not have the full levers of power, but I am determined we take on the challenge of making a generational change for those areas that have been in poverty for too long. "In the face of continuing UK government welfare cuts, an austerity agenda and attempts to take Scotland out of Europe, this will continue to be a long-term challenge." She added: "We are spending Â£100m protecting people against the worst effects of welfare reform and every pound spent on mitigation measures is a pound less that can be spent on lifting people out of poverty." The Scottish Conservatives said the figures should be a "wake-up call" to the SNP government. Equalities spokeswoman Annie Wells said: "There are many causes of deprivation - poverty, family breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, low educational standards and poor health and we now need a new approach. "Powers need to be devolved from the Scottish government to enable cities and city-regions to work more closely together to regenerate and redevelop their local economies." Scottish Labour's deputy leader Alex Rowley said: "If we are serious about cutting the gap between the richest and the rest we need to fully understand the picture of poverty in Scotland. "These numbers are an important start - and they show a Scotland which remains too unequal, and further SNP cuts will only make it worse. "The most deprived communities in Scotland will suffer more because of hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and local services, whilst our health boards are faced with millions of pounds of cuts because the SNP aren't giving our NHS the resources it needs." Scottish Greens spokeswoman Alison Johnstone MSP said: "If we're to boost incomes, employment chances and health, we need to see greater ambition from Scottish ministers and local authorities. Yes, the Westminster government's continuing agenda of cuts plays a part, but we cannot let that stop us. "We can push further on a real Living Wage across our economy, and we can boost people's health by committing to a major programme of housebuilding and energy efficiency measures, along with better public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure." Analysis by Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland Home affairs correspondent The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is published every four years. It provides the government and local authorities with a considerable amount of information aimed at helping them tackle the problem. The index breaks Scotland down into 6,976 "datazones", effectively small postcode areas, and ranks levels of deprivation there on seven criteria. These are: income, employment, health, education, housing, access to services and crime. Overall scores are then provided for each datazone. But that is not the full picture. The statisticians say "deprived" does not just mean "poor" or "low income". It can also mean people have fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education. One area may score well on educational outcomes for example, but have poor health and access to services. The Scottish government says this "allows effective analysis for targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation."	Ferguslie Park in Paisley has been identified as the area of Scotland with the greatest level of deprivation.
The incident happened in December when the 18-year-old man suffered what was described at the time as a broken jaw. Police want to trace a woman and a man. The woman is described as being in her late teens to early 20s, with long brown hair. The man is thought to be in his early 20s. The woman was wearing a beige-coloured jacket and beige knee-high boots. The man was wearing a dark blue puffy jacket, blue jeans and grey and black trainers. PC Graham Crawford said: "This is a serious incident resulting in a male sustaining a severe facial injury. "Violent behaviour will not be tolerated and I would urge anyone who recognises the male and female pictured, or has any knowledge of this incident to come forward and contact the police."	Police investigating an "unprovoked serious assault" on a teenager outside Stonehaven railway station have released CCTV images of a woman and man they want to trace.
Dai Young, boss of Premiership leaders Wasps, expects a number of his in-form players to make the cut. "I'd like to think, the way we've played, we'll have a few in there," Young told BBC Sport. "I know [Jones has] had contact with some of the players on a regular basis - we have got a number in the mix." Jones will also name a trimmed down party of approximately 35 for a training camp in Brighton next week. The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker. Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad. But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign. "There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season," added Young. "And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal." Hooker Tommy Taylor has been "excellent" according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer. Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani. Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum. Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August. It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena. "Will is not ready to play international rugby," Cockerill told BBC Sport. "The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One. "Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge. "He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet [for Test rugby]." However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November. "Mike Williams has a little bit more experience," Cockerill said of the 24-year-old. "Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today."	England coach Eddie Jones will name his 45-man Elite Player Squad squad ahead of the autumn Tests at 10:00 BST on Friday.
Warren, 79, who started the Granada Television show when he was 24, died on 1 March after a short illness. His coffin was carried into the cathedral by members of the cast, watched by the crowds outside. Among those who attended the service were Julie Goodyear and William Roache, who has played Ken Barlow since the first episode in 1960. Goodyear, famous for playing barmaid Bet Lynch, paid a heartfelt tribute to Warren, a friend of 50 years. "We cried together and we laughed together," she said. Canon Philip Barratt said all the hymns and readings at the funeral, which was also open to members of the public, were chosen by Warren. "It's a big service for a very big character and a lovely part of the history of Manchester," he said. Former stars in the congregation included Ken Morley, who played Reg Holdsworth, and Christopher Quinten, best known for his role as mechanic Brian Tilsley. Warren was born Anthony McVay Simpson in Eccles, Salford, in 1937, and took the stage name of Warren during his career as a child star. He trained at Liverpool's Elliott Clarke Theatre School and was a regular on the BBC radio show Children's Hour, before acting in radio plays alongside some of the actors who would became household names because of Coronation Street, including Violet Carson and Doris Speed. His idea for the soap opera was commissioned for 13 episodes by Granada in 1960 and the show has gone on to be one of the UK's most successful ever, reaching viewing figures of 26.6 million for the departure of the much-loved character Hilda Ogden in 1987. He wrote episodes for the ITV soap until the late 1970s and was made an MBE in 1994 for his services to television drama. The writer remained a consultant on the soap until his death, with his creator credit appearing at the start of the closing credits of every episode.	The funeral of Coronation Street creator and writer Tony Warren has taken place at Manchester Cathedral.
Buttler reached three figures in 46 balls, beating the 61-ball hundred he made against Sri Lanka in May 2014. The wicketkeeper hit 10 fours and eight sixes in his 116 not out from 52 balls as England posted 355-5. Pakistan briefly threatened a thrilling chase, but were bowled out for 271, with Moeen Ali taking 3-53. Buttler's effort was the joint-seventh fastest in the history of ODI cricket and the quickest against Pakistan. He has now scored the three fastest England centuries in the 50-over game, along with a 66-ball hundred against New Zealand in June. That was Buttler's last score of 50 or more in all international cricket, a run of poor form that saw him dropped from the Test side for the third match against Pakistan this month. The record for the fastest hundred in ODIs is the 31-ball effort of South Africa's AB de Villiers made against West Indies in Johannesburg in January this year. Buttler's display of devastating hitting was all the more remarkable considering he did not arrive at the crease until the 36th over. Promoted to number four after England were given a solid start by Jason Roy's maiden international century (102) and Joe Root's 71, the right-hander wasted little time in signalling his intentions, slog-sweeping Shoaib Malik for six from only the 10th ball he faced. Brute force over the leg side was a feature of the 25-year-old's innings, with six of his eight sixes clearing the ropes in the direction of deep mid-wicket. He also showed flashes of ingenuity, playing scoop and ramp shots, as well as one incredible reverse-sweep for four off the pace of Anwar Ali without needing to move his feet. Anwar was again the bowler when Buttler moved to a century with his third six in four deliveries. In all, he hit 17 of the last 34 balls he faced to the boundary and went from 50 to 100 in only 16 deliveries as England added 129 runs in the last 10 overs. Buttler stole the show, but his star turn was crammed into a 15-over period of an entertaining series finale. Right-hander Roy overcame some early frailty outside off stump to reach his first ODI hundred in his 15th match, an innings that accelerated with straight and on-drives. Support came from Root, who was at his free-scoring best until he fell seven runs after Roy was caught at long-off. That was part of a brief Pakistan period of pressure, one which halted by Buttler's brilliance. Still, on a pitch perfect for batting, the hosts showed the will to chase their huge target, with captain Azhar Ali making 44 from 32 balls, Babar Azam a run-a-ball 51 and Malik most impressive for a 34-ball 52. However, wickets fell too regularly for the hosts to ever be truly in contention. Mohammad Hafeez was run out in calamitous circumstances and almost all of the rest holed out. In the end, what is only England's third ODI series win since February 2013 was sealed in comfort. Former England off-spinner Vic Marks: "Even the top players on that England balcony will be thinking 'I don't know how he does that'. You can understand why England, even when Buttler's going through a sticky patch in white-ball cricket, keep him in the side as when he clicks he's astonishing. The magic has returned. "We shouldn't forget Jason Roy's hundred - the top three put England in a position where they could send Buttler out like that." England batsman Jason Roy: "I don't really know what we've just witnessed. It was incredible."	Jos Buttler hit England's fastest one-day international century to lead them to an 84-run win over Pakistan in Sharjah and a 3-1 series victory.
It was introduced for the final race of 2014 to keep the championship alive for as long as possible but was criticised by drivers, teams and fans. The agreement needs ratifying at a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council, but F1's legislative body is expected to rubber stamp it. The idea of F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, the double points rule was criticised for being unfair and artificial. As it turned out, the outcome of the 2014 championship would have rested on the final race even if double points had not been in force. Lewis Hamilton was 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg going into the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix but made sure of the title by winning at Yas Marina. That gave the Briton a further 50 points, leaving him 67 in front of Rosberg, who came home 14th after suffering car trouble. Ecclestone and FIA president Jean Todt met with representatives of the teams, circuits and sponsors to discuss a number of proposals at this week's meeting, not just the double points rule. The BBC has learned that they abandoned plans to introduce standing re-starts following the deployment of the safety car but failed to come up with any formal proposals aimed at keeping costs under control. The issue of costs remains a hot topic following the financial collapse of the Marussia and Caterham teams. Force India, Lotus and Sauber have also complained that they are struggling financially because the split of prize money is not equitable. There was also no agreement on allowing limited in-season engine development. Currently, the rules allow a specified amount of development between seasons but none during the championship. Red Bull and Ferrari have been pushing to allow an extra stage of development in the summer. Mercedes are against the idea but have offered to accept a limited amount of development. However, their compromise proposal has been rejected by their rivals on the basis that it does not go far enough. Unanimous agreement is required to change the rules for next season. The World Motor Sport Council, which meets in Qatar on 3 December, will also hear from the investigation into the accident at the Japanese Grand Prix that left Marussia driver Jules Bianchi with severe head injuries. The investigation was charged with establishing what happened and coming up with new measures to reinforce safety at circuits.	Formula 1 bosses have agreed to ditch the controversial double points rule.
Organisers said hundreds of revellers took part in the celebration of the coming of summer. Event co-ordinator Sara Thomas said Beltane was an ancient tradition with a modern twist. The modern Beltane Fire Festival has run since 1988. This year's celebration included drummers, fire dancers, physical theatre, and a bonfire.	Thousands of people gathered on Calton Hill in Edinburgh on Thursday night for the Beltane Fire Festival.
The bung was left in place after the procedure at Northampton General Hospital. A report which went before the hospital's public trust board said the patient was discharged home and the bung fell out four days later. The hospital has apologised for the incident and said it had learned from the error. It was one of two "never events" to happen at the hospital in Cliftonville in 2016. A hospital spokesman said details could not be given of the second incident - that happened in January - due to confidentiality reasons but it was described as "wrong site surgery" in July's report. The spokesman said: "Almost 80,000 procedures are performed annually by our medical and nursing staff. "We are committed to providing each and every one of our patients with a high level of safe care and are deeply sorry that, in these two cases, a vital aspect of the care provided fell short of the standard we would expect. "We don't underestimate the effect of a never event on our patients and our staff.  That is why we believe we need to openly tackle these issues on the rare occasions they occur. "We have undertaken thorough investigations into the circumstances surrounding each of these never events and reported them to the Care Quality Commission, NHS England and our commissioners. "As a result of our investigations we have improved our theatre reporting and recording systems."	Surgical staff left medical equipment in a patient undergoing a hysterectomy at a hospital in Northamptonshire.
The much-anticipated film sparked controversy last week after it emerged it would feature a "gay moment". It was due for release in Malaysia on Thursday, but Disney said it was being held for a "review" of its content. The Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) said on Tuesday it had approved the screening but with "a minor edit concerning a gay moment in the film". Homosexual activity is illegal in Muslim majority Malaysia, although the country's tourism minister has said banning the film is "ridiculous". A new release date has yet to be announced.   The live-action remake was granted a "P13 parental guidance classification". "We have approved the film so there is no more issue. Once a film receives approval, it means it can be screened," LPF Chairman Datuk Abdul Hamid said. "However, the date of screening and where the screening takes place is not under LPF's jurisdiction. We only look at the content and give a decision on whether the movie gets approved or not." Local cinema chains have been offering refunds for customers who have purchased tickets in advance. Beauty and the Beast director Bill Condon has spoken about the "exclusively gay moment" in the film. It involves LeFou - the sidekick of the film's main antagonist Gaston - who tries to come to terms with feelings for Gaston that swing between lust and admiration, as a side-plot to the main story. The decision to review the Disney classic in Malaysia courted criticism from netizens, many of whom called it "stupid and laughable". "Malaysia bans 'Beauty and the Beast' but is okay with nonsense Malay movies with no moral values, just full of brainless jokes," wrote a Twitter user in a tweet which drew more than 4,500 re-tweets. Priyanka Laxmiâ€	The release of Disney's Beauty and the Beast has been postponed in Malaysia.
The 23-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, saved a penalty in normal time and one in a shoot-out when the Chairboys knocked Blackpool out of the EFL Trophy in January. And, with four minutes left on the clock in this game, Blackman saved Brad Potts' spot-kick to preserve a point. The first chance of the game fell to Adebayo Akinfenwa who drilled wide after 10 minutes. Midway through the first half a speculative effort from Potts grazed Blackman's crossbar. On the stroke of half-time Paris Cowan-Hall's low drive brought a smart save from visiting goalkeeper Dean Lyness. Shortly after the break a Potts effort was acrobatically clawed back from the goal-line by Blackman. Blackpool claimed the ball had crossed the line but their appeals fell on deaf ears. And Wycombe's keeper had his crowning moment in the dying stages, producing a brilliant save to deny Potts from 12 yards. Match report supplied by the Press Association.

The 21-year-old will help cover the loss of James Clare, who has a serious knee injury, and the release of Lee Smith from his contract. Naughton came through the academy at Bradford, and spent a year at Sydney Roosters before joining Hull in 2015. "Bringing in Curtis gives him an opportunity to catapult his career at the top level," said coach Neil Jukes.	Super League newcomers Leigh Centurions have signed Hull FC utility back Curtis Naughton on a season-long loan deal.
The annual Roald Dahl Funny Prize is to be relaunched in 2016 as part of the author's centenary celebrations. Set up by former children's laureate Michael Rosen in 2008, the prize is intended to reward authors and artists of humorous children's books. A spokesman for the Dahl Literary Estate said they looked forward to making the prize "even more impactful". The prize was created as a joint enterprise between book charity Booktrust, the Roald Dahl literary estate and Rosen. 'Robust future' "We are delighted with the success that the Roald Dahl Funny Prize has achieved in a fairly short amount of time," said Luke Kelly of Dahl & Dahl. "The Prize has paid tribute to many fantastically talented, inventive and mischievous storytellers." Booktrust boss Viv Bird said the prize had been a "phenomenal triumph" but she wanted to ensure "a robust future for this unique celebration of funny books". Last year's winners, Simon Rickerty (Monkey Nut) and Jim Smith (I Am Not A Loser), received Â£2,500 each.	A children's book prize inspired by Matilda author Roald Dahl has been put on hold for two years.
The 20-year-old Slovak has yet to play for Fulham's first team, but made 17 appearances in the National League on loan at Welling last term. Rodak, who has represented his country at youth level, will go straight into Accrington's squad for their League Two fixture against Cheltenham on Saturday. Stanley are 20th in the table, four points above the relegation zone. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page or visit our Premier League tracker here.

The wager on Murray - the competition's 5/2 second favourite, behind Novak Djokovic - would net a £175,000 return, including the stake. Ladbrokes believes it to be the largest tennis bet ever placed in Scotland. The company's Alex Donohue said: "Our Murray fan in Aberdeen has given his hero the ultimate vote of confidence with this record-breaking bet." Murray ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion in 2013 when he beat Djokovic in the final. The British number one is due to get his campaign under way against Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan on Tuesday.	A punter in Aberdeen has placed a bet of £50,000 on Andy Murray to win Wimbledon.
Spencer Vaughan, 27, of Campbell Road, Plymouth, suffered spinal damage after hitting his head on a sand bar in Gran Canaria while on a training course. He is seeking damages from the MoD for not warning about the dangers of diving into shallow waters. Mr Justice Davis will give his ruling at a later date. Mr Vaughan, who comes from Cwmbran, South Wales, is now an incomplete tetraplegic following the accident in 2009 and gave evidence from his wheelchair at London's High Court. Mr Vaughan insisted he was "on duty" when he walked into the sea to "cool off", executing a shallow, surface dive as the waters reached waist height. Malcolm Sheehan QC, for the MoD, suggested to Mr Vaughan that he and his comrades were simply "chilling out" on the beach. "It is unrealistic to say that you were on duty because you had a free choice about how to spend your time", the barrister said. The QC referred him to "other accounts" which suggested that he "ran into the water and then carried out a Baywatch-style dive". Mr Vaughan agreed that he and his fellow marines were "relaxing and chilling out", but said their primary purpose was to exercise and to swim. Mr Vaughan said he had walked carefully into the water to avoid a young family in front of him. Mr Sheehan said he had "every sympathy" for Mr Vaughan's plight, but added: "On the facts of this case there is no basis for a finding of negligence on the part of the MoD." Mr Justice William Davis has now reserved his judgment on the case and will give his ruling at a later date.	A Royal Marine who is suing the Ministry of Defence for up to £8m, has denied that he broke his neck performing a "Baywatch-style" dive.
Police said the man was being held over alleged offensive behaviour. He is understood to be among those pictured in a recent police CCTV images appeal. Several appeals for information were made after toilets were vandalised at the game and offensive effigies of Rangers fans were hung from the stands. The match, which Celtic won 5-1, took place at Celtic Park on 10 September.	A 23-year-old man has been arrested in connection with disorder at the recent Celtic v Rangers game in Glasgow.
The Belgian, on loan from Manchester United, picked up the injury during Sunderland's 3-2 defeat by Crystal Palace on Saturday. A scan on Tuesday confirmed the 21-year-old has suffered ankle ligament damage. Januzaj has scored once for Sunderland in seven appearances and was sent off against Tottenham earlier this month.	Sunderland winger Adnan Januzaj has been ruled out for a minimum of six weeks with an ankle injury.
David Ellam, 52, was attacked as he walked his Yorkshire terrier, Rolo, near his home in Sheepridge, Huddersfield, last August. At Leeds Crown Court, Aaron Joseph, 29, denied being the owner of a dog that caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place. Mr Joseph was released on bail and a trial date has been set for 5 February. Live updates and more stories from Yorkshire Judge Peter Collier QC, the Recorder of Leeds, said he hoped the trial date could be brought forward. Police were called to Riddings Road on 15 August, and Mr Ellam was taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary where he was later pronounced dead. Mr Joseph, of Riddings Road, pleaded guilty to possessing a quantity of cannabis on the same day.	A man has denied being the owner of a dog which attacked and fatally injured a neighbour.
The world number two won 6-2 6-0 in 66 minutes and will next play Rafael Nadal, who beat Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-4. It was a much improved performance from Murray, who broke 10th seed Raonic's serve five times. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat Roger Federer 6-3 2-6 7-5, and fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils beat Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-4. "It's the most challenging surface for me every year," said Murray. "It normally takes me a few weeks to remember what I need to do, how to move, the way to build up the points and making sure you don't rush." Murray needed almost three hours to beat Benoit Paire on Thursday and had struggled for form since the Australian Open in January - but he was close to his best against Raonic. The Scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving Raonic a single ace and breaking five times. "The two most important shots in tennis I did really well," added Murray. "I was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, I was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. "The serve and the return for me were the best they've been for a while and I'm glad, because they weren't so strong the last couple of matches." Jamie Murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and Brazil's Bruno Soares reached the semi-finals. The pair beat sixth seeds Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea 6-2 6-3, despite Murray requiring treatment on his thigh at one stage. Murray leads Marcelo Melo by just five points in the rankings and will face the Brazilian, and partner Ivan Dodig of Croatia, in the last four on Saturday. Andy Murray and Dom Inglot had a match point but could not convert as they lost 6-4 3-6 12-10 to France's in-form Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues. Never want to miss the latest tennis news?

The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices. But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech industry chief told the Commons science and technology committee. Antony Walker, of techUK, said anything that connected to the internet could "in theory" be hacked into. In the future, this could include driverless cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so-called Internet of Things - said Mr Walker. He said the Home Office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls "equipment interference", highlighting recent concerns about "smart toys" that connect to the internet and have microphones and cameras built-in. "A range of devices that have been in the news recently, in relation to a hack, are children's toys, that children can interact with," he told the committee. "These are devices that may sit in a child's bedroom but are accessible. "In theory, the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices. "So the potential extent, I think, is something that needs to be carefully considered." In November, electronic toy company Vtech had its app store database hacked, allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children's names, dates of birth and gender. Talking dolls, such as Hello Barbie and My Friend Cayla, have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months. Barbie manufacturer Mattel reportedly made modifications to Hello Barbie, which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection, after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it. The police, security services, HM Revenue and Customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant. This allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphones, track locations, listen to calls, or even switch on microphones and cameras, allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby. The Home Office says these powers, the existence of which were revealed earlier this year following a court case, have "made a vital contribution to counter the increased threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism and have also enabled the disruption of paedophile-related crime", according to a Home Office fact sheet. The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would put "equipment interference" warrants on a firmer legal footing and make sure they are "only used when necessary and proportionate for a legitimate purpose". A revised bill will be introduced to Parliament in the New Year, following consultation and scrutiny by the industry and other interested parties. Mr Walker, whose organisation represents 850 UK technology firms, told MPs it needed to be more forward-looking and less vague about the limits of surveillance. "When we start to think, not just about the world today, but the world in five, 10 years' time as the Internet of Things becomes more real, and more pervasive. "I think it requires careful thought in terms of where the limits should be."	The security services could remotely take over children's toys and use them to spy on suspects, MPs have been told.
GM will also hire 1,000 new workers in Ontario to focus on research for connected and driverless cars. Canada and particularly Ontario has been promoting its car-making sector as it attempts to compete with Mexico. Ontario's Premier called the investment a "vote of confidence". "Our government welcomes this investment, which will help Ontario play a leading role in building the auto industry of the future," said Premier Kathleen Wynne. Canada has been fighting to keep carmakers in the country. Many have been lured to Mexico where production is cheaper and the cars have the same tariff free access to the US market. As part of this effort last year Ontario became the first Canadian province to allow road testing of driverless cars. Over the last five years carmakers in Ontario produced nearly 15% of all North American vehicles. The investment will be in GM's Kapuskasing plant, which focuses on cold weather technology. In April, GM purchased land to develop an urban mobility campus to test driverless cars in city driving conditions.	General Motors has announced plans to invest $10m (£6.96m) in a Canadian plant as part of an effort to boost driverless technology and cold weather testing.
The gunman fled after opening fire on Annonciate Haberisoni as she was waiting for her hair to be done, witnesses said. Mr Rwasa accused the government of attempting to assassinate his wife. It has not commented on the allegation. Tensions have been rising in Burundi ahead of elections in May and June. Mr Rwasa said at a press conference that his wife was being treated for head injuries at a local hospital, and her condition was not critical. He would not be intimidated by Sunday's shooting, he added. Mr Rwasa accused the government of compiling a hit list of people to be targeted in the run-up to parliamentary elections in May and presidential elections in June. Police said they were investigating the attack. Witnesses were quoted in the local media as saying that Mrs Haberisoni's life was probably saved by her hair dresser who saw the gunman taking aim and pushed her out of the way. Mr Rwasa is a former rebel leader and an influential member of the opposition Forces for National Liberation (FNL) party. He came out of hiding in 2013 and said he would contest this year's election. President Pierre Nkurunziza has not yet indicated whether he will step down or run for a third term. He took office in 2005 following the end of a 12-year civil war, which killed more than 300,000 people.	The wife of prominent Burundian opposition politician Agathon Rwasa has been shot and wounded at a hair salon in the capital, Bujumbura.
Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was handed over to a delegation of tribal leaders. He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a "manoeuvre". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. "We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership," he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. "Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling." A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed. They seized Mr Bin Mubarak on 17 January to stop him attending a meeting to discuss the draft, saying they had become aware of "irregularities" in the text.	Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen have freed a senior presidential aide who they abducted 10 days ago.
In the Victorian fairground where the grotesque mixed with the gaudy, where the sound of the barrel organ mixed with the whooshes and bangs of the various rides, there would be the stand where you would be able to lace up a pair of boxing gloves and take on the gnarled and grizzled man mountain who would be waiting for you in the ring. And the crowd would "ooh" and "aah" as the prizefighter set about you, raining blows down above and below the belt. And so it was in the beautiful Simi Hills in California last night at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library that the Republican candidates took it in turn to try to give Donald Trump a bloody nose, a cracked rib, a thick lip and black eye. Ideally all four at once. First up, flexing his muscles, and jabbing hard, was Senator Rand Paul on whether Trump had the character to have his hand on the nuclear trigger. "I'm very concerned about him - having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his - his visceral response to attack people on their appearance - short, tall, fat, ugly - my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that?" Good shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - "I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there," said Trump. Cue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. "Mr Trump. We don't need an apprentice in the White House." But with a squint of those blue eyes, Trump shot back "in Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2bn right now. I would do so much better than that." Jake Tapper, the excellent CNN host, didn't quite say "roll up, roll up who else wants to take their chances against my boy?" But he didn't need to. They were lining up. Hold on a minute. What's this? My, my, a lady is getting into the ring. Surely she wouldn't be able to draw blood where everyone else had failed. Well she did. The former Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina had been roundly insulted by Trump when he questioned her suitability because of her appearance. He told Rolling Stone  - "Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" She was stoic and measured: "I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said." And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. "I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman." Her face was acid. She did not flinch. It was a gotcha moment. And "low energy" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate. Trump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited. There was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate. But if you're in a fairground - well you want all the fun of the fair. And once again Donald Trump provided it.  He is still the focal point. But he saw tonight that his opponents are prepared to fight back. And so the circus moves on. So roll up next time to see whether the polls change, whether all those candidates can stay the course. Thrills and spills await us.	The BBC's Jon Sopel sees presidential hopeful Donald Trump roll with the punches in the second Republican debate in California - until a new competitor entered the ring.
Media playback is not supported on this device Webber led after the final pit stops and the drivers were told to hold position to the end of the race but Vettel passed Webber after a tussle with 13 laps to go. Vettel has since apologised for the incident. Media playback is not supported on this device Lewis Hamilton took third ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who obeyed an order to stay behind. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso crashed on the second lap after breaking his front wing. The Spaniard's team-mate Felipe Massa took fifth, fighting past the Lotus cars of Romain Grosjean and Kimi Raikkonen in the closing laps after the Lotus team's gamble to try to do only three pit stops rather than four failed. Grosjean finished sixth ahead of Raikkonen, who won the first race in Australia last weekend. McLaren's Jenson Button was on for a points-scoring finish, possibly in fifth place, before he was sent on his way from a pit stop with a loose front wheel. The Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg took eighth ahead of McLaren's Sergio Perez, with Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne 10th. It was a race full of drama as the intra-team battles at Red Bull and Mercedes played out live. "The Malaysian Grand Prix team orders controversy at Red Bull is only the latest episode of a long-running drama between Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber. "It goes right back to 2010, when the two crashed while Vettel tried to pass Webber for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix. "Since then, there has been a litany of further incidents at the team as the two men, both intensely determined and tough but very different in other ways, have battled for supremacy. "Adding spice to it is Webber's belief that, while they profess to allow them to battle it out on the track, the team is more behind Vettel than him. "The belief - widely shared within F1 - is founded on the way the team have responded to the various situations between their drivers. "In their battle in Malaysia there may even have been a bit of residual revenge on Vettel's part - the German and his champion at Red Bull, motorsport chief Helmet Marko, felt Webber was obstructive in last season's title-deciding Brazilian Grand Prix." The battle between the Red Bulls was resolved in an intense scrap as Webber rejoined from his final pit stop. Vettel was warned by team boss Christian Horner that he was being "silly" but the two then battled wheel-to-wheel around Turns One and Two onto Turn Four, where Webber appeared finally to yield to his team-mate despite having the inside line. Webber said: "After the last stop the team told me the race was over and we turned the engines down and go to the end. The team made their decision. Seb made his own decision and he will have protection as usual." Vettel was told over the radio after the race: "Good job, Seb. Looks like you wanted it bad enough. Still you've got some explaining to do." Webber had initially taken the lead at the first stops as the drivers came in to fit dry-weather tyres following a wet start. He had led the race throughout, with the two Red Bull drivers using the two available tyre compounds in different orders. Vettel chose to end the race on the softer 'medium' tyre while Webber was on the hard. Vettel said: "Obviously it is very hot and if there is something to say we need to say it internally." Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko, a powerful champion of Vettel, admitted the battle had "got out of control". Meanwhile, there was controversy at Mercedes as Rosberg followed Hamilton closely in the final laps. Media playback is not supported on this device Rosberg asked the team to let him pass Hamilton, but was told "negative" by team boss Ross Brawn. When he complained again, Brawn told him that Hamilton - who had earlier been told to save fuel - was also being "controlled" and could also go faster. Hamilton admitted on the podium: "I can't say it's the best feeling being up here today. If I'm honest I really feel Nico should be standing here." Hamilton had provided an amusing diversion when, coming in for his second stop, he headed into the pit box of former team McLaren before being waved on towards Mercedes. "I did a Jenson," he said. "He did it a couple of years ago and I've done it today. Apologies to my team." The result puts Vettel into the championship lead by 11 points from Raikkonen. Webber is five points further adrift and ahead of Hamilton, Massa and Alonso, who is already 22 points behind Vettel, the man who narrowly beat him to the title 2010 and 2012. Alonso started third and was up to second, past Massa, by the first corner. But he tapped the back of Vettel's car in Turn Two. It was the lightest of touches but enough to break the front wing mounts. He held onto second place throughout the first lap but did not stop to change it and it collapsed heading into Turn One on the second lap, sending him into the gravel trap. Ferrari said the decision not to stop was made in the pits. Alonso wrote later on Twitter: "Bad luck today. As always over 19 races we will be compensated and we are ready to recover good points in the next race." Result: 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ger), Red Bull, 1hr 38min 56.681secs 2.

The Scot collected £200,000, the biggest ever victory cheque for a tournament outside the UK, after prevailing in a high-quality contest. Higgins led 5-4 after the first session in Guangzhou, but 2015 world champion Bingham won the first two on the resumption before Higgins moved 7-6 up. An 84 from Bingham levelled it but 134 and two more tons sealed Higgins' win. It was the 41-year-old's first tournament win since last year's International Championship, also in China, but as an invitation title does not count towards his tally of 28 ranking crowns. The world number six beat Mark Williams, Ali Carter and Mark Allen en route to the final, which featured five centuries in all and nine more breaks over 50.	John Higgins reeled off three centuries from 7-7 to beat Stuart Bingham 10-7 in the final of the China Championship.
Mr Gustafsson, 42, is being flown back to Sweden from Africa, Sweden's Foreign Minister Margot Wallström said in a statement on Monday. He was seized by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) along with two other men, one of whom was freed in a dawn raid in 2015. Ms Wallström said Mr Gustafsson was "in good spirits", local media report. "It is with great pleasure that I can announce that Johan Gustafsson has been released," Ms Wallström added. She said that the Swede's release was thanks to "extensive efforts" and co-operation between the Swedish foreign ministry, police and "foreign authorities". Ms Wallström said she had spoken with Mr Gustafsson, who she described as being "happy" and "overwhelmed" by Monday's events. "I cannot say more at the current time," she added. Sweden's former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that Mr Gustafsson's kidnapping weighed heavily on his mind during his time in the role, which ended in 2014. He tweeted on Monday: "Extremely gratifying that Johan Gustafsson is free. No single case concerned me more as foreign minister." Mr Gustafsson was kidnapped along with South African Stephen McGown and Dutchman Sjaak Rijke. Mr Rijke was freed by French special forces in April 2015 after he was discovered by chance in a dawn raid in northern Mali. AQIM took a number of Western hostages before the French military deployed its forces in January 2013. In a separate incident in December 2014, French hostage Serge Lazarevic was freed after a prisoner swap.	Hostage Johan Gustafsson, held by al-Qaeda in Mali since 2011, has been freed, the Swedish government says.
Asad Khan, from Bradford, died three weeks after starting at Beckfoot Upper Heaton School in the city. His mother, Farheen Khan, found her son after forcing her way into his locked bedroom on September 28. He died in hospital a short time later.ã€€ His family maintain he had been bullied. Bradford Coroner's Court heard Asad had told a boy - who cannot be identified - a number of things, including that he felt "unsafe" in school and was "going to skive for a very long time." Coroner Martin Fleming heard on another occasion, Asad told the boy: "Life is unfair. I would say it's 90 to 95 per cent life is hard". Mr Fleming said he would now consider whether to call the boy in person to give evidence. The inquest will resume next month.	An 11-year-old boy told another pupil he felt "unsafe" in his new school on the day he was found hanged, an inquest hearing has been told.
The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe. Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally. This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least. Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration. Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: "Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York." This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda. The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them. In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a "whinge-o-rama". Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation. She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was "normal" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US. As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag. So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting. And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table. What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group? This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU. This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe. She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington. The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office. Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as "probably... my closest international partner these eight years". In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: "Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate." So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established. Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January. The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump. But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries. The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. "For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States," he said. In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions. The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process. Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.	In the arc of history, Britain has rarely flourished when it has had to choose between Europe and the United States.
Natalie Hemming, 31, of Alderney Avenue, Newton Leys, was reported missing on Tuesday. The man, 42, and also from Milton Keynes, was arrested by Thames Valley Police earlier in connection with the investigation and is in custody. Police said Ms Hemming's disappearance was "out of character" and they are still trying to locate her. Det Ch Insp Simon Steel said officers were "keeping an open mind" about the circumstances surrounding the disappearance. "Our priority is to find Natalie and return her to her family as soon as possible. We would like to speak to anyone who has any information about where Natalie may be or anyone who has seen her since 3pm on Sunday. "If you recognise someone fitting Natalie's description or have any details which could assist with the investigation, no matter how insignificant you feel they may be, please contact police." Ms Hemming is described as white,  about 5ft 3in (1.6m) tall, of slim build, has shoulder length brown hair and blue eyes. She was last seen on Sunday at 15:00 BST in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, and was wearing a blue top, blue jeans and a short black jacket.	A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder by police searching for a missing woman.
The 31-year-old, from Sheffield, has received the honour for her services to athletics. Ennis-Hill, who won gold at London 2012 Olympics and silver four years later in Rio, announced her retirement from the sport in October. At the same ceremony, designer and ex-Spice Girl Victoria Beckham was made an OBE for services to fashion. More on this story and others in South Yorkshire Ennis-Hill, who received her honour from the Duke of Cambridge, will receive another World Championships gold medal after Tatyana Chernova was stripped of her 2011 world title for doping. The 2012 Olympic champion, who was accompanied by her grandparents, mother Alison Powell and husband Andy Hill at the ceremony, said: "Just to hear the national anthem in this kind of moment again is really special. "I've so many amazing memories of standing on the podium and hearing it and to be here receiving a damehood, which I never imagined I would ever receive, is an incredible honour." She added: "I've had more than I could ever imagine out of my career so I can't stand here receiving a damehood and wish for any more."	Former heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill has formally been made a dame during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 40-year-old won Olympic heptathlon bronze for Britain in 2004 and has been upgraded to two more bronze medals from 2008 after retrospective drug tests. All world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a new proposal from European Athletics, after the sport's latest doping scandal. Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records. She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m? "We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated. "Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?" Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986. Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased. "I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.	Kelly Sotherton says athletics chiefs should consider tweaking events rather than rewriting existing world records.
Media playback is not supported on this device Tries by Tom Habberfield and Tyler Ardron, converted by Dan Biggar, gave the home team a 14-point interval lead. Ulster dominated after the break, but Brendan Leonard's try saw the game off before Jacob Stockdale's late score. Ospreys need a point in their final game to secure a play-off spot while Ulster will have to beat Leinster for any chance of making the final stages. They face Scarlets on 6 May with the west Wales region secure in the play-off places after a 30-8 win over Connacht. Fifth-placed Ulster will need a miracle to overtake to overtake Ospreys in fourth place and will regret the number of missed opportunities after the break in Swansea if - as now seems likely - they fail to make the play-offs. Stockdale beat most of the defence, only to see his final pass go to ground and later kicked the ball over the dead-ball line after outstripping the cover. Charles Piutau dropped the ball close to the Ospreys' line as Ulster put the home team under pressure. But the visitors were made to pay for their profligacy when substitute Leonard crossed for the Ospreys' third try two minutes before time in a rare second-half attack. When Stockdale scored practically from the re-start, it left Ulster looking for a second try and conversion to claim a losing bonus point - only to lose possession at a breakdown for the umpteenth time. Ospreys - coming into the game after three successive league defeats - weathered an early storm and scored from practically their first attack as centre Ashley Beck tied in two defenders to send the unmarked Habberfield over in the corner. Paddy Jackson and Biggar exchanged penalties before the Welsh side took control in the lead up to half-time with only a combination of good Ulster defence and their own lack of composure keeping Ospreys at bay. But on the stroke of half-time a long kick by Jackson saw home full-back and man-of-the-match Dan Evans carve the defence open before handing on to Habberfield who put Ardron over between the posts. The conversion opened a 14-point gap which better reflected Ospreys' dominance. It was Ulster's turn to dominate in the second half, but mistakes and stubborn defending left them wondering what might have been - and facing an almighty challenge in the final game at home to Leinster. Ulster scrum-half Ruan Pienaar, who leaves at the end of the season,  may have played his last game for the province after suffering a back spasm which saw him leave the field during the first half. Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss said: "Frustrated and disappointed - two words that describe a lot of things because there's a fair bit of pain in that dressing room. "Ruan [Pienaar] had a back spasm before the game started, he said he'd ride it out but within 20 minutes it was gone. It's a fairly significant spasm and those things can take a while. "Stu McCloskey had a bad dead leg and Stuart Olding was hit hard with his first touch with an ankle injury, it's probably season-ending." Ospreys: Dan Evans; Keelan Giles, Kieron Fonotia, Ashley Beck, Tom Habberfield, Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb (Capt); Nicky Smith, Scott Baldwin, Brian Mujati, Bradley Davies, Tyler Ardron, Sam Underhill, Justin Tipuric, James King.

They are due to appear in court later. Nigerian newspaper Punch reports that the police raided a hotel in Lagos State on Saturday afternoon and says the hotel was cordoned off while the investigation was carried out. Homosexual acts are punishable by up to 14 years in jail in Nigeria, while gay marriage and displays of same-sex affection are also banned. Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja Nigeria has an influential Christian evangelical movement in the south and strong support for Islamic law in the north, both of which oppose homosexuality. Since Nigeria passed a law criminalising same sex marriage and gay organisations in 2013, law enforcement agents have cracked down on people suspected of homosexuality. However, arrests are infrequent as homosexual people live in hiding. Gay people live in fear and cannot openly express their sexual orientation. They are not protected by any law so they face discrimination. Northern states under Sharia - Islamic religious law - have the death penalty for people convicted of same-sex offences which in other states carry a 14-year jail term. This is not the first arrest for engaging in acts of homosexuality but so far prosecutions have never ended in prison. Same-sex relations are explicitly banned in 72 countries, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA). The number of states that criminalise same-sex relations is decreasing annually, though, with Belize and the Seychelles repealing such laws last year. Nigeria is one of a small number of countries which has gone against a global trend. The country has had a ban on gay relationships since 1901, and in 2013 also outlawed same-sex marriages, gay groups and shows of same-sex public affection.	More than 40 men have been arrested in Nigeria over the weekend for performing homosexual acts, police say.
The move comes after faulty Poly Implant ProthÃ¨se (PIP) silicone breast implants were recalled in 2010, affecting thousands of women. The inclusion of individual patients' details will not be mandatory. However, all providers of breast implant surgery will be expected to participate in the scheme. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "We want the NHS to be the safest healthcare system in the world and anyone who chooses to have a cosmetic procedure has the right to safe care. "The PIP breast implant scandal in 2010 affected thousands of people which is why we asked NHS Digital to develop a new register which will allow people to be traced swiftly if that is ever needed." As a result of poor record-keeping following the PIP scandal, many women were unable to find out if they had been given the faulty implants. In some cases, because surgery providers had gone out of business, women who received the implants could not be traced. The Breast and Cosmetic Implant Registry - which will be managed by NHS Digital - will include patients treated by both NHS and private providers. And participation in the registry will be noted during Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspections. The registry will be expanded in the future to also cover other cosmetic implants, such as buttock or calf implants. It is expected to record more than 20,000 cases of implant surgery every year and allow complications with specific implants to be picked up. Providers will be expected to submit data on patients via an online portal. Explicit consent from patients will be required to add their details to the registry - and this is in addition to the usual consent for the surgical procedure. Noel Gordon, chair of NHS Digital, said the registry marked a major step forward in improving patient safety for people who undergo breast implant surgery each year. "We look forward to working with patients and providers to ensure that the benefits of this important registry are delivered." The British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, the Association of Breast Surgery and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons welcomed the registry. In a joint statement, they said: "This will protect patients by providing a way to actively monitor all implants, track and trace their use and provide data for further research, which may be used to further technological advances. "We hope that all patients will consent to the submission of data on their behalf."	A register of patients in England with breast and other cosmetic implants has been set up to allow them to be traced in the event of any safety concerns.
The Toffees have been working with Liverpool City Council to find a replacement for Goodison Park, where they have played since 1892. Everton chief executive Robert Elstone said the plan was at "an early stage". He hoped the new sites would provide a "more straightforward, deliverable opportunity" to build a new stadium. Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri bought a 49.9% stake in Everton in February and quickly outlined plans for a move from Goodison, which has a capacity of 39,572. "Goodison Park has served the club extremely well but we need to make sure the club has a suitable stage to perform on for the future," he said. An initial plan was to build a stadium at Walton Hall Park, a short distance north-east of Goodison, but it was strongly opposed by local protestors. Mayor Joe Anderson said the site would now remain a park. "Most people will be aware that I did give a commitment to Everton to support a potential scheme at Walton Hall Park with the aim of regenerating the area and creating new jobs," he said. "However, through the work that the club and the council have done, we have concluded that effectively building a new village in north Liverpool with lots of retail space is a step too far in this current economic climate." Across Stanley Park at Anfield, Liverpool are in the process of expanding their main stand which will take their capacity to around 54,000.	Everton have abandoned plans for a new stadium at Walton Hall Park but have identified two possible alternative sites within the Liverpool boundary.
Olive Cooke, 92, of Bristol, joined the Royal British Legion (RBL) aged 16 following her father who was an active member after serving in World War One. Mrs Cooke said selling poppies took on a whole new meaning after her first husband was killed in action in 1943. The RBL said it could not be exact but that Mrs Cooke was "one of our longest-standing poppy collectors". For the past 12 years Mrs Cooke has sold poppies from the entrance to Bristol Cathedral. She said she wished everyone would wear one with "great pride" to remember those who died in both world wars. She said although she had only been married two-and-a-half years when her first husband Leslie Hussey-Yeo was killed, "he is in my memory every day". "You never forget the lost people and he was such a good man you wouldn't want to," said Mrs Cooke. "His words to me were that if anything were to happen to him, to always wear a smile and I've never got bitter. I never thought bitterness helped. "I think of my husband, cousins and many of my school friends who were killed aged 18, all young men that we were at school with, so all of those faces come back to me." Col Brian John, president of the City of Bristol group of RBL branches, said Mrs Cooke was their "most-valued poppy collector". Sue Potepa, from the RBL in Bristol, said she was "well-loved" by the team. "This year 350,000 volunteers like Olive will help us to ensure that the poppy is available to all those who wish to wear one and we are extremely grateful to her for the support she has given the Royal British Legion and our annual Poppy Appeal for more than 75 years," she said.	A charity volunteer who has clocked up 76 years of service is one of the UK's longest-serving poppy sellers.
Valery Gergiev, a supporter of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, conducted the Mariinsky Symphony Orchestra, from St Petersburg, at Palmyra's Roman Theatre. Last July, IS posted footage online showing some of its fighters carrying out killings in the ancient theatre. Syrian forces, backed by Russian air strikes, retook the historic site. Palmyra in pictures Mr Gergiev led the orchestra through pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach, Sergei Prokofiev and Rodion Shchedrin, in front of a crowd of Russian soldiers, government ministers and journalists. Pictures of the concert, broadcast on Russian state television, were occasionally interrupted by footage of military action - showing Russian military backing for Syrian government forces as they liberated Palmyra from IS militants. Mr Gergiev was until recently principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and is music director of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2014, he backed Mr Putin over the annexation of the Crimea from Ukraine. In 2008, he performed in the capital of South Ossetia when Russia and Georgia were fighting over the territory. The maestro described the concert as a protest against the barbarism and violence exhibited by Islamic State militants who had used the city's Roman amphitheatre to execute prisoners. The Russian president also addressed the audience, by video link from his Black Sea residence in Sochi. He called terrorism a contagion of which the world needed to rid itself, and said the fact the concert was taking place at all was "surprising". "Today's action involved major inconvenience and dangers for everyone, being in a country at war close to where hostilities are still ongoing. That has demanded great strength and personal courage from you all," he said. However, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the concert was "a tasteless attempt to distract attention from the continued suffering of millions of Syrians. It shows that there are no depths to which the regime will not sink". This is about more than just music. By organising a concert in the ruins of Palmyra, Russia wants the world to see that it is making a positive contribution in Syria: bringing peace and stability to the country, and, in the case of Palmyra, saving a Unesco heritage site. Moscow will be hoping that images of its classical musicians in Syria will reinforce the message that Russia is a force for good. Such a musical message will be well received back home. For months now, Russian TV has been assuring viewers Russia's military intervention in Syria has benefited the world by taking on international terrorism. But Western officials remain suspicious of Russia's intentions. Moscow has faced accusations that it has not done enough to rein in Syrian government forces. The Russians deny that and accuse America of not using its influence with the Syrian opposition to halt the fighting. One of the soloists at the concert was cellist Sergei Roldugin, a friend of Putin's, who was recently named as the owner of offshore companies in the so-called Panama Papers. He denies all wrongdoing. Islamic State destroyed a number of monuments during its 10-month occupation of Palmyra and its associated Unesco World Heritage site. Two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers were left in ruins. The jihadist group, which has also demolished several pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous. While some treasured monuments were destroyed, much of the historic site was left undamaged. It is not the first time Mr Gergiev has performed in a war-torn city. In August 2008, the native Ossetian conductor took the Mariinsky Theatre Symphony Orchestra to the ruins of Tskhinvali in the separatist Georgian region of South Ossetia, heavily damaged in the short Russian-Georgian war that year. Mr Gergiev also conducted a charity concert in Tokyo for victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2012, and he led a charity concert tour to raise funds for victims of Russia's Beslan school massacre in 2004.	A renowned Russian conductor has led a concert in the ruins of Palmyra in Syria, which were recaptured from the so-called Islamic State (IS) in March.
A team from Glasgow University studied recorded speech of Glaswegians from the early 20th Century to the present. They found evidence of common UK accent changes, such as the use of "f" for "th" in words like think, and a dropped letter 'l', as in people to peopo. Overall though, the researchers said the Scots accent remained distinctive. The three-year Sounds of the City study, was led by Professor Jane Stuart-Smith, director of the university's laboratory of phonetics. "We were quite surprised by what we found," she said. "The assumption is that traditional dialects generally across the UK are being eroded and some are dying out altogether, but what we have learned, particularly with the Glasgow accent, is that Scots accents are actually flourishing. "Interestingly, what is not happening in Scotland is the dilution of accents to a more homogenised anglicised accent on the scale that we are seeing in England, and in fact the Scots accent remains very distinctive." As part of its study, the Glasgow team built up a digitised body of recorded speech sounds. The team said its work suggested the distinctive Scots accent had undergone two kinds of changes. One set are common accent changes, which have spread right across the UK, such as the "f" and "l" examples. The team said this change was being spread partly by dialect contact and partly by the popularity of TV shows set in London. The project also uncovered a second set of finer changes local to Scotland. These included how vowels were pronounced in words such as boat, goat and coat, or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin, top and cat. The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time, or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo-English accents. Their evidence suggested, however, that these features and others were all changing, the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo-English changes, and that they had been happening for 100 years or more. The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War. The study focused on six audio recordings, made in 1916 and held by the British Library, of Scots soldiers from German Prisoner of War camps. From those recordings researchers found evidence to show that even a century ago, and perhaps even earlier, Scottish accents were already changing. The research and findings of the project will be made available to students and other researchers via an online resource.	The Scots accent is flourishing and proving resilient against a growing homogenised anglicised accent across English regions, new research suggests.
The boy was found "safe" this afternoon and arrested on suspicion of wounding and carrying a bladed weapon. Police said he was found on a train from Hereford to Malvern at 16:55 BST. Detectives launched a search for the boy after the attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at about 08:45 BST. A male teacher and 13-year-old girl suffered minor injuries. The boy was apprehended at Ledbury station in Herefordshire. Leah Johnson, 16, a former pupil of Chase College, was travelling on the train when it stopped at Ledbury. She said an officer was waiting on the platform for the boy, who had been standing near the train doors for around 15 minutes. "The policeman was pacing up and down. The doors opened and he just said 'can you come with me?' and he walked off with him," she said. The boy remains in custody at Worcester Police Station. Earlier, there were police officers stationed at each entrance to the school and crime scene tape blocking off the main entrance. Children were brought out individually from the school and handed to parents waiting at the gates. About 100 had gathered by lunchtime.	A 13-year-old schoolboy who disappeared after a fellow pupil and a teacher were attacked with a knife has been arrested, West Mercia Police said.
The $43bn (£33bn) deal is set to be the biggest ever foreign takeover by a Chinese company. The deal was cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which checks deals for national security implications. About a quarter of  Syngenta's sales are in North America. China National Chemical Corporation offered $465 per share for Syngenta in February. Syngenta's shares subsequently fell to about 20% below that because of concerns that CFIUS would not clear the deal. However, now competition authorities elsewhere are expected to give the deal the go-ahead. In a joint statement, Syngenta and ChemChina said: "In addition to CFIUS clearance, the closing of the transaction is subject to anti-trust review by numerous regulators around the world and other customary closing conditions. "Both companies are working closely with the regulatory agencies involved and discussions remain constructive. The proposed transaction is expected to close by the end of the year." When the deal was announced earlier this year, Syngenta chairman Michel Demaré said that it would help the company's pesticides and seeds business to expand further in China. "ChemChina has a very ambitious vision of the industry in the future," he said. "Obviously it is very interested in securing food supply for 1.5 billion people and as a result knows that only technology can get them there." The Chinese company owns a variety of businesses, included the Italian tyre maker Pirelli, German machinery-maker KarussMaffei and Israel's biggest pesticides producer. The deal would be the second-biggest takeover in the chemicals industry in the past year after the $130bn Dow Chemical-DuPont merger announced last December.	Shares in Swiss agribusiness group Syngenta have risen 12% after its takeover by ChemChina was given the go-ahead by a US regulator.
2 December 2016 Last updated at 14:06 GMT Asked by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about a survey that showed many myths about HIV endure in the UK, Sir Elton said he was not surprised considering the DUP's Trevor Clarke said this week he did not know until recently that heterosexual people could contract HIV.	Sir Elton John has criticised comments by a DUP MLA on HIV.
Aaron Lewis, 26 and from Toxteth, was shot three times outside Anna Jungs in Grosvenor Road, Wavertree at about 19:00 GMT on Wednesday. He was taken to Aintree Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. Merseyside Police believe the offender ran down the road towards the city centre and said the shooting was related to organised crime. Officers said Mr Lewis was known to them. At about 19:40, a 19-year-old man went to hospital with a gunshot wound to his upper body. His condition is not thought to be life-threatening and detectives believe he had been with Mr Lewis. The latest death follows the fatal shooting of Thomas Baker at Stanley Meat Market in Old Swan on Friday and highlighted a "serious escalation" of gang violence in Liverpool, police said. Police said that while both deaths were related to serious and organised crime, the shootings were not linked. In addition to Mr Baker and Mr Lewis, Mark Hillman and Blake Brown have been killed in the city. A police spokesman said gun crime had increased in recent months after falling year on year from 2013 to 2016. Since April, 78 firearms have been discharged, 18 more than in the whole of the previous 12 months. An increasing number of new guns are being used, the spokesman added, and officers do not know how or where gangs are obtaining them. Police said the majority of shootings this year were linked to organised crime and the victims will not co-operate with officers. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson and Wavertree MP Luciana Berger have joined forces with Merseyside Police to appeal for public help. Ms Berger said: "We as a community need to work together to help end this violence on our streets." Mr Anderson said: "By coming together as a city we can send out a powerful message to the perpetrators that they will be found and... punished." A series of warrants are being executed across Liverpool as part of a planned crackdown on gun crime, but no weapons have been recovered.	A man has been shot dead in a "cold-blooded, targeted attack" outside a Liverpool chip shop, police said.
The 79-year-old was held on Monday on suspicion of murdering 14-year-old Elsie Frost in October 1965. Elsie was stabbed to death in a tunnel beneath a railway line in Wakefield The BBC understands the arrested man is Peter Pickering, who was first questioned in connection with the murder in 2016. He was arrested near Newbury, in Berkshire. More stories from across Yorkshire The man is also being questioned in relation to an unconnected allegation of a rape and kidnap in 1972. Elsie was murdered as she walked home from her school's sailing club, close to the River Calder and the Calder and Hebble Canal. The West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiries team re-opened its investigation into her death after a series of reports on BBC Radio 4. Mr Pickering was originally arrested in September before being bailed. Police said he had been re-arrested after fresh evidence was uncovered. The allegations of the 1972 rape and kidnap are understood to have emerged during the course of their investigation into Elsie's death.	A man has been arrested for a second time in connection with the killing of a schoolgirl more than 50 years ago.
Many more found their lives were transformed forever by the natural disaster. Here, some share their stories. Louis Cryer was 18 and in Sri Lanka with his mother Zoe and brother Felix We were staying in an idyllic beach village called Unawatuna in Galle district. It took a matter of seconds for a wall of water of about 5ft (1.52m) in height to start coming in. It was a kind of surge which reached the first floor of our hotel. Zoe Cryer, Louis' mother, Sri Lanka Survival instincts totally kick in. I thought our balcony might collapse. My main worry was for my 13-year-old who wasn't such a strong swimmer. We grabbed what we could and got out as quickly as possible. My youngest son, Felix, had been studying tsunamis in geography. He was the first one to realise what had happened. He saw the islands disappearing. When we returned, all the buildings in front of the guest house had been pulled away. A crowd gathered around a woman who had collapsed. I'm qualified in first aid so went to help. We tried to give mouth to mouth, but she died. I'd never seen a dead body before. Many tourists had the opportunity to fly out immediately but I felt strongly that we needed to make our peace with what had happened - with the country and with the people. We were supposed to travel to southern India but went home instead. I didn't think it was right to be there. It was a while before I could look at the sea and feel comfortable. It flattened walls, trees, and the buildings around us, before rising higher and higher. We tried to get people out. Miraculously, guests who had been in the room underneath us started popping up from the water. One woman was trapped in her locked room because she couldn't find her key. She said the room filled up quickly with water and she took what she thought would be her last breath. Luckily she found the key and opened the door which then burst into pieces under the pressure. Buildings were collapsing around us. We tried to pull out passing people trapped in the currents. When the water finally subsided we made a run for higher ground and a temple that had become a make-shift safe refugee area. We set up camp in a hotel up on a hill and when it was safe to do so, we went back down to salvage anything we could. I remember seeing rooms full of mud and fish. People came up to the temple with dead bodies. We carried one Italian woman with a suspected broken back through the debris to another hotel to get medical help. I met one guy who had been out surfing and was swept a few miles up the coast. He had to walk through all the death and destruction to find his family. Luckily he found them all. One of the only positives to come out of it all was the humanity of it. It didn't matter about your nationality or religion. Everyone was checking on each other. A few days later, once the road was clear, the High Commission sent coaches to take us back to a refugee centre in Colombo. We were fed, watered, offered clothes and flights home but we chose not go straight away. We wanted to stay to try and comprehend the reality of what had happened. The main thing we felt was guilt. After seeing the devastation, we were lucky enough leave, but many were left with nothing. Once in the UK, I put on an exhibition of photos I'd taken, spoke about it at our school and raised Â£3500 to send back to the village. I gained a new-found respect for the sea. I never realised its power. It hasn't put me off going in the water, but I'm a lot more aware of what it can do. We were having breakfast at the hotel on a terrace, overlooking the pool, the beach and the Andaman Sea. My husband Tom noticed the waiters were all pointing at the sea which was receding rapidly. It was a fascinating sight. People got their cameras out and walked towards the dry seabed. The beach was full of sunbathing tourists. Tom had an uncomfortable feeling though. He lived for two years on the beach in California and had never seen a sea behave like this. Then it clicked: the trembling he heard earlier was an earthquake. The receding water was the prelude to a tidal wave. Tom grabbed my hand and screamed, "Run!". At that same moment, he saw a high wall of water come crashing over the reef towards us at a speed of 40-50mph. We ran uphill fast. The water was right behind us. The noise was deafening. Tom looked behind and saw the beach and pool area were a boiling mass of water. Palm trees, beach chairs and parts of bungalows were twirling around and people were frantically trying to hold on to something. We kept going for higher ground, up the steep hill into the jungle beyond it. We waited for two hours, knowing only few people would have survived the onslaught below. When the sea looked calm again we descended to the hotel, and found many badly wounded people. We helped to get them onto the back of trucks taking people to hospital. Then we were warned another tsunami was on its way so we climbed up into the jungle again, where we waited three more hours. We then came down to the road there were cars and trucks loaded with the wounded. No one knew what to do or where to go. We did not want to go down to the lower level and see all the corpses that littered the beach. There was no electricity, no cell-phone network nor radio, so we spent the night at a small restaurant stand. The next day the road was clear, and we could start the long trip home. The floor of the bus station was covered with wounded people, all waiting for the bus to Bangkok. People nearly cried at the opportunity to use our cell phone and reach their families to tell them they were alive. The guilt was hard to bear. I will never forgive myself for not going to the hospital with the wounded but mainly for coming back unscratched. Ten years on and we are still looking at life with a lot of more appreciation. We feel connected with Thailand so that is why we continue with a Thai animal charity. My partner and I had won a snorkling trip at a raffle on Christmas Eve at our hotel, Phi Phi Charlie on Koh Phi Phi. That raffle saved our lives. We had been snorkelling in the water when the Thai guides started to call everyone back onto the boats. The water had receded rapidly from the shoreline and nobody knew what was happening. We were lucky that we managed to get back onto the boat as the waves came in, and the boat swiftly repositioned itself some few hundred metres away from the coast. However, as strange currents began to develop and the waves started to impact upon the bay, we saw people being swept away. Longtail boats that had been closer to the shoreline snapped and sank like twigs. We can't believe how lucky we were to get back onto the boat as we don't know what happened to the people we had been snorkelling with and who had been swept away. We just thought some localised freak incident had taken place but 30 minutes later the boat guides had a phone call from friends who told them Phuket and Phi Phi Don had been hit badly by a tsunami. It became clear that Koh Phi Phi, where we had been staying, was devastated by the waves. Our hotel was destroyed, and it was only recently we found out that over half the people staying there were killed. We stayed in open water for the rest of the day waiting for more advice about what to do. It wasn't until late afternoon that the boat took us back to Koh Phi Phi Don. It was then that the tragedy became apparent. We were sailing in a soup of debris from the island which included TVs, fridges, holiday books and worse. It was just awful. We could see that the island was devastated and the infrastructure was shattered. One man on board had a mobile phone. We all took it in turns to try to call home. Eventually I got through to my brother-in-law. I have never heard anyone speak with such worry and relief. He told me that everyone was so worried and had feared the worst. We all decided to stay on the boat that night, moored out at sea. The boat was too small to have taken us all the way to Phuket. The only option we had was to wait for help to arrive in the morning. It was the longest night of my life and were it not for the camaraderie of those passengers on board and the wonderful generosity of the Thai people who owned and manned the boat, it would have been unbearable. As the sun rose, we took the boat in to the harbour once again and waited for the larger boats to arrive. It was just awful. From our position on the water we saw hundreds of people all desperate to get off the island. They were huddled together on the pier in the harbour. We eventually got the ferry boat to Phuket that morning and after a long wait we boarded an army plane back to Bangkok and a flight home. We had lost all of our possessions but didn't care, we were so grateful to be alive. It was such an awful situation and such a random tragedy. Why did we take that boat trip that day? What if we had overslept? Why should we be the ones to survive and not so many others like us who didn't. It is senseless and random and just so utterly sad. Every 26 December since the tsunami my partner and I take a walk on a beach and reflect on that devastating day. We will remember those who died again this year. Produced by Sherie Ryder and Helen Dafedjaiye	On 26 December 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, triggered a deadly tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people and rendered millions homeless.
The striker took his tally to five goals in two games when hitting the opener and winner in an ABAX Stadium thriller. Marriott fired Posh ahead two minutes into the second half with a low shot that crept in courtesy of a kiss off the inside of the far post. But Rotherham were soon back on level terms as Kieffer Moore, who like Marriott hit a hat-trick in his previous league appearance, headed in captain Lee Frecklington's left-wing cross. Marriott then steered a Marcus Maddison cross against a post to be denied by the woodwork for the second time after seeing an early effort hit the underside of the crossbar. Rotherham thought they had hit the front moments later only to see their celebrations cut short by a raised flag when Jamie Proctor nodded in from close range. But a cracking contest was settled with 15 minutes to go when Marriott got the better of dithering defender Semi Ajayi and lobbed a glorious finish over stranded Rotherham goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell.

The European Space Agency astronaut arrived at the orbiting space lab on Monday, along with two crewmates from Russia and America. But what exactly will she be doing during her time in space? The ISS gives the chance to do scientific experiments that cannot be done on Earth, as the station offers an environment of microgravity. Here we run through a few examples of the experiments on Samantha's 'to do' list... Samantha will operate a gadget called an electromagnetic levitator, which can heat metals to 2,000Â°C and then cool them very quickly. This will be a chance to see what happens to different metals when they go from liquid to solid, without the effect of the Earth's gravity. It's hoped the results will reveal more about the physics of the metals and how they work. Samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well they work in space, such as this astronaut joystick. Using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on Earth. So these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery. Another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so it doesn't float away. The testing will also see what impact this has. Samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects her body. For example, she will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the International Space Station and be tested to see how this affects her body clock. Another important subject is food and energy. Experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out. Samantha will record what she eats and her energy levels over a period of time. Other things that will be looked at include how space affects skin and why many astronauts get headaches.	Italy's first female astronaut, Samantha Cristoforetti, is spending almost six months on the International Space Station.
Guy Hedger, 61, died in the early hours of 30 April after intruders reportedly broke into his home in Ashley, near Ringwood, and opened fire with a shotgun. Marine officers are searching a section of the River Stour in West Parley. Three men appeared in court in May accused of Mr Hedger's murder. Det Ch Insp Sarah Derbyshire of Dorset Police said: "We received intelligence to suggest that the weapon would be in this area and by searching the river today we hope to recover it." Earlier this week the charity Crimestoppers put up a Â£10,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the firearm used and jewellery stolen during the raid. Kevin Downton, 40, of Winterborne Stickland near Blandford, Jason Baccus, 41, and Scott Keeping, 44, both of Verney Close, Bournemouth, have been charged with murder and are due at Winchester Crown Court at a later date to enter pleas. Helen Cooper, 40, from Poole, has been charged with assisting an offender. A 45-year-old-man from Poole and a 39-year-old Bournemouth man were arrested in May on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary and released while inquiries continue.	A stretch of river is being searched in an attempt to find the weapon used to kill a businessman who was shot at his home in Dorset.

On Sunday, the New England Patriots staged a stunning comeback to beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in the 51st Super Bowl.
Hend, 43, carded a one-over-par 73 to finish on nine under after the third round at Wentworth. Hatton, 24, birdied five of his last eight holes to shoot a six-under 66. England's Lee Westwood (68) and YE Yang (75) are tied for third on seven under, while Masters champion Danny Willett (76) is a shot further back. Hend complained after his round about the behaviour of some spectators towards him over the closing holes, as he played in the final match with Willett. The Australian said: "Danny was getting all the crowd support and I had no problem with that. But there were a couple of guys out there who were really over the top and it wasn't very nice what they were saying. "It was quite rude and personal and if it was up to me I would have had them thrown out. "Danny and I are mates. I've played with him before and he wants me to do well and I want him to do well. But when you get hecklers in the crowd saying pretty rude things as they were, I was ready to punch them." Willett again struggled on the back nine. Having coming home in 39 after a tournament record first-nine of 29 in his second round, Willett took 41 strokes on Saturday. The 28-year-old Englishman said: "It's disappointing to be somewhere there or thereabouts and then to play poorly on the back nine like we did yesterday. "We had everything under control nicely and then a couple of loose shots, a couple of bad decisions, a couple of missed putts and very quickly it kind of slipped away." Hatton, who has finished fifth, 13th and 12th in his last three events, set the clubhouse target more than two hours before the leaders finished after firing the day's lowest score. He said: "I've been walking around this place since (I was) a five-year-old and I was in awe of the guys inside of the rope. "For me now, playing my third BMW PGA, it's great. I love this event." England's Westwood is playing the event for a 23rd year in a row and is targeting a first win after a second-place finish in 2000 and losing a play-off to Luke Donald in 2011. Westwood, who finished second to Willett at the Masters in April, maintained his ever-present run after taking painkillers to help overcome a foot ligament injury sustained while running on Tuesday. He said: "For a pro to win the PGA at any stage in their career is special. But to do it at 43 years old, in my 23rd appearance and having been in contention a lot before, would be great. "I've played well here in the past and having finished second in the Masters and 10th in the Irish Open, I was surprised to be 33-1 going into this week. "I haven't played a lot at the start of the year, so I'm pretty fresh coming into this part of the season. Normally I would have played 15 events and I've only played six. I'm looking forward to a run of golf now." We've launched a new BBC Sport newsletter ahead of the Euros and Olympics, bringing all the best stories, features and video right to your inbox.

They began the third day 75 runs behind with five first-innings wickets in hand. For them to win on the same evening is not quite unprecedented, but certainly highly unusual, especially in the age of covered pitches. At lunchtime, South Africa were basically level with all 10 wickets intact. It was their opportunity to bat England out of the game. Instead, less than two sessions later, they were beaten. It was incredible. The catalyst for it all was Stuart Broad. As soon as he starts lifting those knees up and running in hard, batsmen are in trouble. Media playback is not supported on this device His 5-1 in 31 balls is the seventh time he has taken five wickets in a single spell of bowling. Those are match-winning performances. He was helped by conditions - the clouds hung around, the floodlights were on all day, the new ball was venomous and brutal. But the bowler still has to put the ball in the right place and, in those circumstances, Broad is a formidable man to face. It wasn't just the deliveries that took wickets that were dangerous - some were flying past the nose, others were crashing into flesh. South Africa will not only be suffering the pain of defeat, but also the bruises of leather on skin. These spells that Broad bowls - The Oval in 2009, Chester-le-Street in 2013, Trent Bridge in 2015 and now here - are symptomatic of his character. If your team is in a situation where someone needs to stand up and be counted, then Broad wants to be that man. He uses all of his 6ft 6in to get bounce, but also swings and seams the ball as well. He's accurate, so builds pressure. On top of that, he loves to get in your face and under your skin. Broad, though, is just one of the players capable of turning a Test for England. In fact, I'm willing to stick my neck out and say that it is unusual for England to be blessed with so many match-winners. Broad, Ben Stokes and Joe Root can all turn the momentum in a session. We know what a fully fit James Anderson is capable of and Steven Finn showed during the Ashes that he can bowl a magic spell. This ability to turn a Test from a position of peril began for England back in the summer. On the first morning against New Zealand at Lord's, England found themselves 30-4, only for Root and Stokes to counter-attack. For years, England had it done to them - think of the havoc that Australia's Adam Gilchrist used to cause. Now, England are doing it to other teams with a great deal of flair and courage. They are a team on the up and one I fancied to beat South Africa, who, in contrast, are a team in decline. The Proteas may have started the series ranked number one, but we knew they were no longer the world's outstanding team. Yes, they have been deprived of Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander - and it is a shame that England did not have the chance to beat a full-strength South Africa - but that might not have made a difference. South Africa simply did not have the chance to get over their humbling in India and therefore carried the scars into this series. England had the opportunity to draw a line under their defeat against Pakistan in the UAE, a series where they far from disgraced themselves. Looking ahead, England have two home series in the summer that they should win. The last time Sri Lanka were in England, they won, so Alastair Cook has a score to settle there and some ranking points to win back. You never know which Pakistan will turn up, but England will again be favourites. They then go to Bangladesh, which will be good preparation for a formidable trip to India, the new world number ones. Then again, England won the last time they were there too. These things go in cycles and, in English cricket, we tend to look forward to the Ashes as a marker and a time to be judged. The next date with Australia is at the end of 2017, down under. Almost two years out, England look well-placed. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt	England's victory in the third Test against South Africa in Johannesburg was quite remarkable.
The Rams ended an eight-game winless Championship streak with a 3-1 comeback victory at Brentford on Saturday. Martin came off the bench with the Rams trailing 1-0 and helped create one goal before scoring the third - just his second goal in 19 games. "It's nice to finally contribute. I feel a lot lighter with that monkey off my back," Martin told BBC Radio Derby. "I have been a bit non-existent for the last couple of months." The 27-year-old's strike was his 10th league goal in 31 appearances, but only his second since finding the net against Huddersfield Town in October. But Martin said Derby would not be over-reacting after earning their first league win this year. Their last victory was a 2-0 success over Fulham on Boxing Day which took them top of the Championship table. "It's not a time to celebrate and dwell too much because the win should have come much earlier and we understand that," Martin said. "I don't necessarily think I am not contributing if I don't score, but the big thing is I want to contribute to winning performances and we hadn't managed to win in a long, long time. "The main feeling is elation and relief at winning the game. But it's not a time to really celebrate. "But this is a great lift. We have started the week extremely well and hopefully we can kick on again." Derby are at home against Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday and away to Wolves on Saturday.	Striker Chris Martin has described his input during Derby County's dismal recent run as a "bit non-existent".
The 20-year-old has played seven games for the Swans since making his £1.75m move to the Liberty Stadium from League Two Exeter City in January 2015. Grimes made his only Premier League start to date in September, having scored his first Swansea goal in the League Cup a month earlier. His last appearance came in their 3-2 FA Cup exit against League Two Oxford. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Blackburn Rovers have signed midfielder Matt Grimes from Premier League side Swansea on a three-month loan deal.
They include a new water sports park, railway station and a sliproad from the M77. The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.	Some of the first projects to be funded by the City Deal programme for the west of Scotland are to be discussed by councillors.
De Gea, 24, reportedly wants to move to Real Madrid with speculation over his future persisting all summer. "We've observed him in training and matches and he's not the David De Gea of last year," said Van Gaal. New signing Sergio Romero, 28, Anders Lindegaard, 31, or Sam Johnstone, 22, could replace De Gea. Lindegaard and Johnstone travelled on the club's summer US tour, but neither played for United last season. Lindegaard did not feature once in the previous campaign, while Johnstone has yet to make his United debut. United also have Victor Valdes, but the 33-year-old Spaniard has been made available for transfer after Van Gaal claimed he "refused to play" in the reserves. "De Gea tries and does his utmost best, but it's a difficult situation," added Van Gaal. "Now we have to play our first match and I want players who can focus only on the match and he is not capable to do that. "He shall not play." De Gea has made 175 appearances since joining United from Real's city rivals Atletico Madrid in 2011. United are believed to be holding out for a deal that includes Real defender Sergio Ramos coming to Old Trafford. Angel Di Maria has written an open letter to United supporters, following his £44.3m move to Paris St-Germain. The 27-year-old Argentina midfielder conceded his one season at Old Trafford "did not go well". "I can guarantee you it was not for trying," he said in his letter. Media playback is not supported on this device "I did my best but football is not like maths: often a lot of things out of our control affect the way we feel and the way things turn out. "I am sorry it did not work out as I would have wished in this amazing, huge club." Van Gaal, who will reportedly sign Barcelona's Pedro as a replacement, said Di Maria's exit would be a "big loss". But the United boss suggested Di Maria may have struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League. "I want more attackers with speed and creativity," he said. "Di Maria is one of those players so we have to look for that kind of player, but they have to have the talent to cope with the English rhythm and that's difficult to find. "That's why players are not having success in this competition - because of the rhythm of the game and the English culture is a different culture to the Latin culture." Red Devils winger Ashley Young has signed a new deal until 2018, with the option of a further year. The 30-year-old England international has made 115 appearances and scored 13 goals since joining from Aston Villa for a reported £17m in 2011. Van Gaal described Young as a "multi-functional player" who "flourished" last season. Young said: "The spirit and motivation amongst this team is very high and we are all determined to make this a season to remember." New signing Bastian Schweinsteiger will not play against Spurs, with Van Gaal saying he lacks match fitness. There were concerns raised over the German's condition after Pep Guardiola, his boss at Bayern Munich, said the 31-year-old midfielder had not been fully fit for three years. "Schweinsteiger came to us at the last moment, out of his holidays," said Van Gaal. "I don't think he's fit enough, so we have to build him to the fitness I think he needs." Argentina defender Marcos Rojo is also not expected to start against Spurs.	Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal says keeper David De Gea is not "capable" of playing in Saturday's season opener against Tottenham.
Scientists in London created an artificial windpipe which was then coated in stem cells from the patient. Crucially, the technique does not need a donor, and there is no risk of the organ being rejected. The surgeons stress a windpipe can also be made within days. The 36-year-old cancer patient is doing well a month after the operation. Professor Paolo Macchiarini from Italy led the pioneering surgery, which took place at the Karolinska University Hospital. In an interview with the BBC, he said he now hopes to use the technique to treat a nine-month-old child in Korea who was born with a malformed windpipe or trachea. Professor Macchiarini already has 10 other windpipe transplants under his belt - most notably the world's first tissue-engineered tracheal transplant in 2008 on 30-year-old Spanish woman Claudia Costillo - but all required a donor. The key to the latest technique is modelling a structure or scaffold that is an exact replica of the patient's own windpipe, removing the need for a donor organ. To do this he enlisted the help of UK experts who were given 3D scans of the 36-year-old African patient, Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene. The geology student currently lives in Iceland where he is studying for a PhD. Using these images, the scientists at University College London were able to craft a perfect copy of Mr Beyene's trachea and two main bronchi out of glass. This was then flown to Sweden and soaked in a solution of stem cells taken from the patient's bone marrow. After two days, the millions of holes in the porous windpipe had been seeded with the patient's own tissue. Dr Alex Seifalian and his team used this fragile structure to create a replacement for the patient, whose own windpipe was ravaged by an inoperable tumour. Despite aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the cancer had grown to the size of a golf ball and was blocking his breathing. Without a transplant he would have died. During a 12-hour operation Professor Macchiarini removed all of the tumour and the diseased windpipe and replaced it with the tailor-made replica. The bone marrow cells and lining cells taken from his nose, which were also implanted during the operation, were able to divide and grow, turning the inert windpipe scaffold into an organ indistinguishable from a normal healthy one. And, importantly, Mr Beyene's body will accept it as its own, meaning he will not need to take the strong anti-rejection drugs that other transplant patients have to. Professor Macchiarini said this was the real breakthrough. "Thanks to nanotechnology, this new branch of regenerative medicine, we are now able to produce a custom-made windpipe within two days or one week. "This is a synthetic windpipe. The beauty of this is you can have it immediately. There is no delay. This technique does not rely on a human donation." He said many other organs could be repaired or replaced in the same way. A month on from his operation, Mr Beyene is still looking weak, but well. Sitting up in his hospital bed, he said: "I was very scared, very scared about the operation. But it was live or die." He says he is looking forward to getting back to Iceland to finish his studies and then returning to his home in Eritrea where he will be reunited with his wife and young family, and meet his new three-month-old child. He says he is eternally grateful to the medical team that has saved his life.	Surgeons in Sweden have carried out the world's first synthetic organ transplant.
The company had been chosen by KPMG as preferred bidders last month. Ferguson, which went into administration with the loss of 70 jobs, will be renamed Ferguson Marine Engineering. Mr McColl has promised to upgrade facilities at the Port Glasgow yard and seek work in the renewables sector. He also hopes to grow the workforce from its pre-administration level of 77 to 120 people. Joint administrator Blair Nimmo said: "It is extremely pleasing to secure the sale of Ferguson Shipbuilders in such a short timeframe and to buyers who can see the potential in the business and its skilled workforce. "We would like to thank those employees, and all parties with an interest in Ferguson Shipbuilders, including various government agencies, for their patience and support during this period. "We would also like to wish Clyde Blowers Capital every success for the future. "As new owners they have an ambitious vision to build on its heritage and grow a successful shipbuilding and marine engineering business on the Clyde." Mr McColl said: "We are pleased to have completed the purchase of Ferguson's and are excited by its potential to grow into a leading marine engineering business." He added: "Work is now well underway to develop a plan to rebuild Ferguson's, and we look forward to working with the key stakeholders in that rebuilding process."	Administrators have confirmed the sale of Ferguson Shipbuilders in Inverclyde to businessman Jim McColl's firm, Clyde Blowers Capital.
The former Hearts captain recently left Leeds, having moved to Elland Road last summer despite a trial at Rangers. "I'm excited to come here from Leeds and on the first day it felt like it was the right decision," Zaliukas told the club's website. "It's a brilliant stadium and it's going to be fun to play here." Zaliukas played more than 200 times for Hearts over seven years, but made just 15 appearances for Leeds last term. His first competitive match for Rangers could be against Hibs in the Challenge Cup on 5 August. The Ibrox outfit's first Scottish Championship fixture of the campaign is against Hearts at Ibrox on 10 August. "I think the Championship is going to be a very interesting league because Hearts and Hibs are in here, and even Falkirk and Queen of the South are going to be tough teams," the 30-year-old added. "I think our squad could compete straight away in the Premiership, everyone is experienced and top players. I think we are going to have a very good squad." Rangers have also added former St Mirren defender Darren McGregor to their ranks this summer.	Lithuanian defender Marius Zaliukas has signed a two-year contract with Rangers, after impressing during a trial with the Ibrox club.
The public vote, which is called a referendum, will happen on Thursday 23 June 2016. Here is Newsround's guide to what has been going on between the UK and the European Union. Back in 2013, British Prime Minister David Cameron promised that if his political party, the Conservatives, won the next general election, then he would let voters have their say on whether or not the UK should stay in or leave the European Union. Last year, they won the election so it's all systems go. A referendum is a vote in which all adults can take part, normally giving a "Yes" or "No" answer to a question. Whichever side gets more than half of the votes wins. The European Union, or EU, is a group of 28 countries in Europe whose governments work together. It began after World War Two with the idea that the best chance of stopping another war was by countries working more closely together. It's a bit like a club. To join you have to agree to follow the rules and in return you get certain benefits. Each country has to pay money to be a member, which they mostly do through taxes. The EU uses the money to change the way people live and do business in Europe. It has its own parliament, which is made up of politicians called Members of the European Parliament. They are elected by people who live in European Union countries. One of the main jobs of the parliament is to change, approve or reject laws that apply to all EU countries. 1957: Belgium, France, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg 1973: Denmark, Ireland and the UK 1981: Greece 1986: Portugal and Spain 1995: Austria, Finland and Sweden 2004: Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus 2007: Bulgaria and Romania 2013: Croatia One major reason the European Union was set up is trade: to make it easier for countries to buy and sell things to each other. Certain rules to do with immigration have been relaxed too - so people from EU countries can move around more freely inside the Union. EU laws affect many areas of our lives - like how many hours we're allowed to work in a week, health and safety rules, and even how many fish we're allowed to catch. For the 40 years that the UK's been a member of the EU, there's been a debate about our role within it. Some feel being part of this bigger club makes the UK richer and more important. Others argue that the EU takes power away from Britain. They feel that people who aren't British shouldn't be making laws for this country. They also feel it costs Britain too much money. The question is always important in any referendum. The question for voters will be "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?" There are many reasons, but a big one is that some people believe Britain is being held back by the EU, which they say forces too many rules on the UK. They also want Britain to limit the number of people coming here to work from other European countries. They believe Britain gets a big boost from being a member of European Union - it makes buying and selling things to other EU countries easier. They also believe Britain is stronger as part of a big club than on its own.	The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said people should be able to vote on whether the UK should be a member of the European Union (EU).
Prof Allyson Pollock and colleagues at Queen Mary University of London say the contact sport is too dangerous. They do not want an outright ban but say the sport must change and safeguards are needed. The Rugby Football Union said steps had been taken to make the sport safer. The RFU says the physical and social benefits that rugby offers to children "massively outweigh any potential drawbacks" and that myriad safety measures are already in place. These include the provision of a safe environment through investment in pitches and facilities, ensuring adequate first aid and medical facilities, and fully training coaches in methods to prevent injuries to young players. Ministers also want to see more children taking up sport. In 2012, then Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt announced a plan to link up thousands of schools with rugby clubs. But Prof Pollock fears there are not enough safety checks and measures to support this, meaning children could get hurt. She wants to see an increase in the recording of injuries and better injury prevention analysis.  She claims that, compared with New Zealand, the UK has few strategies to protect players. Each season, children have about a one in 10 chance of getting injured badly enough that they need at least seven days off the pitch. Some injuries are minor, but others can cause permanent disability. Most rugby injuries occur during the tackle, as players collide at speed. But scrums are the most dangerous part of play, where some of the most serious injuries occur, Prof Pollock and colleagues say in their report in the British Medical Journal. Concussion and spinal trauma are the big concerns. Some injuries can prove fatal - as the Robinson family from County Antrim know only too well after their 14-year-old son, Ben, died having been hurt in a school rugby match in 2011. He collapsed at the end of that match after he was involved in a series of heavy tackles. An inquest heard that the teenager died from brain injuries. Prof Pollock says not enough is being done to put in place injury monitoring and prevention strategies - and little is known about what really works. "Only by collecting injury data and by providing feedback to individuals and organisations working on safety initiatives will the short - and long-term impact of injury prevention programmes, whether for rugby or any other sport, be known," she said. She added some measures - such as matching child rugby players by size rather than age, playing only non-contact matches and having fewer players on the pitch at any one time - may help reduce the frequency of the most severe injuries. The RFU says set-phase play such as scrums and line-outs are introduced gradually, according to a child's rugby development, with scrums initially only containing three players per side and are uncontested. An RFU spokesman said: "We take player safety extremely seriously, and this is at the core of all the training we deliver to coaches, referees and medics, at all levels of the game. "Rugby for young people at schools or clubs in England exists in different forms, both contact and non-contact. "Significant work has been undertaken over a number of years to develop new rules of play to ensure maximum possible safety, with a structured progression to cover the introduction, playing, teaching and refereeing of the game from under-seven to under-18." A government spokesman said: "Player safety in schools and at all levels of sport is absolutely paramount and sports governing bodies and the government are completely committed to it. "The rugby governing bodies work hard to ensure the sport in schools is played as safely as possible and that young people reap the benefits of participating - boosting their health, self-esteem and encouraging teamwork."	A government drive to boost participation in rugby in English schools is ill-conceived and risks children getting seriously hurt, public health doctors have warned.
BBC Sport takes a look at five things you might have missed in the EFL on the last full match day before the festive season. There were six late winning goals in the Championship on Saturday, all with ramifications in the race for promotion and the bid to avoid relegation. Brighton's Glenn Murray headed home in the fifth minute of stoppage time against Birmingham City to ensure the Seagulls will spend Christmas eight points clear of third-placed Reading. Jaap Stam's men had looked like having to settle for a point at Blackburn before George Evans hit an injury-time winner to move them back up to third. Yorkshire rivals Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday ensured they would spend Christmas in the top six thanks to winners in the 89th minute and stoppage time against Brentford and Rotherham respectively. Meanwhile, 23rd-placed Wigan were set to take a point from their home game against Ipswich before David McGoldrick popped up with an 88th-minute winner for Mick McCarthy's men. Match of the day in the second tier must go to Barnsley's 4-3 win at Cardiff. The Bluebirds led in the third minute before trailing 3-1 at half-time. Peter Whittingham and Antony Pilkington's 89th-minute strike seemed to have given Neil Warnock's side an unlikely point but Ryan Williams scored in the fifth minute of injury time to make it a happy journey back to South Yorkshire for the Tykes. Well, maybe not quite miracles but it's probably fair to say neither Wes Brown nor Isaiah Osbourne would have been fancied by many to get on the scoresheet today. Former Manchester United and Sunderland man Brown, 37, scored on his Blackburn Rovers debut to level the match against the Royals. It counted for nothing in the end thanks to Reading's late winner but it was Brown's first goal since netting for Sunderland in December 2011. Walsall midfielder Osbourne only had to wait a shade over three years to end his scoring drought. The ex-Aston Villa player opened his account for the Saddlers to give them a point against Bradford City. He'll probably be pleased this goal meant a little more than his last one which opened the scoring for Blackpool against Derby in December 2013. The Rams went on to win 5-1. Yeovil boss Darren Way, assistant Terry Skiverton and the 18-strong match-day squad put £300 behind the bar at Carlisle as a 'thank you' to fans for making the long trek north. "Special mention must go to the supporters because how far they've travelled to watch this game is unbelievable commitment," Way told BBC Somerset. "This is beyond the end of the Earth. I just hope they feel that the players gave everything and they can be proud of their team." Travelling Glovers fans certainly seemed appreciative as they tweeted the club with pictures of pies and pints. Sadly for the 96 Yeovil fans who made the 660-mile round trip to Brunton Park, the hosts were not in such a generous mood, with the Cumbrians claiming a 2-1 win. Roll the clock back to 27 September and Bury are celebrating their sixth league win of the season and sit second in League One. The following 16 games have brought a sum total of zero victories and the Shakers have slumped into the relegation zone. David Flitcroft was sacked after presiding over seven consecutive league defeats but replacement Chris Brass, given the job until the end of the season on Thursday, has fared little better, losing his first five matches. Bury twice took the lead at home to Oxford on Saturday but were pegged back on each occasion by a Chris Maguire free-kick before a Greg Leigh own goal gave the U's victory. "We've got to dig in and fight a little bit harder than we are right now to keep the ball out of the net," Brass told BBC Radio Manchester. It's been a tough start to the season for Exeter City and their match-going regulars. Going into today's game against Mansfield, the Grecians had claimed a healthy seven wins away from home but were the only team in the EFL yet to taste success on their own turf. Paul Tisdale's side ended their wait for a win at St James Park, which dated back to April, with a 2-0 win over the Stags thanks to a double from Ollie Watkins. "I'm delighted," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon. "It had to come at some point and we did it today. It was hard work and the boys have deserved it against a really strong team. "They put us under pressure in the second half and in many respects outplayed us but we stuck to it and 2-0 is a great feeling."

They say that Christmas is the time for charity but there are going to be a few football managers across the country wishing their players had not been quite so generous this year.
Thomas Sargent was on his Yamaha Fazer motorbike on Bolton Road, Withnell, on Sunday afternoon when he was involved in a collision with a Volvo car. He was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital, where he later died. His family described him as a "quiet, enthusiastic, caring and loving man" with a "real passion for motorcycles". Paying tribute, they said: "He had just celebrated his 21st birthday by touring Europe on his Yamaha motorbike. "He died doing something he loved and is now at peace and resting with his Grandma. He will be dearly missed by everybody that knew him and will never be forgotten." Police are urging witnesses of the collision to get in touch.	A man killed in a crash in Chorley had recently returned from a motorbike tour of Europe as part of his 21st birthday celebrations.
Hythe Ferry runs between Hythe and Southampton, serviced by a train which runs along a 640m (2,000ft) pier. The presenter lent his support to a community group's aim to take over the management of the pier and train. Its current operator said numbers using the ferry had been falling. Earlier this year, Hythe Ferry Ltd warned staff about possible redundancies, having suffered a "year-on-year decline" in passenger numbers and faced with higher operating costs. More than 9,000 people have signed a petition calling for the service to be saved. Peter King, of the Hythe Hythe Pier Train and Ferry Action Group, said members wanted to create a "viable modern ferry" by a charitable trust taking over the management of the Victorian pier and "relieving" the ferry operators of the costs of maintaining it. He said a redevelopment project could cost £2-3m but a trust would be able to access other sources of finance, including lottery grants. Mr Snow said: "This train is the oldest running pier train anywhere in the world, so I'm campaigning to keep it open. We need to do everything we can to keep this extraordinary piece of our past running."	A Hampshire pier and ferry service facing an uncertain future is a "national treasure" which should be saved, television historian Dan Snow has said.
The hosts had Josh Passley dismissed for bringing down Garry Thompson before Wycombe went ahead when Paul Hayes fired home Paris Cowan-Hall's ball. Thompson later saw red for a challenge on Joss Labadie and the Daggers drew level through Luke Guttridge's tap in. Wycombe won it when Cowan-Hall headed over keeper Mark Cousins from close in. Dagenham remain in the relegation places, while Wycombe move up to sixth spot, above Leyton Orient on goal difference. Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "I know that we're capable that we're winning four or five games together. The side's getting stronger. "The power in the team is beginning to come through. We showed good quality." "As long as we keep to the pattern that we're working to, I think the rest will slip into place. There's so much good stuff, so much energy in our team today. We went down to ten men and you wouldn't have noticed."	Wycombe moved in to the League Two play-off places with victory at lowly Dagenham & Redbridge in a game where both sides had a man sent off.
The city council says 500 self-service bikes will be located across the city from April 2017. A previous pilot scheme, which saw 70 bikes installed at 10 locations, ended in 2011. Ramesh Patel, Cabinet Member for Transport, Planning and Sustainability, said: "The new scheme intends to be far larger that the initial pilot scheme. "The bikes will be based at a number of easily accessed sites including hire stations at district centres, universities and other strategic locations close to existing public transport facilities." The council wants to secure a provider to supply, maintain and operate the scheme, which it says, will be financed through sponsorship income and at no cost to the taxpayer. 'Boris bikes' were launched in London in 2010, with bikes being hired from any docking station using debit or credit cards. They can later be returned to any empty docking point. The scheme has since been rolled out to a number of cities across the country.	Cardiff is to get a public bicycle hire scheme based on London's "Boris bikes".
Gerard Kevin Hughes, 29, and Gavin Martin Hughes, 31, who are both from Springfield Park in Belfast, appeared in court alongside their older brother Joseph Christopher Hughes, 35, from The Meadows in Downpatrick. The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast. Regarding the drugs seizures in October 2013, Gavin Hughes pleaded guilty to five charges, including possessing cocaine with intent to supply. He was handed a four-year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison, with the remaining three years on licence upon his release. His brother Gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in August and October 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years. Half of this sentence will be spent in jail, with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison. Joseph Hughes, who pleaded guilty to a single charge of possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was given a three-year sentence. Six months of this will be spent in jail, with the remaining 30 months on supervised licence upon his release.	Three brothers from Belfast have been jailed for drugs offences linked to a significant seizure of cocaine.
AJ MacGinty landed four penalties and cross-code star Denny Solomona traded scores with Kai Horstmann to leave the visitors 19-5 ahead after 34 minutes. But Luke Cowan-Dickie's try just before the break kept the Chiefs in touch. Olly Woodburn and Don Armand crossed after half-time to earn a bonus point and keep Exeter second in the table. Rob Baxter's side are now level on points with leaders Wasps, who play Worcester Warriors on Sunday, while reigning champions Saracens in third host fifth-placed Bath. Exeter's victory over Sale Sharks, however, was far from straightforward in blustery conditions in Devon. Playing with their wind at their backs in the first half, the Sharks were good value for their lead, with MacGinty reliable from the tee and wing Solomona's ninth try in eight Premiership games putting them ahead. But Exeter, who had England wing Jack Nowell back from Six Nations duty, scored two tries during the first 40 minutes to keep them in contention. And, with conditions on their side after half-time, they managed two further scores to wrap up a bonus-point victory and ensure they bounced back from last week's Anglo-Welsh Cup final defeat by Leicester Tigers. Exeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter: "I can't be happy at us playing at that level and we need to shake ourselves up for the remainder the season. "We were disrupted in the first half and threw careless passes, which made it difficult for ourselves - and had we not scored just before interval the mountain may have been too high to climb. "This was a real wake-up call for us as Sale have worried us in the past and we weren't ready for them." Sale Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond: "I'm disappointed we didn't win the game but I'm satisfied with the bonus point as we had a blip against Northampton in our last league game, when we didn't turn up. "Exeter are a good side and the try we conceded just before half-time was probably crucial, but we made a couple of basic errors at vital times. "I'm pleased we stopped them playing, as they thought they could just kick to the corners and score but our line-out defence was very good and I'm happy that we had them thinking outside the box." Exeter: Dollman; Nowell, Whitten, Devoto, Woodburn; Slade, Townsend; Moon, Cowan-Dickie, Williams, Lees, Parling, Horstmann, Armand (capt), Waldrom. Replacements: Yeandle, Rimmer, Francis, J Hill, S Simmonds, Maunder, J Simmonds, Short. Sale: Haley; Solomona, James, Jennings, McGuigan; MacGinty, Phillips; Harrison, Webber, Aulika, Evans, Ostrikov, Neild, T Curry, Beamont (capt). Replacements: B Curry, Flynn, Longbottom, Nott, Pearce, Stringer, Bedlow, Charnley. For the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.	Exeter came from 14 points down to beat Sale Sharks at Sandy Park and boost their hopes of securing a home semi-final in the Premiership play-offs.
Xiaoyu Zaijia - or Little Fish - responds to voice commands using a combination of pictures, text and speech. Unlike many rival AIs it is dependant on a touchscreen It can answer questions, find local services, play music, make video calls and control smart home devices. Baidu Chief Scientist Andrew Ng said that artificial intelligence is "the new electricity". "AI has been growing steadily - every year our AI has been 50% better," he told the BBC at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. "Those of us on the inside feel the acceleration now but we have been feeling it for the last decade. "Just as 100 years ago the electrification of our society transformed industry after industry, I think AI tech has now reached that stage." Little Fish's hardware has been developed by Chinese robotics firm Ainemo Inc but uses Baidu's AI operating system DuerOS. Follow all our CES coverage at bbc.co.uk/ces2017 Existing digital assistants such as the Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant are not screen-dependant but can be used by voice alone. Apple's Siri, however, continues to rely on a display to provide some of its information. Little Fish will launch initially in China in March 2017 and currently only recognises Chinese languages. Baidu has not yet set a price. "What we have seen so far in terms of digital assistants and smart speakers is very much first generation and it has all been about voice," said Geoff Blaber, tech analyst at CCS Insight. "I would certainly expect that over the next 12 months we will see the next iteration of assistants that do integrate a number of different ways of interacting with the device - not just video but also gesture control. "A richer variety of interaction methods helps bridge the gap in terms of the user experience. When they first start using one, a lot of users find it a steep learning curve."	Chinese search giant Baidu has unveiled an AI digital assistant.
The 31-year-old Falcons academy graduate won three Premiership titles with Leicester in his nine years away from Kingston Park. Flood, who has been capped 60 times by England, said: "When the opportunity came on to the table, it didn't take long for me to make the decision. "It really feels like I'm coming home, and I've watched a fair amount of Newcastle's games in recent months." Falcons, who have now made 10 signings for the 2017-18 season, did not disclose the length of Flood's contract. Flood, who made his Premiership debut for Newcastle in 2005, spent six season with Leicester where he went on to become club captain. He has spent the past three seasons in the French top flight with Toulouse. Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards said: "Toby is a proven performer at the very top level, he is a local lad and it is a huge boost for us to be able to add a player of his quality to our squad. "He has vast leadership experience, he will bring an extra dimension to our game and this really is a signing which outlines the ambition we have to rise even further up the Premiership table." Newcastle won their final match of the Premiership season on Saturday, beating relegated Bristol 39-27 to finish eighth in the table. "We have quality players coming through our academy and a number of major new signings joining us," Richards added. "All the signs are really positive for next season and it is a hugely exciting time to be involved with the club."	Newcastle have re-signed fly-half Toby Flood from French side Toulouse.
Calls to reward them for their heroics are coming from politicians along with news and social media. Suspect Jaber al-Bakr gave elite commandos the slip over the weekend, sparking a two-day manhunt. Police believe Mr Bakr was planning to bomb a Berlin airport. The country's best-selling daily newspaper Bild dubbed the refugee trio the "Syrian heroes of Leipzig". Politicians from across the spectrum recommended them for the Federal Cross of Merit, a rank in Germany's civilian honours system. Ansgar Heveling, chairman of the parliamentary committee on interior affairs, went a step further and called on them to be granted asylum. Fellow Syrian refugees have also taken to social media to praise their compatriots. Police had been watching Mr Bakr, 22, for months, but he evaded police surveillance on Saturday in the eastern German city of Chemnitz, just as the authorities were preparing to storm an apartment where he was staying. Mr Bakr, who is also Syrian, made his way south to Leipzig and asked for help and shelter from the trio, who later recognised Mr Bakr as a suspect after seeing police's appeals for information in Arabic on Facebook. They quickly overpowered the fugitive, tied him up, and called police. "I was furious with him, I couldn't accept something like this - especially here in Germany, the country that opened its doors to us," one of the men told RTL Television. The three have not been identifying over fear of reprisals. A little more than 200,000 people arrived in Germany to seek asylum in the first nine months of this year - a significant reduction from 2015, the country's interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said. Last year, 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in the country, less than the one million originally estimated.	There is a growing clamour in Germany to honour three Syrian refugees who overpowered a bomb plot suspect with possible links to the so-called Islamic State.
Bernard Hender, 19, and Doug McTavish, 39, died in the blaze above a funeral director's office in Llanrwst, Conwy county, in October 2014. The Abergele inquest is examining if a Hotpoint dryer caused the fire. On Thursday, a fire engineer told the hearing there was "no compelling evidence" it started in the dryer but he could not rule it out. Clifford Christie, a member of the Institute of Fire Engineers, was asked to look into the cause of the fire by domestic appliance company Whirlpool. Giving evidence on the second day of the hearing, he said the dryer was "severely damaged" by fire but some components on the machine were intact. Mr Christie said he was "satisfied" it had not started in the timer, the motor or the drum, and there was no accumulation of lint in the machine. But he said he could not rule out that it started in the machine's starter switch, which was not recovered following the blaze. He also told the hearing it was possible there was a fault in an iron kept in the same room. He said evidence given to the inquest on Wednesday that the iron was switched off might have been "mistaken". On Wednesday, a tenant who lived in the flat spoke of surviving the fire. Garry Lloyd Jones, 50, told the inquest: "I just remember walking down the corridor to see what was going on and seeing flames coming out of the tumble dryer. "I went down to the living area and went to the kitchen and there was nothing there but when I looked out of the kitchen window I could see an orange glow." Notices had previously been issued by Whirlpool telling customers to unplug Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit models manufactured between 2004 and 2015 after a potential fire risk was identified. The inquest continues.	A tumble dryer could "not be ruled out" as the cause of a flat fire in which two men died, an inquest has heard.
The 59-year-old was the first American to manage a Premier League club, but lasted just 85 days before being sacked by the Swans in December 2016. They won just two of the former USA and Egypt manager's 11 games in charge. Los Angeles, who are led by an ownership group of 27 people including Hollywood actor Will Ferrell, will join the MLS for the 2017-18 season.

The Portuguese defender's quick-fire brace put the Bees in control at Brisbane Road before Curtis Weston sealed the points in added time after Paul McCallum had halved the deficit. Santos, a recent signing from Peterborough, seized on a fumble by O's goalkeeper Alex Cisak to break the deadlock from close range in the 63rd minute and he doubled the advantage three minutes later following good work from Nana Kyei. McCallum gave the O's a lifeline when he powerfully headed in a Callum Kennedy corner with 10 minutes remaining but Weston guaranteed the three points when he crashed the ball into an empty net after a lob from substitute Jamal Campbell-Ryce rebounded off the crossbar. Although the teams went into the interval all-square, the visitors should have been well ahead having missed five clear chances, and leading scorer John Akinde was the main culprit for their profligacy. His best chance came after just four minutes when he stabbed wide from close range with the goal at his mercy. Fellow striker Simeon Akinola spurned two straight-forward chances set up by Akinde as the home side struggled to contain the Bees' attacking threat. However, an incisive display after the break deservedly earned the visitors their sixth victory in eight matches. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Leyton Orient 1, Barnet 3.

Strachan has indicated a willingness to cap some of the country's young talents as he begins preparations for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. Some of BBC Scotland's football analysts, all of whom have played for Scotland, give their thoughts on which players deserve the chance to impress the national manager in Prague and Glasgow later this month. Position: Central midfield Age: 24 Experience: A product of the Aberdeen youth system and has been capped up until under-21 level. Former Aberdeen defender, manager and director Miller said: "He's got everything you need to make the step up from club to international level. "In that defensive midfield role, he has great composure, a good touch, he doesn't get flustered and he's happy to take the ball in tight areas. "At a young age, he's been given the captaincy of a title-challenging team, which he's handled well and he plays an extremely prominent role in a very good Aberdeen side." Position: Central midfield Age: 21 Experience: Came through the youth ranks with St Mirren before switching to Championship rivals Hibernian after the Paisley's club's relegation last summer and is a regular for Scotland Under-21s. Former Dundee United, Rangers, Cardiff City and Burnley striker Thompson said of his former Buddies team-mate: "I've known him since he made his debut for St Mirren and it looks as though this season he's really turned from a boy to a man. "He's physically stronger and he now has the belief and confidence that he's a top midfielder. "He's the complete midfielder: he can tackle and be combative but also creative, with driving, surging runs. "Despite only being 21, he's played more than 100 league games, so he's got great experience and has managed to maintain a level of consistency throughout this season." Position: Left-back Age: 18 Experience: Has not even represented Scotland beyond under-19 level as yet but burst into the Celtic first-team from their youth ranks this season and ousted Honduras international Emilio Izaguirre from the left full-back position with the Scottish champions. Former Dundee United, Celtic, Bristol City and Dumbarton right-back Wilson said: "He may only have played 23 times for Celtic, but at 18 he's been a real stand-out in a lot of those games and, if you're a stand-out at Celtic, that speaks volumes. "Given the pressure and scrutiny they're under, he's stood up to the challenge and, even in European games, he's been the man of the match. "He has a great engine; he can get from goal-line to goal-line and, unlike a lot of young full-backs, he hasn't sacrificed the defensive part of his game just to concentrate on the attacking aspect. "There are a lot of similarities with Andy Robertson in that he can make a tackle at one end and then be putting in a quality cross at the other within seconds - and he's got quite a number of assists already." Position: Winger Age: 22 Experience: Has played for Scotland at all youth levels after coming through the youth ranks with Hearts and has recently returned from long-term injury to resume his place in the first team at Tynecastle. Former Manchester United, Nottingham Forest, Hearts, Hibernian, Genclerbirligi and Charlton Athletic midfielder Stewart said: "Unfortunately, he's missed a chunk of the season through injury, but he's come back and hit the ground running with three goals in three games. "He's an exciting talent who has the ability to unlock defences with his dribbling skills and also his vision. "At 22, he is now becoming a mainstay of the Hearts team and is at the perfect age to try to get into the senior Scotland squad and continue his progress."	Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is to announce two squads this week for the forthcoming friendly internationals against the Czech Republic and Denmark.
London's first Lumiere festival will feature illuminations and animations projected at 20 locations in the West End and Kings Cross over four nights. Julian Opie will be among more than two dozen artists taking part. The Durham version has been running since 2009 and attracted 175,000 people in 2013. Almost 180,000 turned out when producers Artichoke staged a Lumiere in Londonderry when it was UK City of Culture the same year. The London event will take place from 14-17 January. Mayor Boris Johnson said it would be "a dazzling new festival for the capital" that would "expel the post-Christmas blues". The first artists to be confirmed for London are: Artichoke director Helen Marriage said: "Lumiere was born in Durham and its incredible success has been recognised across the world. Lumiere London will be a very different event with its own artistic programme, but the principles remain the same." This year's Lumiere will take place in Durham from 12-15 November.	A major festival of light art is to be staged in London next year by the people who organise the biennial Lumiere festival in Durham.
The UK must go further to ensure those settling learn English "so they can be more integrated into our country". Asked about the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron said the last government had made progress on the issue, but more had to be done. He agreed parents should be responsible for making sure children speak English. Conservative MP for Keighley Kris Hopkins asked if the PM agreed that there was "a responsibility and an obligation" on parents to make sure their children can speak English when they start school. Mr Cameron replied: "I completely agree... in too many cases this isn't happening." Since last autumn, people from outside the EU applying for a visa to join their spouse or partner now have to prove they have a basic command of English before their application is approved. Previously, visa applicants had to show only that their marriage or partnership was genuine and that they could financially support themselves. The prime minister told the Commons: "The last government did make some progress on making sure people learnt English when they came to our country, I think we need to go further. "If you look at the figures for the number of people who are brought over as husbands and wives, particularly from the Indian sub-continent, we should be putting in place - and we will be putting in place -  tougher rules to make sure they do learn English and so when they come, if they come, they can be more integrated into our country." The weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions was dominated by foreign affairs with Labour leader Ed Miliband focusing all his six questions on events in Egypt and the UK's mission in Afghanistan. Mr Miliband, who visited Afghanistan for the first time as Labour leader last week, paid an extended tribute to soldiers' work there, acknowledged the difference in the Commons session from the normal political point scoring. Mr Cameron welcomed the opportunity to have a "serious conversation" about the work of British soldiers in Afghanistan, saying they wanted politicians to discuss their efforts, although he also noted  many MPs often "preferred a bunfight" about domestic issues.	David Cameron has said too many children from immigrant families are not able to speak English when they start at school.
Karlovic, 35, served 21 aces as the world number one struggled to control his ground strokes in high winds. In the semi-finals, Karlovic will face Spain's David Ferrer, who overcame Germany's Dustin Brown 6-2 6-2. Third seed Tomas Berdych from the Czech Republic will face Italy's Andreas Seppi in the other semi. Berdych saw off France's Richard Gasquet 6-2 6-1, while Seppi enjoyed a 7-5 6-4 victory over Ivan Dodig of Croatia. But the day belonged to world ranked 27 Karlovic, who recorded his second career win over the Serb having also triumphed at the Madrid Masters in 2008. Djokovic was nevertheless twice within two points of winning the match in the second set tie-breaker, before dropping serve in the seventh game of the final set. Karlovic said: "I was feeling good despite the wind. I know he wasn't able to show his full range. "I was relaxed and didn't feel I had to do anything extraordinary. I just had to focus on my game."	Novak Djokovic suffered a surprise loss against Croatia's Ivo Karlovic 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 in the Qatar Open quarter-finals in Doha.
It effectively completes the four-year-old software's transformation from a "lightweight" chat app, spun off from the main Facebook site, into a fully-fledged "platform" of its own. More than 40 new add-on apps have already been developed so far. But one expert said there was a risk Messenger would become bloated. Messenger has already proved controversial with some users of the social network, who have complained about having to switch between two apps to stay in touch with their Facebook friends. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the move at his firm's F8 developers conference in San Francisco. He said more than 600 million people already used Messenger at least once a month to express themselves, and that allowing other social networks and services to directly post to it would make "conversations better". Among the new apps unveiled are ways to post: It builds on a move to allow US-based users to send money to and from each other via Messenger, which Facebook announced last week, and the earlier inclusion of Voip (voice over internet protocol) calls and stickers. Mr Zuckerberg also revealed plans to launch an associated service called Businesses on Messenger. Using the app instead of email, the public will be able to hold conversations with companies from which they buy goods, or have other interactions with. Facebook suggested this could include receiving delivery status updates, organising the return of an order and asking follow-up questions. The company is far from the first to attempt to turn a messaging app into a wider platform. China's WeChat service has gone even further by allowing its users to book taxis, pick cinema seats and find nearby restaurants among other actions. But one expert suggested Facebook should be cautious about the rate at which it adds further facilities to Messenger. "There's a potential risk that they are going to overload Messenger with too many functions and none of them become that important - it really depends on how extensive they get with the features that they add over time," said Brian Blau from the Gartner tech consultancy. "We have seen something like that happen with Facebook's Timeline, where you have all these different people competing for your attention. "So, Facebook won't want to over-bloat, but it could enable all kinds of interesting scenarios where you can integrate messaging with other apps and services." Right now many of the Messenger apps look fun, if a bit gimmicky. But over time these new interactions will give Facebook another source of rich information about a user's interests - and thereby the potential to attract more ad revenue. Facebook would have taken inspiration from companies like China's WeChat and Japan's Line, which have proven successful in building both content and business services atop their core messenger offerings. But Messenger for Business is an ambitious plan. It is asking users to supplant more tried-and-tested means like email. Other communications behemoths like Skype tried - unsuccessfully - to become places to reinvent communications between businesses and their customers. Will users be happy to shift their business interactions over to Facebook - a platform where, until now, they have been used to dealing primarily with friends? Other announcements made at F8 included:	Facebook has confirmed that it is opening up its Messenger service to third-party developers, allowing them to add functions of their own.
Salman Ramadan Abedi, 22, detonated a homemade device in the foyer of Manchester Arena following an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. The five-minute hearing was adjourned until 1 December, pending the police investigation. Twenty-two people were killed in the arena attack. No members of Abedi's family were present at court, which was sitting at Manchester Town Hall. A full inquest will be heard once the police investigation into the attack has been completed. The court heard Abedi died of "multiple injuries" when he detonated an improvised explosive device. He was later identified by genetic markers and his bank card that was found nearby, the court heard. The inquests for the victims were opened with a minute's silence on 9 June and adjourned until November. Coroner Nigel Meadows said the victims' inquests, at Manchester Civil Justice Centre, would be adjourned until 24 November and this was a "holding date" which could be moved if the police investigation was still ongoing. The hearing on 9 June was shown a photograph of each of the victims and told of their injuries. Those who died were aged between eight and 51. A map of where 19 of those killed in the foyer was also shown to the hearing.  The court heard a further three - John Atkinson, Georgina Callander and Saffie Roussos - died later in hospital. Some of those who died were standing very close to the bomber, with others as far as 20m (66ft) away. A further 116 people were injured in the attack.	An inquest into the death of the Manchester suicide bomber heard how he was identified by DNA, fingerprint and dental records.
Photos on the internet appear to show Diouf in a nightclub, just hours before the match at Southampton on 24 March. "I've made some inquiries and I've asked him about it and he denies he was there," Saunders told Radio Sheffield. "It's still ongoing and I want to get to the bottom of it. It's something I can't comprehend if it is true." Rovers lost the match at St Mary's 2-0, with Diouf playing the full game, and are currently six points adrift of safety with six matches to play. Diouf has scored six goals in 22 games since joining the club in October.	Doncaster Rovers boss Dean Saunders says the club are continuing to investigate claims that forward El-Hadji Diouf breached club discipline.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "The only response can be: 'yes, Mr President'." Gen Petraeus resigned as CIA director in 2012 following an extramarital affair with his biographer. It later emerged he had shared classified material with her. He served as a senior officer under Presidents Bush and Obama. He was the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, before retiring from the military to take the top position in the Central Intelligence Agency. Asked if he thought Mr Trump had the correct temperament to be the US President, he said: "It's up to Americans at this point in time not only to hope that that is the case, but if they can, endeavour to help him." He then indicated he would personally serve under Mr Trump if asked. "If you're asked, you've got to serve - put aside any reservations based on campaign rhetoric... and figure out what's best for the country," he said. "I've been in a position before where a president has turned to me in the Oval Office in a difficult moment, without any pleasantries, and said 'I'm asking you as your president and Commander in Chief to take command of the international security force in Afghanistan.' "The only response can be: 'yes, Mr President,'" he continued. A number of media outlets have linked the retired general with positions in the new administration. A report in The Guardian last week linked Gen Petraeus to the race for secretary of state, citing diplomatic sources. Mr Trump has been putting together his administration made up of friends, family, and former rivals - but several key positions, including secretary of state, remain open. General Petraeus was indirectly critical of some of Donald Trump's rhetoric during the presidential election campaign, describing the president elect's anti-Muslim comments as toxic. However, he said he had heard good things from those who have been speaking with Mr Trump since the election result. "It's interesting that those who have been talking to him have said, you know, he's very personable, very hospitable, very gracious guy, full of questions and dialogue," he said. He also suggested that Mr Trump could forge closer ties with Russia, comparing his political position to that of President Nixon's overtures to China in the 1970s. "Only Nixon could have gone to China. Anyone else would have been criticised from the right," he said. "I think that the current president would have been criticised from the right had he tried some of the kinds of outreach that, in fact, President-elect Trump may pursue." But he warned that any such outreach should be attempted "with your eyes wide open".	General David Petraeus, one of the United States' most prominent military officers, has indicated he would be willing to serve in President-elect Donald Trump's administration if asked.
Lord Alderdice said proposals for a new international body to monitor paramilitary activity would have "much less power" than the panel he sat on. He was a member of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) which operated from 2004 to 2011. The Liberal Democrat peer said the new body would only be able to produce a few proposals for the Executive. "Which will then fall into disagreement about how they should be implemented," he said. Lord Alderdice spoke on Tuesday's debate on the Northern Ireland Welfare Reform Bill in the House of Lords. The former Church of Ireland primate Archbishop Robin Eames also used the debate to express his disappointment that the "Fresh Start" deal did not include any agreement on the legacy of the troubles. Lord Eames, who was co-chair of a consultative group on the past, told peers he was well aware of the "desperate plight" of troubles' victims. He urged the government to publish the legacy papers prepared during the inter-party negotiations, arguing that the victims "deserve nothing less". Lord Eames expressed the hope that legacy issues might yet be tackled, adding that "perhaps the situation is not as bleak as it seems". The government spokesman, Lord Dunlop, said the establishment of a new monitoring body to assess the impact of paramilitary activity on local communities is "a crucial part" of the "Fresh Start" deal. Lord Dunlop said the government regretted the fact that an agreement on legacy issues could not be reached, and remained committed to continuing to work to build a consensus.	The former leader of the Alliance party Lord Alderdice has criticised plans contained in the "Fresh Start" deal.
The 23-year-old striker, on loan from Al Hilal, pounced on a sloppy pass from defender Daniel Ayala and slotted a fine finish past Darren Randolph. Boro forward Martin Braithwaite should have levelled at Molineux before the break, but headed wide while unmarked. Britt Assombalonga was denied by goalkeeper John Ruddy as Boro pressed late on and Wolves held on for victory. Wolves' new manager Nuno Espirito Santo handed starts to seven summer acquisitions, including the Championship's record signing Ruben Neves in midfield. Finding a prolific striker was one of Nuno's priorities ahead of the campaign, after midfielder Dave Edwards and winger Helder Costa, missing through injury, topped Wolves' scoring charts last season. And it was former Brazil under-17 player Bonatini who made the difference with the most composed of strikes after some terrible defending. Ayala attempted to pass the ball to Ben Gibson, but it was woefully short allowing Bonatini to nip in and place his effort into the bottom corner. Middlesbrough also struggled to find the back of the net in 2016-17, scoring just 27 times as they were relegated from the Premier League. New boss Garry Monk started three of his new forwards - Ashley Fletcher, Assombalonga and Denmark international Braithwaite - but they could not find a way through a resolute Wolves defence. Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo: "It was a tough game and in the first half we played very well. We controlled the game and this is the way we should work. "I think that we deserved the three points and we are pleased with the boys. "We are still not the final product and every game will be better. This is the line that we want from the boys, always progress, always get better." Middlesbrough boss Garry Monk: "In the first half Wolves were the better team and we made too many mistakes and obviously one of them led to a goal. "But I thought we were the better team in the second half and we upped our level of urgency. We need that at the start of games. "We had the best chances in the game and on any other day we could have taken one or two of them. That is football and is sometimes the way that it works out."

The annual celebratory march, now in its 43rd year, stopped for a minute to remember the victims shot dead in a gay nightclub in Orlando. The parade got under way in the West End with an increased visible police presence. For the first time, the Red Arrows will fly past the march and a rainbow flag is flying at Parliament. Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, announced she is in a same-sex relationship as the event was in full swing. She tweeted: "Today's a good day to say I'm in a happy same sex relationship, I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!" Her announcement came as the director of Pride London, Michael Salter-Church, said this year's campaign slogan is No Filter. He said: "No Filter is a call to arms. A call for people to be themselves, to live as their true selves. "Now that might sound too obvious but too many people already self-censor. On this weekend whilst we celebrate the LGBT community, be your true selves, try and live without filter because that's a really important message that we want spread around the UK and the world." London Mayor Sadiq Khan also joined the celebratory parade and singer Alesha Dixon will entertain revellers. In a message before the march, he said London is "a city where the large majority of people of all communities, faiths and backgrounds, don't simply tolerate each other, but respect, embrace and celebrate our diversity". At the scene: BBC reporter Catriona Renton What a carnival atmosphere! The buzz around the start of the parade was electric as we watched several people dressed as the character of Patsy from "Absolutely Fabulous" dancing on their bus with a giant high heeled shoe and lipstick on it. Then the real stars of the show Edina and Patsy herself cut the ribbon. Then they were off. Approximately 40,000 people from around 300 organisations paraded down Oxford Street in a sea of glitter and colour on their way to Trafalgar Square. There was silence as people here paused to remember the 49 victims of the shootings in Orlando who were killed two weeks ago. The message was of solidarity. The march takes place weeks after a gunman shot dead 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in Florida. The Metropolitan Police said it will mount a visible police presence to provide reassurance to those taking part. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe earlier said there was "no intelligence" to suggest the march or the city would be targeted, urging people to join in but "take reasonable precaution". Organisers expect that more people will attend the event this year to show support for the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender community. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who was involved in organising the first Pride, said people must unite against hate and this year both gay and straight Muslims will join the parade in a show of solidarity. He said: "In the wake of the horrific mass murder of LGBT people by an Islamist gunman in Orlando, we are highlighting the need for dialogue, unity and solidarity between the Muslim and LGBT communities - to oppose all hate." This year the parade will feature more than 100 Met Police officers and 200 military personnel, as the flypast will show support within the Armed Forces for the LGBT community.	Tens of thousands of people have joined the Pride parade through central London.
More than 100 people have been arrested as officers were attacked, police vehicles damaged and shops looted. Disorder spread to Enfield, Walthamstow and Waltham Forest in north London and to Brixton in the south of the city. Home Secretary Teresa May has cut short her holiday to return to the UK following the disorder. Some 35 officers have been injured over the two nights of rioting. Three officers were hurt when a vehicle hit them as they tried to make an arrest in Waltham Forest, east London. Clashes broke out in Enfield, north London, on Sunday evening where shop windows were smashed and a police car damaged. There have been reports of a gang of up to 200 youths looting shops and charging police in Coldharbour Lane and the High Street in Brixton, south London. Metropolitan Police Commander Adrian Hanstock said: "This is not groups of people acting on behalf of communities or with any consent. "This is individuals who are actually attacking communities, businesses, properties and houses and actually causing a huge amount of upset and criminality." The Met said it had dealt with several incidents of "copycat criminal activity" across the city. These included: Kit Malthouse, Deputy Mayor of London and Chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, described the scenes of the last two nights as "disgusting and shocking" and said the police did a good job. He added: "Obviously there are people in this city, sadly, who are intent on violence, who are looking for the opportunity to steal and set fire to buildings and create a sense of mayhem, whether they're anarchists or part of organised gangs or just feral youth frankly, who fancy a new pair of trainers." Talking about the impact on the capital's image, one year ahead of the Olympic Games, he said: "It's pretty rotten for London, it does not look good. "What we need to do over the next few months is to underline to people the fundamental truth about London which is that it is one of the safest, great big cities on earth. "We have a low murder rate and this kind of violence is very rare." The Home Secretary, Theresa May said: "Last night, police officers again put themselves in harm's way to protect Londoners and their property. "Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice." BBC London's Paraic O'Brien said he had witnessed widespread looting in Brixton. He said: "They smashed a William Hill, they set bins on fire. "And now what we're seeing as the night progresses is that replicated, sort of flashpoints all along Brixton High Street. By Andy MooreBBC News I saw the rioting in Tottenham on Saturday and I saw the rioting last night and it was certainly different in character. What might have been started in Tottenham by youngsters aggrieved about what they saw as police persecution has become something very different in nature. Last night there was a sense that the looting, and violence and disorder across London was being co-ordinated on social media. There were people in their cars, youngsters on bicycles, moving very rapidly, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. As soon as you moved to one location they would move on to the next one. The police were doing their best to catch up with them. You had police vehicles going backwards and forwards, blue lights flashing, riot police coming out of their vehicles. Ten minutes later they'd get back in again and go off to the next location - essentially trying to fight the fires, metaphorically, that were spreading all over London. "I'm standing outside Halfords on the other side of the road and they've just smashed through the doors of Halfords. They're taking bikes out the front entrance. "I have to say, what really struck me was the small number of police officers that there actually seem to be on Brixton High Street responding to this." Press Association photographer Lewis Whyld saw looters battle police at a Currys store in Brixton. He said: "A couple of hundred youths were rioting and looting. Riot police went in to get them out and there was a big fight in the street. "Youths were throwing rocks and bottles and there was a bin on fire. They used a fire extinguisher to push the police back so they could get back into Currys and continue taking things out." Met Police Commander Christine Jones said: "Officers are shocked at the outrageous level of violence directed against them. "At least nine officers were injured overnight in addition to the 26 injured on Saturday night." London Fire Brigade said it had been called to a number of fires in Enfield, Brixton and Walthamstow, including a fire at a shop on Brixton Road, which is now under control. The disorder follows rioting in Tottenham which broke out on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. A peaceful protest over the fatal shooting by police on Thursday of 29-year-old Mark Duggan descended into violence later in the evening. The unrest spread into nearby Wood Green and Tottenham Hale. Shops were attacked and looted, 26 police officers and three others were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight. Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's ticket office was also damaged during the violence. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that there were too few officers in Tottenham on Saturday night, but blamed Twitter for fuelling looting and violence, saying: "Social media and other methods have been used to organise these levels of greed and criminality." Mr Kavanagh pledged that more officers would be on London's streets on Monday night to prevent or tackle further outbreaks. Parts of Tottenham are still cordoned off, as officers and forensic specialists continue to examine the riot scene. A total of 61 arrests have been made in connection with the first night of rioting. The majority were for burglary, and other offences including violent disorder, robbery, theft and handling stolen goods. Sixteen people have been charged for offences including burglary, violent disorder and possession of a pointed or bladed weapon following the Tottenham riots. As well as Mr Duggan, a police officer was also shot in Thursday's incident, which happened in what was called a "pre-planned" event, under Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in London's African and Caribbean communities. Police had stopped a minicab which Mr Duggan had been travelling in. The violence has also affected public transport and the roads. This includes:	Police have condemned a wave of "copycat criminal activity" across London in a second night of looting and disorder following riots in Tottenham.
Several species' vision was studied by an international team to identify this ultra-violet (UV) sensitivity. The findings, published in the journal Conservation Biology, claimed habitats and migration could be disrupted. The flashes, or corona, occur when charge builds up in a cable and is released into the air. The international team, including scientists from University College London and the Arctic University of Norway, measured the spectrum of light emitted by these bursts of charge. They worked out that although the light was invisible to us, it contained wavelengths seen by many other mammals. "Most mammals will let some [UV light] into their eye," explained UCL vision expert Prof Glen Jeffery, one of the lead researchers in this project. "We're weird - us and monkeys - because we don't see UV. Most animals do." The first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project. Dr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed. "Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts," he said. "But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines." The animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables. "This has been a mystery," Dr Tyler added. "We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it]." This research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in. Having discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive. Since, as the researchers added, coronas "happen on all power lines everywhere", the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife. "It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals," said Dr Tyler. "As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that's why the animals find them so offensive." The random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them. Prof Jeffery said he hoped power companies would now consider ways to address the issue.	Animals around the world could be scared away from power cables because these give off UV flashes invisible to humans, scientists have said.
Out of nearly 12,000 fans, 52% were in favour and 48% against a game which would raise funds for the Ladies' team and a final decision will now be made. The match would be the final public game at Upton Park but some fans want the Premier League win over Manchester United to be the last at the stadium. The Hammers are moving to the Olympic Stadium after 112 years at Upton Park. West Ham beat United 3-2 and then held a 45-minute celebration after full-time, involving fireworks and former players. Eastenders actor Danny-Boy Hatchard, who plays Lee Carter in the BBC One soap opera, is one of those backing the Ladies' game.	A West Ham Ladies' charity match at Upton Park on 5 June narrowly won a vote over whether it should take place.

Graeme asks: Now that the EU referendum vote has been declared to leave EU, is it not possible for the government to have a second referendum vote just the same as SNP wants to have another referendum for independence. It is unlikely that there would be a second in-out referendum, not least because there is little evidence it would have a different result. While we should not read too much into the results of polling, in a post-referendum poll by ComRes, 92% of leave voters said they were happy with the outcome, while 4% of remain voters were happy (and, overall, 7% were indifferent). Also, MPs (with a handful of exceptions) have been rushing to say that the result of the vote must be respected. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has suggested there may be a second referendum on the terms of an eventual deal to the leave the EU, although that is not required by current legislation. You can read the full Reality Check here. Neil asks: Can Scotland make a deal with the EU separate to England without leaving the EU? We can't say for sure as this is an unprecedented situation and the treaties do not refer to this set of circumstances. If Scotland were to hold a second referendum, and become independent, it could apply to become a member of the EU in the usual way. And it is now more plausible that EU member states would try to speed up the process for Scotland than it would have been at the time of the 2014 independence referendum. We cannot say if it would be able to keep the UK's membership without going through some sort of application process, but Spain and France have both said they are opposed to holding separate talks with Scotland before the UK leaves the EU, and any deal would require unanimous backing of member states. You can read the full Reality Check here. John asks: Is it not right that the USA has a Trade Agreement with the EU? I am sure that they have not agreed to freedom of movement. So why can we not negotiate a deal like them? The USA does not currently have a free trade deal with the EU. It is in the process of negotiating a trade agreement called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. The wording and details of the agreement have not been finalised, but it is indeed unlikely that it will include freedom of movement. The EU's deal with Canada has also been cited as a possible starting point for the UK. Both the US and Canada will get access to the single market without actually being part of it, so they will not get full access - Canada's deal, for example, excludes some food items such as eggs and chicken. The UK could negotiate a trade deal with the EU that did not include freedom of movement, but it would be unlikely to provide the same access to the single market that it currently enjoys. You can read the full Reality Check here. Matt says: Much has been made of the two-year exit period that invoking Article 50 will bring. Can anyone explain what might happen if that period expires without agreement on our exit terms? Would our membership simply cease? Or would we remain engaged to all of the terms and conditions that were in place prior to that time? Once Article 50 has been triggered, there is a two-year time limit on negotiations for a new relationship between the UK and the EU. If an agreement has not been approved by other member states and the European Parliament within two years, then the deadline may be extended if all parties agree to it. Otherwise, the UK simply stops being a member of the EU and its treaties will no longer apply. But negotiations on a new relationship could still continue after that point. You can read the full Reality Check here. John asks: How do you know how various ages voted? We will never know the actual figures for how different age groups voted. Like other elections, the referendum was a secret ballot. However, there are post-referendum polls that give a pretty good indication. They can't tell us the precise numbers but they're clear enough to confirm that young voters were more likely to vote Remain, and older voters more likely to vote Leave. You can read more about what polls from before and after the referendum tell us here. Adam asks: If the UK invokes Article 50 by stating its intention to leave, can we later withdraw this intention if, for example, we don't like the deal that is negotiated or will we be compelled to leave? There is nothing in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, or in any other EU legal document, that would tell us what would happen if an exiting country changed its mind, after the process of leaving had started. A member state leaving the EU is unprecedented, so it's impossible to say what would happen if the UK decided it didn't like the deal and it wanted to stay. However, the signals we have had so far, from both EU and UK politicians, suggest it is unlikely that EU members would allow the UK to change its mind and stay in the EU with all its opt-outs, the rebate and so on, if it didn't like the deal on offer. Graham asks: The view of senior constitutional lawyers is that there has to be a bill passed by Parliament to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, before Article 50 can be invoked.  Won't MPs be duty-bound to vote in whichever way they consider to be in the best interests of the country? The answer: Some constitutional lawyers think that there will have to be a vote in Parliament before Article 50 is invoked. But others say it's a prerogative power held by the prime minister so no vote is necessary. Even if there is a vote, many MPs will think their primary duty is to uphold the will of the people as expressed in the referendum - even if they had personally supported Remain.

Public Health Wales (PHW) said 21 of the 35 residents at the unidentified home had been ill since 10 April. It is unclear if the flu-like illness caused the death. Earlier this week, it was revealed that two people had died after a flu outbreak at two Swansea nursing homes. Public health officials said five residents had been hospitalised and the remainder had been offered the anti-viral drug, Tamiflu. Carmarthenshire council, which runs the home, said it was working very closely with PHW. Dr Mac Walapu, consultant in communicable disease control for PHW, said: "In view of the rapid spread and high attack rate of this illness, it is most likely to be influenza. "We have also recently had outbreaks of influenza in nursing homes in Swansea. "Flu circulates in the UK between October and April and is not uncommon to see outbreaks in closed communities like nursing homes, where the disease can spread easily." Dr Walapu said people with flu would usually experience a fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, and fit and healthy people would usually recover without any complications and without needing medication. "However, in elderly people flu can be more serious and therefore we have treated residents at this home with Tamiflu as a precaution," he added. Sheila Porter, Carmarthenshire council's head of primary, community and social care, said they were working very closely with PHW to support residents, visitors and staff by providing information, advice and reassurance. "Sadly, one of our residents has passed away and although the death is not confirmed as linked to the flu-like illness, we extend our deepest sympathies to the family who we will continue to support," she added. Earlier this week, PHW said two people had died and five others were in hospital after a flu outbreak at two Swansea nursing homes. A total of 17 people have tested positive for the influenza. Overall, 36 people, including six members of staff at the homes, have reported flu-like symptoms.	Health chiefs are investigating an outbreak of a flu-like illness following the death of a resident at a nursing home in Carmarthenshire.
As adept at crafting concert films and documentaries as he was with thrillers, comedies and emotional family dramas, his list of credits shows him to be versatile as well as prolific. Everyone will have their favourites. Personally I have a soft spot for Something Wild, a darkly comic romance from 1986 in which Jeff Daniels realises a date with Melanie Griffith comes with a psychotic ex attached. But if you had to choose the five films that best illustrate his formidable range, you could do a lot worse than picking the following: A footnote in the life of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes formed the basis for this early success. It riffs on the much-disputed relationship between Hughes and Melvin Dummar, a service station owner from Utah who claimed to be one of Hughes's beneficiaries after his 1976 death. It's a quirky story that enabled Demme to muse on the pitfalls of instant celebrity and the way a sudden windfall makes everyone your friend. Mary Steenburgen won an Oscar for playing Melvin's first wife, while Bo Goldman was also rewarded by the Academy for his screenplay. Few directors have captured the electricity and excitement of live performance better than Jonathan Demme. For proof, one need look no further than this film of Talking Heads in concert, shot over three nights in 1983. Featuring such hits as Psycho Killer, Burning Down the House and Once in a Lifetime, it's a perfect marriage of music, cinema and humour. The latter is provided by David Byrne's suit, which gets progressively larger, and absurder, as the film goes on. Another live performance we can enjoy again and again thanks to Demme comes in this vivid record of one of Spalding Gray's acclaimed stage monologues. Focusing on the sometime actor's involvement in 1984 film The Killing Fields, it's a piece that addresses, both comically and poetically, America's own involvement in south-east Asian affairs. Laurie Anderson's score combines with Gray's hypnotising skills as a storyteller to make a riveting hybrid. Demme wasn't the first film-maker to bring Hannibal Lecter to the screen. That honour belonged to Michael Mann and his 1986 thriller Manhunter. Lambs, though, was the one the Academy recognised, awarding it all of the "big five" Oscars - best picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay. The film - and Sir Anthony Hopkins' Lecter - still have the power to chill the blood with its grisly autopsy scenes and Grand Guignol atmosphere. What lingers most, though, is the psychological richness and complexity of a film that, uncommonly at the time, put a female heroine - Jodie Foster's dogged Clarice Starling - at the forefront of the action. Two years on from Lambs' Oscar sweep, Tom Hanks won the first of his two back-to-back Oscars for his role as a lawyer with HIV fighting workplace discrimination. The film did much to remove the stigma associated with Aids at the time, not least by earning more than $200m (Â£156m) at the worldwide box office. "We wanted to reach people who don't know people with Aids, who look down on people with Aids," Demme told Rolling Stone in 1994. "We were calculated about it. We set out to make a movie dealing with Aids discrimination, and there it is." Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Apple Music performed a U-turn over payment policy a day after the pop star threatened to prevent the US firm from streaming her album 1989. Swift had argued that Apple withholding payments during a three-month trial period was not fair for artists. But photographer Jason Sheldon said the singer herself did not "play fair" when it came to image rights. Some of the claims he has made in an open letter to Swift have been disputed by representatives of the 25-year-old singer. In it he wrote: "If you don't like being exploited, that's great - make a huge statement about it, and you'll have my support. But how about making sure you're not guilty of the very same tactic before you have a pop at someone else? "With all due respect to you too Taylor, you can do the right thing and change your photo policy. Photographers don't ask for your music for free. Please don't ask us to provide you with your marketing material for free." Mr Sheldon, who runs the Walsall-based Junction 10 agency, said he and other photographers had been called to hand over some rights to their images from Swift's live concerts. To cover a performance in March 2011 at Birmingham's LG Arena, Mr Sheldon said he had to sign a permission form that granted Swift's management company long-term rights to reuse the images and prevented him from featuring them after the initial coverage. "I can't use it in my portfolio, feature it on my website and even the original newspaper couldn't reuse it," Mr Sheldon said. "What's more, they can give my image to my clients for press purposes. It's giving my work away for free." He said the photo authorisation form included a section that gave the management firm "perpetual worldwide right to use (and to authorise others to use) any or all of the photographs for any non-commercial purpose". Mr Sheldon said clauses such as this were becoming more common in photo agreement forms. He said it was Swift's stance with Apple that "jarred" - with her "lambasting" the firm over using music for free, when her management firm was "guilty of doing the same thing with photos". In a statement, a spokesperson for Swift said: "The standard photography agreement has been misrepresented in that it clearly states that any photographer shooting The 1989 World Tour has the opportunity for further use of said photographs with management's approval. "Another distinct misrepresentation is the claim that the copyright of the photographs will be with anyone other than the photographer - this agreement does not transfer copyright away from the photographer. "Every artist has the right to, and should, protect the use of their name and likeness." Mr Sheldon said he had seen a 2015 version of the same contract that was even more strict, although he had not applied for one. "I fully agree with Taylor Swift's stance against Apple, but it's about her playing by the same rules she wants to live by," he said.	A photographer has accused Taylor Swift of "double standards" in her row with Apple over music streaming.
The 27-year-old, who has two senior international caps for Sweden, is unattached after leaving the Premier League club in July. The former Udinese man initially joined the Hornets on loan in 2012, before signing on a free transfer in July 2013, making 100 appearances in total. "We are in the market for a centre-half," Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol. "It's the one area we are probably a bit light. We invited him in. "There is no pressure from either side at the moment. We are just assessing the situation but also the options in the market."	Former Watford defender Joel Ekstrand is currently training with Bristol City, head coach Lee Johnson has said.
The treatment isn't offered on the NHS, but it's understood some staff have occasionally put patients in touch with organisations who provide it. Experts say attempting so-called "gay cures" can be "dangerous" and "damaging". Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to stop gay conversion therapy being offered to patients. Although in general, referrals to conversion services are rare - there is evidence that GPs, counsellors and psychotherapists have made them. They will also be providing training for staff to enable them to improve support available to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people seeking advice. The agreement, The Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK, makes it clear that NHS England, the organisation which has day-to-day responsibility for running the NHS, "does not endorse or support conversion therapy" and will make this clear to staff. It essentially means GPs will not be able to refer patients for gay therapy and that no-one employed by the NHS can provide it. Amber Dowell, communications officer at the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told Newsbeat the agreement was "really important". "It's very common for people to have feelings where they might question their sexuality, where they might want to explore the attractions they're feeling. "We want people to be able to do that in an environment that is safe, supportive and free of judgement." There are no official figures for how many people attempt conversion therapy every year, but the Department of Health has acknowledged to Newsbeat it does occasionally happen. Amber suggested that an "ignorance of the issue of the ethics involved" rather than staff being "prejudiced against LGB people" was to blame for it being offered by the NHS in the past. "I think, in trying to help people mistakenly, referrals had been made in the past," she said. Newsbeat has spoken to people who said they had experienced conversion therapy. Louise from West Yorkshire said she was blackmailed into receiving "treatment" for being gay in 2007 by her evangelical church. She later attended group sessions of around 20 women near Liverpool. "[Most] were married with children. They were there without the knowledge of their partners or their children. "If I'd been more impressionable I think I could have been really damaged by the process." Brad, from Illinois, lives in the West Midlands. He said he was "scared" when he first discovered he was gay and "wanted to do my very best to change it". He attended group therapy sessions but realised the treatment, which he said encouraged him "to do more stereotypical masculine things" wasn't going to change his feelings. "It's really sad I spent three years of my life trying to do something that was impossible." There are some who suggest it works and insist people should be able to try it. Mike Davidson told Newsbeat he "converted" with therapy over the course of two years and now provides what he calls "support" for people who have "unwanted same-sex attraction" in Northern Ireland. He thinks the service should be allowed but he wasn't able to give an accurate estimate of how widely the treatment was available. He told Newsbeat that gay conversion isn't a "huge industry" and that the people he works with have decided it is something they want to do. "By the time they [clients] get to us, they know what we're about and know what they would like to achieve." Explaining the process, he said: "For some people they want to go as far as controlling their behaviour... they do not want to act out on those issues and we would support them." He also said that he turns people away who appear to have been pressured into taking therapy and admitted that, even when working with someone who wants to change their sexual feelings, a "result" is never guaranteed. The UK Council of Psychotherapy says it intends to expand the agreement to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland soon.

Media playback is not supported on this device Usain Bolt's defeat by Justin Gatlin in the last individual 100m he will ever run proved several things: that sport has less time for happy endings than scripted dramas; that time catches up even with someone who has made it his business escaping it; and that even the biggest party can be pooped if you let the wrong characters in. East End dramas need their villains, and on Saturday night in Stratford Gatlin played that role to eye-popping perfection. Twice caught doping, once facing a lifetime ban that was reduced first to eight years and then to four, he has long been the anti-poster boy for track and field - lacking any obvious remorse, humility left for others, a frequent swaggering reminder that cheats can still prosper should their legal team find the right angle to work. Not all the rancour has made logical sense. Others at these World Championships have returned from suspensions. Russia is banned indefinitely for its 21st century take on state-sponsored doping. Only Gatlin was booed every time he took to the blocks, from heats on Friday morning to semi-finals on Saturday evening and then the final itself. So it was that as he thrust his upper body across the finish line just after 21:45 BST - almost unnoticed in lane eight, outside the peripheral vision of Bolt in four and young American Christian Coleman in five - a wave of shock rolled around the packed slabs of supporters, turning to disbelief, to not wanting to accept what had just happened, to hoping something might suddenly be revealed to make it right. Gatlin does not find charm easy to access. He slammed on the brakes, jumped to attention and put a single, admonishing finger to his lips, daring the crowd to mock him now. Revenge, it seemed, was his - for the catcalls of the past two days, for those who considered him shot at 35, for the mess Bolt has made of his tilts at world and Olympic gold since he returned to competition an older and unapologetic man in 2010. And then you heard the crowd respond again, first the thousands close to him on the top bend, then those all around the oval track. "Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt! Usain Bolt!" This was Gatlin's moment of triumph: unacknowledged, unwanted, first mocking and then being mocked in return. The lap of honour? That went to Bolt. The first interview with the in-field presenter? Bolt. The one all the spectators ran down to trackside to touch and to photograph and to seize for selfies? Bolt. A victory, but a pyrrhic one. A defeat, but one that was treated like a triumph. The strangest of nights, and a strange truth: Gatlin may have deserved all of that - but he deserved this win too, in its technique and focus if not its ancestry. Media playback is not supported on this device In 2015, expected to beat an ailing Bolt at the last World Championships in Beijing. He had led with 15 metres to run only to over-stride with triumph in front of him and let the king cling on to his crown. Now, at an age when his youthful speed has leached away, he ran through the line as if nothing could touch him. Bolt's reaction to the gun was the slowest of anyone in the race. Five hundredths of a second ceded to Gatlin before a metre had been run, a hundredth more to Coleman. When the chase came, the invisible bungee cord of old had been replaced by a rope. There was acceleration but no surge. The champion tightened, but not the American kid nor the compatriot 14 years his senior. Gatlin finished in 9.92 seconds, Coleman in 9.94, Bolt in 9.95. Never before had the 30-year-old Jamaican run so slowly in a major final. In this same stadium, five golden summers ago, he had run 9.63. You can't keep stopping the clock. One day it will stop you. Media playback is not supported on this device The World Championships have defined Bolt and given him a simple narrative. Berlin 2009: his world record of 9.58, the greatest run of all. Daegu 2011: disqualified for a false start, his greatest disappointment. Beijing 2015: the defeat from nowhere of Gatlin, arguably his greatest miracle. This was supposed to be the great finale. That the story was hijacked by a darker subplot will leave some feeling as if something sacred has been blemished, that same sense of sadness experienced by those who saw boxer Muhammad Ali beaten in 10 melancholic rounds by Trevor Berbick in his own concluding fight. Yet sometimes perfection itself can become hard to understand when it seems to come so easy. In defeat, we can look back at all the glories of the past nine years and see that none were preordained and all claimed through an unprecedented blend of latent talent and unremitting hard work. Bolt has done so much on the track that no other human has ever managed. That his last individual race revealed him to have a few mortal flaws after all should not undermine his status. He talked of wanting to be remembered like Ali, like Pele. He will be. Gatlin has his world title - but never will he win the same affection nor respect. An imperfect ending, but with its own little perfections too. Media playback is not supported on this device	And so a perfect career ends in an imperfect way.
They were armed with weapons when they entered their victim's home at 22:45 on Thursday. The 29-year-old suffered head and body injuries in the incident, which spilled out on to the street outside the property in Herbertson Crescent. Det Con Gavin McKellar appealed for help in tracing the attackers, who were wearing balaclavas. "This is a quiet area and we do believe that the attack was targeted, however, even so, this was a vicious attack on the man," he said. The injured man managed to get help from a neighbour before he was taken to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock by ambulance. Det Con McKellar added: "Quite a few people came to the aid of the man but we still need to speak to anyone who was in the area and who saw the two suspects making off. "We believe they may have got into a small black car in Tollerton Drive and then drove off. "We want to hear from anyone who saw the two of them together, putting on or taking off their masks, or if they saw them hanging about prior to the attack either in the car or on foot." Police do not know whether the pair, who were wearing dark clothing, were male or female.	Police are hunting two masked attackers who launched a "vicious" assault on a man in his own home in Irvine.
Williams, 42, was forced to qualify after he was defeated by Mark Selby on Sunday in the final of the China Open. He will be one of 14 Welsh players who will have to win three qualifying rounds at Ponds Forge in Sheffield to secure a place in the first round. Ryan Day is the only Welshman to be guaranteed a place in the competition. The World Championship starts at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Saturday, 15 April. 15-year-old schoolboy Jackson Page and amateur Tyler Rees, 18, will play in the qualifying rounds after receiving an invitation to compete. Page, of Ebbw Vale, will take on world number 75 Martin O'Donnell on Thursday while Rees will play against world number 44 Xiao Guodong of China on Wednesday. Elsewhere, Matthew Stevens - twice a runner up at the Crucible - will face off against fellow Welshman Lee Walker on Wednesday.

Cornwall ran into a 20-5 lead after 30 minutes thanks to two tries from Billy Searle either side of a Neilson Webber score, as Matt Noble replied. Surrey kicked three penalties either side of the break to narrow the gap before Searle got his third try with 17 minutes to go. Herbie Stupple rounded off the win with a fifth score to send Cornwall through. They are the reigning county champions after winning the Bill Beaumont Cup last year when they beat Lancashire in the final. But, after three matches with the Red Rose county, they will face Cheshire in the final after they beat Lancashire 27-11 in their decisive clash at Fylde.	Cornwall reached their fourth County Championship final in a row after a 32-14 win over Surrey at Camborne.
She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret. When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour. "I never get to do stuff like this," marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds. In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk. It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California. She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot "past Ventura and lenses plenty" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion. When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year. "I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches," she says. "I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go. "I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them." But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind ("may you stand proud and strong"); while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival "whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount". It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with "looking for love in all the wrong places". "I kind of got jolted into the real world again," she says. "Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers. "And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening." Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels. They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it "never feels like work," she says. "Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start. "So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music." On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together. She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends. "It was really fun!" she says of working with A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd. "I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record." More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems. "I was definitely nervous," says Del Rey of the recording session. "She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision. "When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out! "I said to her over the mic, 'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like, 'That's ok, you can be my little echo!' "I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is. "That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me." Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics. "That song started out really revealing," she says. "I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything." Once the initial version was "out of my system", she says, the recording was "deleted completely then started from scratch". The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: "I want to move out of the black, into the blue". "I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of," she says of the original. "Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record." She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an "underground sect" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru. In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, "he hit me and it felt like a kiss". "I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more," she says now. "Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully." On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too. Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love. Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir. "I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords," she explains. "I was leaning in to him and saying, 'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like, 'That is it, trust me'. "I listened for 10 seconds and I was like, 'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive. "But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me." She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been. "I'm so glad," she says. "Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?" I tell her it was like being in church. "Oh, stop!" she beams, and bursts into laughter. That good mood isn't going anywhere soon.

Michelle Mellotte, 61, took the money from Michael McGrory in February 2010, saying it would be repaid that summer. But, it was only returned following the start of a police investigation. Ms Mellotte knew her patient was suffering from Alzheimer's when she asked him for the loan. She went to his home to "ask him for a favour" and he agreed to sign a cheque for £10,000 with an endorsement that it would be paid back in the summer of 2010. In April, Ms Mellotte admitted fraud by abuse of her role and was given a suspended prison sentence and was suspended from the medical register. Last week, the ruling was endorsed following a hearing by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in St James's Buildings in Manchester. The tribunal noted that Ms Mellotte, who did not attend the hearing, did not oppose the GMC's case against he. In written submissions, the former doctor's legal team stated she accepted the "appropriate sanction" was erasure. Summarising the case against her, the tribunal chairman, Sean Ell, said: "The tribunal has determined that Dr Mellotte has put patients at unwarranted risk of harm, she has brought the profession into disrepute, she has breached fundamental tenets of the profession and her integrity cannot be relied upon." She will no longer be able to practice as a doctor in the UK.	A Fermanagh GP who dishonestly exploited and took advantage of a vulnerable elderly patient, when she failed to repay a £10,000 loan, has been struck off the medical register.
Mauritania, an Islamic republic, has not applied a death penalty since 1987. The Forum of Imams and Ulemas says Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir, 29, should be executed despite the fact that he repented for an article criticising Mauritania's caste system. The clerics want him to be killed according to the "law of God". The blogger was arrested in January 2014 for an article in which he lashed out at those who use religion as a means of discrimination against members of certain ethnic groups. The article was later taken down as it was deemed blasphemous towards the Prophet Muhammad. Mkhaitir then apologised and said he never meant to insult the Prophet. Mauritania's Supreme Court can pardon him if it feels his repentance is sincere. But ahead of the court's decision on Tuesday, the body of clerics said the blogger should not be shown any mercy. "We demand that the competent authorities apply the law," the Forum of Imams and Ulemas was quoted by Reuters as saying in a statement. "Kill him and bury him in conformity with the law of God," the statement added. Leading rights groups, including Freedom Now and the Committee to Protect Journalists, have campaigned for the blogger's release. Freedom Now, which represents him, said his trial was marred by procedural irregularities and that three of his lawyers had to resign after receiving death threats. Mauritania's caste system is a sensitive subject in a country with deep social and racial divisions. It has served as justification for the enslavement of members of Mauritania's Haratin ethnic group, often known as the "black moors". Last year, Mauritania introduced a tough new anti-slavery law which makes the offence a "crime against humanity". The country officially abolished slavery in 1981, but activists say it is still widely practised with children born into slavery.	A body of Muslim clerics in Mauritania has called for the death sentence to be carried out against a blogger convicted of apostasy in 2014.
Bristol Sport Ltd, which owns the football club, wants to replace two stands to increase capacity. The plan is an alternative to proposals to build a new stadium at nearby Ashton Vale, which has been delayed by an application for a town green. Majority shareholder Steve Lansdown confirmed the club would begin work at a shareholder meeting on Tuesday. The work was approved by Bristol City Council in November. Mr Lansdown told the club's official website: "We'll sign the section 106 agreement any day now, and then we have six weeks to wait for the judicial review period. "We wanted to give some certainty to supporters, so if we get through to March with no judicial review, then we will be going ahead with the redevelopment plans, starting in May."	A £40m revamp of Bristol City's Ashton Gate ground will go ahead this summer, the club has announced.
East Markham is a quiet Nottinghamshire village. It has a pub and a primary school and the last shop closed five years ago. But it does have an ancient monument - the East Markham Pinfold. The largest pinfold in the country no less. It's basically a high-walled rectangle where any stray livestock found wandering around would be put, making it the first port of call for a worried shepherd. Nowadays, the best place to go with your worries is the village hall. It's where I found Conservative MP for Newark, Robert Jenrick, holding one of his mobile surgeries. He drives to see people and they know where to find him, a modern political pinfold. Some were there to respond to an issue raised by Mr Jenrick himself. He wrote to 8,000 of his constituents to find out what they thought Bassetlaw District Council's wish to join in with the Sheffield City Devolution deal. He was surprised to get more than 2,000 replies - all of them against the plan. He said they "hated the idea" and expected they would just be neglected. Mark Priddle, who went to see Mr Jenrick, said: "Why would Sheffield want anything to do with a village in Nottinghamshire? It doesn't make sense economically or socially." It's a year since plans for a combined Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire devolution deal were submitted to the government. The aim is to get powers and money shifted from Whitehall to the East Midlands. But of the 19 councils first involved, only 13 are left. Two, Chesterfield and Bassetlaw, have decided they would rather be part of a deal already signed off with Sheffield. Nearby in Worksop, it is fair to say that devolution is not the hot topic of conversation of many in the street. But for the politicians getting money from Westminster to spend on infrastructure projects is important. The MP for the bulk of the Bassetlaw district is Labour MP John Mann. He said people in the town looked to Sheffield, so would be better off in the new Sheffield City Region. "When it comes to education, when it comes to transport and industrial links, that's where our links are and we want to benefit from it and get the most out of it." If you look around the town you can see his point. Buses are heading to Rotherham and Doncaster and Wensleydale. Signposts show how to navigate North to the M1 and the A57 to Sheffield. You can see too, the town needs investment. Below the Worksop Town Centre notice board in the car park lies a substantial rat which has given up on life. Shops are boarded up as you venture towards the centre. A shopping centre is padlocked shut. The traffic is pretty congested too. As for giving away its identity to Sheffield? "We're giving nothing to anyone," Mr Mann said. "We're not going to be run by Sheffield, by Mansfield, by Nottingham, by London. We look after ourselves. "But when it comes to those strategic investments in railways and in roads, let's get the investment which would be good news for local people and local jobs." But Nottinghamshire County Council is keen to keep the North Nottinghamshire towns and villages as part of their devolution deal whenever it comes. The Labour leader, Alan Rhodes, represents a Worksop seat. He said: "If you live in Worksop, like I do, people may well associate themselves with Sheffield as a big city, but it's different in Retford, Tuxford and the villages. "It's a very short-sighted approach which will divide the district and I don't think that is helpful for Bassetlaw or Nottinghamshire." He added there would also be confusion surrounding highways maintenance and transport. Mr Rhodes said they needed clarity from the government. He acknowledges there is talk of doing away with having a mayor for the planned Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire deal. He wants to get around the table with ministers as soon as possible. Robert Jenrick said a mayor was not needed. "We've got enough politicians as it is," he said. "The last thing we need is another expensive politician." Mr Jenrick said it was more likely a devolution deal would happen if the idea of a mayor was scrapped. It could well be that instead, the government wants a three-city, three-county, deal involving Leicestershire, and without the need for a mayor to oversee it. That was always a stumbling block for Tory MPs. And Leicester already has its own mayor.	With a possible shake-up of local government in the East Midlands to be decided in the autumn, Nottinghamshire's politicians are haggling over what is best for the county's residents.
The track's release date was brought forward by five weeks after a cover version by X Factor's Fleur East topped the iTunes chart last week. Ronson thanked "boy wonder" Bruno Mars, who features on the track, "without whom there would be no jam". Ed Sheeran, who scores a 10th week at the top of the album charts, fell to number two in the singles chart, while Band Aid 30 climbed to number three. The physical release of Do They Know It's Christmas? saw the charity track climb nine places, but it was kept off the top spot by Ronson and the ubiquitous Sheeran. East, who is the favourite to win this year's X Factor, performed the Ronson track during the show's semi-final on Saturday 6 December. Her mentor Cowell, who chose the track after Ronson and Mars pulled out of performing the song themselves on the talent show, called it "one of the top three performances" in X Factor history. East later apologised to Ronson, calling it "an amazing song". "I don't think anyone expected my performance to be as popular as it was," she added. Speaking to the Official Charts company, Ronson refrained from mentioning East, but thanked "everyone who bought, downloaded or DJ'd Uptown Funk this past week." "It's pretty much the coolest thing ever," he added. Featuring  Mars on lead vocals, Uptown Funk is the first single from British producer Ronson's fourth album, Uptown Special. Inspired by the feel-good funk of the 70s and 80s, it was already available in several countries around the world. Two Ronson tracks - Stop Me and Valerie, a collaboration with Amy Winehouse - reached number two in previous years.	Mark Ronson has clinched his first UK number one with Uptown Funk.
There were 69 claims against peacekeepers in 2015, up from 52 in 2014 was 66 in 2013. Almost a third of the 2015 claims were made in the Central African Republic. For the first time, the report has also set out all the countries whose soldiers are reportedly involved under a new "name-and-shame" policy. Overall, 10 peacekeeping missions were subject to allegations in 2015. The allegations involve military personnel, international police, other staff and volunteers. According to the UN's latest figures, there are 124,746 personnel serving in 16 peacekeeping missions worldwide. It has been criticised for failing to act quickly on sexual abuse allegations made against peacekeepers. Last December an independent panel calling the UN response to allegations in the Central African Republic (CAR) "seriously flawed" and a "gross institutional failure". It accused senior UN officials of abusing their authority by failing to take action over allegations of abuse by soldiers from France, Equatorial Guinea and Chad. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon's report called for an international convention on "crimes committed in peacekeeping operations". He also urged countries to change their laws so that they apply to sex crimes committed by citizens serving in UN peace operations. Mr Ban also called for "on-site court martial proceedings" for some crimes and a DNA database of all peacekeepers. UN peacekeepers operate under the legal jurisdiction of their home countries, making prosecution more difficult. In February, the UN said it would send home more than 100 peacekeepers from CAR following sexual abuse allegations. A 10,000-strong UN force took over a peacekeeping mission in the country in September 2014. After CAR, the second highest number of allegations was at the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo, with 16 cases, followed by Haiti with nine.	Allegations of sexual exploitation or sexual abuse by United Nations peacekeepers rose by a third last year, according to a UN report.
The bodies of Ronald Kidd, 40, and Holly Alexander, 37, were discovered at a tenement in Rosefield Street, in the city's west end, at about 21:00 on Sunday. The property was sealed off by police while detectives and scenes of crimes officers investigated. The man is expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court on Wednesday. Detectives said a review of CCTV in the are was being carried out, while house-to-house inquiries are continuing. Police have also appealed for anyone with information to come forward. Det Insp Brian Geddes, who is leading the investigation, said: "I would be keen to hear from anyone who heard or saw anything suspicious in the Rosefield Street area, in the days between Thursday 8 December 2016 and Sunday 11 December 2016."	A 37-year-old man has been charged in connection with the deaths of a man and woman at a Dundee flat.
The 50-year-old from Felstead in Essex rowed the Atlantic two years ago in the Woodvale Challenge. The 3,000-mile (4,800km) voyage took him 52 days - 10 of which were spent going backwards. Despite this, he set a new UK solo and race record. In January, Mr Pitcher plans to do it all again. This time, he has his sights set on the 40-day trans-Atlantic solo rowing world record. He will live aboard his rowing boat, the Soma of Essex. Made of carbon fibre, it is 6.5m (21ft) long and weighs just 460kg (1,014lb). Each day he will have to eat about 7,000 calories and make his own water to drink from sea water. Asked why he would row the Atlantic a second time, Mr Pitcher said: "The first time, it was an adventure. I stumbled across that adventure and ended up rowing across the Atlantic in a race from the Canaries to Antigua. "But we had very bad weather and it wasn't really what what I had bought into. "When I got to Antigua I decided I wanted to do it again, hopefully with the right weather. "I want to experience those famous trade winds which blow of the coast of Africa towards the Americas. "Of course, I also want to try and break the world record to be the fastest solo rower across the Atlantic. "Last time I spent 10 days going backwards and that is very mentally challenging," he said. "But if we get good weather and  I don't go backwards for 10 days, I think there's a possibility of breaking the record." His days will be divided into 16 hours of rowing, four hours sleeping and the remaining four hours will be spent on boat management. Mr Pitcher will sleep on the floor of his compact cabin, which has a carbon fibre seat. For entertainment, Mr Pitcher has a number of audio books to listen to and more than 4,000 songs on an iPod. His music includes a mix of music from classical to hard rock and Abba. The Soma of Essex has been designed to be self-righting in the event of a capsize. "It's designed to come up very quickly if it turns turtle," he said, "and as long as I hold on tight I will be alright - even if I'm like laundry in a tumble dryer." "Those people who think I'm crazy don't really know me. "There's a risk and there's an assessment of that risk. And we reduce those risks as much as possible." The plan is to get the rowing vessel to Tenerife and then to the island of La Gomera. Once there, Mr Pitcher will wait for the the right conditions. Asked what he was expecting on the open ocean, he said: "You only need a tropical storm and it can be very bad. We are not departing in tropical storm season, though there is still a risk. It is less than 10%. "But there are other things which can go wrong. I have a water machine that turns salt water into drinkable water. If that breaks, it'll be game over. "It doesn't have to be storm weather that stops me, there are other things that could be. There's a liferaft on the boat as well," he said. As well as attempting to break the current record - which is 40 days, 9 hours and 44 minutes - Mr Pitcher is raising money for two charities, Great Ormond Street Hospital and The C Group, which seeks to generate support for former Royal Marines.	Charlie Pitcher says people who call him "crazy" do not know him very well.
Bristol's Lee Haskins defends his IBF world bantamweight title against Ivan Morales at Cardiff's new Ice Arena. Selby, 27, is brother of current World IBF Featherweight champion Lee Selby. Andrew Selby made a dazzling start to his professional career, beating Tanzanian Haji Juma in Newport on October, 2015. Leicestershire's Norman, 22, has been beaten once in 13 bouts.	The British Boxing Board of Control has sanctioned Andrew Selby to fight Louis Norman for the vacant British flyweight title on 14 May in Cardiff.
He and his son Gorka were arrested earlier this month as part of a corruption investigation. Villar, who denied all the allegations, has been suspended for one year by the Spanish football federation. "Villar will no longer have any official functions at our organisation," Uefa said on Thursday. "In view of the ongoing court proceedings in Spain, we have no further comments to make on this matter." Uefa said its president, Aleksander Ceferin, had accepted Villar's resignation and had thanked him for his years of service to European football. Villar, a former Athletic Bilbao and Spain midfielder, had headed the Spanish football federation for 29 years. Juan Luis Larrea has been named as interim president.	Suspended Spanish Football Federation president Angel Maria Villar has resigned from his roles as vice-president of Uefa and Fifa.
The Yomper statue is currently located in front of the Royal Marines Museum at Eastney. The National Museum of the Royal Navy has started consulting over a proposed move to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Campaigners insist it is a local memorial to the conflict and "belongs" at Eastney. The Yomper statue was created by Philip Jackson, depicting a royal marine marching across the islands during the 1982 conflict and was unveiled by former prime minister, Lady Thatcher, in 1992. The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is planning to relocate the Royal Marines Museum from Eastney to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard as part of a Â£13m lottery funded project and wants to take the statue with it. An online petition against moving the statue has attracted more than 1,800 signatories, saying it was "now considered as our local Falklands War Memorial". Sheila Mackie who set it up said: "The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space." Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a "clear preference" that the statue remain where it it is. Its motion stated: "The Yomper statue has graced the seafront for many years, serving as a reminder of both the Falklands War and of the Marines' historical association with Eastney." NMRN director Jon Rawlinson said the new museum site would potentially have 750,000 visitors a year, compared to 40,000 at the current museum. "He would be seen by far more people at the historic dockyard, but of course he was built for here [Eastney] and is part of here. " He said no decision had been made and it would consider all comments submitted to its public consultation.	Plans to move a statue depicting a Royal Marine in the Falklands conflict away from Portsmouth seafront have been criticised.
Media playback is not supported on this device England lost three wickets before tea but Moeen made a 93-ball 84 to help his side declare on 490-8, a lead of 321. Joe Root (72), Dawid Malan (61), Ben Stokes (58) and Chris Woakes (61 not out) also helped England, who started the day just two ahead, take control. West Indies' openers survived a six-over spell to reach 5-0 at the close. That leaves the tourists needing an unlikely 317 runs for victory, despite them dominating the first three days at Headingley. England, who lead the three-match series 1-0, trailed by 169 after the first innings but have moved into a position from which they need 10 wickets on the final day to win. It would be only the 20th time in Test history a team has won having conceded a first-innings lead of 150 or more. Media playback is not supported on this device With Stokes and Malan at the crease, England were cruising in the afternoon session, but three quick wickets for spinner Roston Chase put the match back in balance. Stokes was caught at long-off from the first ball after a drinks break, Malan was bowled two overs later, and Jonny Bairstow followed soon after as he was bowled playing a reverse sweep. That brought Moeen and Woakes together, and they survived until tea, when England were seven wickets down with a lead of 188. At that point the match could have gone either way, but it was England who took control as they added 133 in just 28 overs. Moeen was his typical attacking self, hitting a series of flowing boundaries through the off side in a 117-run partnership. Woakes contributed just 31 to that stand but was the perfect foil for Moeen, and took the upper hand alongside Stuart Broad when Moeen was caught in the deep. Shortly after Woakes became the sixth player to score a half-century in the innings, Root boldly declared, his side having reached their highest ever score without a player hitting a century. Having missed chances earlier in the day, West Indies were run ragged, but could at least take solace from surviving overs from James Anderson, Broad and Moeen before the close. Malan started the day alongside Root, with questions still to be answered over his place in the side in the build-up to this winter's Ashes. He was by no means fluent in his five-hour innings, hitting just seven fours in 186 balls, but battled and scrapped his way to a second Test half-century. It was his slowest first-class fifty but allowed Root, Stokes and Moeen to express themselves as they hit 15, 10 and 14 boundaries respectively. "Malan tired out the bowlers," said former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott. "West Indies bowled at him for so long that later in the day they bowled off line and then the middle order kill you, they just give it a whack. "He was gritty, determined and sewed up one end so West Indies couldn't get early wickets." England have long been looking for a batsman to score 'ugly runs', and here Malan showed his ability to do that. But his knock was not chanceless. Having escaped on day three when feathering an edge behind only for it not to be given, he was dropped at slip on 32. He shared a 118-run stand with Root, who continued his remarkable consistency with his 32nd Test half-century but again fell short of 100 when he cut to gully off Shannon Gabriel. England all-rounder Moeen Ali to TMS: "It was a nice time to go out and bat. They were tired and we counter-attacked a little bit and tried not to let them settle. There was a bit of spin but it was nice and I play spin all right. "I felt good before tea and thought to keep playing the same and when the bad balls come try and put them away. Me and Chris Woakes tried to build five-run partnerships. "Hopefully we can win the game in two sessions." England bowler Chris Woakes: "We were just trying to creep up to a score. Moeen was going pretty well. It was nice to watch at the other end. I try and bat like a batsman and I work hard on my batting. "I got to 50 and there was a signal from the dressing room saying 'get on with it'. We didn't get too much of as heads up but sometimes it is good like that. The way we were playing we were picking up runs anyway."	Moeen Ali's fine counter-attacking innings laid the foundation for England to push for a final-day victory in the second Test against West Indies.
Goals from Ellen White and Rachel Yankey set up a game against France in Leverkusen on Saturday. "We had a game plan, the girls implemented it, we've topped the group and it can only increase our confidence," Powell told BBC Sport. "We were very, very good and I'm so proud of how well the girls played." England needed to avoid defeat against Japan to be sure of reaching the last eight. They got off to the perfect start when White's lob put them ahead after 15 minutes, with Yankey's clever finish in the second half wrapping up the points. "The ambition was to get out of the group," added Powell. "We're still in the competition, we're not going home and that is brilliant for England. "We made some changes to the team and they worked out, but we always knew it was going to be a squad game. Our opponents from now on doesn't matter. "Sophie Bradley was enormous, Jess Clarke did a job in the first half, we changed a few things and the girls did really well." White, who impressed throughout the game and could have had a second goal when her acrobatic volley was tipped over, admitted scoring was a dream come true. "It's indescribable, the feeling of scoring in a World Cup," said White. "It's the pinnacle of your career to play in this tournament. "I don't know what came over me for that," she said of her near-miss. "I was pretty unlucky but I'm pleased I got on the scoresheet to help the team. "We stuck together as a team and implemented the game plan, which we try and do every game but this one really worked. "We always had somebody kind of filling in, always there pressing the ball and worked really hard for 90 minutes and got the end product. "I think we deserved to win the game in the end. I'm so pleased we got the three points and we topped the group. "We know that if you want to be the best you have to beat the best, so we're happy to take anyone on now we're in the quarters. "They are a great team, Japan, and they put up a real fight and it was a hard game so it was a great win for us and a good team performance."	England women's coach Hope Powell praised her players after they beat Japan 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup.
A group chaired by Paralympic multi-gold medallist Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson says it would be the first country in the world to take that step. It would mean more time for sport, but unions worry too many core curriculum subjects could dilute their importance. The Welsh government said it would consider the recommendation. Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he wanted to look into how schools can increase levels of physical activity in children and young people. By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Although the need for more exercise is clear enough, it isn't just a simple matter of adding PE as a core subject. Pupils in Wales already have as core subjects Welsh, English, maths and sciences. They are the areas the government has decided should have most time and resources allocated to them. And teaching unions fear the more you add to that core, the less of a priority they each become. More than one-third are either overweight or obese, costing the Welsh NHS more than £70m a year. The current core subjects in schools in Wales are English, Welsh (as a first language), mathematics, and science, while physical education is a foundation subject. Having PE elevated to a core part of the curriculum would mean more time devoted to it, as well as extra resources and more training for teachers. Schools would also need to give greater priority to provision for PE. As a result: • Teachers would be required to be competent to deliver the subject on completion of their initial teacher training. • Well qualified, specialist teachers would be needed to work with schools to ensure high-quality provision. • Standards and provision in physical education would be rigorously reviewed in school, both by the educational consortia and by schools inspectorate Estyn. • Progress would be regularly measured. The move to give PE more status in schools would be a bold move but an important one, according to the group. In its report, the group, which also included the chair of Sports Wales Laura McAllister, said: "Given the Welsh government's commitment to making physical literacy as important a development skill as reading and writing, the group felt that changing the status of physical education is the only credible and secure way of ensuring this." But while teaching unions support the idea, they are worried that too many subjects on the core curriculum could dilute their importance. Dr Philip Dixon, director of ATL Cymru, said it was important to decide on "what small core we want". "We certainly want literacy and numeracy in there," he said. "We may well want physical education in there too, that's for the government to decide. "But the core has to be kept very small or else we'll see a core which isn't a core and that's just ridiculous." Owen Hathway, Wales policy officer at the NUT, also warned that schools already had a heavy curriculum in Wales. "We are constantly being told that literacy and numeracy is a priority, " he said. "Science is being pushed as a priority with its importance to future PISA testing. We have the core subjects of maths, English, Welsh and so on already in place, while IT is also being promoted as a priority. "Quite simply, by the nature of the word, not everything can be a priority." Responding to the report, Education Minister Leighton Andrews said he would be considering the report in the context of the wider review of the national curriculum and assessment. "We firmly believe in the positive impact that physical activity can have on the people and nation of Wales and I'm determined to ensure that sport continues to make an important contribution to Welsh life," he added. Sport Minister John Griffiths said sport was important as it improves health and wellbeing, along with helping with team building and making friends. "We are committed to widening access and encouraging greater participation in physical activity as the health benefits of making physical exercise a part of everyone's daily lives is well-understood," he added.	PE should be given the same status as maths, English, science and Welsh in schools to help tackle obesity in Wales, experts have recommended.
The 22-year-old Scotland international made five appearances for Leeds in 2012 and was released by the Rhinos at the end of the 2013 Super League season. Hood will join his former Leeds team-mate Ben Jones-Bishop at the Red Devils next season. "I'm very pleased that I've got this chance again and I'm going to take it with both hands," said Hood. He told BBC Radio Manchester: "It's a massive challenge. I've had a couple of years out of top-flight rugby and it's a big change. "You don't realise how much it benefits you being full-time. I'm really looking forward to getting back into it."	Salford Red Devils have signed hooker Liam Hood from Championship One Hunslet Hawks on a two-year deal from 2015.
Brantano employs about 2,000 staff in 140 stores and 60 concessions across the UK. Administrators from PwC are now running the Leicestershire-based business, which they said would trade normally while they sought a buyer. PwC's Tony Barrell said the chain was a victim of changing consumer habits. "The continuing challenging conditions for 'bricks and mortar' retail stores are well documented. "Like many others, Brantano has been hit hard by the change in consumers' shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment." Brantano, along with Jones Bootmaker, was bought by retail investment firm Alteri Investors in October from Dutch-based Macintosh Retail Group. Jones is not affected by the administration. Brantano is one of the first sizeable retailers to fall into difficulty this year after the key make-or-break Christmas trading period. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said that Alteri specialise in turning around failing business, but "it appears that Brantano's trading position was worse than than expected. Christmas trading, I'm told, was also below expectations." She understands that a number of possible buyers have already approached PwC. Mr Barrell added: "The administrators are continuing to trade the businesses as normal whilst we assess the trading strategy over the coming days and weeks. "Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work during the administration."	Discount shoe retailer Brantano has gone into administration, about four months after the chain was bought by an investment firm.
Parents of brides cannot invite more than 500 guests, and the number has been limited to 400 for grooms. The government also said that no more than seven main dishes can be served to "ensure that there is no wastage of any food items". An MP has also proposed a bill to impose a similar ban on expensive weddings across India. Weddings are expensive in Kashmir, and the traditional feast, locally called Wazwan, includes a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The state government said the order, which comes into effect from 1 April, was issued in response to public complaints about extravagance, waste and intrusive noise. The state had imposed a similar ban in 1984, but it was revoked after protests. Marriages are costly in other parts of India as well, and many people spend lavishly on food, clothes and entertainment. In November, the five-day wedding of businessman and former Karnataka state minister G Janardhana Reddy's daughter, Brahmani, with an estimated cost of about 5bn rupees ($74m; £59m), prompted outrage as millions of Indians struggled with a cash flow crisis. Among the extravagances were gold-plated invitation cards fitted with LCD screens, costing 10m rupees. Here are a few of the world's most expensive weddings:	The government in Indian-administered Kashmir has put curbs on excessively lavish weddings.
It is believed the same group of criminals are targeting Lye Valley Industrial Estate several times a week. West Midlands Police said they will put in place extra measures to help businesses. However, those with units at the site say they are worried not enough is being done. Bob Turnock, who operates from Lye Valley, said he had spoken to the force in an effort to improve security at the "demoralised" estate. "There needs to be a certain police presence down here, and they do need to act on it - it's destroying businesses," he said. Tetsuya Kuwaki, whose unit was the first to be broken into, said he is "exasperated" with the problem, and may consider moving his business. "We're looking to invest quite a lot back into the business recently, but at this rate every money that we put into the business is just going to get taken out by some lowlife," he said. "It feels like nothing's getting done and the thieves can take what they want." Supt Phil Dolby, from West Midlands Police, said a dedicated detective and new patrol strategy would be put in place to reassure businesses. He said the force would also work with British Transport Police to secure access from a nearby railway, and look at providing funding to strengthen security.	Business owners on a Black Country business park say they are not being given enough support to deal with a spate of break-ins.
The crash, which happened at the Rising Sun in North Bradley near Trowbridge at about 06:00 GMT, left a huge hole in the front of the building. Wiltshire Police said the driver was taken to Bath's Royal United Hospital for treatment to his injuries, which are not thought to be serious. Nobody was inside at the time of the crash, officers said. The building has been deemed to be structurally safe. The road next to the pub was closed for several hours but has since reopened.	A lorry driver has smashed through the front wall of a pub in Wiltshire.
The Project Loon team, part of the company’s X research lab, said it was now able to use machine learning to predict weather systems. It means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe. Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google’s “captain of moonshots”, Astro Teller, told reporters. "We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,” he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously. “Real users” will be able to use the system in the “coming months”, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place. Rural ambition Google’s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas. Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons. The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction. By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time. Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months. Spin off Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas. Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work. Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more “mature” moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in “no rush” to make Project Loon a stand-alone business. “The service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,” he said. "Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go. That has made the prospects of Loon even better than we had anticipated.” Falling out of the sky One key hurdle for the company to overcome is the reliability of its balloons. To date, the record for continuous balloon flight has been 190 days. At a research lab within Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, development teams painstakingly analyse each failed balloons on a huge scanner nicknamed “Billie Jean” owning to light panels reminiscent of the illuminating pavement in Michael Jackson’s iconic music video. Other technologies trying to achieve similar goals have been tested by Google and others. The company recently shut down Project Titan, an effort to use solar-powered drones to deliver connectivity to a wide area. The programme was cancelled owing to economic and technology difficulties, the company said. Facebook has attempted to work with similar technology. It’s Project Aquila drone, which is being developed in the UK, suffered a major setback when one of its craft crashed last June. On the challenge facing Project Loon, Mr Teller admitted that many at the company did not think it would ever actually work. “If we’d known how hard it was going to be, we probably never would have tried,” he wrote in a blog post published on Thursday.

Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme. GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character". Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients." The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June. Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had. "They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform. "If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them."

The limb was found in a garden in Cranwells Park on Wednesday and has been sent for forensic analysis, Avon and Somerset Police said. A force spokesman said detectives were "keeping an open mind" as to whether it was linked to two similar incidents in the city. All three feet have been found within a few hundred yards of each other. Tests showed the first foot found in Weston Park East in February was  "probably" a medical teaching aid. The second foot, found last month in the same area, is still undergoing tests. "The same officers are looking into the latest discoveries and will look to confirm beyond all reasonable doubt that they are linked and if there are any new lines of inquiry which can be taken forward," the spokesman added.	A third human foot has been found close to where two others were discovered earlier this year.
The move reunites the 21-year-old with former boss David Moyes, as well as ex-team-mates Donald Love and Paddy McNair who joined for a £5.5m fee this week. Belgium international Januzaj had asked to leave Old Trafford on a permanent transfer but United preferred a loan. He has scored five goals in 63 appearances for the club and is under contract until the summer of 2018. Januzaj spent four months on loan to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund last season, but played only 12 games before returning to his parent club. United boss Jose Mourinho said of the switch: "He fits in my plans. That is why he is on loan at a Premier League club "If he doesn't fit in my plans, I don't care where he is going, I just send him to Borussia Dortmund where he didn't play one match. He is talented."	Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj has joined fellow Premier League side Sunderland on a season-long loan.
In an email thanking his campaign team after voting closed, Mr Burnham said getting this far was "a real achievement". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said this was seen by some of his supporters as a concession of defeat. But a campaign source said this was "categorically not" the case. The winner of the leadership election will be announced on Saturday. Mr Burnham is up against Jeremy Corbyn, Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper in the contest. In his email, he told supporters the campaign had "tested us all on every level". He said: "But we have coped with the inevitable ups and downs with good humour and run a strong, positive and professional campaign of which you can all be very proud. "Most importantly, we have stayed true to our values and competitive right to the end of the race. "We end it with an outside but realistic chance of winning. That is a real achievement." Mr Burnham added that "thousands of ordinary, decent party members are now worried about where we are heading". Mr Corbyn only made it on to the ballot paper at the last minute when nominations were finalised in June but has become the bookies' favourite. On Twitter, he said it had been "an inspiring summer" regardless of the outcome of the election. This is it. The last minute phone banks, panics over missing ballots, final pleas from the candidates are done. The vote is over and now Labour's wait begins. Before the result though it seems that already the party has been changed, possibly forever by these extraordinary last few months. An unexpected candidate has done the unexpected and Jeremy Corbyn has put himself into the most likely position to win the contest. Strikingly, that is against the better judgement of nearly every single senior figure in the Labour Party, and crucially nearly all of its MPs. Read Laura's blog in full One of Mr Corbyn's supporters, Leeds East MP Richard Burgon, said many people would be "pleasantly surprised" at his leadership style if he won. "It will be a more collegiate and a more collectivist leadership which will include people," he said. "It will include MPs who don't agree with some of Jeremy's politics." Speaking to the BBC at Mr Corbyn's final rally in his Islington North constituency, Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey said the left-wing MP had already won in his eyes. He said Mr Corbyn had "lit up our movement in a way that I didn't think was possible" after the general election, adding: "That's a victory in itself." "Jeremy, in that calm fashion seems to have touched a pulse, and that pulse is about people rejecting the constant downbeat austerity message that's been coming out of politics for thirty five years," Mr McCluskey added. Angela Eagle, who is running for the deputy Labour leadership, told the BBC she would serve whichever leader is elected, adding that the party needed to capitalise on the "enthusiasm for politics" and "hope" the contest had generated. The contest has been plagued by internal rows over Labour's direction and concerns that non-party supporters have tried to influence the outcome. Labour has said efforts to weed out non-party supporters would continue up until results day. In the closing speech of her campaign, Ms Kendall - who has stressed the need for Labour to appeal to a broader section of the electorate - said she may have been "too blunt" at times. She added: "But my view is that in politics, as in life, you cannot deal with problems by ignoring or avoiding them." There have also been claims from some people that they did not receive their ballot papers in time to vote. London mayor hopeful David Lammy said 20% of supporters who his team spoke to had received nothing. Labour said ballots had been emailed and posted out correctly to everyone entitled to vote. The party said everyone who had not voted or said they did not have a ballot had received a final email reminder on Tuesday. Labour's new deputy leader will also be unveiled at the leadership conference on Saturday, and its London mayoral candidate will be announced on Friday.	Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham has told supporters he has an "outside but realistic chance" of winning the contest.
There was a protest in the public gallery after the decision on the Glyn Rhonwy pump storage project was made. The Snowdonia Society is concerned about its possible effects on wildlife, culture and heritage. But developer Quarry Battery Company (QBC) said it was the "missing piece of the jigsaw for renewables". The proposed pump storage scheme is based on the same principle as Dinorwig's First Hydro plant in Llanberis. By Iolo ap DafyddBBC Wales environment correspondent The value of pump storage is that it offers almost immediate access to electricity by allowing water to rush down the mountainside from one abandoned quarry - Cefn Du in this instance - through a pipe into hydroelectric generators and a lower reservoir in the second quarry Glyn Rhonwy. The water is then pumped back up the mountain at night when the price of electricity is cheaper. The biggest value is energy or electricity when needed. Demand in the UK is not constant. The focus is now on smaller sites, including using old quarries, because large holes in the mountains have already been excavated to mine slates over the past 100 to 150 years. So provided the company can find investors, contractors for this scheme could build and engineer smaller scale pump storage commercially. Water there is pumped uphill to a reservoir and then released back down through a turbine to generate electricity to sell on to suppliers. Under the proposals, a dam will be built at the upper reservoir. QBC managing director Dave Holmes said the project can help Britain "keep the lights on" and was environmentally more acceptable than another Dinorwig-sized facility. He said: "Our scheme for the Glyn Rhonwy quarries is just the start. "By putting small-scale storage near to centres of energy generation such as wind farms, and others near centres of heavy consumption such as major cities, we will cut down on distribution losses and network transmission costs, making whole regions of the UK increasingly self-sufficient in renewable electricity. "Not only will pumped storage smooth out the supply of electricity, but it will enable conventional power stations to be stood down, rather than kept on standby to fill gaps in generation. "This will save further costs and carbon emissions." The Snowdonia Society has said it was concerned about the effects of construction. The society is also concerned about how the scheme will be connected to the national grid, fearing that extra pylons would have to be built. The Open Spaces Society had added its objection, claiming the scheme would encroach on common land and be an eyesore. It previously said the applicant needed to be aware that it could not develop common land unless it offered land in exchange. The site has previously been the subject of planning applications for schemes ranging from a large ski dome to a mountain biking centre.	Controversial plans for a £100m mini hydroelectric power scheme on the edge of Snowdonia National Park have been backed by Gwynedd councillors.
The same could be said of the US Federal Reserve's highly anticipated decision, and the ensuing markets and currency reactions in Asia. When Janet Yellen failed to raise rates in September, pointing the finger at China's economic instability, markets in Asia went beserk. But this time around don't expect a meltdown on regional stock markets. Asian investors are, frankly, fed up with waiting for the Fed. This was a decision that everyone has been expecting. In fact, according to a Reuters poll, the probability that the Fed was going to raise rates stood at 90% before the meeting. So investors in Asia are prepared - and have been for the last couple of years. And they've been reacting - we've seen money being pulled out of equities in emerging markets in preparation for this move. Capital outflows from emerging markets are on track to exceed the amount that went into them this year for the first time since 1988, according to the Institute of International Finance. So if immediate reaction isn't the concern - then what are the longer-term consequences of this rate rise for Asia? Here are the three things you should watch out for: When the US raises rates, the US dollar tends to rise which means other currencies depreciate against it. And that's going to hurt some emerging markets. Moody's has already highlighted the issues for emerging markets: the ones where domestic challenges have added to exchange rate problems will be the worst off. So in Asia - that's Indonesia, Malaysia and possibly India. Then there's debt - or what some are calling the "perfect storm" for emerging markets. RBC Capital Markets says emerging markets currencies will be weaker in 2016 and that Asia's debt levels as a percentage of GDP have converged to those of the developed world. That's worrying for Asian companies who have a lot of their debt in US dollars, but make their profits in local currencies - especially if there are more rate rises to come. And that's what many in the market are betting on, as Shang Jin-Wei, chief economist at the Asian Development Bank told me. US rate rises tend to be followed by a series of rate rises so "from that point of view, even though we're very prepared, there can be some elements of surprises." So what's an Asian central bank to do? Raising rates like the US means that you risk stifling growth and hitting consumption. Cutting rates means more capital outflow and a weaker currency - which could lead to more emerging market debt. But it's not all doom and gloom. Capital Economics says that Asian economies are much less vulnerable now than they've been in the past to deal with all of this and believe the economic environment in Asia should improve next year. So until then Asian central banks - and Asian investors - are likely going to have a tread a fine balance, preparing themselves for the worst, and ready to react when the timing is right.	Life, it has been said, is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
The conference, organised by Mankind Initiative and held at the Keepmoat Stadium, was chaired by former abuse victim Ian McNicholl. His ex-girlfriend is serving a seven year prison sentence for GBH and assault. Mankind Initiative said men too often are "too ashamed" to report abuse. Mr McNicholl, 52, from East Yorkshire, said: "Far too many men feel they're to blame, they're weak and they're alone often because they do not think there is support for them. "We aim to change that so no man suffers in silence and realise they can escape and rebuild their lives." Mankind Initiative said male domestic abuse figures are particularly high in South Yorkshire. In the last three years, police received 19,459 calls from men but the charity said the real figures are likely to be higher because of under-reporting by men. Mr McNicholl, who was in an abusive relationship for 18 months, said: "By the time I was rescued by police I had a fractured skull, multiple fractures to my cheekbone, I've had the septum on my nose replaced, I have a scar from an assault with a steam iron. "It almost took my life. She told me in her last assault she was going to kill me. I was also on the point of suicide." He said he did not report it earlier because he feared for his life and was "emotionally and physically ground-down". 130 delegates from around the country attended the conference. Mankind Initiative said men often do not report abuse because they feel "embarrassed", feel it "undermines their identity as a man" and "fear they won't be believed."	One in five domestic violence victims in Yorkshire are men, according to a charity holding a conference in Doncaster.
Police said he was armed with a stolen gun and they had been tracking him. They blamed the violence on a small group of people. Four officers have been placed on administrative leave. The wounded man's name and age have not been released by police. But the St Louis Post-Dispatch identified him as 18-year-old Tyrone Harris, having spoken to his father, the paper said. The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 sparked demonstrations across the United States. Although Mr Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing by a grand jury and by the US Department of Justice, the teenager's death fuelled a national protest movement against the use of excessive force by police officers. A justice department investigation also found widespread racial bias in the Ferguson police force. What happened in Ferguson in 2014? US Dept of Justice report on Ferguson racism Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of people stood silent for four-and-a-half minutes at the spot where Michael Brown was killed, representing the number of hours that his body lay in the street unattended. The BBC's Aleem Maqbool, who is in Ferguson, says most people at Sunday's gathering felt little had changed since Michael Brown was shot dead a year ago. At the end of a sombre, peaceful day of commemorations, shots were heard at about 23:15 local time on Sunday (04:15 Monday GMT) as a large crowd gathered on West Florissant Avenue, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters that after "an exchange of gunfire between two groups" the suspect, believed by police to be armed, left and encountered officers in an unmarked SUV. He said the suspect fired on the vehicle and the plainclothes detectives returned fire from inside the van. There was then a further exchange of fire after the officers left the vehicle. The gunmen "were criminals; they weren't protesters," he said, adding that the officers were not wearing body cameras. Photos from the scene showed a young black man lying bloodied on the ground. He was face down and handcuffed. President Barack Obama announced a federal programme to help pay for lapel-mounted cameras for US police to record their interactions in the wake of the nationwide protests on perceived policing injustices. There have been a number of high profile shootings of unarmed black men in US cities in recent months. The most recent case involved 19-year-old Christian Taylor who was shot dead by a white police officer after he was spotted on surveillance footage vandalising cars in Arlington, Texas, on Friday.	A man has been critically injured in Ferguson, Missouri, in an exchange of gunfire with police at a rally marking the anniversary of the killing of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

It says "cosmetic lightening and hygiene creams... that de-pigment the skin... are now forbidden". Whitening creams have been popular for years among young women - and some men - across Africa, who believe they make them more beautiful. But medical experts say they may cause cancer, diabetes, severe skin conditions and other diseases. "The number of people with side-effects caused by these medicines is really high," Christian Doudouko, a member of Ivory Coast's pharmaceutical authority, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Latest African news updates Africa: Where black is not really beautiful British consultant dermatologist Justine Kluk told the BBC the major concern was over unregulated products, which may contain ingredients such as mercury or excessive amounts of steroids. "If one thinks about steroids being present in these products, they're often present in much higher quantities than we would prescribe," she said. She said the creams can cause a variety of health issues, such as "acne, thinning of the skin, glaucoma or cataracts if applied near the eyes". "Or if applied liberally to the whole body, [they can] cause high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, weight gain, mood disturbance due to absorption of large amounts of steroids," she said. However, analysts say the ban may not stop people buying the products. They are still used in The Gambia despite a ban. South Africa has the world's toughest laws against skin lighteners, having prohibited the most active ingredient - hydroquinone, but a University of Cape Town study found that more than a third of South African women still buy them. The use of whitening creams in Africa is most widespread in Nigeria - where more than 75% of women buy them, according to a 2008 UN Environment Programme study.	Ivory Coast has banned skin-whitening creams because of health concerns, the health ministry says.
It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease. "We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out," says Mr Badr. "None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through." Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club. Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers. And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space. Mr Badr says: "I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. "That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve." Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020. "When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin," says Mr Badr. "But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time." While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. "The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent," he says. "In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars." Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. "It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them," he says. "There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging." But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. "A club really has three businesses going on," says Mr Rosenfield. "It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. "There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year." Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says: "Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. "If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500. "And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions." Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. "The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? "Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience." While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. "The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits," he says. "It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. "Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while." But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says: "We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'. "But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet. "And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof."	Have you heard the one about the computer programmer who bought a failing comedy club in Texas and turned it into a million dollar a year business?
Haseeb Hamayoon, 28, sent the image to friends and a co-accused branding the officer "kaffir" - non-believer - London's Woolwich Crown Court was told. Prosecutors say Mr Hamayoon, Yousaf Syed, 20, and Nadir Syed, 22, plotted an attack using a Rambo-style knife. The cousins deny all charges. The image, allegedly taken on 19 September 2014, shows the back of the officer and was apparently taken by someone in a car. Mr Hamayoon wrote: "Look at this kaffir. Hounslow parking lot." Nadir Syed wrote back: "How can you pray in such a place?" Mr Hamayoon replied: "You're right I'm walking out. This kaffir cop yeh.  Looking inside every car who's in there. I gave him a dirty look." Mr Syed replied: "He's looking for u mate. Mi5 sent him to keep eye on y." The messages were exchanged on encrypted messaging service Telegram. Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court: "You'll see on Mr Hamayoon's mobile phone two photos taken that show a police officer or PCSO walking away from the car and around a car park. "The photos are taken from the driver's seat of the car. Those images are created on the telephone. It's quite clear what Mr Hamayoon was writing messages about." Two days later, IS militants issued a "fatwa" calling on followers to attack Westerners. It implored them to: "Rig the roads with explosives for them. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads." Prosecutors claim the trio plotted to carry out a terror attack in the UK. Mr Hamayoon and Nadir Syed, from Hounslow, west London and Yousaf Syed, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, filmed themselves stamping on a Remembrance Day poppy and were obsessed with the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby, it is claimed. The trial continues.	A supporter of so-called Islamic State photographed a police officer in a mosque car park before plotting to carry out a knife attack around Remembrance Sunday 2014, a court heard.
Dressed in a suit, he handed out currencies in exchange for sterling to customers at the Asda in Trafford Park, police said. He then emptied the safe into a bag before walking out of the store at 15:45 BST on 29 July. Police said they were still searching for the man, described as in his mid 20s or 30s, Asian and of slim build. A 22-year-old woman has been arrested and bailed on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.	A man has walked away with £40,000 from a superstore in Manchester after posing as a manager at the Bureau de Change.
The pensioner, who is in her 70s, had gone into a church on William St on Friday and disturbed a man as he was trying to prise open a donation box. He left the church when he saw her, but returned and demanded money from her. "At first, the lady refused to hand over her purse but when this man hit her with the crowbar, she did give him a sum of money," police said. Det Sgt Stephen Wilson said the pensioner was "left shaken and has some bruising to her left shoulder". Officers investigating the robbery have arrested a 45-year-old man. He was detained on suspicion of attempted theft and robbery; going equipped for theft; and possession of an offensive weapon with intent.	An elderly woman has been hit with a crowbar during a robbery at a church in Portadown, County Armagh.
He told Reuters that the EU should not interfere with "domestic issues". He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights. The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law. Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros. Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months. Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: "No. Why should we? "These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues." The minister added that "my Polish colleague" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary. EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously. Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law. Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines. Meanwhile, draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon. Human rights groups say it would stigmatise them as "foreign-backed" organisations. Last month, the deputy head of the bloc's executive Commission, Frans Timmermans, warned action would be taken in coming weeks if there were no positive developments.

Home Retail Group said that like-for-like sales at Argos fell 1.1% in the eight weeks to 27 February, compared to a fall of 2.2% in the previous quarter. The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff. Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos. Last month, a £1.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's £1.4bn offer. Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business. Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers. The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added. Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been "another rather eventful period" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales. Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos. The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a "world-leading" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: "Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong." Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys. However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos. Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer.	Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the Christmas period.
Yet for some chocolate firms the fact that most Easter eggs are hollow is more than just disappointing, it's problematic. "It sounds ridiculous, but there is a lot of air in Easter eggs relative to their value in weight," says Helen Pattinson, co-founder of boutique British chocolate chain Montezuma's. The oval shape of eggs and the boxes required to keep them intact means that, compared to the amount of space they take up in a shipping container, it is impossible for Montezuma's to charge the end customer enough to make a decent profit. Foreign sales account for about a fifth of the company's overall sales and for this financial year, ending in May, it expects exports to hit the £1m mark for the first time. Despite the strong demand from abroad, the firm is yet to send its chocolate eggs overseas. "The economics just haven't added up so far," says Mrs Pattinson, who co-founded the firm in 2000 with her husband Simon. The company has six shops in the South East of England and sells directly to customers in the US and Europe via its website, and further afield via export arrangements. So far most of its overseas customers have come via a partnership deal with a large US retailer. Despite the more established reputation of Swiss and Belgian chocolatiers, Mrs Pattinson says she is seeing a growing demand for British-made chocolate. "The most contemporary artisan foodies are beginning to realise Britain is a fantastic producer of chocolate," she says. Last year, the UK exported a whopping £245m worth of chocolate, up by almost a quarter on 2015. Exports of unfilled chocolates and chocolate products, which include Easter eggs, totalled just over £30m, up 3% on 2015. While the vast majority of these went to EU countries, the biggest growth was in exports to non-EU countries which increased by almost a fifth, according to the Department for International Trade. It is a trend that hasn't escaped the notice of Sean Ramsden, chief executive of Ramsden International. The family firm specialises in exporting British food overseas and Mr Ramsden says Easter is its busiest period after Christmas. The awkward shape of chocolate eggs isn't a problem for the company because it supplies a much wider range of products, enabling it to mix Easter eggs with other food orders. "Easter eggs are a popular UK product and they're very exportable. They [Easter eggs] are not as advanced in other countries," he says. When the Grimsby-based firm first started exporting in 1970, business was largely driven by expats. Marmite, brown sauce and baked beans were the items most in demand in the company's markets in Spain, Portugal, France, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Now it delivers to 130 countries and turnover last year was £50m. Mr Ramsden says the company's growth reflects demand from a growing global middle class. "The food becomes premium by virtue of being imported. There is an element of snob value in certain markets," he says. Particularly in Asia, he says, customers are keen to have "something a little bit different or a bit more exclusive" such as a foreign brand. But he says many of its customers also have an international outlook, with second homes in the UK, for example, and a genuine affection for British food. Sharan Gill, who lives in Hong Kong, says she always buys imported chocolate eggs for her children at Easter. "It's a tradition amongst my friends too, both Western and Asian. I spend between 100 to 150 Hong Kong dollars (£10-£15; $13-$19) on chocolates for the annual Easter egg hunt, which my kids thoroughly enjoy. "Easter seems to be a growing trend, partly because clubs and restaurants promote it extensively. "Plus Hong Kong has a large expat community, a large proportion of which consists of Westerners, for whom Easter is an established tradition. It is also celebrated by the predominantly Catholic Filipino community who form a large part of the domestic helper workforce," she says. The fervour surrounding the Christian festival has reached such fever pitch that the home and lifestyle gurus at Good Housekeeping magazine recently declared the occasion "a second Christmas". Theresa May criticises Cadbury over Easter egg hunt Co-op's 'Treat your daughter' Easter egg adverts changed It is not just small firms benefiting from the growing sense of occasion. Marks and Spencer says it exports a number of its popular eggs to its 468 shops overseas, with them selling particularly well in Hong Kong, Western Europe and the Czech Republic. "We're seeing double-digit growth on sales of our Easter eggs internationally - with people buying into both our large 'giftable' eggs as well as impulse purchasing small bags of chocolate foiled eggs and bigger bags of eggs for Easter egg hunts - an event which is increasing in popularity," says a spokeswoman. People really like the licensed character eggs and Star Wars' R2D2 is currently the best seller internationally, she adds. While market research firm Mintel doesn't track British chocolate exports, its figures show people around the world are eating more chocolate eggs. "In Brazil, for example, the trade association ABICAB reported that 95 million chocolate Easter eggs were sold in 2016, a 19% increase over 2015. In that country, Easter eggs make up a major percentage of annual chocolate revenues," says global food and drink analyst Marcia Mogelonsky. "In Ireland, consumers spent more than 40m euros (£34m; $42m) on Easter eggs in 2016, while the UK Easter egg market was valued at £220m." It is a market that Montezuma's Mrs Pattinson is obviously keen to exploit. "It's about putting our new product development heads on to find ones that don't have so much air inside," she laughs.	Cracking open a large chocolate egg to find nothing in the middle is one of life's perennial disappointments.
The IFG says legislation will be needed to establish new policies on areas such as customs and immigration. The extra measures will place "a huge burden" on Parliament and government departments, the think tank says. The attitude of the SNP may also affect the passage of Brexit laws, it adds. In its report, Legislating Brexit, the IFG says that with the average Queen's Speech announcing only 20 new bills, the introduction of 15 Brexit bills before the UK even exits the EU "will leave very little space for non-Brexit related legislation". The report comes as Theresa May travels to Swansea with Brexit Secretary David Davis, where she will talk about the "precious union" of the UK. The prime minister will meet First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones, as well as local businesses, as she tries to show she is including all areas of Britain in negotiations with the EU. Mrs May will say: "I want every part of the United Kingdom to be able to make the most of the opportunities ahead." The IFG report anticipates the new bills will be in addition to the Great Repeal Bill, which will scrap the 1972 European Communities Act that paved the way for the UK to enter the then-EEC, ending the legal authority of EU law. The IFG - an independent charity that aims to increase government effectiveness - says departments will need "ruthlessly to prioritise" other legislation and find non-legislative routes to get the laws through, particularly given the government's narrow Commons majority. It warns that this will mean ministers having to achieve a fine balance between giving too little parliamentary scrutiny and too prolonged, in-depth examination of Brexit-related legislation. The IFG also argued that "a lack of clarity" about the role the devolved legislatures will play in legislating for Brexit could pose a problem. "The attitude that the Scottish National Party (SNP) takes to the passage of Brexit-related legislation in Westminster could affect the smoothness with which that legislation passes through Parliament if they join forces with the Labour Party and Conservative rebels," the report says. Dr Hannah White, IFG's director of research, said the government had finite resources to draft new legislation and Brexit bills would take a "big chunk" out of its capacity to legislate in other areas. "In the first session after the 2015 election the government passed 23 bills," she told BBC Radio 4's Today. "So that's roughly the capacity that there is in government to draft these bills and in Parliament, in terms of parliamentary time, to pass them." The reality, she suggested, was that the government's domestic priorities would "take a hit in the next couple of sessions". "There'll have to be some really tight prioritisation in government to work out what else is going to be done aside from the Brexit legislation. "The legislation required for Brexit will leave little parliamentary time for anything else - and making a success of it will require a large volume of bills and secondary legislation to be passed by Parliament against a hard deadline." The Queen gave Royal Assent to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill last week, clearing the way for Theresa May to start talks to leave the European Union. The Bill allows the prime minister to notify Brussels that the UK is leaving the EU, with a two-year process of exit negotiations to follow. Mrs May says she will trigger the process by the end of the month.	Parliament might have to scrutinise up to 15 new bills to deliver Brexit, leaving little time for other legislation, the Institute for Government has warned.
Dominic Elliott, 23, died in March after he was taken to hospital from the world-renowned artist's house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. The inquest in Hull heard Mr Elliott had taken cocaine, ecstasy and temazepam before he drank the liquid. Mr Hockney was in bed asleep at the time and was "completely unaware" of what had happened, the inquest heard. The artist's former partner, John Fitzherbert, told the hearing he drove Mr Elliott to Scarborough Hospital in the early hours of the morning. Mr Fitzherbert said that in the day leading up to the incident, he and Mr Elliott had drunk alcohol, taken cocaine and smoked cannabis. Pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd told the court that temazepam and ecstasy were also found in his body. Dr Shepherd said the acid severely burned Mr Elliott's mouth, tongue and throat before perforating his stomach. Mr Hockney, who was not in court, said in a statement read out at the inquest that he had been asleep in his bedroom and woke up on the morning of 17 March to be told Mr Elliott had died. The 76-year-old artist said he had gone to bed at 21:00 GMT the night before and despite seeing Mr Fitzherbert and his chief assistant, Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima, at midnight there was "nothing out of the ordinary". He did not see Mr Elliott before going to bed, Mr Hockney said. He said Mr Elliott and Mr Fitzherbert had been in a relationship for about four months and described how a number of people lived in his five-bedroom former guesthouse, including Mr De Lima. Mr Hockney said he had a large double bedroom where he also did portraits. He said Mr Fitzherbert had another large, self-contained room and they both led separate lives. He said he had known Mr Elliott for about 10 years and described how he helped him with all aspects of his studio work. But the artist said he only knew him "professionally" and he did not "really know him in a social aspect". He said Mr Elliott sometimes drank a lot and this gave him a "Jekyll and Hyde" character. "I cannot comment on any of the lifestyle habits he has," Mr Hockney said in his statement. He said he had not been well at the time of the incident due to a mini-stroke. Mr Fitzherbert, who was present in court, described how he and Mr Elliott had spent the Friday night drinking and smoking cannabis. He said that on the Saturday morning, after Mr Hockney had left the house, Mr Elliott started laughing hysterically before jumping head first off a 9ft (3m) high internal balcony. Asked by the coroner, Professor Paul Marks, why he did this, Mr Fitzherbert replied: "No idea". He said Mr Elliott was not seriously hurt. "I just saw his feet going over," he told the court. Mr Fitzherbert described how Mr Elliott later smoked more cannabis and they both fell asleep again together. He said he was woken by Mr Elliott in the middle of the night asking to be taken to hospital. Mr Fitzherbert told the court he found a bottle of toilet and drain cleaner in the sink but did not connect it to Mr Elliott at that time. Pathologist Dr Shepherd had told the inquest that Mr Elliott would have been in extreme pain and Mr Fitzherbert was asked repeatedly whether he noticed this as he tended to his friend. Mr Fitzherbert was also asked why he later called Mr De Lima to get him to tidy up the house. He said Mr Hockney had not been well and he wanted to "shield him" from any "scandal involving drugs in his house". Asked about why Mr Elliott did what he did, Mr Fitzherbert replied: "I do not have any answers." "I think he liked living on the edge," he said. Mr Elliott's mother, Karen Kent, told the inquest how her son met Mr Fitzherbert at a family barbeque when he was 15 years old. It was Mr Fitzherbert who introduced him to Mr Hockney. Mr Elliott's best friend, Christopher Towland, told the court he had recently become worried about his friend's gambling. The inquest was adjourned until Friday.	David Hockney's assistant died after drinking acid at the painter's home, an inquest has heard.
Ross-shire Engineering has secured the potential investment across the next five years supplying equipment to Scottish Water. The firm in Muir of Ord has already created 100 new jobs to allow it meet the needs of the utility company. The investment has also provided additional job security to the existing 273 staff members. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the company's premises near Inverness on Monday, following a tour of Nigg Energy Park on the Cromarty Firth. She said: "Ensuring a strong rural economy is crucial to Scotland's success. "This funding Ross-Shire Engineering has secured provides a hugely welcome boost in providing skilled jobs and investment across the Highlands, as well as providing vital utility services to Scotland's homes and businesses. "In particular, I am delighted they will be investing in their already strong apprenticeship job programme, providing vital training and employment to young people living in the Highlands in a competitive jobs market." The first minister added: "Last week when I set out my Programme for Government I promised to protect Scotland's interests, particularly our economic interests, in the wake of the EU referendum. "Driving sustainable economic growth is at the heart of that, and I am committed to ensuring this government does all it can to ensure Scotland's rural economy remains prosperous for future generations."	Funding of up to £200m has helped create new jobs at a Highlands engineering company.
The Red Rose, on the brink of defeat by Surrey this week, have lost two and drawn five of their previous seven County Championship games. Lancashire won three of their opening five Division One games this season, but last triumphed in May. "We are looking behind us now," Giles told BBC Radio Lancashire. "It would be nice if results went our way elsewhere around the country, but ultimately we can only do what we do and we need to play better cricket for the last three matches. "We're getting a bit of a wake-up call here as there is a lot of cricket to be played and it is a very tight division. "At the moment we're far from safe so we've got to play better cricket." Lancashire sit fourth in the table after 12 County Championship matches, 17 points above second-from-bottom Hampshire in the relegation places.	Lancashire cricket director Ashley Giles is concerned their end-of-season form could see them dragged into a relegation fight.
It has led to calls for Douglas Ross to stand down from his frontbench role as the party's justice spokesman. He was an assistant referee at the clash between Sporting Lisbon and Real Madrid on Tuesday. But it meant he was unable to attend a justice committee meeting in the Scottish Parliament. Mr Ross earns up to Â£40,000 a year as a self-employed specialist assistant football referee, according to his Scottish Parliament register of interests. He is also a councillor with Moray Council and his trip to Portugal meant he missed its policy and resources committee meeting on Tuesday. SNP MSP Ben Macpherson said it was not the first time Mr Ross's refereeing job had affected his parliamentary work. It has been reported that he missed a key vote in parliament when he was in Switzerland taking part in World Cup referee training. Mr Macpherson said: "The arrogance and blatant disrespect of 'three jobs' Tory Douglas Ross is simply staggering. "Last time the whistle was blown on one of his refereeing junkets the Tories claimed it was just a 'one off'. But he's at it again - and this time it should be a straight red card. "Obviously he values his Â£40k-a-year weekend job - and all-expenses paid trips to Lisbon and other European cities - more than his responsibilities as an MSP and local councillor, demonstrating complete contempt for the people who elected him. "If Douglas Ross can't pitch up to do his job, it's time for relegation - he should either take a step back from refereeing or stand down from Holyrood's justice committee with immediate effect, and Ruth Davidson should give him the boot from her frontbench team." A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: "Earlier this year Ben Macpherson asked Douglas to kindly speak to clubs in his constituency about refereeing - presumably this invitation has now been rescinded." Mr Ross did not comment.	A leading Scottish Conservative MSP missed a parliamentary committee to referee a Champions League match in Portugal.
Andrew Barnes, 61, hit Luke Down with four heavy axe blows to his head, leaving him with brain injuries and close to death. Barnes, from Topsham, Devon, admitted attempted murder and was jailed for 15 and a half years at Exeter Crown Court. The judge described the axe attack as an "impetuous moment of madness". More on Andrew Barnes, and other Devon news Mr Down, 29, had been staying at Barnes's flat for free when he was attacked with the long-handled axe as he slept in the lounge. He had been paying his way by bringing round alcohol and food, but Barnes claimed he had become violent and abusive towards him, the court heard. The trigger for the attack was Mr Down's threat to claim squatter's rights and barricade himself in the flat. The court heard how the injuries would have been fatal if Barnes had removed the protective cover over the blade. Jailed Andrew Barnes was once a drug cartel pilot, flying cocaine from Colombia to the United States. Public school educated at Blundells in Tiverton, Barnes moved to America where he ran his own freight airline in the late 1970s. But his business ran into financial trouble and in the early 1980s Barnes was employed by the Medellin cartel, flying their cocaine to remote US airstrips and Caribbean islands. The planes left Colombia loaded with cocaine and returned crammed with so many dollar bills that drug lords such as Pablo Escobar built apartments with millions hidden in the cavity walls. Barnes worked mainly for Carlos Lehder, who he testified against at his trial in Jacksonville in 1988. He was jailed for eight years in the US after admitting drug smuggling, before being moved to a witness protection scheme. He returned to Britain in the late 1990s and descended into a spiral of alcohol abuse. He moved into a flat owned by his family in Topsham and worked for 18 months at the SPCK religious bookshop on Cathedral Green. In July 2001 he set light to the 15th century building housing the bookshop, causing Â£200,000 damage and forcing the evacuation of the neighbouring Ship Inn. He also set light to a boat on the banks of the River Exe after the owner refused to sell it to him, and was jailed for four years. He was a well-known figure in Exeter, Exmouth and Topsham, regaling people with tall stories of his exploits as a drug-smuggling pilot. Source: SnowBird: The Rise and Fall of a Medellin Drug Pilot Sentencing Barnes over the axe attack, Judge Mr Justice Dingemans told him: "You acted impetuously and on the spur of the moment. "While he [Mr Down] has made a remarkable physical recovery, he is going to have very serious long term health consequences. "This was an spontaneous attempt to kill because you were fed up with Mr Down saying he was going to claim squatter's rights and also lying on your bed "There is significant mitigation in the fact that he undoubtedly provoked you, although that is not to say there was any justification for this moment of madness."	A former drug cartel's pilot has been jailed for trying to kill his unwanted lodger with an axe as he slept.
Williams, who took Cuthbert's place on the wing during the Six Nations, will miss Wales' first two warm up matches following foot surgery. Ex-Wales centre James says Cuthbert faces a big task to win the shirt back. "He'll be very lucky if he gets back in," he said. "I don't think he's put his hand up this season." Cardiff Blues' back Cuthbert, 25, has not played for Wales since their 26-23 win over Scotland in February at Murrayfield, their second match of Six Nations. He was left out of the matchday squads altogether for their three remaining fixtures. The previously prolific Cuthbert failed to score in 11 of the 14 matches he played for his region in the Pro12 during 2014-15, but crossed twice in their final fixture of the campaign against bottom side Zebre. He has been included in Wales' 47-man World Cup training squad which will be trimmed down to 31 at the end of August and James told Radio Wales Sport that the winger needs to improve. "It's down to mental attitude possibly," the 2001 British Lion said. "It depends how he goes in the training camp. "If I was in the training camp and I was one of the backs I'd see this as a massive opportunity to really step up my game, show what you can do and put your hands up." Wales head coach Warren Gatland is "optimistic" Williams, 24, will recover in time to take part in the World Cup. James says losing the Scarlets' back would be a setback for Wales, who are already without injured centre Jonathan Davies (knee). "It would be a massive blow," said James. "He's certainly a valuable commodity to have in the back division. "He seems to create a hell of a lot of try-scoring opportunities, which we've seen him doing time and time again for Scarlets, but also for Wales this season. So let's hope he makes a speedy recovery."	Alex Cuthbert would be "lucky" to regain his Wales place even if Liam Williams is ruled out of the Rugby World Cup, according to Dafydd James.
I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasé attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. "I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches," he tells me, "where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. "The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story." The Tor Project's website has a section called "Abuse FAQ". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the "guns don't kill people" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. "I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. "It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists." I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. "I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor," Dingledine insists. "Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there." In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has "cracked" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. "As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. "Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect." Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. "Which is frustrating," Dingledine interjects, "Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy." Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading "Tor Stinks… but it could be worse", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: "We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time." Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. "A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet." The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. "About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely," Dingledine says. "Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thing…. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase." The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. "I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries," he says. ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370	When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence.
The Nottinghamshire golfer partnered Masters champion Danny Willett on the Sunday at Augusta, then Dustin Johnson on the final day of the US Open at Oakmont. "I hadn't had those feelings for a while, that buzz and that rush of adrenaline," Westwood said. "It was great to get them back, even if it ended in disappointment." The 43-year-old stands 39th in the world rankings. He has done well on both previous trips to Troon, finishing tied 10th in 1997 and fourth in 2004, while he came third just down the Ayrshire coast at Turnberry in 2009. The bookmakers see it differently, rating him a lot higher. He is the 12th shortest price on offer at 40-1, shorter than not only Willett but also four comparatively recent former Open winners - defending champion Zach Johnson, Ernie Els (2002 and 2012) Louis Oosthuizen (2010) and Padraig Harrington (2007 and 2008). "I feel like I'm back to the stage where I turn up fully expecting to play well, a bit like the way when I was winning for fun a few years back," said Westwood. Find out how to get into golf with our special guide. "That's down to the way I'm swinging a club, and the way I am mentally. Hiding in a darkened room and cursing my luck is never going to be my style. "After putting myself in the frame in both majors this year, I'm sure I'll be a bit more relaxed if I can get in the mix at Troon. "I've been through so many ups and downs now that nothing's ever going to faze me, and I really like the course." The former world number one continued: "I had a great weekend in 2004 when I finished 67-68 and holed a really long putt on the last on the Sunday from 35 feet. In fact, I've played well there both times the Open has been played there." Westwood has come close to victory so many times in major championships. His total of nine top-three finishes is comfortably the most of any golfer not to have won one of golf's big four events - the Masters, the US Open, the Open or the US PGA. And, on five occasions, he has had to stand by and watch mates from Chubby Chandler's same management team - Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel, Rory McIlroy, Darren Clarke and Willett - all win their first major. But, in three successive years, from 2011 to 2013, the Open was won by a fortysomething. Phil Mickelson was 43 when he won at Muirfield in 2013. Both Westwood's great friend Darren Clarke (at Sandwich in 2011) and Els (at Royal Lytham in 2012) were 42, while Mark O'Meara was 41 when he triumphed at Royal Birkdale in 1998. Like allowing a good claret time to mature, when it comes to finding the winner of a Claret Jug, turning 40 is clearly not the worst age to be. English golf's big hitters: Along with Westwood (39th), there are currently six other English players inside the world's top 50 all taking up their invites to Royal Troon - Yorkshiremen Willett (ninth) and Matthew Fitzpatrick (43rd), Hampshire's Justin Rose (11th), Bristol's Chris Wood (22nd), Cheltenham's Paul Casey (29th) and Nuneaton's Andy Sullivan (36th). The old-timers: Buckinghamshire's Luke Donald (15 Open appearances), Swindon's David Howell (13), Surrey's Ross Fisher (eight), Staffordshire's Robert Rock (seven) and London's Anthony Wall (six) have all been familiar figures at the Open over the past two decades. The under-exposed: London's James Morrison has only played twice, but has performed well each time (tied 23rd in 2012, tied 20th in 2015), while Southport's Tommy Fleetwood is out to better successive missed cuts in 2014 and 2015. Essex's Matt Southgate (2014) and London's Andrew Johnston (2011) both missed the cut in their one previous Open appearance. As for last week's Scottish Open runner-up Tyrrell Hatton, this will be a fifth Open in six years for the former Bucks, Berks & Oxon amateur - but the 24-year-old from Marlow, now up to 68th in the world, is yet to make the cut. The first-timers: As well as Hampshire amateur Scott Gregory, six English professionals will be making their Open debut - Lancashire's Jack Senior, London's James Heath, Merseyside's Paul Howard, Northamptonshire's Ryan Evans, Watford's Callum Shinkwin and Lincolnshire's Dave Coupland.

Froch, 38, who announced his retirement in July, has been training every day and predicted he would beat IBF super-middleweight champion James DeGale, 29. "It's an easy job for me and he's world champion," said Froch. "Get my old belt back, show them all how it's done and then retire. There'd be something satisfying about that." Froch is a four-time world super-middleweight champion who won 33 of his 35 fights, 24 victories by knockout. But the Nottingham boxer has not fought since he knocked out fellow Briton George Groves to retain the WBA and IBF titles in May 2014. Media playback is not supported on this device In May, DeGale beat Andre Dirrell on points to claim the vacant IBF super-middleweight belt and become the first Briton to win a professional world title and an Olympic gold. Froch said if DeGale beats Romanian-born former IBF super-middleweight champion Lucian Bute in December that would give him motivation to return. "I always said once I've retired, I won't come back, but 18 months on from my last fight, I'm starting to think to myself 'I'm fit, strong, in good shape'," said Froch. "But it's a big if. I might just stick with poker. The desire's gone, it's getting the desire back. What would I need? It might be DeGale beating Bute."	Former world champion Carl Froch has said he would consider returning to the ring next spring for one fight to reclaim his title.
A report said the force was inadequate at protecting vulnerable victims. Surrey Police boss Nick Ephgrave said the force was good at preventing crime but this potentially came at the expense of investigations. Inspector Zoe Billingham said Surrey showed a "commendably strong commitment to keeping people safe from harm". She said the force had strong, mature neighbourhood police teams who worked well with councils, and neighbourhood officers had more training than in other forces. But she said: "The way the force investigates more complex crime requiring specialist investigations is still not good enough. "Many investigations that we reviewed were not of an acceptable standard and there were long delays in examining computers and mobile phones for evidence." She said the force needed to improve its understanding of the threat posed by organised crime, improve its process for mapping those groups, and fully mobilise its neighbourhood teams in the fight against organised crime. Mr Ephgrave, temporary chief constable, said the force was already tackling concerns by increasing resources to protect the vulnerable, and providing more training, better process and use of systems, and a culture change in how the force operated. He said: "None of these things can provide an instant fix but together they are starting to deliver positive results." A separate report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in December last year found Surrey Police's approach to protecting vulnerable people to be inadequate. Surrey police and crime commissioner Kevin Hurley said changes were already in place, including a change in chief constable. This month it emerged that Mr Hurley had considered seeking Ms Owens' dismissal as Surrey Police chief. She resigned last autumn to move to her new role as director general of the National Crime Agency Mr Hurley said: "When we look at where the buck stops, it stays with the team manager." But he said the force was already turning around, with reductions in robbery and burglary, improvements in violent crime and rape investigations, praise for the force's action on anti-social behaviour. The BBC has approached Ms Owens for a comment. In a previous response, she said blame apportioned to her was "ill-considered and inaccurate". "I was selected to my current role by the Home Secretary after a lengthy and thorough process and am now focused on leading the National Crime Agency in its fight to cut serious and organised crime," she said.	Surrey Police needs to improve how it investigates crime and tackles serious and organised crime, a government inspector has said.
There was plenty of confusion after a dramatic finish, with Greece's Spiros Gianniotis initially given the win before being downgraded to silver. Burnell's disqualification was for two yellow cards - he was unclear why the first was shown, while the second followed a tussle with a rival swimmer. "Absolutely outrageous," said Burnell. The 23-year-old said officials in "about 600 boats" had "no idea what they are doing, giving out cards left, right and centre for nothing". He added: "The whole thing is a joke. I was disqualified two metres from the finish." Find out how to get into swimming with our special guide. Burnell was given third and then fifth place at the finish before being disqualified. His first yellow card came while progressing down the straight in second place. "No-one was either side of me and he pulls out a yellow card," said Burnell. "I couldn't physically have touched anyone and I got a yellow card. "I shook my head at the guy. This is meant to be the pinnacle of our sport and there are referees who haven't a clue what they are doing." Burnell insisted the officials should not get involved unless "something is clearly wrong". "Imagine this happens in the [football] World Cup final and the referee gives the goalie a yellow card for standing there. That is how ridiculous this is," he said. "They always want to be seen to be doing something. On the Olympic stage, what do they want to do? Do they want to get on telly to show a yellow card? To show their family back home that they're doing something? It's absolutely ridiculous." Burnell and the chasing pack had caught sole breakaway swimmer Jarrod Poort, of Australia, before a race to the finish. Gianniotis led the way into the finishing funnel and, even though he might have crossed the finishing board first, Weertman was first to touch it. France's Marc-Antoine Olivier and Zu Lijun of China shared the bronze. Defending champion Oussama Mellouli finished 12th, despite Burnell alleging he impeded his progress. The British swimmer received his second yellow card for pushing the Tunisian off him just metres from the finish. "He was holding my leg not for one, two, three, but for four or five strokes, so I had to turn round to try to get him off. What am I meant to do?" he said. "We're all at top speed and I'm stopped dead. I'm one of the fastest finishers in there. "He was yellow carded for that, which stopped me winning, but I was disqualified for trying to get him off to try to win the race. Explain that to me." Burnell believes appealing against the decision would be futile. "It's never changed anything in the sport," he said. British Swimming did appeal against the decision, but that was dismissed. Organisers have not given British Swimming or any Team GB officials a reason for their decision, but it is thought they did not believe there was any evidence to suggest changing the initial decision was required following a review of the race footage.

Great Britain's Jack Burnell said his disqualification from the men's 10km open water swim was "a joke", after Dutchman Ferry Weertman took gold.
The claim: England and Wales have the highest incarceration rate per head of the population in Western Europe. Reality Check verdict: In 2014 England and Wales did indeed have the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe, marginally ahead of Scotland. Together with former home secretaries Jacqui Smith and Ken Clarke, he had written a letter to the Times calling for the prison population in England and Wales to be cut from the current level of more than 85,000 to the level in 1993 of about 45,000. They referred to 1993 as being the year in which Michael Howard said that "prison works". The prison population grew rapidly after that point, especially in the following five years. In the last five years it has been pretty much static at about 85,000. Since 1993 the prison population has almost doubled over a period when the overall population of England and Wales has grown by about 17%. Mr Clegg was only talking about England and Wales because in the rest of the UK the justice system is a devolved power, controlled by the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. He also said: "We already have higher rates of incarceration per head of the population than anywhere else in Western Europe." This chart based on Eurostat figures for 2014 shows that England and Wales is indeed ahead of the rest of Western Europe with 146 prisoners per 100,000 population, narrowly ahead of Scotland's 145. Northern Ireland had 93 prisoners per 100,000 population.

The Labour leader has also said he is "very angry" that so many lives were lost in a deadly tower block fire. PM Theresa May said the residents were "in our thoughts and prayers" and has ordered a public inquiry into the fire. But she was criticised by a senior Labour MP for failing to meet residents when she visited the scene on Thursday. At least 17 people died in the disaster at Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London in the early hours of Wednesday. Mr Corbyn, who earlier released a statement saying he was "very angry that it was possible for the fire to spread in the way it did," said people living in high-rise flats would be frightened following the Grenfell Tower disaster and needed answers to give them "peace of mind". And he told MPs on Thursday: "The south part of Kensington is incredibly wealthy, it's the wealthiest part of the country. "The ward where this fire took place is, I think the poorest ward in the whole country. "And properties must be found, requisitioned if necessary, in order to make sure those residents do get re-housed locally. "It cannot be acceptable that in London you have luxury buildings and luxury flats kept as land banking for the future while the homeless and the poor look for somewhere to live." Mrs May met police and firefighters at a private visit to the site but was not seen speaking to residents who survived the attack. Mr Corbyn was pictured speaking to local people. Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was heckled by some angry residents at the scene when he visited. Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added: "People are angry and I share that anger." Downing Street said that Mrs May's visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed. But Labour's former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter: "Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents. She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV." The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the "professionalism and bravery" of the emergency services. She pledged that the government "stands ready to provide every assistance" to the council and emergency services. "I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re-housed in London and as close as possible to home." She has ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the disaster. Ministers have also made emergency funding available to local authorities to support people affected. But MPs demanded answers in a specially-arranged session in Westminster Hall on Thursday, while Parliament is still suspended. At the start of the special meeting in Westminster's Grand Committee Room, Fire Minister Nick Hurd said: "What we are dealing with here is a national tragedy." He said the "exceptionally complex" investigation would take several months, and there would be no room for "plodding bureaucracy" in the official response. "It is the intention of the government to leave absolutely no stone unturned," he said. Answers were needed about fire walls, sprinkler systems, the alarm system and how the fire spread, he said. "Every single person living in a high-rise building today will be frightened, will be traumatised and will be very, very worried." Shadow housing minister John Healey urged ministers to begin installing sprinkler systems immediately and not to wait for the result of the public inquiry. The new housing minister, Alok Sharma, said he too had heard accounts of residents who said they had warned about fire safety. The government was talking to councils and housing associations about getting checks on other buildings done quickly, he said. At the end of the meeting, he promised "every single family" would be re-housed in the local area. Earlier Theresa May ordered a full public inquiry, "to ensure that this terrible tragedy is properly investigated". Labour is calling for measures recommended after another fatal fire in 2009 to be implemented immediately. Recommendations made after a fire in a tower block in Lakanal House in Camberwell in which six people died included installing sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings and reviewing building regulations. In October the former Housing Minister, Gavin Barwell, said the government had "publicly committed" to reviewing building regulations in relation to fire safety after the Lakanal House fire. Mr Healey said this review had "not been started". "The residents and others have some really serious questions to put to ministers and the people who run the building," he said. Responding to reports, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was "simply not true" that a report about building regulations had been "sat on". The BBC understands the Lord Chief Justice will make a recommendation to the prime minister of a judge to chair the inquiry. He or she will be independent from the government and able to call who they want as a witness. The Liberal Democrats have called for an urgent review into fire safety and building regulations.	Properties in North Kensington should be "requisitioned if necessary" for people left homeless after the Grenfell Tower fire, Jeremy Corbyn says.
The home side almost went behind when Charlie Austin went close with two headers and hit the post with a shot. Austin was also through on goal in the second half but an ambitious chip was saved by keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Jamie Vardy had Leicester's best chance after a poor backpass but he was tackled by Oriol Romeu, who also blocked two follow-up shots. The Foxes have now won only two of their opening seven leagues games, collecting eight points. Relive all the action and reaction to Sunday's games Leicester are now unbeaten in 19 Premier League home games since a defeat by Arsenal in September 2015 but that record would have been ended if Southampton's finishing had been more clinical. The Foxes had gone into the game following another impressive win in the Champions League - 1-0 over Porto on Tuesday - but they failed to replicate that form, with the visitors having the better chances as the home side managed just one shot on target. Vardy had the type of opening he relishes when he ran on to Virgil van Dijk's poor backpass but he tried to round keeper Fraser Forster and gave Romeu enough time to get back and tackle him. The two shots in the aftermath from Islam Slimani and Vardy, who has failed to score in six games, were also blocked by the Southampton midfielder. An effort that came from a clutch of bodies following a Christian Fuchs cross almost crept in at Forster's near post and Shinji Okazaki nodded just wide but, whether it was because of their Champions League exertions in midweek, the Foxes rarely carried the threat that won them the top-flight title last season. Southampton's build-up to the game had been overshadowed by assistant manager Eric Black being named in a Daily Telegraph investigation into corruption in football and a seven-hour delay in their return from a Europa League tie in Israel on Thursday. But manager Claude Puel made seven changes for the game at the King Power, and they started strongly as Austin had one header saved and glanced another wide before seeing an acute-angled shot coming back off the far post. Austin had scored five goals in four games going into the match and should have added to that tally when he was through on goal in the second half only to go for a difficult chip over Schmeichel, which was saved. Their main concerns at the back came from their own mistakes, especially Van Dijk's weak backpass, but they comfortably kept their sixth successive clean sheet in all competitions. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "I'm very happy because Southampton deserved to win. They played better. We conceded too many chances to score a goal. "I recognise they played better than us. Fortunately we finished with a draw from the match." On playing Champions League games in midweek: "Everything is a new experience. Now I have to decide whether to give a rest to players." Media playback is not supported on this device Southampton boss Claude Puel: "We had the possibilities to win the game.

64,596,800 People living in the UK 491,100 more than the previous year 259,700 added from net migration 226,200 from natural growth 25% of all births in 2013 were to mothers born outside the UK The "above average" increase of 491,100 from mid-2013 to mid-2014 included net migration adding 259,700 to population growth, the ONS figures show. This was more than "natural growth" - births minus deaths - which added 226,200. The ONS said a quarter of births were to mothers born outside the UK. The overall number of births was down compared with the previous year, continuing a downward trend seen since a peak in mid-2012. Analysis: Brian Wheeler, BBC Politics Is there any limit to the size of Britain's population? And if so what is it? Prime ministers, from Tony Blair to David Cameron, have always refused to answer that question. To do so would risk accusations of pandering to the far-right and provide a hostage to fortune, when their predictions, inevitably, proved wide of the mark. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has made political capital out of their discomfort but even he rarely talks about the overall size of the population. David Cameron thought he had hit on a formula for talking about numbers without announcing that the country is full by targeting "net migration". But, his critics would say, he only succeeded in revealing how little control he has over it. For some Britain's growth spurt, which began at the end of the 1990s, is a sign of success. It is the secret weapon that will pay the pensions bill and underpin economic growth. Some of our European neighbours struggling with declining populations, such as Germany, can only look on in envy. But anxiety about the pressure on services and the pace of cultural change among many voters is not likely to go away. The population increase was above average compared with rises over the last decade, the ONS said. As well as net migration and natural growth, other changes and adjustments, mainly in the armed forces, accounted for an increase of 5,200 people, the ONS said. The ONS figures show the annual growth in population rose steadily from about 150,000 in 1992 to about 300,000 in 2004, but that rose sharply in 2005 to 460,000. It has remained above 400,000 since - 2014's net increase is the fifth biggest. Migration Watch, which supports tighter immigration controls, said the increase "will only worsen the housing crisis and put still more pressure on our public services." Population Matters, which researches the environmental impact of population size, said the growth is having an impact on quality of life. "We are all affected adversely by the rapid population growth of recent decades," said chief executive Simon Ross. "Examples include pressure on housing and public services to the environment and climate change." The figures also found that the number and proportion of older people in the UK continued to rise. The median age of the population - the age at which half the population is younger and half the population is older - in mid-2014 was 40 years, the highest ever estimated. There were 11.4 million people (17.7% of the population) aged 65 and over in mid-2014, up from 11.1 million (17.4%) in the previous year. Of the UK's individual nations, England's population grew the most quickly during the year, growing by 450,800 people (0.84%). Within England, London had the highest population growth, up 1.45%. The East and South East regions of England increased by 1.08% and 0.92% respectively. The figures found that the population of Scotland increased by 19,900 (up 0.37%) to 5,347,600 and accounts for 8% of the UK's population. Meanwhile Wales' population increased by 9,600 (up 0.31%) to 3,092,000 and accounts for 5% of the UK's population Northern Ireland's population, which accounts for 3% of the UK's population, increased by 10,800 (up 0.59%) to 1,840,500 people/ The lowest regional population increases in the year were seen in Wales, North East of England and Scotland growing by 0.31%, 0.32% and 0.37% respectively. No country of the UK or region of England experienced a population decrease. 1. City of London - up 5.54% from 7,600 to 8,100 2. Tower Hamlets, London - up 4.08% from 272,900 to  284,000 3.

The Daggers, who reached League One in 2010, needed victory to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O's into a 2-0 lead. But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient's play-off hopes alive. Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007, but they now return to the National League under John Still, the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One. The Daggers have League Two's worst goal difference, and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term. Still's side have also struggled in attack, with 40-year-old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals, compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014-15 campaign. Boss Still, who returned for his third spell at the club in December, told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season. Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play-off spots and comes four days after player-manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role. Leyton Orient interim manager Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London: Media playback is not supported on this device "For me to lose two managers this season has been very tough and I've found it very hard this week. "We had to be professional, we're here to do a job and if I wasn't professional then I wouldn't be true to myself. "We owe it to the fans. At the end of the day there's nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club. "We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away, but in the end that's what we need to do now - we need to win games if we're going to get into the play-offs." Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London: "I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline. "If you haven't got organisation and you haven't got the discipline to play 90 minutes, the outcome is inevitable. "Dagenham over the years are going to get beat, it's responding to that that the club's not been able to do this year."	Dagenham & Redbridge have been relegated from League Two after losing at Leyton Orient, ending their nine-year stay in the Football League.
Josh Vela fired Bolton in front from eight yards after Emile Heskey laid Dean Moxey's long throw into his path. But Boro equalised when Rhodes, who was about to be replaced by David Nugent, drilled home from close range. Rhodes then headed in Middlesbrough's second stoppage-time winner this week from three yards. Minutes earlier, Boro's big-money transfer deadline day signing from Blackburn had hit the post and headed wide from six yards as the Teessiders sought a winner, while substitute Gaston Ramirez also scooped a shot over from close range. Relive Middlesbrough's win at Bolton But Rhodes was in the right place at the right time to nod in Nugent's cross in the first minute of injury time and leave Boro two points clear at the top after promotion rivals Burnley, who they face on Tuesday, won 2-1 at Birmingham. Boro, who have now won six successive games, also scored an injury-time winner to beat Reading in midweek and this late show secured only their second victory at Bolton's current home. Middlesbrough face promotion rivals Burnley and Brighton in their closing four games and, as such, have their fate in their own hands as they bid to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2009. Aitor Karanka's side dominated the first half in terms of chances as Stewart Downing hit the bar from 25 yards, while Adam Forshaw, Daniel Ayala, Albert Adomah and Ritchie de Laet all failed to hit to target. Mark Davies' backheel forced Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos into a save from Bolton's best first-half opening. Wanderers looked set for only their fifth win of the season after Vela put them in front but Rhodes had the final say to the delight of Boro's 4,302 travelling fans. Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: "I told him [Rhodes] after the game that a goalscorer can't forget to score goals in two months. "Always one day it would arrive that he would score goals and it was today - two important goals. "I don't think it's been easy for him. He's not a strong character, you can see it in his face. The reason I am pleased for him is because sometimes when you do your best and you're unlucky you are going down. He was always trusting himself. "Today, the most important day, he arrived and he was there to help the team." Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips: "That's [the level of performance] got to be the case from now until the end of the season. "We encourage players to get on the ball, show as much in possession as they could, to be confident with it, because our league fate has been decided but also retaining a real competitive edge and defensive shape. "There's still areas to work on, definitely, hopefully if we can achieve better ball retention, become harder to beat and still work hard that will set the players up for next season for those that are going to be here."

After the problems last week, many doubt the system will cope. Transport for London (TfL) remains confident, although it admits there will be breakdowns. The trick will be in getting the system back up and running quickly. So here's some friendly advice for tourists and Olympic visitors to try and make the transport experience as easy as possible. If anyone thinks of any more please post below.	The busiest summer ever looms for London's transport system.
A major emergency had been declared at the airport after the Italian C-27J aircraft lost communication. It was escorted to Prestwick by RAF Typhoons as a precaution and landed without incident shortly before 20:00. Police Scotland said the C-27J had been flying from Iceland to Italy. Flights are believed to have been delayed for a short time at Glasgow and Edinburgh, but Scottish airspace was not closed. Prestwick Airport also remained open throughout, and a Ryanair passenger flight to Malta took off a short time after the Italian plane landed. A video posted on Facebook by the Ayrshire News newspaper appeared to show the civilian aircraft landing at the airport. The Typhoons did not land. Photographs from the scene posted on social media showed several emergency service vehicles which had been summoned to the scene as a precaution. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: "Typhoon aircraft were launched this evening from RAF Lossiemouth to intercept a civilian aircraft which was causing concern to air traffic control authorities. "The aircraft was safely escorted to Prestwick airport and the local police now have the lead."	A civilian cargo aircraft has landed safely after being escorted into Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire after suffering technical problems with its communications equipment.
Charlie Dunn, from Tamworth, died in hospital after being found submerged in the Blue Lagoon area at Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on 23 July. Lynsey Dunn, 28, and Paul Smith, 36, who are believed to be the boy's mother and stepfather, have been charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. They are also accused of seven child neglect offences. These offences are alleged to have taken place between April 2012 and July 2016. Live updates from the East Midlands In addition, Mr Smith has been charged with two counts of witness intimidation alleged to have taken place in March 2016 and June 2017; one count of threats to damage or destroy property by fire in June 2017; and eight driving offences which are alleged to have taken place in January and June 2017. Both defendants, of Caledonian, Glascote Heath, Tamworth, appeared at Leicester Magistrates' Court earlier and are due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on 5 July.	A man and woman have been charged with the manslaughter of a five-year-old boy who drowned in a lake.
Bailey died after the incident at Cults Academy on 28 October. The 16-year-old accused - who cannot be named for legal reasons - appeared in private at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. The boy is also charged with having a blade or point on school premises. He made no plea, was fully committed and remanded in custody. Special assemblies were held on Monday as pupils returned to classes for the first time since the incident. Bailey's family issued a message of thanks for the support they have received.	A teenage boy has appeared in court for a second time charged with murdering 16-year-old Bailey Gwynne, who was stabbed at his Aberdeen school.
Provisional data from the Department for Transport (DfT) showed the 3% rise came alongside a 2.2% increase in traffic in the 12 months to September. AA president Edmund King said the death toll was the "equivalent of three plane crashes" and called for more action. Separate DfT figures suggest about 240 deaths in 2014 involved drivers over the legal alcohol limit. Officials said the rise in deaths in the year ending September 2015 was not "statistically significant" - meaning the increase was "probably to do with a combination of factors that have come about by chance, rather than any specific change". Steve Gooding, director of automotive research charity the RAC Foundation, said: "Forty-nine more people dying on the roads might not be statistically significant, but try telling that to their family and friends. "It is true that traffic is on the rise again and that might partly explain why the downward trend in road deaths has plateaued in recent years. "But the pressing question is: what do we now do to get back on track?" Neil Greig, the Institute of Advanced Motorists' director of policy and research, said that although drink-drive deaths were "flatlining", the numbers were still "unacceptable". He called for the drink-drive limit elsewhere in Britain to be lowered to be in line with Scotland. In 2014, the Scottish government reduced the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg. The DfT said the new estimated figure of 240 road deaths involving people over the legal alcohol limit in 2014 meant the level was unchanged from 2013. Roads Minister Andrew Jones said: "Britain continues to have some of the safest roads in the world but we cannot be complacent on road safety and are determined to do more. "We launched our road safety plan last year which includes plans for tougher penalties for people using mobile phones while driving, extra money to crack down on drug-drivers and funding to train the next generation of cyclists."	Some 1,780 people died on Britain's roads last year - 49 more than the previous year, new figures suggest.
Fly-half Sexton and flanker O'Brien have both recovered from calf injuries and should be available at Murrayfield. Sexton was injured against Castres on 20 January but is said to be "feeling very positive" about his recovery. However, uncapped Munster wing Andrew Conway has been ruled out after aggravating an existing groin problem. Ireland playmaker Sexton has the chance to cement his starting spot, provided he comes through Tuesday's session. Ulster's Paddy Jackson will start for Joe Schmidt's side if the Leinster star is ruled out while Munster's Ian Keatley has joined the squad as cover for the time being. "Johnny's making good progress and he's back on track to train on Tuesday," said Ireland team manager Paul Dean. "I think everything is fine, he's being very positive about it." O'Brien has completed the rehabilitation on his calf issue and was expected to take full part in Monday afternoon's training session. Full-back Rob Kearney says Ireland remain unfazed by his Leinster team-mate Sexton's latest quest for full fitness. Sexton battled hamstring trouble before the turn of the year, with this calf problem proving yet another unwanted hurdle. Kearney labelled injury doubts "par for the course" in any Test week, then tipped Sexton's understudy Jackson to thrive if pressed into service from the start in Scotland. "We're all so used to it now," said Kearney, of general battles for fitness. "On a weekly basis, more often than not, there's someone going in or out. "Someone picks up a niggle or they're not fully fit, so the coach doesn't risk them. The way Test rugby is now, it's par for the course. "Paddy [Jackson] has been there all last week running the plays. He's more than equipped and he's got a week head-start."	Ireland pair Jonathan Sexton and Sean O'Brien are set to resume full training after injury before Saturday's Six Nations opener against Scotland.
Around one in four births in the UK is by C-section, while in Cyprus the figure is 52% and in Sweden 17%. The study of 26 European countries, published in the journal BJOG, said more research was needed to find out why the differences existed. The Royal College of Midwives said health systems had a role to play. The study, led by researchers at City University London said that Caesarean section rates in most EU countries have shown "a continuous rise", although in a few countries there are signs they are flattening out. It said there could be several possible explanations for this - "including a fear of litigation, financial incentives, women's requests for Caesarean section and the perception that Caesarean section is a safe procedure". The study also said there were consequences to the rise, which included potential raised risks for mothers and babies - such as stillbirth - in future pregnancies. Caesareans are more likely when babies are born to first-time mothers, when women have multiple births or when the woman in question has already had a Caesarean. However, there is continuing debate, the study said, about the use of Caesarean section for babies who are breech (feet first), for multiple births and women who have had a C-section already. In the study, the highest rate of Caesarean sections planned before labour started was in Cyprus at 38.8% and in Italy at 25%. The lowest rates were found in Finland (6.6%), the Netherlands (7.7%) and Norway (6.6%). In the UK, planned Caesarean rates are 9% in England, 11% in Wales and Scotland and 14.6% in Northern Ireland. Emergency C-section rates were highest in Romania at 33% and lowest in Sweden at 8.6%. In all four countries of the UK, emergency rates are around 15%. Prof Alison Macfarlane, professor of perinatal health at City University London, said: "Given that people are supposed to be practising according to evidence, it is surprising there are such wide variations between countries. "We need a comparative review of national policies and guidelines and further research to ensure that clinical practice is based on evidence." She said it was important that the health of mothers and children was also prioritised. Gail Johnson, professional advisor for education and research at the Royal College of Midwives, said the disparities were likely to be due to differences in health service models and the overall health of different populations. She said the percentage of women giving birth by Caesarean in the UK was still "a bit too high". "A Caesarean is an emergency procedure, done when a normal birth isn't going to work. "It's not a lifestyle choice, and although it's a safe operation, it does carry more risks than a vaginal birth."	There are wide variations in Caesarean section rates across Europe, indicating a lack of consensus about the best way of delivering babies, a study suggests.
Barcelona said it paid €57m (£43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to €83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received €40m and his former club, Santos, was paid €17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40% of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received €6.8m of Santos's €17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: "They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice." The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated €13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus. But the 23-year-old has also encountered legal difficulties in Brazil, where a court has frozen $47m (£33m) of his assets in connection with suspected tax evasion between 2011 and 2013.	Brazilian football star Neymar has appeared in court in connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to FC Barcelona.
Emmerson Whittel may need surgery on his jaw, while the club alleges player Josh Lynam was also bitten on the ear. The RFL's match review panel will look at official video on Thursday, as it does for all on-field incidents. Keighley have gathered additional video from spectators following an appeal. Footage already online, shot from the stands, shows a number of fights breaking out on the field between the two sets of players. Following the incident, Whittel posted on Twitter that brackets and bands had been used to try to re-align his jaw and that he faces at least three months out. Keighley Cougars of League One, England's third-tier competition, progressed to the Challenge Cup fourth round with a 50-32 win over Fryston Warriors - a side from the second tier of England's amateur game. The match, a "home" game for Fryston, was played at nearby Featherstone in West Yorkshire after the tie was at risk of being reversed and played at Keighley instead. Keighley have also complained to the RFL about their off-field treatment before kick-off, as they allege players and members of staff were refused entry to the ground without a valid matchday ticket. A statement on Keighley's website said: "The players' allocation of 'family and friends' tickets was then claimed to have been used to admit the playing squad and coaching staff into the ground. "The club is outraged by this development." The BBC contacted Fryston Warriors, who have declined to comment at this time.	Keighley want the Rugby Football League to consider amateur video footage when they review a brawl during the club's Challenge Cup tie against Fryston, which left a player with a broken jaw.
A video in which the girl's father says that "everyone is welcome" to the party featuring local bands, a meal and a horse race was posted on Facebook on a public setting. He said the idea had been to invite neighbours and friends only. But he has since confirmed he would not turn anyone away. The video shows Crescencio Ibarra standing next to his daughter Rubi, wearing a tiara, and his wife Anaelda Garcia. "Hello, how are you? We invite you this 26 of December to the 15th birthday party of our daughter, Rubi Ibarra Garcia," Mr Ibarra says, while his daughter smiles. He then goes on to list the three bands that will play and announces that the winner of a horse race to be held as part of the event stands to win 10,000 pesos ($490; Â£390). He ends by saying that "hereby everyone is cordially invited". A girl's 15th birthday party is a big event in Mexico, as it is seen as the time when she comes of age. Lavish parties with live bands are not unusual and girls traditionally wear puffy dresses, tiaras and make-up as they are "queen for the day". It is not clear why this particular video went viral and was shared more than 800,000 times and prompted countless memes and imitations. Mr Ibarra said in a TV interview he had no idea what had caught the public's imagination. "We wanted to invite the people from the area, that's all," he said, before denying he had since uninvited all but personal acquaintances. Mr Ibarra said that when he found out about the mass interest in their daughter's party and how some had poked fun at their rural ways he had been "sad" for two days but that the family had now got used to the idea and that the party would go ahead in a field outside the village of La Joya, in the state of San Luis Potosi. Ms Garcia said: "Rubi is my daughter and she has always been our queen", before describing her favourite meme so far. "It's the one about Donald Trump and [Mexican President} Enrique Pena Nieto coming to an agreement to allow undocumented Mexican migrants in the US to return to Mexico for Rubi's party." Local lawmaker Roberto Alejandro Segovia Hernandez said police would be deployed to the village and the roads leading to it to ensure safety in case the crowds who said on Facebook they would attend really did descend on La Joya. But even that announcement prompted fresh memes: Rubi's older sister said Rubi was now "very excited" and looking forward to her party.	Police will be deployed to a village in Mexico after an invitation to a girl's birthday party went viral and 1.2 million people said they would attend.
The White Garden, at Kensington Palace, was planted to mark 20 years since Princess Diana died in a car crash. The Duchess of Cambridge joined the princes on the garden tour. A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace said: "The engagement will allow the princes to pay tribute to the life and work of their mother." They met representatives from the causes and charities supported by Diana, including the Royal Marsden and Great Ormond Street hospitals, the National Aids Trust, Centrepoint youth homelessness charity and the Leprosy Mission. Members of the public have been leaving tributes and flowers at the gates of the palace to mark the anniversary of Diana's death. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in Paris, when William, now the Duke of Cambridge, was 15 and his brother was 12. The garden at their mother's former home has been inspired by memories of her life, style and image, such as her white "Elvis" Catherine Walker dress. The White Garden, as it is known, follows a tradition first established at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, famous for its own white garden created in the 1930s. Their Royal Highnesses met gardener Sean Harkin who designed the display and Graham Dillamore who knew the princess when he worked there some 30 years ago. The garden has been open since spring and will continue into September with white roses, lilies, gladioli and cosmos. It is the fourth London memorial created in tribute to Diana - the others are the Diana Memorial Playground at Kensington Palace, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the Diana Memorial Walk at St James's Palace.	Prince William and Prince Harry have visited a London memorial garden for their mother on the eve of the 20th anniversary of her death.
More than 350 Roma people had lived in the camp on La Petite Ceinture since mid-2015. Activists said many left early ahead of the police action. The site belongs to the national rail authority SNCF. France has one of Europe's toughest policies towards Roma. Most live in camps that are regularly demolished and every year thousands are deported. Amnesty International urged city authorities to find a lasting housing solution for those evicted in Paris - saying they would become homeless in mid-winter. Hundreds of thousands of Roma - mostly from Romania and Bulgaria - have moved to western Europe since the 1990s. The Council of Europe, the region's main human rights body, warned that evictions were "counter-productive" because they disrupted education and healthcare for Roma children. Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland said it was crucial for French authorities to provide "adequate, alternative accommodation" for those evicted, "particularly as they have decided to take this action during winter". France's unwanted Roma	Police have cleared hundreds of Roma people from a slum-like camp built on a disused rail line in north Paris.
She had just given birth to their first son Dylan. But rather than congratulations, she was told: "We're sorry, your son has Down's syndrome." With her background in nursing and her husband's as a doctor, the couple had some knowledge of the condition. But it still did not prepare them for the negative information that came flooding their way. "No-one spells out all the things that could possibly go wrong for a child when they're born," she said. "But when you have a child with a disability, with Down's syndrome, they tell you the average life expectancy is 50; they won't go to mainstream school; they won't do this and that. "They just say all the negatives." Fourteen years later and Dylan has defied those initial expectations. He is flourishing in year 9 at mainstream school and has made the Down's Syndrome GB swimming squad. But that initial lack of support led to his mother and two other mothers of children with Down's syndrome to take matters into their own hands. When Dylan was a toddler, a health visitor introduced his mother to Katharina Barker and Nicky Williams. Both women also had babies with Down's syndrome. And all three discovered they had shared similar experiences in terms of a lack of support for people with Down's syndrome and their families. Katharina said although she had had a "very positive, supportive" experience with the birth of her daughter Amelie, she quickly struggled to find specialist support. "One of the things I found hugely frustrating, unless you are pointed in the right direction you are not going to find services, they are not coming to you," she said. They decided to host a coffee morning for parents with children with Down's syndrome to make friends and share experiences. The success of it led to the trio setting up a charity and the support it offers includes speech and language therapy, school help and annual education conferences. Although Nicky has since stepped down from the Monmouth-based 21 Plus charity, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary, Victoria and Katharina are determined to expand its reach as much as possible. And their hard work and dedication led to them becoming finalists in the national St David Awards citizenship category. They want to continue helping children with Down's syndrome "achieve their potential and increase access to opportunities". "One of the mums said to me yesterday that one thing she loves is being able to ask any question, even if it sounds daft and she wouldn't have the nerve to ask anyone else, she can ask us," Victoria said. "I guess that's why I do it. I don't want any of our families to think, 'I wish I'd known aboutâ€¦'  or 'I wish I'd known that earlier'." "I believe in expert parents and I want to make it possible for our families to become experts if that's what they want." Katharina added: "We want to give children the chance to access schooling, to access learning and to access the world. "The greatest thing is to see the children grow up, to see them developing and how well they're doing. "It makes it so worthwhile, it's wonderful."	It was the look between the midwife and her husband that Victoria Hughes remembers.
There are 67 items in total, including a Dalek from 1966, and a Cyberman from the show's 19th series. His rare props are expected to attract interest from people around the world, and could go for thousands of pounds. His wife has said she might have to lock him in the shed to stop him from buying back his own favourites. The auctioneer has said that the full collection of film memorabilia, including the Dr Who props, is the best he's ever seen. "They are incredibly rare, to get a genuine Dalek from that period," he said. "I've never seen one coming up for many, many, many years."	A collector is putting his massive haul of film and TV props on sale, because his wife says there isn't space for them all in the house.
But the annual Easter School at St Mary's University College Belfast drew more than 250 pupils from across the west of the city this week. Classes are targeted at those who require extra support in preparation for GCSE Maths and English. Four days of tuition are offered to schoolchildren who are at risk of not achieving a pass grade. Geraldine McAteer of the West Belfast Partnership Board, which manages the programme, said demand for places is high and pupils are "incredibly keen" to take part. Ms McAteer puts the popularity of the classes down to the environment and ethos of the school, which is one of "relaxed but focused learning". "They're mixing with children their own age, from other schools, in their own clothes, their civvies," she said. "They're in a university environment, working with different tutors and university students who volunteer to shepherd them around. So it has actually gained a reputation as quite a fun experience. "A grade C is a passport to so much, so this is to help get them over the line," said Ms McAteer. Maths tutor Jim Stott said the additional support often provides the encouragement students require to keep on studying at a time when their predicted grades may discourage them. "They're keen to tell you what exact areas they need more support with. "It may be trigonometry or algebra, so we break them up into small groups and when they're getting the extra attention, they soak it up. They're really committed to it. "It's very relaxed - I'm not standing at a board talking to children, the children are taking part in it. Sometimes they're at the board. "Pupils tend to gel together very well. They're not necessarily from the same schools, and that's part of the attraction - they like to mix with young people from other schools." Ms McAteer explained that the Â£25 fee is waived for those who cannot afford it. "This is a great social justice model," she said.  "We raise money from the Department of Education which enables us to pay for tutors and hire of premises. "There are some people who can afford to pay that amount per hour. But this is 16 to 20 hours tuition for Â£25. "But if we find out from the school that a family can't afford that cost, it's overlooked. Our main aim is to get the pupils in, to give them assistance, to get them to pass." Ms McAteer said the West Belfast Partnership Board hope to roll the programme out to other parts of the city over time.	It's a strange phenomenon - teenagers opting to return to the classroom over the Easter Holidays.
A planning application has been made for the development on green belt land at Park of Keir, near Dunblane. However a council planning and policy consultation stated the development "cannot be supported in policy terms". A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said they would discuss the report with Stirling Council planning officers. Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, and golfer Montgomerie announced plans for the facility, Scotland's first purpose-built golf and tennis centre, last summer. The proposed facility would include six indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course with a practice range, coaching suites and a cafe, along with around 100 houses and a hotel. However, some local residents raised concerns about the development being sited on green belt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan. These concerns were echoed in an official planning and policy document authored by Claire Milne, a principal planning officer at Stirling Council. Her report concluded that the planned housing - included in the project to subsidise the cost of the sports facilities - "is not intended to meet any of the local or particular housing needs, and will in fact exacerbate affordability in the local area". While the tennis, golf and tourism element of the proposal would "provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area", the report noted that the business case submitted was "not sufficiently convincing". The report also states that there is no "overriding national need" or a local need for the project to be sited on green belt land, a "sensitive landscape" which would suffer a "significant detrimental impact" from the development. A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said it was "normal practice" for planning officers to carry out a policy review. He added: "We plan to meet with the council's planning officers to address a number of the comments in this report and we remain confident our proposed development represents sufficient benefit to the people of the area, and Scotland as a whole, to allow members of the planning committee to approve our application." A date has not yet been set for councillors to consider the application.	Planning bosses have raised concerns over a Stirlingshire tennis and golf centre proposed by Judy Murray and Colin Montgomerie.
The hosts declared on their overnight score of 244-5, setting Notts a victory target of 386 in 96 overs at The Oval. Notts were 102-2 at lunch but collapsed spectacularly during the afternoon session, losing their final eight wickets in 53 minutes for just 38 runs. Surrey spinner Zafar Ansari, who removed Jake Libby and Riki Wessels with successive balls, ended with 6-36. Ansari's devastating spell meant Brendan Taylor's 68 from 79 deliveries was in vain for Notts, who are now level on points with Surrey in Division One. The win also lifted Surrey off the bottom of the table above Hampshire. Notts had looked in a good position while Taylor and opener Jake Libby, who made a patient 33 from 115 balls, were at the crease sharing a third-wicket stand of 90. But the swift departures of Libby and Wessels started the procession of Notts wickets, with only Dan Christian (11) reaching double figures among their final seven batsmen. Surrey captain Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London: "We've missed key moments in games at times, and we didn't miss them in this game. "Everybody contributed and it ended up being a very good win against a very good Notts team. "Traditionally, we're a better team in the second half of the season than in the first half. Hopefully we go back to type, play good cricket for the rest of the season and get a few more wins under the belt."	Surrey wrapped up their first Championship win of 2016, beating Nottinghamshire by 228 runs.
The Japanese company posted a 9.9bn yen ($97m; Â£57m) deficit for the April-to-June months, compared with an 8.6bn yen profit for the same period a year earlier. Sales were 8% lower, despite the release of a Mario Kart game in May - one of its most popular franchises. The firm did not alter its prediction of a return to full-year profit. It sank to a loss in its last financial year. Nintendo said it expected the release of key titles over the coming months to boost demand before the critical Christmas shopping season. These include new Super Smash Bros fighting games for its Wii U and 3DS consoles, as well as the action title Hyrule Warriors for the living-room machine and two Pokemon monster-collecting remakes for the handheld device. Nintendo won praise for the innovative titles it showcased at the recent E3 video games expo in Los Angeles, where it unveiled a new open-world Legends of Zelda title and the paintball arena shooter Splatoon, both due to be released in 2015. But one analyst suggested the releases would come too late. "They have a relatively good games pipeline, but the big question is about its hardware," said Ed Barton, a games industry analyst at the Ovum consultancy. "The Wii U is so far behind now, and the perception of the audience that it's a relatively under-powered console compared to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is now pretty firmly cemented. "Given how inaccurate some of Nintendo's forecasts have been going into their results in terms of hardware and software sales in the past, I'm not optimistic." Nintendo originally forecast it would sell nine million Wii Us in its last financial year. In May it revealed it had sold only about 2.7 million units despite a price cut. A further 510,000 Wii Us were sold over the most recent quarter, taking the total tally since its 2012 launch to 6.7 million consoles sold. Nintendo did not host a conference call following the earnings release, as it normally does, meaning analysts were unable to quiz executives about the progress of previously announced plans to establish a health division and release new devices for emerging markets. Its president, Satoru Iwata, had previously cancelled appearances at E3 and the firm's annual shareholders' meeting after doctors found a "growth" in his bile duct, requiring him to have surgery. He wrote a letter late last month saying he had resumed work "by email and by other means" but was not yet ready to return to his regular schedule. Documents posted online do, however, offer a couple of other insights: The news was released after the close of the Japanese markets, but Nintendo stock traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange had fallen about 6% from its opening price by early afternoon.	Nintendo has reported a bigger first-quarter loss than expected, causing its share price to tumble.
Lieutenant Colonel Benedict Tomkins, 49, of Defence, Equipment and Support, based at Abbey Wood, near Bristol, is facing trial in the US. He allegedly attacked the woman in her hotel room where he went under false pretences after a drinks reception. The woman told the court Mr Tomkins was "very aggressive" and "took control". The trial is being heard at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. It is the first-ever court martial which will be held in the US and UK to allow more witnesses to testify. The court heard that Mr Tomkins said he had had sexual activity with the woman, which "wasn't rose petals or cupid's arrows, it was fairly animal". The incident is alleged to have happened after a dinner and a drinks reception at the Sheraton Hotel, Kampala, on 7 January 2015. By the end of the evening, the young woman said she was "very drunk" when Mr Tomkins went to her hotel room. "There was no talking, no romantic lead up to something that I recall. He did get much more aggressive and used some level of force to take things further," she said. "The room was spinning, it was a very brief memory." They later exchanged messages and he thanked her for a "wonderful evening" to which she agreed. She told investigators she initially feared reporting the incident in case it would harm her career. The case is expected to resume in Bulford, Wiltshire, on Monday.	A married British Army officer denies raping a young female colleague at a UN event in Uganda, a court martial has heard.
Mist caused problems early in the day but Dunlop was quickly on the pace with a speed of 121.65mph on his Superstock. The Ballymoney man then secured pole on the BMW Superbike with 131.783, just faster than Peter Hickman's 131.063. Neil Kernohan won the Dundrod 150 Lightweight race, with Christian Elkin taking the Ultra-Lightweight honours. Ballymena rider Kernohan finished ahead of runner-up Davy Morgan, Paul Robinson, Paul Owen and Olie Linsdell. Elkin repeated his Armoy success of two weeks ago, coming home first on his Moto3 machine, followed by Sam Wilson and Derek McGee on 125cc bikes. Gary Dunlop, son of the late, legendary Joey, claimed a creditable fourth place on his debut at the event, with female competitor Melissa Kennedy fifth. Graham Kennedy took the flag in the National race and David Jackson in the Challenge event. The Dundrod 150 Superbike race was cancelled due to deteriorating visibility after the initial race had been red-flagged following an incident, which was not serious. The leaders had completed two laps, with Michael Dunlop just in front of Bruce Anstey, Ian Hutchinson and lap-one leader Conor Cummins when proceedings were brought to a halt. Meanwhile, New Zealander Anstey clocked the fastest time for Saturday's two Supersport races, edging out Yamaha-mounted Hutchinson by 1.7 seconds, with Manxman Cummins third. The 600cc qualifying session was halted prematurely after an incident at Flow Bog, which resulted in a rider being taken to hospital with non life-threatening injuries. A seven-race programme is scheduled for Saturday, with roads closing at 09:30 BST. Superbike practice times - 1 Michael Dunlop 131.783 mph; 2 Peter Hickman 131.063; 3 Bruce Anstey; 4 Ian Hutchinson 130.13; 5 Dean Harrison 129.92; 6 Conor Cummins 129.335.

Michael Dunlop set the fastest times for the Ulster Grand Prix Superbike and Superstock classes in Thursday's delayed practice sessions at Dundrod.
The YouGov poll for The Times suggests that in the final round of voting, Mr Corbyn would get 53% of support, six points ahead of Andy Burnham. Shadow minister Tristram Hunt warned a Corbyn victory could reduce Labour to the status of a pressure group. Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall are the other candidates for the leadership. The YouGov poll suggests Mr Corbyn is the first preference for 43% of party supporters, ahead of Andy Burnham on 26%, Yvette Cooper on 20% and Liz Kendall on 11%. Taking second preferences into account the poll, of 1,054 people eligible to vote in the contest and carried out between Friday and Tuesday, pointed to a 6% Corbyn victory.	Tony Blair is to make a rare speech to Labour activists as turmoil grows after a poll suggested left-winger Jeremy Corbyn was ahead in the leader contest.
Cleverly, 29, will face Braehmer for the WBA regular light-heavyweight belt in Germany on 1 October. The Welshman's three career defeats have all come in his last six bouts. "This is a must-win for me - I'm confident I can upset the champion," said Cleverly. "I believe this is my opportunity to turn things around." Cleverly and Braehmer were due to meet in 2011 before an eye injury forced Braehmer to withdraw. The German will be aiming for a seventh successful defence of his title, while Cleverly lost his WBO crown in 2013 when he was stopped by Sergey Kovalev. Asked if this would be his last world title fight if he lost to Braehmer, Cleverly told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "Possibly so and probably so. "I knew the world title opportunity would come back around. "Sometimes you hit those plateaus - you peak and then have a bit of a flat period. But I think I've got through that and the best is yet to come." The WBA super world light-heavyweight title - the body's top honour in this weight division - is held by Kovalev. Cleverly's last fight was a points defeat by Andrej Fonfara in Chicago in October 2015, though he was encouraged by his performance. "We [Cleverly and Braehmer] were meant to fight three times in the past but he never fancied the challenge when I was at the peak of my game and had a lot of hunger and fire," he added. "Maybe he's taken the fight now thinking I've had a quiet couple of years and gone off the boil. "Maybe he's thinking this is his opportunity to beat me but, as I showed in my last fight, the fire is coming back. "I'm looking to become a two-time champion and I'm going to grab it with both hands. "It's notoriously difficult for boxers in Germany against the home fighters, but I'm confident that I'm not just going to win, I'm going to win emphatically and take it out of everyone's hands."	Welsh former world champion Nathan Cleverly believes his world title fight against Juergen Braehmer can be a turning point in his career.
28 August 2015 Last updated at 14:08 BST The device was able to track and damage a free-flying drone during the trial in California. Boeing is one of many companies working to develop high powered lasers that can be used in military or defence scenarios. The company says its new device is the most portable yet, and can be collapsed into four parts light enough to carry.	Boeing has successfully shot a drone out of the sky using a high-powered laser during a test, the company says.
Her path to being the chief strategy officer of internet security firm RSA started when she travelled on her own to the US at 11-years-old. Ms Howe remembers vividly arriving at San Francisco airport on her own. "A tall, lanky, moustached immigration agent spends what feels like an eternity questioning me. I know the stakes are high. I know my family's future depends on me passing this interview" she explained at a Tedx event. Her family had fled Iran shortly before the 1979 revolution. They went to the UK and a few months later put her on a flight to the US as they "calculated that an 11-year-old girl on her own will not be turned away by immigration," she said. Their calculation paid off. The customs officer stamped her Iranian passport and she started her new life. The first thing she had to do was adapt to California - a place she described as "where all-you-can eat buffets and free-thinking rebellion are the norm". She found her safe space in coding. "I was happy in the computer room," she told the BBC. "I was an immigrant, trying to fit in a girls' school and the computer room was a safe place to be." But at 17-years-old she took an entirely different direction. She "fudged" a few details on her CV and applied for a job as a casting assistant for Steven Spielberg. "My 1968 birthday changed to 1966 so I could work legally full-time in that job," she explained. "I remember trying to stay as close to the truth as possible." Ms Howe was in her senior year at school, but was also doing a course at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) so just didn't mention the bit about school. She had also been an assistant director in theatre productions and gave that a prominent showing in her CV. She got the job and for around eight months she moonlighted between casting for a TV show and her senior year at high school. The UCLA course gave her more freedom than in normal high school and when she needed to take an exam she told her boss that she had a doctor's appointment. It would be decades before she returned to the world of coding. In that time she went from being an entertainment lawyer to business consultant to angel investor to venture capitalist. Ms Howe was meeting with the cyber security company Endgame to talk about investing in them when she was offered a job by the chief executive. "He said 'raising money is not going to be a problem. What I need is a business partner'." She took the job of chief strategic officer and eventually moved to a bigger cyber security company RSA. She described the path back to the computer room as "circular" and said she had been "distracted" by "bright shiny things" in the entertainment industry. But Ms Howe said she was not alone, as a female, in her interest in technology not turning into a career at first. Over the nine years of investing in tech, she said she had only met a "handful" of female company founders. But Ms Howe urged women to consider working in internet security specifically. She said making the internet safe was a "mission" that "appeals to women". "Solving a problem that makes the world safer, makes our personal lives safer and makes our children online safer," is how she put it. Internet security companies are struggling to fill vacancies and she said the demand for workers was only going to become bigger. The 13-year-old in the computer room now needs many more protections than when she was a teenager.	Niloofar Howe is a rare woman working in internet security.
Core earnings fell 41% to $1.59bn (Â£1.03bn), with pre-tax profits down to $708m from $1.9bn a year earlier. Like many other energy companies, BG's results have been affected by the fall in oil prices from a year ago. BG said it was still happy with Shell's Â£47bn offer for the firm, despite a recent recovery in oil prices. "There is no change to our view on the offer," said BG chief executive Helge Lund. BG agreed to be bought by Royal Dutch Shell last month. Mr Lund said the deal was expected to be completed by early-2016. BG more than doubled production from its Brazil and Australia operations in the first quarter. However, the impact of the lower oil price from a year earlier was seen in a 21% fall in revenues to $3.99bn.	UK oil and gas exploration firm BG Group, which is set to be taken over by Royal Dutch Shell, has reported a big drop in first-quarter earnings.
London Fire Brigade said it was called to the arena on Millennium Way, Greenwich, at about 11:15 BST. About 21 firefighters tackled the blaze, which was contained to the restaurant's extraction system. Station Manager Martin Freeman said: "It did create a lot of smoke and so security staff evacuated people from arena. There were no injuries." At the time Julie Price tweeted: "At O2 for Elvis exhibition but can't go in as its on fire." The cause of the fire is not yet known.	More than 1,200 people were evacuated from the O2 Arena in London due to a fire at a restaurant.
Caerleon-born Machen, who died in 1947, is known for his story The Bowmen, set in World War One, which gave rise to the legend of the Angels of Mons. Newport council is consulting on budget plans that could see the library shut. A spokesman said it would relocate the reference library if the building shut but no decisions have been made. The Friends of Arthur Machen literary society said its members, who include comedian Stewart Lee, actor Barry Humphries and writer Alan Moore, are writing to the local authority. Friends' founding member Godrey Brangham said: "This obviously is of great concern regarding the Machen collection in the reference library." Friends' chairman Ray Russell said: "Newport holds the finest public Machen collection in the UK. "We'd like them to preserve it, develop it, and keep access to it open. "Arthur Machen was a local son of Gwent who won worldwide literary fame, and it is hoped that Newport will continue to honour his work." Arthur Machen 1863-1947 •Born 150 years ago in Caerleon, south Wales •Fantasy and horror writer •Works include early self-published book Eleusina, The Great God Pan and The Three Imposters •Fans include Stephen King, Mick Jagger and Rowan Williams •His portrait is in the National Museum Wales More about the first modern horror writer The leader of the council has met with the group, and a spokesman said: "If the proposal to close the central library building did go ahead then the council would consider where the best possible place to relocate the reference library would be." The consultation on the council's budget savings proposals continues until 16 January 2015.	Fans of horror writer Arthur Machen have called on Newport council to protect the collection of his books and papers at the city's central library.
The vote in the St Louis suburb is the first since the death of Michael Brown last August led to protests. A federal investigation found racial bias in the Ferguson police department was widespread. Two-thirds of Ferguson's residents are black and now half the council. Shortly after the results came out, a video emerged showing an unarmed black man being shot dead by a police officer in South Carolina. State investigators said the officer, Michael Slager, would be charged with murder after the video showed him firing at Walter Lamer Scott who was running away. Turnout in Ferguson increased from 12% at the last elections, in 2013, to 29%. Wesley Bell, who defeated another black candidate in Ferguson's third ward, said: "This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard. "When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit." A drive by activists to register new voters and encourage previously disenfranchised residents to vote appeared to have paid off. "People in general want to see change," Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Reuters news agency. Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in Ferguson's first ward to become the first black woman on the council. Black residents in Ferguson protested for several days last August after Mr Brown was shot dead by St Louis police officer Darren Wilson. The protests spread nationwide in November when it was announced that Mr Wilson, who has since left the police, would not be charged. US police have faced severe criticism from rights groups in the wake of Mr Brown's death, with a series of high-profile deaths of unarmed black men in police custody.	Voters in Ferguson, Missouri, where last year an unarmed black teenager was shot dead by police, have tripled the number of African-Americans on the six-member council from one to three.
Boyle struck the only goal in the 18th minute after lobbing over Graham Doyle following a moment of hesitancy in the Wexford defence. Derry needed fine saves from Gerard Doherty to stay ahead as the keeper denied Conor O'Keeffe and Paul Murphy. Josh Daniels also headed a Gary Delaney effort off the line in the second half as Derry endured some nervous moments. Derry did go close to adding to their lead in the final five minutes of the game as Aaron McEneff clipped the Wexford crossbar with a long-range shot and substitute Jordan Allan fired just wide. Kenny Shiels' side suffered a blow in the second half as goalscorer Boyle was forced off by an apparent hamstring injury. With leaders Dundalk beating St Patrick's Athletics 2-0, the Candystripes remain nine points off the pace but they have edged to within six points of second-placed Cork City who were held to a 0-0 draw by Shamrock Rovers in Dublin.	Nathan Boyle's first-half goal proved enough to give Derry City victory over Wexford Youths at the Brandywell.
They were brought to the capital Lima by air from an isolated valley in the Amazon region. The army said their column had stashed explosives and weapons near a pipeline connecting a gas field to the capital. Last month the army freed 39 captives, mostly women and children who had been kept as slave labour by the group after being kidnapped. Some of the captives said they had been seized some 30 years ago. The defence ministry said 26 of them were children, some of whom had been born in captivity. The victims said they were forced to work in fields. The two fighters' column had been operating in the Shining Path heartland -  a corner of the Peruvian Amazon crossed by three important rivers known as VRAEM  (the Valley of the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro rivers).  It is Peru's largest cocaine-producing region. Shining Path was largely dismantled after the capture of its leader, Abimael Guzman, in 1992. Yet in the closed jungle of the Amazon the group has proved hard to destroy totally. The government says it estimates there are still some 350 members of Shining Path left.	The Peruvian government has announced the capture of two leaders of the Maoist guerrilla group, Shining Path.
Notts leg-spinner Imran Tahir led the recovery with 7-112 as Somerset were all out for 437 - a lead of 36. Resuming on 244-3, South Africa international Tahir claimed six of the seven Somerset wickets to fall on a scorching day - including Trescothick, who added 101 to his overnight 117. Notts lost Steven Mullaney and Michael Lumb early, before closing on 58-2. Trescothick, who equalled Somerset's record for the most first-class centuries with his 49th on Monday, was in wonderful form once again despite stifling temperatures. The 40-year-old brought up his double century off 323 balls with a trademark cover drive off Samit Patel - his 31st boundary - before he was the last man to go, chipping Tahir to cover. Somerset looked set for a much bigger lead as Trescothick and Jim Allenby's hundred partnership took them to 379-4 and within 22 of the hosts. But once Allenby was bowled by Patel for 63, Tahir tore through the rest of the batting order as Somerset lost their last five wickets for 37. The procession of afternoon wickets continued in Nottinghamshire's second innings as Craig Overton pinned first-innings centurion Mullaney lbw and Allenby bowled Lumb without scoring in the next over. Jake Libby and Brendan Taylor batted out the final hour to give Notts a lead of 22 at stumps.	Somerset opener Marcus Trescothick hit a superb 218 before Nottinghamshire fought back at Trent Bridge.
Albert Newman drove for 30 miles in the wrong carriageways on the M42, the A42 and the M1 before crashing into a van. An inquest heard one force had no motorway patrols on duty and another had earlier failed to notice Mr Newman's licence had been revoked. The coroner adjourned the hearing so officers could answer more questions. Dementia patient Mr Newman, from Nottingham, crashed his Mazda Premacy into a Transit van near Kegworth, Leicestershire, in October last year, killing passenger Michael Luciw and injuring the driver, Andy Harrington. The inquest was told that Warwickshire police took the first call about a car on the wrong carriageway on the M42, but officers incorrectly recorded the direction he was heading. The error was put right, but Mr Newman crossed the county boundary into Leicestershire on the A42, where the specialist roads policing unit had finished work for the night. This meant the force had no specialist motorway patrols in the county. Pamela Oxlade, who was travelling towards Birmingham Airport with her husband, told the inquest: "We were fortunately just past a lorry when suddenly, out of nowhere, there were two balls of light. "It was really quick and it was just unreal because you couldn't see the outline of the car in the dark. "I dialled 999 and spoke to a gentleman, explained what had happened and he just said they were aware of it. "We said we were almost half an hour from the M1 and going towards Birmingham. It was such a great relief to hear that he was aware of it." The inquest was told that about 20 minutes later, Mrs Oxlade spotted signs warning motorists to slow down because of a car travelling in the wrong direction. Coroner Trevor Kirkman, speaking about Leicestershire police's involvement, said: "It does seem as if the procedure does not seem to be working very satisfactorily. "This vehicle had travelled a long distance with no intervention." It emerged at the hearing in Loughborough that Nottinghamshire Police spoke to Mr Newman months before the crash after reports about him driving while showing signs of dementia. An officer did not check the paperwork before visiting him. That would have revealed his licence had been revoked on medical grounds two years earlier. Mr Kirkman adjourned the hearing until December to establish whether the force could have seized his car at that time. At the end of the hearing, a senior officer from Nottinghamshire police offered an apology to the families if there was anything the force could have done to prevent the deaths.	Police have been criticised for failing to stop an 87-year-old driving the wrong way on major roads before killing himself and another man in a crash.
Former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville explains what Louis van Gaal has learned from his first season in the Premier League and why his team are not far away from being title contenders again. This season, they have dropped points in 10 out of their 16 away games against teams below them in the table. They got rolled over at Everton and Leicester, and drew with Burnley, Sunderland and West Brom. In the past, the aim at United was always to do the double over everybody outside the top six. We approached all of those games - home or away - with the aim of winning them and doing that was one of our strengths down the years. That meant, when we came up against our rivals in the top five, our record against the rest meant that those big games were not must-win and the pressure was off us a bit. This season, it has largely been the opposite. United have produced their best football against the other teams in the top five and have struggled against the sides that have camped in their own half and made things difficult for them. Going forward, United need a player who can make the difference in those games, when the opposition are packing their defence. Chelsea have that with Eden Hazard. Last season, Luis Suarez did it for Liverpool. Those players can win you the title because, when games are tight, they make the difference. But at the moment United do not have anyone who is providing those bits of individual brilliance in the final third. A lot of people are saying Gareth Bale would be the answer to that particular problem but I think United already have the right player on their books - if he performs to his capabilities. Angel Di Maria arrived for a British record fee last summer but, considering his £59.7m price-tag and his reputation, he has not delivered since his first three or four games. Even so, he is still the United player who excites me the most. Everything about the way he plays from his pace, his skill, and his ability running or passing forwards tells me he has what it takes to shine at Old Trafford. He has just not done it yet. Next season could be the time when he realises what it takes. He now knows there are no easy games in the Premier League, and that he has to toughen himself up. Di Maria will also understand that United are a huge club. He is on a big stage and there is a bit of pressure on him. We know he can do much better, and so will he. I would love to see him play to his potential because he could be the attacking star this United team needs to make the next step. Van Gaal's first season as United manager is also almost over and he will have found out a lot about English football over the last few months. Earlier in the campaign, he tried playing three at the back and I don't think that system worked for United. Van Gaal probably tried it because he was trying to accommodate Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in the same team, but he has realised that he can't do that in the Premier League. When he arrived at Old Trafford, I think he might have under-estimated that anyone can beat anyone in this country. Maybe in some of the countries where he has managed in the past, teams in the bottom half of the table do not even give you a contest. Here, they do. At times Van Gaal has probably been surprised by the intensity of every game that United have played, but he will have learned from it too. Next season, he will come back and be thinking 'I know what I need to do'. Van Gaal has achieved his aim for his first year at United by securing a top-four finish and a return to the Champions League. Because of that, it has been a good season for him. Now his next target is to win the title, and I don't think United are far away from being champions again. The important thing is that they are going in the right direction. To go from seventh, where they finished last season, to first was always going to be impossible. People might say that is defeatist and not the way United should think but you cannot make that leap, even by spending £150m like United did last summer. You have to do it gradually. Going from seventh to fourth then first is achievable, although it clearly will not be easy. Can they do it? If David De Gea leaves, then that would be a big blow. Without him in goal, I don't think they would have finished in the top four this time. I am worried he will go because he has not signed a new contract and the noises coming out of the club about his future are not good, particularly if Real Madrid do come calling. Along with Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young and Juan Mata, De Gea's individual form has been one of the high points of the season. But it was United's sensational team performance in their win over Liverpool in March that was the most encouraging thing for the future. For me, it was their performance of the season and the one that gives me massive hope for what they can achieve next season. In fact, that period in March and April where they also beat Tottenham and Manchester City gave us a glimpse of what this team can do. That is the level that they have to play at consistently to challenge for the title. They could not do it this time but, just as with Van Gaal, a lot of United players will be better for what has happened to them in the last few months. I am expecting further improvement from them too. Phil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.	I think Manchester United can be Chelsea's closest challengers for the title next season, but Louis Van Gaal has got to get things right away from home against the so-called lesser teams.
The 31-year-old Brazil forward, better known just by her first name, has signed a two-year contract with an option of a third. She has recently been playing in Sweden for FC Rosengard. Marta was part of the Brazil side which lost in the 2007 World Cup final to Germany in China. Marta won five consecutive world player of the year titles from 2006-2010 and has finished in the top three of the voting in every year from 2004-2014. Orlando City chief executive Alex Leitao said: "We are incredibly proud to bring Marta to Orlando, and I am personally very excited as I have been a fan of her for many years. "Our technical team worked hard to add the best, most accomplished women's soccer player in the world to the roster."	Five-time world player of the year Marta Vieira da Silva has joined Orlando Pride in America's National Women's Soccer League.
He was addressing supporters outside his Istanbul residence who were chanting for capital punishment to be restored. EU officials have warned that Turkey's bid to join the bloc would be finished if Ankara restored the death penalty. Mr Erdogan has overseen a crackdown since the coup attempt was quashed. Thousands of police officers, military personnel and judges have been suspended or arrested. Turkey's Western allies have expressed concern and urged President Erdogan to respond in a measured way. But speaking to his supporters on Tuesday morning, the president said Turkey was "a democratic state run by the rule of law". He said he was ready to reinstate the death penalty if the Turkish people demanded it and parliament approved the legislation, adding: "You cannot put aside the people's demands." "Today is there no capital punishment in America? In Russia? In China? In countries around the world? Only in European Union countries is there no capital punishment," he said. Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2004 as part of its bid to become a member of the EU. On Monday, Mr Erdogan said suggestions that he was using the coup attempt to crack down on his political opponents were "libel". "I'd like to know what a crackdown by Tayyip Erdogan looks like... It's just libel," he said. "If Tayyip Erdogan was an oppressive figure, he wouldn't have won 52% of the vote at the presidential elections." Also on Monday, one of the coup's alleged ringleaders, the air force commander Gen Akin Ozturk, appeared in court. The general, who appeared to have several recent injuries, denied any involvement in the uprising. At least 232 people were killed and 1,400 wounded in fighting after rebel troops sealed off bridges in Istanbul, surrounding the city's Ataturk airport and stationed tanks outside the presidential palace in Ankara. Many later surrendered. Officials have blamed the unrest on the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and the "parallel structure" they say he has formed to topple the government. Mr Erdogan insists the US should extradite Mr Gulen, warning that it "should not keep such a terrorist". US Secretary of State John Kerry has said Turkey would need to provide "evidence, not allegations" against Mr Gulen, who has denied any involvement in the plot. The Turkish interior ministry dismissed almost 9,000 police officers on Monday as part of a purge of officials suspected of involvement in the coup attempt. That followed the arrest of 6,000 military personnel and suspension of almost 3,000 judges over the weekend.	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he is ready to reinstate the death penalty "if the people demand it", following the recent coup attempt.
Fifteen-year-old Sarvesh Verma, son of illiterate parents, scored 96.83% in the test and has been widely praised in India for his hard work. In the villages of Uttar Pradesh, the power supply is intermittent and Sarvesh said he mostly had to study under the light of a solar lantern. Although secondary school exams are optional and do not have much significance on their own, they are taken by tens of millions of students every year across India to prepare for the really crucial higher secondary exams. Success stories involving students from poor backgrounds like Sarvesh are not uncommon, but for the moment, Sarvesh and his family are revelling in his success. "My son has brought me immense joy," said his father Swaminath Verma, who owns a tiny plot of land and sells vegetables to supplement his income. "I could not study because of financial problems, so I thought I must send my children to school and wipe out the darkness from their lives," he added. "We knew he will do well, but we didn't know he will be a topper. We never had to ask him to study. He always say he has to study so he can improve our lot," said his mother, Sona Devi. Sarvesh, who lives in Sahsaraav village, has to cycle 10km (6 miles) to reach his school in Haraiyya town. He credits his success to his parents' hard work and co-operation from his teachers. "I got tremendous support from my school teachers," he said. When he grows up, he wants to join the civil service and fight corruption, since the "culture of giving and receiving bribes is a huge problem in our society". "We must think how to eradicate corruption. In my village the public distribution system is in a bad shape. People who deserve subsidised food grains sold through ration shops do not get them. All this must change," he added. In a school competition last year, Sarvesh won a tablet and said he often goes on the internet to see what is going on in the world. But, he added, he is not a fan of social media and is not on Facebook.	The son of a poor Indian farmer who has beaten nearly 3.5 million students to top secondary school exams in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh talks to BBC Hindi about his struggles and ambition.
John Key said the toll was expected to rise further, adding: "We may be witnessing New Zealand's darkest day." The tremor caused widespread damage as it occurred at a shallow depth of 5km (3.1 miles) during lunchtime when Christchurch was at its busiest. The mayor of New Zealand's second-biggest city says 120 people have been rescued from the ruins. The country's deadliest natural disaster in 80 years struck at 1251 (2351 GMT on Monday), 10km (6.2 miles) south-east of the city. The damage is said to be far worse than after the 7.1-magnitude quake on 4 September, which left two people seriously injured but no fatalities. Christchurch earthquake: Eyewitness accounts The epicentre of that quake, which occurred in the middle of the night, was further away from the city and deeper underground, but it still caused an estimated $3bn (Â£1.9bn) in damage. TV pictures of the aftermath of Tuesday's disaster showed scores of collapsed buildings in the South Island city of nearly 400,000 people. Shocked survivors could be seen wandering the rubble-strewn streets, which cracked open as the ground beneath was liquefied by the tremor. Police said that the dead included people on two buses which were crushed by falling buildings. Helicopters plucked survivors to safety from rooftops, and dumped water on fires. Officials said up to 30 people were feared still trapped inside the razed Pyne Gould Guinness building, where screams have been heard from the ruins. Trapped under her desk inside the building, Anne Voss told Australia's Channel Seven by mobile phone: "I am hoping they will get me out soon because I have been here so long. And it's dark. And it's horrible." Asked whether she was injured, she said: "I know I am bleeding and I can feel the ground is quite wet. I think it's blood." A dozen visiting Japanese students are among those reported missing. Bystanders have been using bare hands to try to free survivors trapped under debris. Many injured people were carried out on blood-soaked stretchers or in the arms of shocked workmates and strangers. Some escaped on ropes lowered from office towers. Others managed to crawl out of the rubble. By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News By nature, earthquakes tend to cluster in space and time. And Tuesday's tremor in Christchurch is almost certainly related to the much more energetic event that hit the region last September. The critical difference on this occasion is the ground broke almost directly under the country's second city, and at shallow depth, 5km (3 miles) below the surface. Contrast this with September's magnitude 7 quake: its epicentre occurred some 40km west of the city and at a depth of 10km, and it continued to rupture mainly away from the major built-up areas. New Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. The country straddles the boundary between two tectonic plates: the Pacific and Indo-Australian plates. On South Island, the location of the latest quake, the plates rub past each other horizontally. Depth and location key The tremor sent the spire of Christchurch Cathedral, a landmark in the centre of the city, toppling into the square below. John Gurr, a camera technician, told Reuters news agency the area outside the cathedral was "like a warzone". Power and telephone lines have been knocked out, while burst pipes have deluged streets with water. The suburbs of Lyttelton and New Brighton are reportedly "unliveable". Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement she had been "utterly shocked" by the news. "My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this dreadful event," the statement said. The quake caused some 30m tons of ice to shear away from New Zealand's biggest glacier. Witnesses say massive icebergs formed when the Tasman Glacier in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park broke, tossing a nearby lake with huge waves. Back in Christchurch, emergency shelters were set up in the city's Hagley Park, a race course and schools as night approached. City Mayor Bob Parker told the BBC: "This is a terrible, terrible toll on our city." "There is no power in most of the city; there is no water in most of the city," he added. PM John Key said: "It is just a scene of utter devastation. We have to work as fast as we can to get people out of environments where they are trapped. "This is a community that is absolutely in agony. We just need this community, as it has done before and as it will do again, to come together, to check and support one another," he added. The military has been deployed to help the rescue effort, and the government has accepted an offer of specialist help from Australia. A series of aftershocks, some as big as magnitude 5, have already rattled the stricken city, and officials warned residents to brace for more. One Christchurch resident, Jaydn Katene, told the New Zealand Herald: "We've had friends in town call us and say there are just bodies lying around; lots of dead bodies outside shops just lying there just covered in bricks." A British backpacker said the city "looked like a bomb had hit it". New Zealand experiences more than 14,000 earthquakes a year, of which only around 20 have a magnitude in excess of 5.0. The last fatal earthquake was in 1968, when a 7.1-magnitude tremor killed three people on the South Island's western coast. Tuesday's was the country's worst natural disaster since a 1931 quake in the North Island city of Napier killed 256 people.	New Zealand's prime minister says at least 65 people have died after a 6.3-magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch.
Cheshire is home to major employers in science and manufacturing, housing developers are eager - some would say too eager - to build new homes, and it could soon have two high-speed rail stations. The presence of the Northern Powerhouse's chief architect, Chancellor George Osborne, as the MP for Tatton, means there is the will within Whitehall for Cheshire to benefit from devolution. The Powerhouse allows Cheshire companies "to be part of something far greater", according to Cygnet Group chief executive Matthew Kimpton-Smith. His Northwich firm sells specialist machinery, predominantly to China and the United States. He says the Northern Powerhouse gives his company "real power, real punch" on the world stage. But Cheshire has been beaten in the race to take on devolved powers. Officials have had to watch as devolution deals were done with the noisy neighbours in Manchester and Liverpool. They've even lost territory as the Cheshire borough of Halton decided to become part of the Liverpool city region. Over the summer, anxious to avoid being left behind, the two councils in the east and west of Cheshire, plus Warrington, hurriedly put together their own devolution bid to meet a tight government timetable. Warrington Borough Council's chief executive Steven Broomhead, who used to run the Northwest Regional Development Agency, said the bid wouldn't just "enhance and grow" the county's economy - it would allow the borough to escape the influence of its neighbours' elected mayors. But as city regions have so far been the only places to have agreed deals, there's a lack of clarity over what a Cheshire deal might look like. It seems so unclear that the leader of Warrington Borough Council, Terry O'Neill, recently said his authority wasn't sure whether devolution would be "a poisoned chalice or an opportunity". A report by the think tank IPPR North seems to acknowledge this, calling for "greater clarification of the purpose, process and timescale" of devolution deals for counties. It's also not clear whether the government will insist on a Cheshire elected mayor. Until there are firm answers to questions like those, the county's Powerhouse ambitions may just be held back.	Looking at a map, Cheshire might appear to be on the fringes of the Northern Powerhouse, but officials in the county say it's actually the Gateway to it - bringing in commuters and investment.
Roslyn Condie, of Mossdale, near Castle Douglas, admitted being the owner of a dog which was dangerously out of control last September. A court heard how her Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Nipper, bit the postman on the leg leaving a puncture wound. Sentence was deferred on Condie for six months. Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how the incident happened while the postman was delivering mail in the village of Mossdale. Local residents gave him first aid and he later had medical treatment for the bite. Fiscal depute Jennifer McGill said there was concern in the area over the dog which had on occasion escaped from the garden of its home. A solicitor for Condie said she had had the dog since it was a puppy and it was very affectionate. She now kept it muzzled when taken out and the garden fences had been made escape proof. Sheriff Brian Mohan handed out the warning that a second bite would bring destruction and deferred sentence on Condie stressing that she should keep the dog under control with appropriate measures.	A sheriff has warned the owner of a dog which bit a postman delivering the mail that her pet will be destroyed if it bites someone again.
Chartoff's daughters confirmed he died at home in Santa Monica surrounded by his family. He had pancreatic cancer. "He was an amazing father and person," said Julie Chartoff, adding: "There are no words." He won the best picture Oscar for the first Rocky film in 1977, which was written by its star Sylvester Stallone. The producer shared the Academy Award - one of three for the 1976 film - with partner Irwin Winkler. They both went on to produce all seven Rocky movies, including the forthcoming film Creed, which is currently in post-production. Chartoff was also nominated for an Oscar in 1981 for Raging Bull, Martin Scorsese's darker take on the sport, which starred Robert De Niro as boxer Jake La Motta. He produced films into his late 70s and early 80s, including 2014's The Gambler with Mark Wahlberg and 2013's Enders Game with Harrison Ford. He also worked on Jane Fonda's They Shoot Horses, Don't They? and 1983 film The Right Stuff, which won four Oscars. Chartoff and Winkler - who worked together until 1985 - convinced United Artists to make Rocky for less than $1 million (Â£646,000), after Stallone insisted on playing the lead, according to Variety. The film went on to earn 10 Oscar nominations and take more than $200m (Â£129m). Chartoff is survived by third wife Jenny Weyman and his five children.	Oscar-winning producer Robert Chartoff, who was behind hit boxing films such as the Rocky series and Raging Bull, has died in California, aged 81.
Sinead Higgins, 37, and son Oisin O'Driscoll were found after police forced their way into the house in The Fairway, Ruislip, west London on Wednesday. Police responded to concerns for the pair's welfare at about 10:50 GMT. A Met Police spokeswoman said detectives do not believe a third party was involved in the deaths. Det Insp Dave Bolton said: "Inquiries so far lead us to believe there is a likelihood that the tragic events that led to the deaths do not involve a third party." A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place on Friday. Next of kin have been informed.	The bodies of a mother and her seven-year-old son have been discovered at their home.
We look at a new gadget which helps blind and visually impaired people read text and recognise faces, we talk to a tech giant about its progress in making software more accessible, and we ask what role AI could play in opening up technology for everyone. We are joined on the show this week by Johny Cassidy, a producer in the BBC's Economics Unit who has masterminded the Disability Works series across our TV, radio and web output this week. Johny lost his sight as a teenager and for the programme he tried out a new gadget called Orcam. It consists of a camera which you clip onto a standard pair of glasses and a separate unit which provides an audio description of what the device is seeing. The idea is that you can point it at text and it will read it or it can be programmed to recognise faces. This was the feature which worked best - it quickly recognised me and producer Jat Gill when we stood next to each other, reading our names out to Johny. This impressed him, but the text readout proved very clunky and slow. Johny showed us the technology he uses every day to work on a computer, a screen reader system which allows him to sort through his emails and scan online articles at breakneck speed. It seems evident that Orcam, priced at a hefty Â£2300, is trying to solve a problem that is already being addressed far more efficiently in software - but perhaps it will improve over time. When he took over as chief executive of Microsoft, Satya Nadella made it clear that accessibility was going to be a priority - an admission perhaps that the company hadn't been moving quickly enough. Key to that was the appointment of a new chief accessibility officer Jenny Lay-Flurrie. She tells us that, with an unemployment rate for people with disabilities in the United States twice the average, there is much to be done. The screen reading technology which we saw demonstrated by Johny Cassidy is going to get more upgrades and she described an accessibility checker built into Office that allows users to check that the documents or presentations they send can be read by anybody. Jenny, who is profoundly deaf, talked to us in our London studio from the West Coast of the United States and I was curious about how that worked. She explained that a colleague was listening into the call from another part of the US and sending her the text of my questions. At the moment, she has an interpreter who often accompanies her to meetings, but she's trying out new technology such as real-time captioning in Skype. And she points out that some ideas you might think were developed for people with disabilities, like subtitling on web videos, are now being used by everyone. Much of the progress made recently in artificial intelligence has been about teaching computers to see, hear and understand in the same way as humans do. That is changing the way we all interact with computers - we can talk to them, and they are beginning to understand our facial expressions, making them more accessible to everyone. That is the message we hear from IBM's Dr Guru Banavar, the man guiding the Watson AI project. "That's going to be the game changer with AI," he says. "Machines have to be natural with people see and hear like people do." Technology used to be a big barrier for disabled people hoping to thrive in the workplace - but in the future it could augment human capabilities, making working life easier for everyone.	This week we devote the whole of Tech Tent to a special programme on assistive technology - that's tech to help disabled people take advantage of all the advances we've seen in recent years.
The slide, set up in Shore Road, Swanage, for the Swanage Carnival, came loose at about 13:40 BST. Police said nine children were treated at the scene - at least one was taken to hospital. South Western Ambulance Service said its paramedics treated three of the children but there was "nothing to suggest their injuries are serious". There have been conflicting reports about the number of casualties but some children may have been treated by the carnival's own medical staff, an ambulance spokeswoman said. Dorset Police said the children treated at the scene had either "stayed to enjoy the afternoon or gone home". It said one child was taken to Poole Hospital and three had been taken to the minor injuries unit in Swanage. "Officers remain at the scene and are speaking with organisers," a spokeswoman said. A South Western Ambulance Service spokeswoman said two of the children it treated "were reported to be suffering from neck pain" and were taken to Poole Hospital. The third was treated at the scene. Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance said it attended but was stood down before it landed.	A number of children were injured when an inflatable slide broke away from its moorings during a carnival in Dorset.
The operation took four hours. IS continued to fire mortars at the airport from further inside the city after losing the ground to the army. The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS, but BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It's a large piece of land, and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The assault began with overnight air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants who had holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told AP, without specifying their nationality. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city, amid reports that they could number up to 650,000. More than 160,000 people have already fled their homes in and around the city. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians. All bridges linking the east and west of the city, across the Tigris river, have been destroyed by air strikes. IS jihadists overran Mosul as they spread across much of northern and western Iraq in 2014.	Iraqi security forces have recaptured Mosul airport, a key part of the government's offensive to drive the so-called Islamic State (IS) from the western half of the city.
Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said Christians were the most persecuted people, but few of them would receive sanctuary in the UK. The government has said 20,000 refugees will be brought to Britain directly from refugee camps around Syria. But Cardinal Nichols said most Christians did not go into the camps. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today, Archbishop Nichols said: "I can see the point in going directly to the refugee camps, but in fact I think its unintended consequence will be that there will be few, if any, Christians coming to this country. "That is because for the most part Christian refugees do not go into the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) camps. They go to fellow Christian organisations." He added: "If we are going to deal purely with UNHCR according to their rules, then there can be no preference given to anybody on behalf of their faith and we will simply bypass the Christian refugees, not intentionally but in fact." It comes as the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, will say that Britain has lost its sense of proportion in relation to the refugee crisis. In his Christmas sermon at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff he is expected to say that the "debate seems to be centred on how many refugees we should accept. We forget to ask, or perhaps we choose to forget, why there are so many refugees in the first place". The refugees being brought to the UK will be drawn from established refugee camps, initially as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme. More than 50 local authorities have taken a share of those who have already arrived. Alongside the VPR scheme, the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015.	Christian refugees fleeing Syria are being bypassed by the UK government, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales has said.
When The Beatles first performed at the Cavern on 9 February, 1961, it was so low key it wasn't even advertised. A year and a half, and 292 performances, later, the group was set for stardom and the Cavern would become one of the world's most famous clubs. While both Lennon and McCartney had already played the club as The Quarrymen, the un-advertised lunchtime session was George Harrison's first appearance at the Cavern. The club's lunchtime sessions were popular with young city centre office workers and many would take sandwiches to eat while watching the groups. The current Cavern has organised a day of events to mark the anniversary and is inviting regulars from the early 1960s to attend. The day of live Beatles music starts with a lunchtime session at 1300 GMT. A 40-metre long light installation is being created across Mathew Street, called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It will create a ceiling of light along the Cavern Quarter area. The original Cavern had started life as a jazz venue in 1957 but by 1961 it was moving towards rock and roll - driven more by plain economics than any change in musical taste. Promoter Sam Leach was instrumental in transforming the Cavern's music policy away from the jazz favoured by owner Ray McFall. Mr Leach said: "It was a good club and it was exciting. "Ray McFall hated rock and roll. On March 11th 1961, I did the Iron Door (a rival Liverpool club)  - I did an all night session and it got 1,800 people, that night the Cavern had 50 people in, more musicians than fans. "Ten days later...Ray gets the message and he turns over to rock and roll at night. Up until then The Beatles only played at lunchtime." The Beatles had played other Merseyside venues since returning from Hamburg in late 1960, but it was at the Cavern that they would cement their reputation as one of the city's top rock and roll groups. Many who saw The Beatles at the club claim that was where they were at their best as a live outfit. Mr Leach's first taste of The Beatles was at a venue in Huyton. He said: "When I first saw them in Hamilton Hall as soon as they started playing, I was just gobsmacked. "The sound didn't just go over you it went through you. "John Lennon started with Slow Down and Paul did Hippy Hippy Shake, Stuart did Wooden Heart, Pete Best did Matchbox. The sound was so powerful, it seemed to reverberate around the hall. "We more or less took American rock and roll and sent it back at them improved. We gave them better sound, which was Merseybeat. "Make no mistake the Cavern has become the most famous club in the world. "It makes me smile when they say: 'The Cavern where it all began' - they were the last ones in. But it was an exciting club." In November 1961, record store manager Brian Epstein saw The Beatles at the Cavern and soon after became their manager. A record deal with Parlophone would follow but not before the band's sound and image had been subtlety changed. "The Beatles were the best rock band on the planet", Mr Leach remembers. "Eppy [Brian Epstein] took them and he groomed them, and took all that rawness out of them, and fair enough it worked. But I know John didn't like it because John was an out and out rock and roller. "Paul was sensible he knew you had to sort of bend a little bit and become a bit more showbiz. So he went along with Epstein and really, Paul was right." Paul McCartney returned his roots at the Cavern in December 1999 to play a one-off concert, but it wasn't on the same stage that he had played from almost 300 times in the early 1960s. The original Cavern club closed in 1973 and was demolished to make way for a ventilation shaft for Liverpool's new underground railway loop line. The shaft was never built and the current Cavern club is recreated across three quarters of the original site, using many of the old club's bricks. Exactly three year's after their first Cavern appearance on 9 February, 1964, The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show playing to a record 73 million people across America. Beatlemania had arrived.	Fifty years ago, a young group stepped on stage in a dark cellar club on Liverpool's Mathew Street for the first of what would be almost 300 appearances.
Conservative MP for St Ives, Derek Thomas, claimed diabetes is "completely avoidable through good diet and exercise" on his Facebook page. Dozens of constituents in Cornwall complained that his comments were inaccurate and "insulting". He said he was "sincerely sorry" and would raise the issue with government to prevent confusion in future. Mr Thomas' post provoked more than one hundred comments, many of which pointed out that type 1 diabetes "is genetic", and type 2 diabetes, which is often linked to obesity, is "not preventable for all". Orson Cornick commented: "Being an ignorant human being is avoidable, not type 1 diabetes!" Marianna Baxter whose daughter has type 2 diabetes said she was "very angry and hurt" at the "very offensive" remarks. Mr Thomas told the BBC he was told the information by "two medical professionals" and had simply been trying to raise awareness that many people can help themselves by improving their diet. He said: "I certainly got it wrong and I apologise for that. I certainly wasn't going out to intentionally upset a number of people that can do nothing about their ill health, so I do apologise for the way that was worded." He said he would raise the issue with the government ahead of its national diabetes strategy launch next year to make sure no discrimination took place. Mr Thomas removed the post on Saturday and replaced it with another offering a "sincere apology". Many commended him like Charlotte Clews who commented: "I stand up and applaud you. So does my type one son. It really is very heart warming to see that you have corrected a mistake and educated yourself and now others." The charity Diabetes UK declined to comment but said information on any link with diet and lifestyle was available on its website.	An MP has apologised for his "very offensive" and "damaging" comments on diabetes.
The girl, called Nieve, was attending the Handmade Parade in Hebden Bridge on Sunday with her grandparents when the dog jumped up and bit her. She needed eyelid surgery and suffered "potentially irreparable damage" to a tear duct. The man in the e-fit is described as being broad, bald and aged about 50. A second man, also thought to be about 50 and of similar build, was present at the time of the incident, West Yorkshire Police said. Both men left the scene without checking on the girl's welfare or leaving any details. The dog, believed to be a Staffordshire bull terrier, was on a lead at the time of the incident and is described as brindle and white coloured. PCSO Gareth Helliwell said: "The five-year-old girl involved in this incident needed reconstructive surgery to an eyelid following this attack and has suffered potentially irreparable damage to her lower tear duct." The girl's family described the dog's owner as "scum", adding "she could have lost her eye, she was covered in blood and the guy just ran off, it's cowardly". She was also bitten on the ankle despite the dog being pulled away on a lead, they said. Police appealed for anyone with information about the dog or the two men with it to contact them.	Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to trace in connection with a dog attack on a five-year-old girl.
Brazil's Attorney-General, Rodrigo Janot, has asked the Supreme Court to open an investigation into Lula's alleged involvement in the multi-billion dollar scandal that has already seen dozens of lawmakers arrested. Here we look at the accusations in more detail and how the once popular ex-leader came to be linked to the allegations. At this stage, few details of the accusations against Lula are known as neither the Attorney-General's office nor the Supreme Court have made them public. What is certain is they are connected to Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a multi-billion dollar kickback scheme at state-oil company Petrobras. Investigators say that starting in 2003, construction companies formed a cartel to overcharge Petrobras for building contracts. They would then pay part of their windfall to Petrobras executives and politicians who were in on the deal. Prosecutors allege that the Workers' Party, of which both Lula and current President Dilma Rousseff are members, partly financed its campaigns and expenses through these kickbacks. Sao Paulo newspaper Folha quoted Attorney-General Janot as saying that the kickback scheme "could never have functioned for so many years and in such a broad and aggressive form under the federal government without the participation of ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva". Lula, who governed from 2003 to 2011, has denied the allegations. At this stage, we do not know what the evidence against Lula is. Local media have reported that the Attorney-General has sent several folders of documents to the Supreme Court. Nor is it known what the exact charges against Lula could be. Newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo reports that Mr Janot would charge Lula with obstruction of justice. The newspaper says that the former leader is suspected of hampering Operation Car Wash, the investigation into corruption at Petrobras. According to the daily, the Attorney-General will cite President Rousseff's nomination of Lula as her chief of staff as evidence that Lula and Ms Rousseff tried to obstruct justice. Under Brazilian law, members of the cabinet can only be investigated by the country's highest court. Lula was sworn in as chief of staff in March, but a judge suspended the nomination within an hour, arguing that it was a move to shield Lula from possible prosecution by the federal judge investigating the Petrobras scandal. The country's Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether Lula will be able to take up his post or not. The Attorney-General's move is based on testimony given by Senator Delcidio do Amaral as part of a plea bargain, according to Brazilian media. Mr Amaral of the governing Workers' Party was arrested in November on charges of obstructing justice, the first sitting senator to be arrested in Brazilian history. He is accused of trying to help former Petrobras executive Nestor Cervero flee the country. Cervero was jailed for being the mastermind of the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Amaral has been collaborating with the authorities. His testimony also prompted the Attorney-General to request the launch of an investigation into former presidential candidate Aecio Neves. Mr Neves lost to Ms Rousseff in the 2014 presidential race. Yes, police took the ex-president for questioning on 4 March. The officers escorting Lula to the police station were acting under a judge's order called a "conducao coercitiva" (bench warrant) which means that a person is commanded to appear before authorities to give testimony. Police also searched his house in Sao Bernardo, the offices of the Lula Institute - a non-governmental organisation founded by the ex-leader - and the homes of some of his family members and associates. In total, 200 police officers enforced 33 search and 11 arrest warrants at locations in three Brazilian states. While the allegations were related to the Petrobras kickbacks scheme, they focussed specifically on two properties allegedly owned by Lula's family. Prosecutors alleged that Lula had received "illicit benefits", such as having one of the construction firms involved in the Petrobras scandal renovate a luxury beachfront apartment and a ranch for his family. They said that "the suspicion is that the improvements and the properties are bribes derived from the illegal gains made by OAS [construction firm] in the Petrobras graft scheme". Investigators said they also had evidence that in 2014 the ex-president received at least $270,000 (Â£190,000) worth of furniture and improvements for the beachfront apartment in Guaruja. They said they were also looking into sums paid to Lula by construction firms involved in the scandal as donations or speaking fees. Lula denied any wrongdoing. Lula was the political mentor of current President Dilma Rousseff and remains close to Ms Rousseff, who nominated him as her chief of staff in March. Ms Rousseff is currently facing impeachment proceedings over allegations she manipulated government accounts prior to her re-election in 2014. But up until now, she has not been linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal, even though some of her critics have questioned how she could not have been aware of such a wide-ranging kickback scheme while she held a senior position at the oil giant. Ms Rousseff chaired the Petrobras board of directors from 2003 to 2010. If her close friend and mentor Lula were to be charged, pressure on the president would increase massively at an already difficult time in her political career,	The former president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has been accused of playing a key role in a huge corruption scandal involving state-oil company Petrobras.
The A547 at Meliden, between Rhuddlan and Prestatyn, was closed after 14:00 BST on Saturday after the collision. The child was taken to hospital, with the extent of his injuries not yet known. Police confirmed traffic had resumed on the road after 16:00 BST.	A Denbighshire road has been reopened after a boy was hit by a car, North Wales Police says.
The petition.parliament.uk site is designed to help people get issues on the political agenda and open up a "new dialogue" with MPs and ministers. E-petitions will initially be considered by a cross-party committee of MPs chaired by Labour's Helen Jones. The first e-petition tabled called for increased taxes on foreigners buying UK property worth more than Â£3.5m. Under the previous system, petitions were directed to government departments rather than MPs, with 10,000 signatures required for an official response and 100,000 needed for a petition to be considered for a debate in Parliament. More than 40 petitions passed the 100,000 signature threshold during the last Parliament. A number of them were subsequently debated in Parliament although critics say not enough of them were given parliamentary airtime. The thresholds for a petition getting a response or being considered for a debate have not changed in the revamp of the old website which launched in 2011. The new site will be jointly run by the House of Commons and the government. The Petitions Committee, made up of 11 MPs from different parties, said it would enable every British citizen and UK resident to start or a sign a petition electronically. The committee, whose creation was recommended in a report by MPs last December, said its role was to liaise with petitioners, seek information from government about issues raised and, in some cases, refer petitions to specialist parliamentary committees. "First and foremost, it is an easy way for people to let MPs and ministers know they care about," Ms Jones said. "What's more, it gives us a chance to open up a new dialogue between the public and Parliament. I very much hope that the petitions committee will be able to bring forward issues that wouldn't otherwise have been debated or investigated in Parliament. "For the most pressing petitions, we will be able to schedule debates...It is an exciting step for Parliament and a visible demonstration of its commitment to improving public engagement with what goes on here." Deputy Commons leader Therese Coffey said the new website would further improve public engagement with politics.	Members of the public can once again digitally petition MPs on issues with the launch of a new website.
Netherlands striker Van Persie, 33, had scored the opening goal in the Turkish side's 3-1 win against Akhisar before the first-half injury. Television pictures showed blood coming through a bandage on his left eye. "After tests in the hospital this morning I can say my eye itself is undamaged so all good," he said. He told followers on Instagram that he had torn his eyelid. Club doctor Burak Kunduracioglu had earlier sought to play down fears the player had suffered a serious eye injury, saying: "He received a blow to the eye and suffered a torn eyelid and bleeding. "After the investigations we learned that nothing important happened. His condition is good." The former Arsenal and Manchester United forward joined Fenerbahce from the Old Trafford club in July 2015.	Fenerbahce's Robin van Persie has reassured supporters that his eye was not damaged after he was carried off the pitch bleeding on Sunday.
Undefeated Rigondeaux had to call off a fight with the Liverpool boxer in March because of visa issues. The Cuban, 35, became WBA champion when Carl Frampton opted to fight for a featherweight title rather than defend his super-bantamweight belt. "It's been my childhood dream to be the best in the world," said Dickens, 25.	Britain's Jazza Dickens will fight WBA super-bantamweight title holder Guillermo Rigondeaux in Cardiff on Saturday, 16 July.
Archery, fencing, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby have also missed out. Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m. Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was "staggered" by the "incomprehensible" decision to remove the sport's funding. A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games. As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147. Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has "confirmed its commitment" for Tokyo 2020. He added: "These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained." Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed. Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle. Christy said the decision represents a "catastrophic impact on the sport" and Badminton England would "fight for the hopes and dreams" of its players. "How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?" he said. "What have we done wrong?" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin. Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly. Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly. "We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential," she said. "If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk." Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: "UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020." Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build "performance pathways for future success" was supposed to be aimed at such sports. A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: "It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review. "With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport." UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed. Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme. UK Sport says funding will be determined "following further exploration of medal potential", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated. Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: "The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open. "We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders."	Badminton is one of five sports to lose all UK Sport funding for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo - after Britain claimed a bronze in the sport in Rio.
He said it was "dispiriting if pretty unsurprising" to see David Cameron's government turn their back on the coalition's "liberal stance". The former deputy prime minister also criticised his former partners' "swagger" over the EU referendum. And, in his final speech to MPs as Lib Dem leader, he predicted the EU debate would "devour" Mr Cameron's party. A contest to replace Mr Clegg is under way after the election left his party with just eight MPs. "My party's presence may be much, much reduced in size, but our mission is clearer than ever," said Mr Clegg. He said new data monitoring powers, resisted by his party in government, represented a "turbo charged snooper's charter", and said there had not been enough to support social care and house-building. He accused the Conservatives of ditching their commitment to civil liberties. "The human rights we hold dear, our right to privacy in an online age, our future as an open-minded, outward-looking country, are all hanging in the balance again because of the measures announced today," he said. "The previous coalition government's commitment to fairness is weakened," he added. Mr Clegg said he sensed "a slight swagger" among the Conservatives over Mr Cameron's bid to repatriate powers from the EU, saying the PM was "ambivalent" towards the UK's place in Europe. And he called for electoral reform and wholesale changes to Britain's constitution, adding: "This sort of piecemeal tinkering does not go nearly far enough." He began his speech, in a half empty chamber, by saying it was "an unaccustomed surprise" to speak in the Commons without being greeted by a "disobliging wall of noise" from the opposition benches. Following the Lib Dem leader in the Commons, Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell said history would treat Mr Clegg's time as deputy prime minister more kindly than the electorate had.	Nick Clegg has accused the new Tory government of abandoning the values he said had been at the coalition's core.
Natalie Queiroz, 40, has been moved from critical care to a ward following the attack on Hollyfield Road, Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, on Friday. Ms Queiroz's daughter is doing well, University Hospitals Birmingham said. Babur Karamat Raja, 41, is charged with two counts of attempted murder and one of attempted child destruction. He was remanded in custody during a short hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday. Updates on this story and more in Birmingham and the Black Country. The court heard businessman Mr Raja, of Hollyfield Road in Sutton Coldfield, is also charged with assaulting witness Anthony Smith and possession of a knife. He is due to appear at Birmingham Crown Court on 6 April. Up to five passers-by helped Ms Queiroz when she was attacked at about 15:00 GMT on Friday, police said.	A heavily pregnant woman who was repeatedly stabbed in a street attack, resulting in her daughter's delivery hours later, is in a stable condition.
On Monday, Mr Robinson, who now advises the economy minister, denied any family links to the Renewable Heat Incentive. MLA Jonathan Bell said he was told he could not challenge the scheme because two DUP special advisers had "extensive interests in the poultry industry". Mr Bell made the allegation on Monday, speaking under parliamentary privilege. The DUP said the claims were "outrageous". But on Tuesday, Mr Robinson told the Press Association his father-in-law applied to the scheme in August 2015, before he was married in October. "I have never had any personal financial interest in the RHI Scheme," he said in a statement. "At no point have I ever advised anyone to join the Scheme or sought to benefit in any way from it. "Neither my wife nor I have ever had any role in the business nor have we received any benefit, financial or otherwise, from the business. "I was appointed as an adviser in the Department for the Economy in June 2016. I was not involved in any aspect of the RHI Scheme prior to taking up the post." The other adviser named by Mr Bell, Timothy Johnston, also denied his claims. MLAs were debating the RHI scheme at Stormont. The RHI scheme was set up by former first minister Arlene Foster in 2012 when she was enterprise minister. Its aim was to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for fuel, and the scheme became heavily oversubscribed. It could lead to an overspend of Â£490m over the next 20 years. Mr Bell said when he was enterprise minister his special adviser, Timothy Cairns, told him "he will not be allowed to reduce the tariff on (the RHI) scheme" because of Mr Johnston and Mr Robinson's "extensive interests in the poultry industry". He added that he has "kept the records in many, many formats" and that he had been suspended from the party for "telling the truth". He also claimed that Mr Robinson and Dr Andrew Crawford, a DUP party adviser, had issued instructions to "try not to get Arlene called to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)" and "under no circumstance allow Jonathan Bell to be called" over their roles in the RHI scheme. On Monday the DUP said that neither Mr Johnston nor Mr Robinson have interests in the poultry industry, and added that Mr Robinson's "family home farm have chicken houses but are not part of the RHI scheme and never have been recipients or applicants". Mr Johnston, the special adviser to Arlene Foster when she was first minister, said: "I have no family connections to the poultry industry and I have no connection to the RHI scheme. "These are unsubstantiated allegations. I have two brothers-in-law in the poultry industry. They have no connection to RHI." Mr Robinson, special adviser to Economy Minister Simon Hamilton, said: "I have no personal interest in the poultry industry. Two of my brothers are poultry farmers but they have no connections to RHI." Dr Crawford, a former special adviser to the Department of Finance, told the BBC last month that his brother is the director of a company which successfully applied to the RHI scheme. He said: "I never sought to keep the RHI scheme open at the original higher tariff against the wishes of the minister." Mr Bell broke ranks with his party and made serious allegations against the DUP over the scheme's operation in a BBC interview in December. He claimed that DUP advisers had attempted to remove Mrs Foster's name from documents linked to RHI. Mr Bell was later suspended from the DUP.	The father-in-law of former DUP director of communications John Robinson runs two green energy boilers under a botched energy scheme.
He says small companies are not receiving the funding required to grow. "We have been appallingly bad at giving those minnows the long-term capital they need," said Mr Woodford. On the BBC, Tech Talent coverage is asking whether the UK can compete in the global tech industry. The UK is a magnet for entrepreneurs - around a third of them come from abroad. But according to Mr Woodford and others, home-grown tech entrepreneurs are not turning promising starts into leading global companies. Rory Cellan-Jones: Has the UK got Tech Talent? Mapping the UK's digital clusters On Monday, the BBC will look at the vibrant and growing UK tech scene and ask why it has failed to find a Google or Facebook. A variety of reasons have been put forward, including a digital skills shortage, a lack of leadership experience and difficulties in raising finance. Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur and former adviser to David Cameron when he was prime minister, says funding for start-ups has "long been seen as a big problem in the UK". "There's two types of funding," he told the BBC. "There's the funding that comes from friends, family and fools: the start-up money - £50,000, £100,000 - to get going. There we've really made a big difference in the UK. We've created the world's most generous tax breaks for that kind of investment." The second type is "scale-up cash" to help companies grow, which is still proving "a big challenge". "There is a big role for government in providing a bunch of that funding, particularly when it comes to research in the laboratory and helping that go to market," he says. Mr Woodford agrees that financing is a major constraint. "We have four of the top 10 universities in the world, 29 of the top 200. We do science and research really, really well in the UK and we're generating lots of little companies," Mr Woodford said. According to him, it is after this stage that the problems emerge. Mr Woodford argues that UK investors are too short-term and do not have the scale to support small technology firms. Hussein Kanji, co-founder of Hoxton Ventures, agrees: "It would still be hard for something like an Uber to be born out of the UK because I don't think there's a financing community that would give Uber the billions of dollars that it has consumed to get to global stage." Others point out that Silicon Valley has had longer to perfect the process. Eileen Burbidge has worked at Apple and Yahoo and is now a venture capitalist based in London. "They [Silicon Valley] did have an ecosystem that was cultivated in the 1940s and 1950s frankly by the US government and the defence industry that were originally in that part of California." One problem, Mr Silva says, is the UK's entrepreneur relief which gives a lower capital gains tax when businessmen and women sell their company. "The problem is this relief perversely encourages you to sell out early. If you did decide to try and build a Google or an Uber in this country, you'd actually pay a much higher tax rate than if you'd sold out and decided to live in a country mansion after a few years." Mr Woodford also believes that UK entrepreneurs have been too quick to sell out once the business gets going. But this is not a path that Taavet Hinrikus, chief executive and co-founder of London based peer-to-peer money transfer service TransferWise, is intending to follow. His company has become what is known as a unicorn - a company set up since 2000 which is now valued at more than $1bn (£770 mn). There are fewer than 20 in the UK. He said he would not sell-up at the moment. "We're just getting started with the company so why should we stop now? What would I do? I'd go on the beach for a day and then I would become incredibly bored and I would have the same urge to change the world for the better. I think starting over would be going backwards," Mr Hinrikus said. Another theory is that universities aren't being supportive enough. "We haven't been as opportunistic, adventurous and entrepreneurial as others," said Annalisa Jenkins, boss of Dimension Therapeutics, a gene therapy innovator. "In the past academics have traditionally viewed success, quite rightly, as their ability to publish their research in leading journals... the notion of turning their inventions into innovations that really drive value for people hasn't really been rewarded and recognised in terms of the culture of our country in the last 20 to 30 years," Ms Jenkins said.

Technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, economics editor Kamal Ahmed and North America technology reporter Dave Lee will all be involved in the coverage of why the UK seemingly cannot match Silicon Valley.	Investors need to take a long-term view when backing new tech start-ups in the UK according to leading fund manager Neil Woodford, speaking as part of the BBC's Tech Talent coverage.
Wolves started brightly and Nouha Dicko gave them the lead, beating Rob Green with a low first-time shot on the run. Leeds turned up the pressure after the break, but Andy Lonergan saved from Souleymane Doukara and Kortney Hause cleared off the line to keep it 1-0. Fulham's 3-1 win over Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday's 2-1 victory at QPR sees Leeds drop into seventh place. Despite losing their past two Championship matches, Wolves dominated the opening exchanges, with Green having to come out quickly and make a low save one-on-one from Andreas Weimann. Dave Edwards forced another Green stop and Dicko went close, cutting inside and firing narrowly wide before the goal their pressure deserved finally came. The 24-year-old striker latched onto Ben Marshall's clever through-ball behind the defence and found the bottom corner before Green could set himself. Leeds rallied, but Pontus Jansson could not hit the target with a free header and Lonergan produced a reflex save to keep out Doukara's header from Kemar Roofe's cutback. Wolves sat back and invited pressure, with Hause clearing Roofe's looping header off the line from a corner and Chris Wood heading over late on, but the away side hung on to claim the points. The win secures Wolves' Championship status for another season on 54 points, while Leeds' third loss in five games puts them out of the play-offs on goal difference with three matches remaining. Leeds manager Garry Monk: "We're disappointed with that result. "We didn't want that to happen at this stage of the season but we've had the mentality for so long where we've been in the play-offs quite comfortably and have kind of been in that protective mode of trying to stay in there. "Now we have to change that mentality to be a team that goes on the hunt and lets it all go. "It's still a really good situation for us. We've got no time to feel sorry for ourselves, that doesn't get you anywhere." Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "We were excellent and should have been two or three up in the first half. "We were strong defensively in the second half and a threat on the break." Match ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1. Second Half ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1.

"Listen up," splashes the News Letter. The paper takes us to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and reports on the telling off Michael Barnier got from a UUP MEP. Jim Nicholson was speaking in the chamber about Northern Ireland's "integral roll in the UK" when he saw the French politician "twiddling with his telephone". The Armagh MEP suggested Mr Barnier "actually listen to the speech". The paper reports that the two made up later, however, with Mr Nicholson saying they had a "good and constructive meeting" in the chief Brexit negotiator's office. Cat lovers, look away now. The Belfast Telegraph reports that three cats who have made the grounds of Stormont their home are the latest victims of the collapse of the political institutions. A security review means a pensioner has been banned from feeding the cats, says the paper. Edna Watters said she was "broken-hearted" as she has been caring for cats at Stormont, day-in, day-out, for 30 years. The paper reports it has seen an email from the Stormont Estate Management Unit (SEMU), saying: "Only those visitors with a valid business reason can access restricted areas of the estate. "Feeding cats does not constitute a business need," it adds. Hence why Edna has been refused entry. But there may be light at the end of the tunnel for the 76-year-old - the cats' homes are to be moved to a more suitable area where she will be free to visit them. The Irish News leads with the news of a spike in calls to a Belfast surgery from patients fearing they will die after a spate of sudden deaths over the weekend. At least three of the five Belfast deaths, one of which was a 16-year old girl, were connected to drugs, say police. Dr Michael McKenna, whose surgery is based on the Falls Road, said one of the people who died was a patient of his and he had been contacted by several people, including a teenager who had taken 20 "street diazepam" at once. One headline in the paper strikes a particularly bitter-sweet note. "Parents whose newborn son died now raffling ex-Tyrone stars boots in aid of hospital baby unit". Ballinderry couple Sinead and Cormac McIvor's baby Franky tragically died after living for a few days before passing away in February. But the big-hearted couple are hoping to raise money for the Royal's neo-natal intensive care unit in Belfast by auctioning Tyrone GAA star Owen Mulligan's boots. Mrs McIvor said she and her husband were keen to help the unit after the expert care baby Franky received. Talk about building with bricks and Donald Trump might bring to mind US plans for a wall along the border with Mexico, but the News Letter has the story of a Belfast artist who has captured the image of the POTUS using Lego bricks. The creation, which is of President Trump as a teenager, is just one of the subjects of David Turner's latest collection which looks at famous politicians in their "formative years". It looks like the piece has already been snapped up by an art collector. The Belfast Telegraph reports that a "massive quantity of 20p coins", understood to amount to thousands of pounds, were stolen from a house in Ligoniel in north Belfast on Tuesday. The coins were in two large glass jars. All the papers report on the PSNI's "action plan" to recruit more Catholics. However bringing back the 50/50 policy has been ruled out. The Irish News says recent recruitment drives have "struggled to attract new Catholic officers". The News Letter says the PSNI intends to start a new recruitment drive targeting "cold spots" this autumn. A number of changes will also be made in the recruitment process, it says.	Thursday's newspaper front pages all take different directions.
Routine monitoring by Argyll and Bute Council discovered raised levels of algal toxins in Loch Melfort and Seil Sound. The naturally-occurring toxins were above the "legally-permitted levels for harvest". Members of the public have been asked not to gather them. The toxins accumulate in molluscs such as mussels, oysters, cockles and razor clams, and when levels breach statutory limits, harvesting of affected species is prohibited. Elsewhere, raised levels of Escheria coli (E.coli) bacteria have been identified in Oitir Mhor Bay. It follows the discovery of raised levels at Kerrera West, Loch Craignish, Kilfinichen Bay and Castle Stalker. They were discovered by the council's environmental health team as part of their work to maintain the quality of shellfish. Potential raised levels of E.coli were also found at Dunstaffnage, Kerrera East, Loch na Cille and Loch Riddon. A council spokesman said: "Eating shellfish such as cockles, mussels, oysters and razor fish from affected areas can pose a risk to human health. "Notices to warn the public and casual gatherers have been posted along the shore. Commercial shellfish harvesters in these areas have been contacted by the council and steps taken to postpone harvesting until bacterial levels subside. "People are advised to avoid eating shellfish from these areas until further notice as a precaution. When levels subside, the warning notices will be removed."	People have been warned not to eat shellfish in parts of Argyll and Bute after raised levels of toxins were found.
The Anglo-South African company said its current structure was "too costly" and inefficient. Changes to the regulatory environment in Europe and South Africa had also made the business more complex to run. It came as the firm reported a 4% rise in annual pre-tax adjusted operating profit to Â£1.7bn. Old Mutual said it expected the separation of its four main units to be completed by the end of 2018. The company plans to separate into Old Mutual Emerging Markets, Old Mutual Wealth, Nedbank Group and OM Asset Management. Chief executive Bruce Hemphill said: "The strategy we have announced today sets out a bold new course to unlock value currently trapped within the group structure. "We have four strong businesses that can reach their full potential by freeing them from the costs and constraints of the group. "These businesses are performing strongly, have excellent competitive positions in sizeable markets and the underlying growth potential to flourish independently." He said the current organisation of the group was "a costly structure with insufficient synergies to justify those costs". The group said it had yet to decide how it would go about spinning off the units. Old Mutual announced its strategic review in November, after former Standard Bank executive Mr Hemphill took over as chief executive. The group, which was founded in South Africa in 1845, currently has a majority stake in South African lender Nedbank. But it plans to reduce it to a minority stake by the end of 2018. The company's Old Mutual Wealth unit, a sponsor of England rugby union, has also received a takeover approach from private equity firms, according to reports citing unnamed sources.	Financial services group Old Mutual has said it will split itself into four separate companies following the outcome of a strategic review.
In the capital Nairobi and other cities, many shops remain open. At least 24 people have been killed in violence since the 8 August election, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights has said. Mr Odinga said the poll was rigged to give President Uhuru Kenyatta victory, and called for a "day of mourning for the fallen patriots". However, Kenyans on Twitter have been using the hashtag #TurudiKaziniChallenge (Swahili for "Let's return to work" ) to urge a return to normalcy following last week's disruptions. Mr Kenyatta repeated his appeal for peace. "At the end of the day we are all Kenyans, we don't need to fight one  another, we don't need to destroy each other's property, we don't need to take  life," he said in a statement. "Kenyans have said that the election is behind them, the majority have  returned to work," he added. Young people have been burning tyres in Kibera, a Nairobi slum where Mr Odinga has strong support, reports the BBC's Tomi Oladipo from the scene. However, some of Mr Odinga's supporters in Kibera have opened their shops, saying that while they agree with him that the result was rigged, they cannot afford to lose business, our reporter adds. Businesses are open as usual in the coastal city of Mombasa. In the western city of Kisumu, a stronghold of Mr Odinga, there has been a mixed response to the strike, with shops open in some areas and shut in others. The official results gave President Kenyatta about 54% of the vote, and Mr Odinga 45%. "This is a failed regime that is resorting to killing people instead of addressing the real issue. The vote was stolen. There's no secret about that," Mr Odinga told his supporters on Sunday, as he called for a strike. Foreign observers have declared the poll free and fair. European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan are among those who have urged Mr Odinga to seek redress through the courts - something the opposition coalition says is not an option.	Many Kenyans have ignored opposition leader Raila Odinga's call for a strike over disputed elections.
As he was in the summer, the 38-year-old has again been linked with the vacant national job following the departure of Sam Allardyce on Tuesday. Howe guided Bournemouth to Premier League safety last season after winning the Championship title in 2015. "My mindset and my full attention is here with AFC Bournemouth," Howe told BBC Radio Solent. "The last thing you need is to be distracted. I certainly won't be, but I know other people will talk about it." Howe was recently asked in an interview with the BBC's The Premier League Show if the role as national coach would ever appeal to him in the future. "The England job, I think, is the ultimate," he told presenter Gary Lineker during filming before Allardyce's departure. "I would never say no, but it's not something I want to consider." Media playback is not supported on this device Howe has now moved to reassure Bournemouth supporters his view has not changed despite subsequent events. "I have pledged my allegiance to AFC Bournemouth time and time again," he said. "When these situations and these stories occur, it's more the press than absolutely anything else. I'm absolutely committed to AFC Bournemouth."	Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says he will not be distracted by talk linking him with the England manager's role.
When the hand of God strikes, nudging a major GCSE exam into the path of an England World Cup match, it can be a teachers' worst nightmare. A clash with the Muslim month of fasting may also cause concern in some schools wanting their pupils to do their best. And as exam timetabling is something of a long game, there can be no last-minute changes to scheduling to take into account a major football fixture. With so much hype over world sporting events such as the Olympics or the World Cup, most people will want to watch, says former exams doctor George Turnbull. "With the best will in the world, it is very difficult to talk young people down from taking time out of their revision to watch such events, and staying up late is not the best way to prepare for examinations," says the former adviser for exams regulator Ofqual. "Of course young people should be preparing long before hand, but we all know that it doesn't always work like that The exam itself should be the major event because it has so much potential to affect the young person's life chances," he adds. The public exams timetable is drawn up by the Joint Council for Qualifications at least 18 months in advance of the exams themselves, following consultations with a wide range of stakeholders including religious groups, schools and colleges. And because of the narrow window in which exam boards can hold examinations and get them marked, they are always in a fixed period of six weeks in the education calendar. The JCQ has reiterated that there were only minimal changes carried out to the draft timetable for 2016  before it was published. "In such a large, complex system where there is a large number of candidates taking examinations and a diverse range of subjects available, it is not always possible to meet each and every request," it says. "Exam boards will always aim to be as fair as possible to all. "If a small change can be made for any one group that does not impact negatively on most students, it will, quite rightly, be considered - but these are made before the timetable is published." And even as that timetable is drawn up, there is very little room for manoeuvre, says Andrew Harland, chief executive of the Exam Officers' Association. He cites the example of one local authority that complained, unsuccessfully, their students were going to have to sit a maths exam during their half-term holiday. Exam boards have to get GCSE papers marked in time for schools and colleges to decide places on sixth-form courses, he explains. Equally, A-level papers need to be graded so universities can confirm places to potential undergraduates. In recent years, the exam season has moved from June to July to late May to June, in part, to enable boards to get enough markers. Mr Harland says exams used to run up to the end of term, when people were going on holiday. "The days of markers taking a bundle of papers down to a cottage in Cornwall are over, as marking has moved online," he says. There may be a few cases where students taking unusual sets of subjects may have exam clashes, Mr Harland says. This can mean they have to take a paper at a later time of day and will thus need supervision so the integrity of the examination paper is maintained. But the major change in exam timetabling in recent years has been to what he describes as a "one-hit summer exam system" in which all exams are taken at the end of a two-year period and retakes have been discouraged. This, he argues, has put even more pressure on exam boards to get timetabling right first time.	As it emerges that GCSE and A-level exam timetables have been drawn up to minimise clashes with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, we take a look at what influences and restricts scheduling.
They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are "of particular interest" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved their "causal connection" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been "secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine". "The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts," the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. "We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17," he added. "If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough." The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question. The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added. The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia. They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October. The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage. Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as "premature" and "counterproductive". The Boeing 777 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was brought down on 17 July last year in Donetsk region.	Fragments of a suspected Russian missile system have been found at the Flight MH17 crash site in Ukraine, investigators in the Netherlands say.
It was the third day of hefty falls, sparked by news on Wednesday that the company admitted falsifying fuel economy data for more than 600,000 vehicles sold in Japan. Government officials raided a company office and authorities want a full report from the company in weeks. The shares are 40% cheaper than before news of the false data emerged. Elsewhere on the Asian markets, shares of consumer electronics giant Sony also traded lower and closed down 1.7%. The company trimmed nearly 10% off its previous profit estimate for the full year to March 2016, due to a one-off charge. Sony is scheduled to report its financial results next week. On the broader Japanese market, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index reversed earlier losses and ended the Friday session higher by 1.2% - or 208.87 points - at 17,572.49. Other Asian markets traded lower on Friday, mirroring how US markets performed overnight. South Korea's Kospi closed down 0.33% at 2,015.49. In Australia the S&P ASX 200 ended the week down 0.69% at 5,236.39. China's Shanghai composite ended up 0.2% to 2,959.24. Meanwhile in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index dropped 0.7% to trade at 21,467.	Shares in Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors plunged 13.5% in Friday trade to close at 504 yen.
The FBI has ordered the tech giant to assist it with unlocking an iPhone used by San Bernadino gunman Syed Farook. Prince Al Hussein said the law enforcement agency "deserves everyone's full support" in its investigation. However, encryption was essential in the interests of freedom, he added. "There are many ways to investigate whether or not these killers had accomplices besides forcing Apple to create software to undermine the security features of their own phones," he said in a statement. "It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers. "Encryption and anonymity are needed as enablers of both freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to privacy. Without encryption tools, lives may be endangered." Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and left 22 injured when they opened fire at his place of work in California in December 2015. The FBI has asked Apple to disable a feature that means the data on an iPhone is erased after 10 incorrect attempts at the four-digit password. It also wants to be able to run software that could go through the 10,000 possible combinations to unlock the gunman's handset quickly. Apple says agreeing to the request would set "a dangerous precedent". A number of major tech firms have also pledged their support for Apple's refusal to circumvent its own security. Two groups of tech giants have now filed an amicus brief, which allows parties not directly involved in a court case, but who feel they are affected by it, to give their view. They include Twitter, AirBnB, eBay, LinkedIn, Reddit, Amazon, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo. However, a lawyer representing a group of Farook's surviving victims said he would file similar legal paperwork on their behalf in support of the FBI. "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," said Stephen Larson, a former judge. He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee.	Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, high commissioner for human rights at the United Nations, has warned that a "Pandora's box" will be opened if Apple co-operates with the FBI.

He said it "makes sense" for pay to be handled by AMs and Welsh ministers as education is already devolved. The Welsh Government described the move - part of planned changes to the Wales Bill which sets out the next steps for Welsh devolution - as "encouraging". But two major teaching unions say they are opposed to the idea, fearing lower pay than in England. The move is one of several improvements demanded by First Minister Carwyn Jones for the bill, which the Welsh Government says it is not yet ready to support. The announcement was made as the much-criticised bill, which makes significant changes to the way power is shared between Wales and Westminster, returned to the House of Lords for debate on Monday. "Education is a devolved matter, and it makes sense for the assembly and Welsh ministers to decide the pay and conditions of teachers' in Wales," Mr Cairns said. The amendment to the bill on teachers' pay will be debated next Monday. Powers over the community infrastructure levy - which allows councils to raise cash for local improvements - will also be devolved, Mr Cairns added, with further changes promised in the coming weeks. "I want a clear and lasting devolution settlement that works for Wales and for the UK as a whole," he said, adding he was happy to consider devolving further powers "where there's a clear purpose for doing so". However Geraint Davies, Wales official for the NASUWT union, said teachers in Wales were "best served by a continuous link with Westminster". He said: "We strongly believe that if pay and conditions were devolved there is every danger that teachers here could end up being paid less than across the border for doing the same job." Mr Davies added if wages were higher in England there was also a risk of teachers leaving Wales to further their careers. Owen Hathway, policy officer for NUT Cymru, also said his members were opposed to the move. "We are fearful that we will have terms and conditions that are depressed and will lead to lower wages," he said. "When you think there is a teaching shortage in England, if you pay them more in England it could lead to a brain drain of teachers going across the border. "But the political will is there for it to happen." Earlier in October, Mr Jones told Mr Cairns the UK government's approach to the legislation would "heavily" influence whether his government recommends the bill to the assembly - saying he was not yet ready to do so. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: "As the first minister's recent letter to the Secretary of State (Alun Cairns) made clear, we are not currently in a position to support the bill and there are a number of obstacles still to overcome. "However, these are encouraging amendments from the UK Government, and we note with interest the promise of further changes in the coming weeks." During the debate concerns were also raised about a lack of power Wales has over it courts and prisons. Lord Wigley said it was not acceptable there was no crown court west of Swansea, or between Swansea and Caernarfon, and no crown court between Merthyr and Mold. He added: "Wales is able to decide on the siting of its schools and hospitals, but not on its courts and prisons." Baroness Morgan, shadow minister for Wales in the House of Lords, said it was premature to talk about establishing a separate legal jurisdiction for Wales, but said the issue did need to be addressed. Lord Wigley withdrew his amendment on legal jurisdiction, but said he hoped the focus would remain on such issues.	Control over teachers' pay and conditions will be devolved, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns has announced.
The video posted by Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, a strong Putin ally, portrayed Mr Kasyanov though a sniper's gun sights. Mr Kadyrov has criticised social network Instagram for removing it. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Kasyanov said Mr Putin was responsible for Mr Kadyrov's actions. "He is one of the 45 governors of the [Russian] regions, appointed personally by Mr Putin, and Mr Putin is responsible for his behaviour personally," he told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford. "He is supposed to stop his undertakings... but unfortunately there's no reaction. The fact that Putin who is guarantor of constitution doesn't stop Kadyrov - means it's some kind of silent encouragement at least." Putin loyalist Kadyrov unleashed on Russian 'traitors' Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally Mr Kasyanov, who served as President Putin's prime minister from 2000 to 2004, now leads Parnas, a small liberal opposition party. He and other Russian opposition politicians have described the sniper video, which appeared after the Chechen leader called Mr Putin's critics "enemies" and "traitors", as a murder threat. "They want to intimidate us and continue to create pressure on the opposition," Mr Kasyanov said. "The main purpose is pressure on the opposition. To make fear. So that we stop our active policy." He described Mr Kadyrov as "one of the most outrageous pieces" of the current Russian political system. "Like all people in Russia, we should all be worried about what is going on," Mr Kasyanov said. "But we've chosen our way and we have to stand up and continue to do our job." The former prime minister argued that a campaign of intimidation was under way because the Kremlin feared the opposition speaking out about the economic crisis and other issues. "That's why they are afraid of us," he said. "Because we will describe  who is responsible for the problems of the people." Instagram said the controversial video had "violated the requirement to respect other members" of the social network. Mr Kadyrov, who has ruled Chechnya with an iron fist for nearly a decade with the support of the Kremlin, suppressing separatism, accused Instagram of bowing to US pressure. In a new Instagram post, he said he had been punished for saying a "few words about the USA's guard dogs". "You can write anything you want, but do not touch America's dogs, friends of the Department of State and Congress," he said. "You know very well whom I am talking about!" Last March Mr Kadyrov spoke out on Instagram about the assassination of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov in Moscow, defending one of the Chechens charged over the shooting. A day later President Putin gave Mr Kadyrov a top award. Nemtsov, also a leading member of Parnas, was among several well-known opponents of Mr Putin assassinated in the past decade.	Russian politician Mikhail Kasyanov has accused President Vladimir Putin of "silently encouraging" intimidation as a row over a menacing video continues.
It is hoped the RNLI camera will reduce the number of launches at Porthcawl, in Bridgend county, which had the second highest number for Wales in 2015. The camera looks out towards the town's pier from the lifeboat station. The location is also notorious for crashing waves that can risk sweeping people out to sea. Ian Stroud from Porthcawl RNLI is their former deputy launch authoriser. He said: "One of the most significant tasks a lifeboat station must undertake is observing sea conditions to make judgements on the equipment lifeboat operators will need. "We wanted a view of the pier as it is such an important landmark. This is viewable by members of the public, who can alert the lifeboat station if they see someone in distress." The camera was supplied by Swansea-based PC-1 and Axis Communications. PC-1's online project manager Graham Thomas said: "We installed a weather station and connected the installation to YouTube, allowing the public and lifeboat staff to view real-time images and accurate weather reports - including tide times. "The station will soon receive a superfast fibre connection, allowing for a further upgrade of the system to take full advantage of the camera's HD capabilities. "We can then look at running an additional camera; one looking at the pier and another focusing on the coastal defence where waves crash up to 300 feet in the air."	One of Wales' busiest lifeboat callout hotspots has had a monitoring camera installed to warn the public of dangerous sea conditions.
The man had left the medals on a work surface to clean before leaving his home in Wootton Park, Bristol, only to find on his return that they had vanished. It is thought someone entered the house via a rear door on the afternoon of 22 June. Avon and Somerset Police are appealing for help in tracing the items. Among the collection of medals was a bronze 1939-45 star, a bronze France and Germany star and a police long service medal. The medals were were engraved with the victim's name, the regimental number 2666006 and 5th Battalion Coldstream Guards. A silver and green French Legion d'Honneur medal  - the highest decoration bestowed by the French state - and a black wallet with gold lettering in the bottom right corner were also taken. Anyone with information is urged to call 101 and quote reference number 5216151507.	A 91-year-old war veteran had his six medals stolen from his home while he went on a shopping trip.
The message from David Cameron was clear - there needs to be "a big cultural change" towards sport in schools with a return to the "competitive ethos" in school sports. The prime minister said the problem was not money and suggested some teachers were not "playing their part" but what do those in grassroots sport believe are the key ingredients for success? Graeme Maw, director of sport at Millfield School, in Somerset, says every pupil at the school does a minimum of three hours of scheduled sport per week. However, many pupils at the private school, which has nine former and current pupils competing at the London Games - more than any other school - do up to 22 hours of training. There are also more than 30 different sports on offer. Mr Maw says the word "opportunity" is key. "Sport and physical activity are the heartbeat of our community," says Mr Maw. The Youth Sport Trust (YST) says it is important schools engage everyone, for example by involving young people in the selection and planning of sport and activities. Schools also need to broaden the range of lunchtime and after-hours clubs to increase opportunities for young people to take part, it says. It is an ethos Mr Maw agrees with. "Dance might not be an Olympic sport but it's something that young girls really enjoy - it's about finding and discovering individual talent in a child," he adds. Mr Cameron spoke on Wednesday of "some teachers not wanting to join in and play their part" when it came to school sports. But Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says his comments were "ill informed, unfair and fail to recognise the huge contribution that many teachers make to sports in schools". "Many teachers, not just PE staff, willingly give up their time to motivate and coach young people in a wide range of sports," he says. The YST says there must be teachers and coaches on the ground ready to support young people who show an interest in sport at primary and secondary level. Mr Cameron has said the government is investing Â£1bn in school sports over the next four years, but "the problem isn't money". David Mansfield, headteacher at Coopers' Company and Coborn School, in Essex, says investment is key. The state school was named the most sports-minded school in Europe in 2005 and Mr Mansfield says it is one of few that competes with public schools in national sport. Mr Mansfield says the school's success is down to putting extra money into sports, for example, the school employs a professional hockey coach. He describes funding as "the bottom line" and says there is a "straight-line correlation between outcomes and incomes". "If schools are not on the front foot to identify talent then we're going to see a real fall away from the fantastic job that has been done (in the past)," he says. Mr Trobe is critical of the removal of funding for the Schools Sports Partnership (SSP), a network of sports colleges in England - including the Coopers' school - that put specialist PE teachers to work with primary school pupils, linked schools with local sports clubs, brought high quality coaches into schools and promoted competitive matches. Experts say it is too early to say how this will affect school sport participation. But Mr Trobe says: "If the prime minister is serious about wanting to enhance sport in schools the funding will need to be put in place to support those very willing teachers and coaches to deliver a lasting sporting legacy." The Fields in Trust (FIT), a UK charity that protects recreational spaces, says funding is essential - but it is important not to forget about the fields themselves. "It is important to look beyond the funding when considering sporting legacy for a golden future," said Alison Moore-Gwyn, chief executive. "David Cameron has initiated this process but it is vital that other elements which nurture sporting ability are not overlooked. A fundamental one is the provision of space for people to discover and hone their talent." The charity's Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge focuses on this, says Ms Moore-Gwyn. The scheme works with landowners to protect their outdoor recreational spaces, aiming for 2,012 of them by the end of this year. The YTS says school and council facilities should also be opened up after hours. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Education Secretary Michael Gove has approved the sale of more than 20 school sports fields in the past two years. But FIT said more concerning was the situation for academies and new free schools, which are exempt from government regulations that govern mainstream schools' freedom to sell off their playing fields. There could be an unknown number of other sports pitches that have been lost, it said. "This could have serious implications for our sporting legacy," a spokeswoman said. The prime minister has called for a return to the "competitive ethos" and "getting rid of the idea all must win prizes and you can't have competitive sports days". But British Olympic Association chairman Colin Moynihan says many children do not want to play competitive sport, nor should they have to. "The key thing is to make sure that where they do want to there's the facility and the opportunity for them to do so and that's our emphasis and has been our emphasis throughout," he says. The YST adds that the first experience young people have of sport needs to be as positive as possible to encourage them to go further. This week a survey of 2,000 people by Freeview found that seven out of 10 thought Team GB athletes had replaced music stars and footballers as role models. During the Games so far many stars have served to inspire young athletes. Alan Davis, head coach at the Maindy Flyers club in Cardiff, where gold medal-winning cyclist Geraint Thomas trained until he was 16, said Thomas was "the perfect role model". "He's humble and takes his success and occasional setbacks equally well. What better example to give nine-year-old kids," he said. While Jessica Ennis's former PE teacher has said she is inspiring a new generation of athletes. Chris Eccles, who taught Miss Ennis at King Ecgbert School, Sheffield, said: "They are inspired by her because they can see someone from their own town being so successful." They have been on show throughout the Games, none more so than Chad Le Clos's father Bert who paid tribute to his "beautiful boy" after winning a swimming gold, but parents are often key to many Olympic successes. John Steele, chief executive officer at the YST, says: "For every gold medal and Olympic athlete we have had the pleasure to watch performing at the Games, there is a teacher, coach or parent that inspired them to start the journey to be their personal best." The YST says parents should encourage their children to lead active lifestyles and get them involved in sport, but parents themselves also need to be encouraged into volunteering roles in sports clubs and school sports activity. Mr Maw says it is important to find ways to celebrate sport and make it fun. Last year 2,000 of Millfield's pupils and 450 members of staff ran a total of 2,755 miles, raising Â£21,000 for Sport Relief. He says it is about "everybody having fun in the name of sport".	With Team GB celebrating their most successful Olympics for 100 years, a debate is growing about how best to build on the legacy and inspire the next generation into sport.
The 1920s window at St Paul's Church in Grangetown, Cardiff, depicts air, sea and land battles alongside religious images and trench scenes. The church says the masonry around the window must be replaced. Repairs could cost tens of thousands of pounds.	An appeal has been launched to raise money to refurbish one of the largest stained-glass windows in Wales honouring casualties from World War One.
In 2007, the Icelandic economy appeared healthy. Its real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 35% higher than it was in 2002, unemployment was 2.3% and government debt was a modest 27% of GDP. However, the assets of its three largest banks had grown to over nine times GDP, a size that made it impossible for the Icelandic central bank to act as an effective lender of last resort. Thus, regardless of the quality of the banks' assets, the predictable consequence was a bank run and the subsequent collapse of the Icelandic banking system. Following the demise of its banks, Iceland imposed capital controls to prevent massive outflows and a plunge in the value of its currency. Recapitalisation of its banking system and other crisis-related expenses caused government debt to rise to 95% of GDP by 2011. However, a successful International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme cushioned the impact: real GDP fell by a less-than-expected 6.6% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2010, before returning to growth. Icelandic authorities protected the holders of domestic deposits, who enjoyed uninterrupted access to their accounts; the UK and Dutch governments stepped in to protect deposit holders in UK and Dutch branches of Icelandic banks. In 2013, the European Free Trade Association (Efta) court ruled that Iceland did not breach its obligations, either by treating domestic deposits differently or by not accepting legal obligation for foreign branch deposits. Today, Iceland faces the difficult challenge of removing its capital controls in an orderly fashion but the IMF expects real GDP growth of 4.1% in 2015. In 2008, the Cypriot economy was more like that of an emerging market nation than a modern European one, but the country was enjoying an economic boom. Cypriot real GDP had grown by 27% between 2002 and 2008. The growth, however, had been fuelled by inflows of foreign bank deposits and foreign loans to banks. As a result, the assets of commercial banks with Cypriot parents expanded to over five times' Cypriot GDP. Unlike the Icelandic banks, the Cypriot banks had a credible lender of last resort: their central bank was a member of the Eurosystem. Unfortunately, they were heavily exposed to Greece. Cypriot banks were hit hard by the restructuring of Greek sovereign debt in 2012. In March 2013, the Cypriot authorities were in a desperate situation. Either they had to make a sizable contribution to a European Stability Mechanism/IMF rescue package or the emergency loans Cypriot banks had been receiving through its central bank would be cut off. Without the rescue package, saving the Cypriot banking system would be likely to require exiting from the euro area, adopting a new currency and recapitalising the banks by printing money. This would cause the value of the new currency to plummet, taking with it the real value of Cypriot pensions, wages and bank accounts. To avoid catastrophe, the Cypriot authorities looked to the one source of readily available funds: Cypriot bank deposits. Initially they planned to impose a levy on all deposits but ultimately insured depositors were spared. To stem a run, capital controls were imposed. Banks were closed for two weeks and when they were reopened there was a limit on daily withdrawals. Real GDP fell by 2.4% in 2012, 5.4% in 2013 and 2.3% in 2014. Unemployment rose to 16.2% in 2014 and government debt has climbed to 107% of GDP. Currently, the outlook for Cyprus is guarded. The country finally returned to economic growth this year and the capital controls were removed entirely in April. However, further economic reform is necessary to ensure sustainable growth. Greece currently faces a choice similar to the one faced by Cyprus in 2013. Its banking system depends for its survival on emergency lending controlled by the ECB. Bank runs have forced the imposition of capital controls, temporary bank closures and limits on deposit withdrawals. The consequences of leaving the Eurosystem are likely to be as dire for Greece as they would have been for Cyprus. Reaching an accommodation with its creditors is the preferred outcome. Real GDP has fallen by almost 30% in Greece since 2007, partly because of severe fiscal austerity. Unemployment was 26% in 2014 and there has been an exodus of skilled labour. As with Cyprus, and unlike with Iceland, any lasting recovery will require significant economic and fiscal reform. Greece ranks 61st in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, edging out Russia and Cyprus (at 64) but behind Tunisia; Iceland is 12th. Government debt was already a massive 113% of annual GDP in 2008 and now stands at 180%. Capital controls were necessary in Iceland and Cyprus, and in Greece today, but they come at a cost. Many view them as an assault on civil liberties; others see them as a chance to profit. Even in Iceland, a remote island nation, evasion and avoidance appear to have been widespread. Some say they promote disrespect for the law and the belief that once again the wealthy, sophisticated and corrupt are benefiting at the expense of the rest of society. Anne Sibert is a professor of Economics at Birkbeck, University of London, a fellow of the Centre for Economic Policy Research. She is a former member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Iceland.	As people across cash-strapped Greece wait to vote in a referendum on Sunday on whether to accept proposals made by creditors, what can be learned by examining similar economic crises in Iceland and Cyprus?
Coroner Jim Kitson said the inquest into the death of 11-year-old Francis Rowntree in 1972 would be "severely hampered" if he could not attend. He said the man's heart condition had to be a factor when deciding whether to compel him to give evidence. The coroner told the preliminary hearing it was a "fine balancing act". Francis was playing with friends at the Divis Flats complex off the Falls Road in west Belfast in April 1972 when he was struck on the head by the rubber bullet. He died in hospital several days later. Controversy surrounds the shooting, with disputed claims about whether the young boy was struck directly or hit by a ricochet, and if the bullet had been doctored to make it potentially cause more injury. The former Royal Anglian Regiment member who fired the rubber bullet is known to the court as soldier B. A barrister for the Ministry of Defence told the hearing that soldier B's consultant cardiologist had expressed "significant reservations" about his fitness to attend, in a report produced for the coroner's court. "It appears on the face of it to be quite a severe condition involving multiple medical interventions over the years," the lawyer said. He added: "The likelihood of a heart attack or death would be small but not zero. "There is a significant risk to the health of this man to compel him to give evidence." A barrister representing the Rowntree family said a number of steps could be taken to make the witness feel at ease. She suggested the former soldier could give evidence via video-link; there could be regular breaks in the hearing; medical assistance could be on standby and the court could be partially cleared. She told the coroner: "You know the gravity of the case and you know he's essentially the key witness and very important to the case." Mr Kitson said: "This is a key witness and clearly the inquest would be severely hampered if this witness is not in attendance, but I'm acutely aware of the impact on this man's health. "It's a fine balancing act between the two prerogatives and pressures - I will reflect on this very carefully." The inquest is due to begin on 27 April.	A coroner has said he will reflect carefully on whether a soldier who fired a rubber bullet that killed a boy is too ill to give evidence.
Derek Penman said the oversight of the project was inadequate and made 30 recommendations. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the report included some "hard messages" for the force and pledged the recommendations would be implemented. The report followed the M9 crash in which Lamara Bell and John Yuill died. Ms Bell, who was discovered critically injured in the crashed car, had been in the vehicle next to her dead partner Mr Yuill for three days. She died later in hospital. Police Scotland admitted they did not investigate a report they had received about the crash until three days after it happened. The father and grandfather of Ms Bell's five-year-old son Kieran, said the report delivered "a damning indictment on Police Scotland's call-handling processes". In a statement, Kieran's father Lee Burt and grandfather James McMillan said "such a catastrophe should never happen again", and that Police Scotland were "guilty of failing communities across Scotland". They added: "At the heart of this tragedy is Kieran who never stops speaking about his mum. "Some mornings he will wake up a happy boy because he dreamt of Lamara, but it is heartbreaking when a little boy tells you he misses his mum and the sound of laughter changes to silence." Ms Bell's brother Martin said he was no closer to understanding why the call reporting his sister's vehicle had crashed down an embankment was not investigated. He said he would have to wait for the results of an inquiry by Pirc (Police Investigations and Review Commissioner) to get the answers to those specific questions. The HM Inspectorate of Constabulary report, which concentrates on police call-handling more generally, found examples of call handlers being under pressure to end calls quickly and grading of calls being dependent on resources available. Mr Penman said staffing levels at Bilston Glen - where the call regarding the M9 crash was received - were insufficient and had resulted in poor call-handling performance, although the force had made "considerable efforts to address this". The report also said: Read our guide to 10 things we have learned about police call-handling from the report. The report offered assurances on areas including staffing levels, the effective handling of emergency and high priority calls, and training arrangements for new staff. Its recommendations included a review of the use of ad hoc "scribble pads" by service advisors and to "provide definitive guidance on their use, issue and proportionate supervision". Scribble pads are used by some staff to note information rather than inputting it directly into the computer system. Mr Penman said there were "a number of weaknesses" in Police Scotland's approach to the roll-out of its new national call handling system. "This model is a critical element in the delivery of frontline policing and a key part of the bringing together of Police Scotland post reform," he said. "The oversight of this project has been inadequate with key risks and other issues not being identified or highlighted to senior managers. "There was an initial focus on meeting deadlines and increased productivity rather than a well-managed project with a focus on customer service, good staff relations and thorough process design." Mr Penman also said that Police Scotland should focus on stabilising the existing call-handling arrangements before making any further changes. Plans to close control rooms in Aberdeen and Inverness have already been postponed and Mr Penman said that should not change in the near future. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament, the justice secretary said independent experts would be brought in to provide strong assurances before any decision was considered regarding the implementation of proposed changes to Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness control centres. In January 2014, Police Scotland announced proposals to cut the number of police control rooms, retaining five of its 11 sites. Dumfries was first to close, followed by Stirling, Glenrothes, and Pitt Street in Glasgow in March 2015. Aberdeen, which has two control rooms was scheduled for the end of this year. The reform plan saw Motherwell and Govan becoming a West Area Control centre, Bilston Glen near Edinburgh given responsibility for the East Command Area and Dundee the North Area Command. Inverness was to lose its police control room but would instead become the new hub for the command and control of major incidents and national events anywhere in the country. Following the interim HMICS report in September, plans to close Aberdeen and Inverness were put on hold. Mr Matheson said that, in future, "any dip in performance such as experienced in Bilston Glen earlier this year will become quickly apparent and will trigger rapid intervention". He also said unannounced visits would be made to call centres which would begin with immediate effect and would be ongoing until the restructure was complete. "The report also includes some hard messages for Police Scotland and I have been assured that all 30 of the recommendations will be accepted and actioned by them," he said. "It is my strong conviction that investment in staff is as important if not more important than investment in systems." Police Scotland's Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick said the force would be implementing the recommendations of the report "through a detailed and comprehensive action plan". She said maintaining the eight previous systems had not been a "viable option" and that the changes required had been "highly complex". "We acknowledge there have been challenges. Today's report recognises that we have already made progress in addressing these issues to ensure we can further strengthen call handling." Brian Docherty, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, which represents police officers, said: "We have consistently stated that the drive to save money was resulting in an erosion of service and creating intolerable pressures on those working within it. "We have also stated that there is little point answering calls quickly if there are no police officers available to respond to them. "This report leaves no doubt that this was indeed the case and that our concerns were fully justified." The HMICS report is the first of two reports into the incident. The Police Investigations Review Commissioner (Pirc) is investigating the incident itself while the HMICS review examined the broader issue of call-handling. Chief Constable Sir Stephen House, who will stand down next month, admitted the information received about the M9 crash near Stirling on Sunday 5 July in the initial call had not been entered into police systems.	Weaknesses in Police Scotland's roll-out of its new national call-handling system have been highlighted in an Inspector of Constabulary report.
The 11 imams, sheiks and religious teachers from nine countries met a Holocaust survivor and Poles whose families risked execution to save Jews from the Nazis, in the Polish capital's Nozyk Synagogue as part of the tour. They have been around museums, including the recently opened Museum of the History of Polish Jews on the site of the former Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw. And they also visited the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. "The main aim is to get Muslims who are leaders all over the world, particularly in the Middle East, to acknowledge the reality of what happened here and to be able to teach it to the people that they lead," said trip organiser Rabbi Jack Bemporad, who is executive director of the US-based Center for Interreligious Understanding. He was standing underneath the red brick watchtower over the main entrance to Birkenau, the largest of more than 40 camps that made up the Auschwitz complex. This was where the Nazis installed four gas chambers and crematoria to speed up the murder and disposal of people, who were mostly Jews, from across Europe. Auschwitz-Birkenau, set up by the Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland, is largely intact and is now a museum. Historians estimate 1.1 million people were killed there - one million of them were Jews but there were also Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and others. "I think that when someone wants to deny the Holocaust or think that it is exaggerated, which many of them do and certainly many of their followers do, when they come here and see it, their experience is such that they can no longer think that," Rabbi Bemporad said. Beside the ruins of one of the gas chambers - the Germans blew them up as they retreated, in an effort to hide their crimes - the Muslim leaders paused for a moment's silence. "You may read every book about the Holocaust but it's nothing like when you see this place where people were burned," said Mohamed Magid, president of the Islamic Society of North America. "This is the building, the bricks. If they were to speak to you and I, they would tell you how many cries and screams they have heard." Mr Magid, who is originally from Sudan, first visited Auschwitz-Birkenau during a trip organised for American imams in 2010. He said the experience had led him to hold an annual Seder, a Jewish ceremonial meal, at his mosque in Virginia where he invites people to listen to the story of a Holocaust survivor who was saved by a Muslim family. "We go back more committed to human rights and more understanding of conflicts and how to resolve them, but also to be careful of a curriculum that teaches racism and hatred," he said. Earlier, the group had taken photos as they walked around an exhibition in the red brick barrack blocks at Auschwitz, about 2 miles (3kms) from Birkenau. They made comments such as "Can you imagine?" and "It's beyond comprehension" as they saw a great pile of hair shorn from women prisoners that was used to make rudimentary textiles. They shook their heads as they saw faded children's shoes and dolls in glass cases. After they had seen just two of the 14 exhibition blocks, some of the group asked for a break and they knelt in prayer beside the camp's execution wall. Barakat Hasan, a Palestinian imam and director of the Center for Studies and Islamic Media in Jerusalem, said he "didn't know many details about the Holocaust" before the trip. "I felt my heart bleeding when I was looking at all this. I was fighting back tears," he said through an interpreter. "As a Palestinian living under occupation, I feel sympathy for the pain and injustice that was inflicted on the Jews," he added. Mr Hasan said he did not believe there were people in the Muslim world who denied the Holocaust happened, but he said there was discussion in his community about whether the commonly quoted figure of six million Jewish victims was correct. "Maybe now after seeing what I've seen, maybe the numbers are correct also," he said, adding that he would write articles and mention his trip on Facebook. As he walked along the railway line and unloading ramp at Birkenau - where the trains hauling cattle cars crammed with Jews arrived - Ahmet Muharrem Atlig, a Turkish imam and secretary general of the Journalists and Writers Foundation in Istanbul, said he wept when he saw a photograph that showed children looking scared as they got off a train. "Unfortunately the Muslim communities and congregation don't know much about the Holocaust," he said. "Yes, we've heard something. But we have to come and see what happened here. It's not just about Jews, or Christians, this is all about human beings because the human race suffered here."	Muslim leaders from around the world have taken part in an unprecedented trip to Germany and Poland to see and hear for themselves about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust.
The 73-year-old Oscar winner will be presented with the award on 9 June. AFI chair Sir Howard Stringer called Freeman "an American treasure" who brought a calm authority to his roles, "whether playing a prisoner, a president or God." Freeman won an Oscar for his role in Million Dollar Baby in 2005. His next film is the thriller Red. He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for 1997's Street Smart, and has garnered three Academy nominations for best actor for Invictus, Driving Miss Daisy and The Shawshank Redemption. His other credits include Bruce Almighty and Nurse Betty. He will be the 39th recipient of the AFI Lifetime Achievement award. Others include Jack Nicholson, Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand, Elizabeth Taylor, Alfred Hitchcock and Martin Scorsese. Stringer said Freeman had an "unmistakable voice that echoes through the hearts and minds of movie lovers around the world". The AFI's Lifetime Achievement award is considered one of the highest honours in the US for a film actor. Freeman's ceremony will take place in Los Angeles - it will be broadcast on US TV towards the end of June.	Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman is to receive a lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute (AFI).
Valerie Cadogan was cycling with her husband when she struck the 25cm (10in) wide, 11cm (4in) pothole and hit her head, Newport Coroner's Court heard. Council workers were called to the area within hours to fill in the potholes in April this year and make the area safe. Coroner David Bowen said the effects of the impact may have been lessened had Mrs Cadogan been wearing a helmet. Mrs Cadogan was airlifted to Bristol's Frenchay Hospital after the incident but never regained consciousness. She died the following day. The Newport Coroner's Court hearing was told Monmouthshire council immediately filled the pothole on St Mary's Road. Mark Watkins, of the local authority's highways department, said the road is inspected annually and they had had no reports of defects there following an inspection in June 2012.	A 72-year-old cyclist died after she fell from her bike after hitting a pothole in Monmouth, an inquest heard.
The head teacher of Sandown Bay Academy resigned and the board of governors was replaced earlier this year. Academies Enterprise Trust (AET) said it intended to merge it with Ryde Academy to make "one great school". It said falling numbers and the consequent impact on finances had prompted the decision. Sandown Bay Academy came out of special measures two years ago, but is still seen as underperforming. Pupil numbers have fallen to fewer than 1,000 from 1,252 in 2012. In a statement, AET, the biggest academy chain in England, said: "It has been becoming increasingly difficult for the school to fund the teachers and the educational resources needed in order to provide the education we would all want for the students. "We believe that merger offers the best option all round, and that out of these two schools we can create one really great one." If approved, the principal of Ryde Academy, Joy Ballard, will oversee the transition between the two schools. A spokesman said no decision had been made on whether to operate two campuses or on any job cuts. A public consultation is to be held on the plans, with the final decision made by the government after the general election.	A troubled Isle of Wight academy is set to merge with another school, its sponsor has announced.
Lib Dem Mohammed Bashir won the Woking Borough Council seat in Surrey by 16 votes in May 2012 but a judge ruled there had been corrupt and illegal practices. Charges were brought after police investigated allegations that postal votes were fraudulently submitted. The Conservatives won a subsequent by-election, held in September 2013. Shaukat Ali, 56, Parveen Akhtar, 48, Shamraiz Ali, 28, Sobia Ali Akhtar, 23, and Abid Hussain, 40, all from New Haw, Surrey, will be sentenced on 9 June at Reading Crown Court.	Five people have been found guilty of conspiracy to defraud a local government election.
Her Majesty, who had been staying at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, popped into the Sheep Heid in Duddingston on Friday. The Monarch had earlier been at Musselburgh Racecourse's 200th birthday celebrations. She is very rarely seen eating out at public restaurants, but the 650-year-old Sheep Heid Inn has been linked to the Royals since the 1500s. In 1580, King James VI of Scotland gifted the landlord an ornate ram's head snuff box. It is believed he, and his mother Mary Queen of Scots, stopped by the inn many times to play skittles in the courtyard. As a mark of gratitude he presented the landlord with the unusual gift which remained on site for 300 years before being sold at auction to the Earl of Rosebery. A Sheep Heid spokesman said: "I can confirm the Queen was here. " He refused to give details on what she ordered. However, it has been reported that the Queen and her companions enjoyed two portions of lamb and a fillet of seabass.	The Queen has been spotted having an evening meal at an Edinburgh pub.
Many lizards can detach their tails when attacked, but fish-scale geckos have large scales that tear away with ease. The new species is a master of this art, say scientists, having the largest scales of any known gecko. The reptile, named Geckolepis megalepis, is described in PeerJ. The skin of fish-scale geckos is specially adapted to tearing. The large scales are attached only by a relatively narrow region that tears with ease. In addition, beneath the scales there is a pre-formed splitting zone within the skin itself. Although several other geckos are able to lose their skin like this if they are grasped firmly, fish-scale geckos are able to do so actively - and at the slightest touch. They can also grow them back scar-free in a matter of weeks, while other geckos might take a long time to regenerate their scales. But Geckolepis megalepis is remarkable for the huge size of its scales. The researchers hypothesise that larger scales tear more easily than smaller ones, because of their greater surface area relative to the attachment area, and larger friction surface. "What's really remarkable though is that these scales - which are really dense and may even be bony, and must be quite energetically costly to produce - and the skin beneath them tear away with such ease, and can be regenerated quickly and without a scar," said lead author Mark Scherz, from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. The new species was discovered in the Tsingy cave formations of northern Madagascar.	A newly discovered species of gecko has tearaway skin that leaves predators with nothing but a mouthful of scales when attacked.
Jenny Rathbone said some tenants were charged ??150 to have properties taken off the market while a contract was finalised, while others charged ??65 for cleaning the property. The Cardiff Central AM called for a ban on the charging of such fees. Ministers have warned of a risk that banning fees would push up rents. In Scotland, all charges to private tenants other than rent and deposits have been deemed illegal since 2012. Campaigners have called for similar rules in other parts of the UK. In a Senedd debate, Ms Rathbone said: "It should be the landlord paying the letting agency, not the tenant." She added: "Frankly, the letting agencies are getting away with simply not providing a service in exchange for the fee and I think it's something that needs to be stopped as a matter of urgency." Assembly lawyers have told Ms Rathbone that Wales had the legal powers to impose a ban, despite the Welsh Government previously saying it did not have the authority. Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said agents were legally obliged to advertise fees, and he was "not persuaded" a ban was needed at this time. "I wouldn't want to see the fees - extortionate fees in some cases - just being transferred to the tenant [in the form of higher rents]," he said. "I would like to learn from the evidence from the experience in Scotland before deciding whether this measure is necessary," Mr Sargeant added. Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales on Sunday 16 October at 1100 BST	Students and other people renting their homes have been victims of "widespread abuse" of fees charged by letting agents, a Labour AM has claimed.
Media playback is not supported on this device West Ham manager Slaven Bilic questioned Dean's decision to send off Sofiane Feghouli in his side's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United on Monday. It was the fifth red card Dean has shown in 15 matches this season. The Hammers are appealing against Feghouli's dismissal. Dean sent off the Algeria international midfielder after just 15 minutes following his collision with Phil Jones, but Bilic felt the United defender had committed the more dangerous tackle. The dismissal was the 25th by Dean since the start of the 2013-14 season - the highest number by any current Premier League referee in that period. Writing in The Times, former player Tony Cascarino said Dean "lost all control of the game" while Sky Sports pundit Niall Quinn called Dean "arrogant" and the decision "rank bad refereeing". But former Manchester United captain Gary Neville later tweeted: "I was critical of Mike Dean's performance in the game. He was poor. But I think the reaction since towards him is disgraceful. "Yes, he should be criticised but to suggest he wanted to be centre of attention and he should be sacked or not referee again is wrong!" Sunday's FA Cup match between Tottenham and Aston Villa is live on BBC One from 15:35 GMT, and full match commentary will be available on BBC Radio 5 live from 16:00 GMT.	Mike Dean will referee Sunday's televised FA Cup third-round tie between Tottenham and Aston Villa - despite recent criticism of his performances.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said the process should begin "immediately". And several EU foreign ministers have urged Britain to start the process soon. But Mr Hammond insisted that "nothing is going to happen at the moment". The timing of the formal notification of intention to leave the EU was in Britain's hands and talks would not start until a new prime minister was chosen to replace David Cameron, he said. Mr Hammond's position was supported by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff, who said Britain's politicians should take time to review the consequences of leaving the EU. "Politicians in London should take the time to reconsider the consequences of the Brexit decision - but by that I emphatically do not mean Brexit itself," Peter Altmaier told Reuters news agency. Mrs Merkel said on Saturday that the EU had "no need to be particularly nasty in any way" in the negotiations with Britain, and that deterring other countries from leaving the bloc should not be a priority in the talks. The EU has clarified the way the UK can kick start formal negotiations to exit the bloc following Thursday's referendum. It says Britain can trigger Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets a two-year deadline for a deal, by making a formal declaration either in a letter or a speech at a meeting of the European Council, the gathering of ministers from each EU state. UK PM David Cameron has said he will step down by October to allow his successor to conduct the talks. Since Thursday's vote there has been intense speculation about when, and how, the UK might begin formal negotiations. The UK's decision to leave the EU has sent shockwaves across the continent with leaders of Eurosceptic parties in France, the Netherlands and Italy demanding referendums in their own countries. In response, some EU politicians have called for speedy reforms to quell further unrest. French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron suggested a new mission statement should be drafted and put to a referendum of all EU citizens. "We've never had the courage to organise a true European referendum in its real sense," he told a conference. "We would first build this new project with European peoples and then submit this new roadmap, this new project, to a referendum [across the bloc]." The first summit of EU leaders with no British representation will be held on Wednesday, a day after Mr Cameron holds talks with members. Global stock markets and the pound fell heavily on the news of the so-called "Brexit", while credit rating agency Moody's cut the UK's credit rating to "negative". Brexit: What happens now?	Britain will resist pressure from the European Union for a swift start to negotiations on its withdrawal from the bloc, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has indicated.
The sturgeon, named Steve, swam out of World of Water in Romsey, Hampshire when it was inundated by flood water in early February. But now staff at a car wash a mile from the centre have discovered him in a deep puddle. A larger koi carp fish named Chadwick escaped at the same time but, despite sightings, has not yet been retrieved. Centre manager Mark Bradbury said he was "hugely relieved" Steve had been recovered and "only a little worse for wear for his travels." The seven-year-old fish was used as part of the shop's displays, but Mr Bradbury said similar fish would retail for up to Â£1,000. "He must have crossed the road and got to the petrol station through the flood water. He's got a few bumps and scrapes but is happy to be back with his friends," he explained. The centre has now re-opened after being closed for three weeks because of the floods.	A metre-long fish that escaped from an aquatic centre during recent flooding has been found.
Denis O'Brien obtained the injunction to stop RTÉ from reporting details of his personal finances and relationship with former Anglo Irish Bank. Last week, a judge granted permission for the media to report details about Mr O'Brien's finances made under privilege in the Dáil (parliament). RTÉ lawyers said as a result there was no need for the injunction to remain. The media mogul's fortune is estimated to be around £5bn. Following the granting of the injunction, the purchase of one of Mr O'Brien's companies was discussed in the Dáil. The comments were made by TD Catherine Murphy under privilege. She said Mr O'Brien owed the former Anglo Irish Bank, now the nationalised Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC), upwards of 500m euro (£362m). Ms Murphy, an independent left-wing TD, said Mr O'Brien was attempting to pay loans back at an interest rate of just over 1%, when it was arguable that the correct rate should be over 7%. In response to her comments, lawyers for RTÉ and the Irish Times returned to the high court to seek clarity over whether her remarks could be reported in light of the injunction. A judge told the media organisations that he never intended nor could he order any interference with what a TD may say under privilege in the Dáil. The application by RTÉ to have the injunction discharged relates to a planned broadcast regarding certain information regarding Mr O'Brien's relationship with IBRC. Lawyers for Mr O'Brien said they accepted that following comments made by the Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty in the Dáil on Tuesday evening, there was nothing in the proposed RTÉ script that had been injuncted that warranted further restraint. The lawyer added that as far as he was concerned, the script in its entirety could be published, as a result of events that had happened outside the courtroom. On Tuesday, Mr Doherty gave details of what he said were documents related to Mr O'Brien's IBRC loans during a debate in the Dáil. The Sinn Féin finance spokesman said he had documents which led to questions about the way IBRC was run in the public interest.	Irish state broadcaster RTÉ is trying to get an injunction granted to Ireland's richest man discharged.
The 26-year-old has made just one appearance since joining Posh in November, scoring in the 3-2 win over former club Barnsley. Graham Westley's side currently have injuries to fellow defenders Callum Elder, Gabriel Zakuani and Kgosi Ntlhe. Posh, currently sixth in the table, are at home against struggling Chesterfield on Boxing Day.	Peterborough United defender Miles Addison has signed a new one-month contract with the League One side.
She found time to visit Mount Vesuvius and the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, she took her friends to the villa they had hired... and then she received an email from her agent with news of a wildcard into the US Open qualifying draw, and promptly headed back to the airport. Forty-eight hours earlier, Robson had won her first tournament since the age of 14 - capturing the ITF title in Landisville, Pennsylvania. It was by far and away her biggest triumph since first feeling the effects of a wrist injury in the late summer of 2013. She played only two events in the whole of 2014, and in April of that year underwent surgery on her dominant left wrist in Minnesota. Her recovery was a slow, painful and very frustrating process. She next played competitively at the Eastbourne qualifying event of June 2015. By this time Robson had forfeited her WTA ranking. She was playing on a 12 month long protected ranking of 58 (the position she held at her last event before injury: the 2014 Australian Open) and the comeback was a very stilted affair. Other minor injuries held her back as she hit the practice courts hard and it is only since the start of this year that she has been totally free of pain in the wrist. Robson's progress in the first six months of this year was unspectacular. At the back of your mind you're not quite sure if your body is going to break down or if it's properly healed She has won only one tour level match since her return - and that came against an unranked Moroccan teenager in the first round of the WTA event in Rabat; she was soundly beaten by Andrea Petkovic at the French Open, and Angelique Kerber at Wimbledon. But then, after dispiriting trips to minor tournaments in Fort Worth, Lexington and Sacramento in which she collected five ranking points and earned barely one thousand dollars, Robson won five matches in a row in Landisville - including the final without dropping a game. The $3,919 in prize money was irrelevant, but the 50 ranking points helped her climb back into the world's top 250, and did wonders for her confidence. "I definitely put a lot of pressure on myself when I had my protected ranking," Robson told BBC Sport after qualifying for the main draw at the US Open. "You know you are on a limited amount of time so I wasn't playing as freely as maybe I should have - especially at the Slams. "But I knew I was putting in all the right things on the practice court and in the gym. It was waiting for that one moment where it all came together. I was prepared for it - I knew that I had this long season of training behind me." Her reward for overcoming a nasty bout of conjunctivitis to win three qualifying matches at Flushing Meadows is a first round match on Tuesday with fellow British player Naomi Broady. Robson is now being coached by the former British number one Lucie Ahl and Colin Beecher, and being watched here in New York by the LTA's lead women's coach Jeremy Bates. "You see it a lot with athletes when they've had a long term injury," Bates explained, after Robson's early Saturday morning practice session. "Mentally it's very difficult to fully commit yourself again to the physicality of the sport. At the back of your mind you're not quite sure if your body is going to break down or if it's properly healed. "You can't shortcut it. At Wimbledon she was playing, but now when you see her play she's completely uninhibited, she's very mobile, she's chasing every ball. She's able to recover and compete as she used to. And you can see that she has no negative thoughts in her mind at all. "It's completely mental - you've just got to get your brain around it." Media playback is not supported on this device Robson has lost virtually three years of her career - but yet she is only 22, and is still armed with a devastating forehand. She says she is working harder than ever on the practice court, and has proved in the past she has the temperament for the big occasion. In the first eight months of 2013 alone, Robson beat Petra Kvitova en route to the third round of the Australian Open; had clay court wins over Agnieszka Radwanska and Venus Williams; reached the fourth round of Wimbledon and then the third round of the US Open. As a result, she reached a career high ranking of 27. Her involvement in the final Grand Slam of this year has, though, come as a lovely surprise. After winning in Landisville, Robson's agent Max Eisenbud told her there was virtually no chance of her being awarded a wildcard into qualifying. Hence the flight back home to the UK, and then on to Italy for that girls' holiday. Find out how to get into tennis in our special guide. She was soon gone. But not forgotten. "I've had so many pictures of their sunset cruises and they have been tagging me in their Instagram as if I'm still part of the group," Robson said. "We had squad necklaces and everything - it was a full on girls' trip. "But they're very happy that I came here instead."	Laura Robson's recent holiday in Italy lasted all of six hours.
Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service recorded the acreage of several of the most serious of the 73 heath and grass fires its crews have tackled. The 332-acre total includes 100 acres burnt in Locaber on 1 May, but does not take into account all land affected. Landowners contributed more than Â£1m towards the cost of the fire fighting. The Scottish Rural Property and Business Association (SRPBA), which has provided the figure, said private landowners and estates supplied staff, specialist equipment and paid for helicopters to water-bomb flames. Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service (HIFRS) said the majority of wild fires in its area were now out. Parts of Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Fife were also affected during a dry and windy spell of weather. Crews tackled flames on the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire, while smoke from a fire near Tyndrum temporarily closed the A82 in Argyll. The north-west Highlands was the worst hit. Since the start of the month, 150 acres of burning heath were tackled by crews from Fort William, Newtonmore and Kilchoan. Acharacle and Mallaig dealt with a 100-acre heath fire, while crews from Stornoway and South Lochs extinguished a 24-acre grass fire on Lewis. Dunvegan, Portree and Uig crews extinguished a wild fire that burnt 40 acres on Skye. Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland's national stadium, sits in 33 acres bought in 1903. HIFRS has praised firefighters and the public for their help in dealing with the incidents. SRPBA Highlands and Islands regional manager, Drew McFarlane-Slack, said private landowners and their employees had played their part. He said: "Many of our members have made a huge effort over the last week investing significant time and resources supporting and working with the fire and rescue service and their neighbouring landowners like the National Trust for Scotland and the RSPB to fight the fires. "This is despite the majority of affected land falling outwith our members' own estates."	Ten Hampden Park-sized football grounds could be fitted into the 332 acres of land calculated to have been burnt in wild fires in the north since 1 May.
George Verrier was treated by officers who were called to an altercation involving about 20 people in Bromley in the early hours of Sunday. He did not want to be taken to hospital, said police, but was found unconscious several hours later in nearby Ferndale. He died in hospital. A 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. The Met said it had voluntarily referred the actions of officers who went to the scene to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for assessment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At this early stage it appears the victim suffered a head injury as a result of the altercation. "Inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident." George, a trainee electrician, was injured in Southborough Road at about 00:45 BST, while on his way home from the party in adjacent Blenheim Road. Police were called at about 09:30 BST to a home in Ferndale - about a mile away - after he fell unconscious. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died at about 18:00 BST. He had been due to have his first driving lesson on Tuesday. Cornelius Moran, whose 16-year-old daughter was having the party, said: "He was a good friend of my daughter's. A lovely boy from what she tells me. "My thoughts are with the family." A woman who lives near the party venue, but did not wish to be named, said: "It looked like a very well-organised party - it was noisy, that's all. "The family who had the party are such a nice family." Another neighbour said some partygoers had been turned away from the house. He said: "We were very much aware of the noise. That stopped at about 12.30am when the music stopped. "My wife was looking out of the window and she could see three large adults leading a group of youngsters up the road, turning them away from the party."	A 17-year-old boy has died of head injuries following a fight after a party in south-east London.
The lawsuit accuses Jean Kasem of elder abuse and inflicting emotional distress on Kasem's children by restricting their access to him before his death, according to the AP news agency. Kasem was known as host of the American Top 40 radio show and as the voice of Shaggy in the TV animation Scooby Doo. He died last June at the age of 82. He had been suffering from dementia, and the battle between his children from a previous marriage and their stepmother Jean began before his death. They claim she abused him before he died, moved him from Santa Monica to Washington without telling them and, after his death, had him buried in an unmarked grave in Norway despite his wishes to be laid to rest in Los Angeles. "What she did to my father is reprehensible," daughter Kerri Kasem said, according to AP. "It's disgusting. It's horrific." Jean Kasem's lawyer H Michael Soroy did not immediately return a request for comment to the news agency. Kerri Kasem said the family members were taking legal action after US prosecutors decided not to bring criminal charges against Jean Kasem, who was married to the star for more than 30 years. In May, Los Angeles prosecutors said they could not prove at trial that her actions led to his death. Kerri has taken out the lawsuit with siblings Julie and Michael Kasem and their uncle Mouner. They are seeking damages of $250,000 (Â£166,000). But Kerri Kasem said: "We would rather see her in jail than receive one dime. We don't care about the money. We care about justice." Casey Kasem began his career in the 1950s and found fame with the chart programme in the 1970s. He famously ended his broadcasts with his signature sign-off: "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars."	Three of US DJ Casey Kasem's children and his brother have sued the late star's widow for wrongful death in the latest move in a bitter family feud.
Steven Souley, 26, and his accomplice Zico Malavin, 20, were remanded in custody after they admitted attacking Robert Eadie, 25, in Glasgow in 2014. The victim required surgery to repair a wound to his groin and penis after being hit with an axe and knife. Souley was previously jailed for seven years for killing a man in 2010. Sentence on both accused was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow after they admitted assaulting Mr Eadie to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. The court heard that the attack happened at a Christmas party hosted by Mr Eadie's sister at her flat in the city's Summerston area. Souley and Malavin, who were not invited, turned up at about midnight. Souley was armed with an axe and Malavin - who was wearing a red Christmas jumper - was clutching a knife. Mr Eadie's sister, who knew the pair, demanded that they leave. Her brother was attacked after he tried to put them out of the flat. Souley and Malavin both fled the scene and police and paramedics were called. A knife and a Christmas sweater were later found at a property linked to Souley. It was months later that the pair were charged. The court heard that Mr Eadie needed an operation to repair a "deep wound" to his groin and to his penis. He also suffered injuries to his head and hand. He was released from hospital days later, but will be permanently scarred. Souley and Malavin, both from the city's Drumchapel area, will be sentenced next month. Souley was jailed in 2011 after being convicted of the culpable homicide of 41-year-old Andrew Curran. In May 2014 he was deemed safe enough to be freed early. Zico Malavin's brothers were both found guilty of murder over the attack on Mr Curran. Angus Malavin was jailed for 18 years and younger brother Zak for 17 years. Mr Curran died from a sword wound to the neck. The fatal park attack happened following a row over a bottle of Buckfast. A fourth Malavin brother, Kris, was jailed for seven years in 2014 after he tried to run down and kill a key witness in the murder trial.	A convicted killer has been sent back to jail after he admitted carrying out a brutal attack on Christmas Day, months after being freed early.
Nearly 25,000 signatures - 10% of Cardiff's voters - are needed to force a vote on the issue. But Labour councillor Ashley Govier told BBC Wales only about 8,000 have been collected. Cardiff council's Labour group said it was "willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue". The Mayor for Cardiff campaign was launched earlier this year with a budget of more than Â£20,000. Daran Hill, from the campaign, said at the time that an elected mayor was a "new, fresh idea" that could "energise the people of Cardiff". There are currently 17 directly-elected mayors in England with more on the way, but there are none in Wales. Mr Govier, a councillor for Cardiff's Grangetown ward, said the debate has "moved on" and a regional mayor was now needed. "We're not going to hit the target, especially because the council refused to allow online petitions," he said. "We feel we've moved the debate on and the focus now needs to switch to a regional mayor for south east Wales. We have to go bigger." Mr Govier claimed the Cardiff Capital Region City Deal - a funding package agreed between UK, Welsh and local government worth Â£1.2bn over 20 years - was beginning to stall "because of governance". "The region has to work together on infrastructure and transport," he said. "A regional mayor is needed." He added there are "sympathetic ears throughout the region and across political parties". Ceredigion is the only Welsh local authority to have had a referendum on the matter. Voters there rejected the idea in 2004 by a margin of nearly three to one. A spokeswoman for Cardiff council's Labour group said: "Cardiff Labour are willing to take the lead from public opinion on this issue, and as we have seen there is very little interest in introducing a further level of bureaucracy. "The City Deal is definitely not stalling and is moving forward, despite uncertainty caused by Brexit. "It will be a huge boost for Cardiff and the region, and suggestions to the contrary are just mischief making." A Wales Office spokesman said: "The Cardiff City Deal is the biggest of its kind in the UK and we are confident this ambitious project is on target." The Welsh Government declined to comment in response to Mr Govier's comments.	An attempt to trigger a referendum on Cardiff having an elected mayor is going to fail, a campaigner has admitted.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease which is prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions. It is a major cause of illness worldwide, causing about 100 million episodes of feverish illness a year. Its outbreak in Burkina Faso is causing alarm and officials are trying to avoid any widespread panic. One man told BBC Afrique's Yacouba Ouedraogo in the capital, Ouagadougou, that the disease had killed his brother quickly: "My younger brother did not even have a chance to say what was wrong. We just found him dead," he said. Dengue fever particularly affects young children and adults, but is not normally fatal, specialists say. Most people who get it will suffer from headaches and fever. Some get rashes, aches and pains and their symptoms usually last for two or three days. An infected person can feel tired for up to three months, but will not usually need treatment. Cases of the disease have been reported from all 12 districts of Ouagadougou, the World Health Organization says. Two other regions - the Sahel Region in the north and the Hauts-Bassins region in the west - have also reported cases.	Dengue fever has killed at least 20 people in the West African state of Burkina Faso, where about 2,000 cases of the disease have been recorded.
He collided with a black Vauxhall Insignia on the junction of Wian Street and London Road in Holyhead shortly before 12:30 BST on 3 June. The man, who was local to the area, was taken to a hospital in Stoke but has died from his injuries. North Wales Police are investigating the incident and want to speak to witnesses of the collision.	A 92-year-old man has died in hospital after being hit by a car on Anglesey last week, police have confirmed.
Next was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme called a rate-booster. The court ruled Next diverted UK profits to foreign subsidiaries to claim tax relief on overseas profits. Such schemes are a way in which firms avoid corporation tax on foreign profits that are then paid back to the UK parent firm. Under rules designed to prevent double taxation of company profits, firms were able to claim credit for tax paid on money they made overseas. But some companies were able to exploit the rules through the creation of artificial arrangements involving what HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) referred to as "complex circular movements of money between companies in the same group, so they can claim there has been double taxation". Known as rate-booster schemes, this enabled companies to avoid corporation tax by diverting profits made in the UK to foreign subsidiaries. The foreign subsidiary then paid tax on those profits - often at a lower rate of corporation tax - before the profits were paid back to the UK parent company. Finally, the UK parent company received credits from HMRC for the tax already paid by its subsidiary. As a result, companies were able to claim far more tax had been paid on their overseas profits than was actually the case. Legal changes in 2005 and 2009 mean rate-booster schemes are no longer possible or attractive, HMRC added. The Next case is the second to reach court, following a 2013 ruling against P&O Ferries, although the firm appealed against the decision and an appeal judgement is outstanding. HMRC said about £130m in tax was at stake across 20 rate-booster cases, which were awaiting the P&O and Next decisions. About 70 rate-boosters have already been conceded by companies that wanted to avoid going to court. This has brought in more than £500m in tax, it added. HMRC's director general of business tax, Jim Harra, said: "This case shows how HMRC takes effective action against big businesses that try to avoid paying tax through convoluted, artificial avoidance schemes. HMRC expects all businesses to steer well clear of such schemes." In a statement, Next said it had paid the tax owed to HMRC "some years ago" and that this had been fully accounted for at the time. The retailer described the dispute between itself and HMRC as "a technical debate around complex legislation" which had now been superseded. It added that current UK law generally allowed companies to "repatriate their profits without a tax charge".	High Street retailer Next has been hit with a £22.4m tax bill after a court found it diverted profits made in the UK offshore to avoid paying tax.
World number 127 Figueiredo was struggling at 4-1 down, but then took four frames to leave Ding clinging on. Ding, ranked fifth in the world, rallied to take the 10th frame and won a tense decider with a break of 74. The two-time UK Championship winner said: "I missed some easy shots." The 29-year-old, runner-up at this year's World Championship, added: "He played well and made a few 50 breaks. But at 5-4 down I told myself to carry on and I knew that pressure would come so I was confident in the last two frames." Barry Hawkins, another former Crucible runner-up, whitewashed Welshman David John 6-0. Marco Fu saw off Ireland's Josh Boileau 6-2 but the ever-popular Jimmy White was on the wrong end of the same scoreline against Wales' Ryan Day. White, the winner of 10 ranking events including the 1992 UK Championship, drew level at 2-2 but could not maintain his form after the interval. The 2011 champion Judd Trump, world number 13 Kyren Wilson, and Scotland's Anthony McGill are all in action in the evening session.	China's Ding Junhui survived a first-round scare to beat Brazilian outsider Igor Figueiredo 6-5 in a thrilling UK Championship match at the York Barbican.
Ten Protestant workmen were killed when their minibus was ambushed in the south Armagh village in January 1976. A file was passed to the PPS in August last year following the arrest of the suspect in Newry, County Armagh. A palm print found on a van used in the murders was believed to belong to him. However, on Thursday, the PPS said that "following careful consideration of the evidence", it had decided not to prosecute him. The coroner is now giving consideration to the scheduling of dates for the inquest to recommence. No one has been convicted for the Kingsmills atrocity. The victims - textile factory workers - were shot dead when an IRA gang ambushed their mini-bus in 1976 near the County Armagh village of Kingsmills. After checking their religion, the gang ordered one Catholic colleague to leave. The 10 men killed were John Bryans, Robert Chambers, Reginald Chapman, Walter Chapman, Robert Freeburn, Joseph Lemmon, John McConville, James McWhirter, Robert Samuel Walker and Kenneth Worton. Only one man survived the shootings - Alan Black, a 32-year-old father-of-three at the time. He was seriously wounded and spent months recovering in hospital. Outlining the PPS decision, casework assistant director Michael Agnew said: "We have given careful consideration to all the evidence currently available and have applied the test for prosecution. "We have concluded that there is no reasonable prospect of a conviction, based on the available evidence and that the test for prosecution is therefore not met." The sole survivor of the atrocity, Alan Black, expressed disappointment that no-one has been held to account for the murders. However, he added: "At the same time, it lets us get on with the inquest, so maybe we'll get a few more questions answered through the inquest process. "The PPS have really explained pretty well what they went on and how they made the decision and I'm reasonably satisfied that it was all above board. "A policeman came to the door early this morning and handed me an envelope containing their decision and how they came to it. "They seem to be pretty thorough about it all and I can understand why they didn't go forward with this prosecution." Asked if he believes justice will ever be served on those who killed the workmen, Mr Black replied: "That is a question I cannot answer, unless the gunmen take an attack of conscience and come forward, I doubt we will get all the truth, but we may get some. I am hopeful that we will get some answers." Mr Agnew said that the families of those murdered had been informed of the decision and the reasons for it, and that the PPS had offered to meet them "to answer any further questions that they may have". "We are also conscious that inquest proceedings are currently adjourned to allow for any criminal matters to be concluded and accordingly have advised the coroner of this decision," he added.	The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has decided not to prosecute a man arrested last year in relation to the Kingsmills massacre.
The Duke of Rothesay laid a wreath on a visit to a new memorial cairn built by the community of Cabrach in Moray. The cairn commemorates the farming community and neighbouring parishes at Rhynie, Lumsden and Dufftown. The Imperial War Museum suggests that, between battle and disease, the number of war dead could be several hundred. Along with those officially acknowledged "lost in battle" are the many who died from disease in France and Belgium. It is thought that coming from such a remote rural area, they had little resistance. A recent BBC TV programme, examining the effects of World War One on rural Scotland, quoted an eminent Dutch historian speaking on behalf of the  Commonwealth War Graves Commission, who referred to the ruined crofts and farm buildings of the Cabrach as representing "perhaps the biggest War Memorial in Europe". Charles, wearing a Gordon Highlanders kilt, took part in a short service with local residents, followed by a minute's silence. He then laid a wreath which said: "In special memory of those from the Cabrach, and the parishes of Rhynie, Lumsden and Dufftown who lost their lives during the First World War." The prince chatted to locals, including Royal Observer Corps veteran John Gordon, 88, who laid a wreath on behalf of the community. His family has farmed in the Cabrach area for more than 300 years. The memorial project was led by Marc Ellington, a leading authority on Scottish cultural heritage, who said: "Each and every aspect of the construction of the cairn has involved members, both young and old, of the Cabrach Community working closely with master craftsman Euan Thompson, a specialist in traditional dry stone construction. "As well as being one of the finest memorial cairns to be built in Scotland in recent years, this is an outstanding example of what a local community, working together with energy and determination, can achieve."	Prince Charles has joined tributes to a Scottish community whose loss of lives in World War One may have been greater than previously thought.
The country is the second European Union nation after France to enforce such a ban. Offenders face a fine of 137.5 euros (Â£121; $197) and up to seven days in jail. Two women who wear full veils launched an immediate court challenge, saying the law is discriminatory. France, home to Europe's biggest Muslim population, enforced its ban in April. Belgium's law bans any clothing that obscures the identity of the wearer in places like parks and on the street. It was passed almost unanimously by the lower house of parliament in April 2010. MPs voted with only two abstentions to back the legislation on the grounds of security, to allow police to identify people. Other MPs said that full face veils such as the burka or the niqab were a symbol of the oppression of women. But critics of the law say it could end up excluding women, leaving those who do wear the full veil trapped in their homes. And they say the measures are over the top - estimates suggest only a few dozen women wear this kind of veil in Belgium, out of a Muslim population of about half a million. "We consider the law a disproportionate intrusion into fundamental rights such as the freedom of religion and expression," Ines Wouters, the lawyer representing the two women challenging the ban, told the newspaper La Libre. She has taken their case to Belgium's constitutional court, where she will request a suspension of the law, AFP news agency reported.	A law has come into force in Belgium banning women from wearing the full Islamic veil in public.
England won by six wickets after a Pakistan batting collapse featuring three run-outs in Sharjah on Tuesday. The Daily Mail reported that the match was the subject of an investigation into suspicious betting patterns. "There was nothing wrong with that game. I have no doubts about my boys," said former bowler Waqar. The ICC declined to confirm or deny that it was investigating the game. Pakistan collapsed from 132-2 to 208 all out before England triumphed with nine overs to spare. Waqar said: "Yes, we lost the game. You lose and win games, and it's unfortunate the way the whole thing happened." ICC chief executive David Richardson told BBC Test Match Special: "I wouldn't be suspicious of that game." He said Pakistan had reported approaches from bookmakers in recent times.	Pakistan coach Waqar Younis has dismissed suspicions over his side's performance in the third one-day international against England.
The result was further embarrassment for Michael O'Neill's side after their 3-2 defeat by Luxembourg last month. Paterson was among Northern Ireland players to miss great chances before the hosts scored two second-half goals. "If you watched that game you're probably scratching your head wondering how have we lost 2-0. We are," he said. Media playback is not supported on this device "People might see the result and say 'Northern Ireland lost 2-0, what a poor result that is' but they don't see how we've played. "Saying that, we've only got ourselves to blame. We dominated the game for 45 minutes but didn't take our chances and their goalkeeper played very well. "Then we just switched off for a couple of minutes, conceded, and the game changes. "In the second half I hit the bar - it's a game of inches - and their second goal was just frustration." Another night of Northern Ireland ignominy ended with Jonny Evans being sent off for a crude foul, with Mahir Shukurov punishing the foul by netting the free-kick. After a night that proved a body blow to the team's hopes of a bright finish to their campaign, Paterson still felt able to tentatively look on the bright side. With two points taken from a possible 12 against Luxembourg and Azerbaijan in the campaign, that might seem a stretch, but the 26-year-old gave it his best. Media playback is not supported on this device "There are positives to take, as mad as that sounds," said the Huddersfield striker. "I don't think we're miles away but it's a fine line. We had four or five good chances, they got one break and scored: that's international football. "But we are still a young group. We've got to learn quickly and turn results around. "If we do we have a chance of really pushing in the next campaign, but we have to work harder as a unit." Manager Michael O'Neill, who cut a frustrated figure in his post-match media duties, now faces the unenviable challenge of lifting a depleted squad for Tuesday's final match in Israel. Joining Evans in being suspended for that match are defensive talisman Gareth McAuley and midfielder Oliver Norwood, who each picked up their second bookings of the campaign. Northern Ireland are unlikely to add to their squad in Tel Aviv, leaving O'Neill to sift through his current group for answers. "We have three players out but we also have men to come in - particularly the likes of Sammy Clingan and Chris Baird," added O'Neill. "We'll have to look at the centre-back situation because of the players we've lost to suspension and that is self inflicted."	Striker Martin Paterson said Northern Ireland were left dumbfounded by their latest World Cup qualifying humiliation as they lost 2-0 in Azerbaijan.
Adrian Evans, 44, from Tipton, died along with his father, Patrick Evans, 78, and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury. All three men were Walsall FC fans. At least 30 Britons were among 38 people killed when a student linked to Islamic State extremists opened fire on a beach in Sousse on Friday. Adrian Evans worked for Sandwell Council as a manager in the gas services department. His nephew, Walsall season-ticket holder Joel, was a football referee and student at the University of Worcester. His brother, Owen Richards, 16, survived the attack. Prime Minister David Cameron has led tributes in Parliament to the family. "It is absolutely heartbreaking," he said. "All of us have read about it in the newspapers and I know how the family and the community will be affected for many years to come." A GoFundMe page set-up to support the family has raised more than Â£3,300. Sandwell Council is inviting people to pay their respects in two books of condolence. One is in the Sandwell Homes office where Adrian worked, in Roway Lane in Oldbury, and the other in the foyer at the council house in Freeth Street, Oldbury. Colleague Mark Peniket said his death was a "real, real shock". "Adrian will be a great loss both personally and in his working life," he said. "He was such a popular person." A statement from St Mary's Primary School in Wednesbury, where Joel was a former pupil and returned as a volunteer, said he was a fantastic role model, "bright, enthusiastic, aspirational and always smiling". "Joel was an intelligent, radiant and compassionate young man who had the world at his feet and everything to live for," the statement said. "The staff at St Mary's are heartbroken at the tragic loss of his life and the lives of his uncle and grandfather. "We would like to offer our prayers and sympathy to his parents, grandmother and brother Owen who survived the attack. "There are no words that could possibly do justice to this wonderful young man. We were proud to have known him." Professor David Green, vice chancellor of the University of Worcester, described Joel as a "first class student" and was "the son everybody would want to have". Walsall FC changed the main image on its social media accounts to a photograph showing the three outside Wembley Stadium at the Saddlers' Johnstone's Paint Trophy final appearance three months ago. In a statement the club said it would do everything it could to support the family. "It is at times like this when the football family really comes together and we have been overwhelmed by the messages of condolence that we have received from all around the world," it said. "That iconic image of the three men, along with Owen, enjoying our first-ever appearance at Wembley Stadium in March resonates with us all. "It was a special moment that we all enjoyed together and now at this most devastating of times, we join together to offer strength and support."	Scarves have been laid at Walsall FC's ground in memory of three people from the Black Country who died in the Tunisian beach attack.
The A&E unit at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital could be downgraded, leaving the Royal Shrewsbury as the only hospital in the county to offer emergency and critical care. Women and children's services would also be moved to Shrewsbury, despite a Â£28m centre opening in Telford in 2014. The proposals have been made by the NHS 'Future Fit' board. More updates on this and other stories in Shropshire Urgent care centres would be based at both sites, which Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said would attend to the majority of patients who are currently seen at A&E. These "preferred options" will be considered by Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Shropshire CCG, who will formally decide if a public consultation can begin. The board is also recommending three other options be put forward for public consultation. No formal decisions will be made until at least Summer 2017, Telford and Wrekin CCG said. The NHS Future Fit programme was launched in 2014 to review the health system across Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and mid-Wales and is set to finish in spring 2017. Princess Royal Hospital in Telford: Royal Shrewsbury Hospital: There has been criticism of the plans to move women's and children's services from Telford. Shaun Davies, leader of Telford & Wrekin Council, described the announcement as "a total farce that is being railroaded through" and said he opposed the idea of downgrading Telford's A&E department. "If there is to be only one, then it makes sense from a financial and clinical perspective to locate it at Princess Royal Hospital; in the area where there is a growing population."	Shropshire could have one emergency and trauma department under recommendations being put forward by NHS bosses.
The Dundee-based company said shareholders had wanted changes to be made to improve performance. Chief financial officer Alan Trotter is to leave Alliance Trust, while chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox is to step down from the board. The financial services company's share price rose when trading opened following the announcement. Alliance Trust had been facing demands for a change in governance from US-based activist investor Elliott Advisers. The firm aims to simplify its structures and reduce costs by £6m per year by the end of 2016, although details of staff cuts or other efficiency measures have not been announced. Ms Garrett-Cox leaving the board means it now consists solely of non-executive directors, making it fully independent. In a letter to shareholders, chairman Karin Forseke said the changes would take effect "as soon as practicable", and no later than March 2016. She said: "The actions we have announced represent some of the biggest changes in our history, and are designed to further improve shareholder value. "Implementation will require considerable further work by the team, but we believe that as a result Alliance Trust will be significantly better positioned for the future." Managers at Alliance Trust, the venerable Dundee finance house, have been under siege for years. Having had to sue for peace earlier this year, the terms are now clearer, and they mean a radical change of direction. A cut in costs of 20% will feel painful at the Tayside headquarters. Non-core assets are being sold,  and new benchmarks are being set, with regular overviews to check how management of the fund performs against the market. They've been ahead of their benchmark since last year, but if they don't perform adequately in future, the board members brought on by activist investors will re-consider the decision not to contract out fund management to another company. The scale of the change to the Trust's strategy, and the clipping of senior executives' influence, by removing them from the board, is such that you might expect the resignations of chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox and/or chairwoman Karin Forseke. However, this follows consultation with the full range of shareholders, and the long-term smaller ones may see the current bosses as their best protection against short-term profit-taking. With lead activist investor Elliot Advisers upping its stake recently, this is an uneasy-looking settlement.	Investment firm Alliance Trust is to cut costs by £6m while restructuring its board to become fully independent.
Researchers found that four out of five children in England who ate school lunches had tried food at school that they had not tried at home. Half of parents questioned said their children had asked for foods they had eaten at school to be cooked at home. The survey, of about 1,000 parents, found the most popular vegetables were carrots, sweetcorn and peas. Aubergine, chickpeas and spinach were among the least popular. Of the parents questioned, 628 had children who ate school lunches. (% denotes proportion of parents who said their child would eat each vegetable) England's School Food Trust commissioned the research after a survey by the Mumsnet website suggested some parents gave their children packed lunches because they thought they were too fussy to eat anything else. Trust chairman, Rob Rees, said: "Every parent knows it's a nightmare watching their child push food around the plate. "School meals can be a great way to help parents encourage their children to try new foods and to increase the variety of foods in their diet." Mumsnet co-founder, Carrie Longton, said: "Getting children to eat healthily is every parent's dream, but meal times at home can often be a battle ground and emotionally charged. "From Mumsnetters' experience it seems that once at school there's a desire to fit in with everyone else and even some positive peer pressure to boast about the variety of what foods you can eat. "School meals have also moved on quite a bit from when Mumsnetters were at school, with healthier options and more variety." School meals in England now have to comply with strict nutritional guidelines. About four in 10 primary school children in England now eat school lunches, slightly more than in secondary schools. More children in Scotland eat school lunches - about 46%. The survey was conducted online between 26 February and 5th March among a panel of parents who had at least one child in school aged 4-17 years old.	School lunches can tempt fussy eaters to try new foods, a survey for the School Food Trust has suggested.
Howe, 37, has overseen three of the club's six promotions since he was first appointed manager in 2008-09. The new deal is believed to take Howe through until 2020. He had two-and-a-half years left on his previous contract with the Cherries. "We've been in discussions since gaining promotion. I'm very pleased to have committed my future to here," he told the club's website. Following a short spell as manager of Burnley, Howe returned to manage the club at the end of 2012, leading them to promotions from League One and the Championship within three seasons. "I'm delighted Eddie has committed his future to the club," owner Maxim Demin said.	Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has signed an extension to his contract.
The Alabama Securities Commission led the investigation, which helps prevent financial fraud against the elderly. After an agent interviewed Lee, the commission's head said he was satisfied she wanted a second book published. The new work - Go Set a Watchman - will be the 88-year-old American author's first release since the 1960s. The surprise move prompted some suggestions Lee was manipulated into publishing the decades-old manuscript, which was discovered by her lawyer in the author's possessions last year. "We closed the file. Let's just say that she was able to answer questions we asked to our satisfaction from our point of view,'' said Joseph Borg, Alabama Securities Commission director. The New York Times reported that the investigation was sparked by requests from a doctor that the state investigate whether Lee was capable to have consented to the release of the work. Lee herself was "extremely hurt" by allegations she was manipulated, her lawyer Tonja Carter said. To Kill a Mockingbird was published in July 1960 and has sold more than 40 million copies around the world. Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill A Mockingbird, and features many of the same characters, with an adult Scout Finch returning to her native Alabama from New York to visit her father.	US investigators have closed an inquiry into whether To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee was pressured into publishing a sequel.
The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was "swept off my feet" when she was contacted by a man she believed to be in Turkey. She lost her home, business and took out several loans over 14 months. She said: "The pressure was horrendous, and it got to the point where all the money had gone." More on this and other York stories Speaking to BBC Radio York, the woman, known as Nancy, said she had come out of a "bad marriage" and joined dating website Match.com "to dip my toe into the dating world". In July 2015, she received her first message. Nancy, from North Yorkshire, said: "I just connected with what seemed to be a very attractive-looking person who was really keen to talk to me. "There's a term for it - lovebombed - where you're just bombarded with affection and compliments. "When you're with someone who tells you how awful you are every day for ten years, then someone pays you some compliments... of course you're going to be swept away." After chatting for six weeks online, they then began talking via another messaging service, and she was asked for money. She was told the man and his young son had been attacked and mugged, with the boy requiring "urgent medical care". "It was a really bizarre amount of money, it was €3,750, it wasn't a straightforward amount of money I would have normally associated with a fraud," she said. "Reluctantly I sent the money, because I couldn't think of a child in distress and we seemed to be getting on really well." Nancy said she was "bombarded" with messages from the moment she woke up to when she went to sleep, with further requests for money coming in. She did not tell anyone about what she was experiencing. Nancy said: "As soon as the money requests came through it was posed to me that I shouldn't tell anybody because it would look really bad, nobody would understand." Action Fraud advice Nancy continued: "I came from one abusive relationship and went straight back into another one. "The manipulation was so extreme that I was told that if I didn't send money, they would starve and die. I didn't want that on my conscience. "You get to the point where you have lost so much money, you have to keep going in the hope that you're wrong." After reading fraud advice online, Nancy went to police at the start of September, but by this time, more than £300,000 had gone. No arrests have been made over the crime, also known as 'catfishing'. Nancy added: "I've got no house and huge debts, but the pressure has now gone. "I've restarted my business and have got a really good support network now."	A woman "lovebombed" out of more than £300,000 in an online dating scam has shared her story as a warning to others.
Among those arrested were six suspects in Italy, four in Britain, and three in Norway. Police say some of the suspects may have travelled to Syria or Iraq. Italy's Ansa news agency said the suspects were accused of international terrorism association. The network was allegedly plotting to free its leader, Mullah Krekar, who is already in detention in Norway. Krekar, the Iraqi-Kurdish founder of the radical Islamist group, Ansar al-Islam, is one of those held in the operation. Two other suspects were arrested in Norway. The three of them are suspected of plotting attacks in Norway and other European countries, according to Italian police. They face extradition to Italy. Krekar - born Najm Faraj Ahmad - has served several jail sentences in recent years, including for praising the killing of staff at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in January. The anti-terrorism operation included investigations in the UK, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland, Italian police said. Arrest warrants were issued for 17 people and at least 13 were arrested. The detainees are suspected of involvement in a group called Rawti Shax, described as a "terrorist organisation of Kurdish-Sunni origin". Some suspects could not be located, as they are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadist organisations, according to the EU's judicial co-operation agency, Eurojust. Sixteen are Kurdish or Kosovan, according to Ansa news agency. In a statement, Eurojust said Rawti Shax - or Didi Nwe - represented "an evolution" of Ansar al-Islam, which is listed by the UN as a terrorist organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda. According to the Italian investigation, it was founded in Europe, with cells operating via the internet.	Police have targeted 17 people in raids in several European countries connected to a suspected jihadist network.
Orla Galton, from Blackmill, Bridgend county, was diagnosed with leukaemia at three and blood transfusions helped save her life. She endured them for years, but her mother, Sharon, said they were a lifeline. The Welsh Blood Service wants 200,000 more donors to replenish stocks. "When Orla was having chemotherapy her bloods hit so low that she became anaemic, she would have no white blood cells so she couldn't fight any infection," she said told BBC Radio Wales. "It's quite a dangerous time as while their bloods are going down, they can't carry on with the treatment. Orla needed blood transfusions so she could keep having the chemotherapy." Orla, who has now been given the all clear, paid tribute to the donors who helped her. "I would just like to say thank you," she said. "I can't thank you more." The Welsh Blood Service said:	A 12-year-old cancer survivor has urged more people to give blood, as the number of new donors has dropped by 40% over the past decade.
The UKIP leader told MEPs that the vote would be an opportunity for the UK to regain its "national self-confidence". He described David Cameron's renegotiation strategy as a "charade" which would yield only "minor" changes. EU leaders will discuss the UK's reform agenda, including proposed curbs on benefits, at a dinner on Thursday. While there will be no agreement at the two-day EU Council meeting, the UK expects there to be "substantive and frank discussions" which could potentially pave the way for a deal in February. The talks are likely to show the level of support and opposition to Mr Cameron's four main reform objectives, the most contentious of which is a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in work-benefits. The UK also wants more powers for national Parliaments, legally-binding safeguards for countries outside the eurozone and an opt-out for the UK from the principle of ever-closer union. Although David Cameron has said he will not name the referendum date until the negotiations have concluded, Mr Farage - who has long campaigned for the UK to leave the EU - said he expected it to be held next June. Speaking in the European Parliament, he said he expected David Cameron to be given short shrift at Thursday's dinner, claiming the UK prime minister had only been allowed to speak for seven minutes at an earlier dinner in June when he first set out his plans after the Conservatives' election victory. "He (David Cameron) has asked for almost nothing and is unlikely to get even that," he said. "But I am sure we will be treated to the usual theatricals. A grave-faced prime minister will come back to the UK to say how tough the negotiations have been, to say he will not give in and there will be hints that the PM will even support "Brexit" if he does not get his own way. "In February, the charade will come back. There will be a European summit and on something minor and inconsequential there will be a deal." Q&A: What Britain wants from Europe Guide to the UK's planned in-out EU referendum BBC News EU referendum special report Mr Farage said the backlash against migrant quotas in Hungary and other countries and the performance of the Front National in recent regional elections in France showed the degree to which opposition to the European Union was "growing right across the continent". He added: "So far nobody has reached the tipping point but the British referendum may be that moment. The momentum is on our side. It is not just about getting back national democracy, it is about getting back national self-confidence. "For those of us who believe in nation state democracy, 2016 is a very bright dawn indeed." Speaking in the same debate in Strasbourg, Gianni Pitella - the head of the Socialist and Democrat Group in the Parliament - said the EU must do "everything it can" to keep the UK as a member and the UK needed a "clear and positive commitment to conclude the negotiations". And Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who is now an MEP, said there must be a "constructive" response to the UK's demands - which he said provided the EU with an opportunity to pursue other "desperately needed" changes, including new governance arrangements for the eurozone and a "defence community". Speaking on Wednesday, former British prime minister Sir John Major warned against the UK "flirting" with EU exit, saying it would be dangerous to adopt a position of "splendid isolation" when the world was "coming together" to fight common challenges.	The referendum on the UK's future in the European Union could be a "tipping point" for opposition to the "European project", Nigel Farage has said.
Saturday's anti-fascist march in Brighton was held on the same day that a Great Skinhead Reunion also took place on the seafront. The protest was initially organised to oppose an anti-immigration march that failed to materialise. Police arrested 14 anti-fascists after an attack on three bald men. Ch Supt Nev Kemp said some anti-fascists were "intent on violence". He said the planned anti-immigration protest did not take place because protesters went to an event in Bristol instead. "My understanding is that most of the protesters that said they might be coming to Brighton actually went up to Bristol, so they didn't appear," he said. But he said the anti-fascist counter-protest did go ahead and he added: "There were a significant number who took part who were intent on violence and criminality." The 14 anti-fascist campaigners - arrested on suspicion of violent disorder - were held after masked protesters were seen attacking three bald men, he said. Sussex Police said 10 men and four women - most from Brighton, but two of no fixed address - had been bailed to dates in July pending further inquiries. Mr Kemp said: "There were a number of people in the protest who showed they were actually - ironically, bearing in mind the protest is about tolerance - some of the most intolerant people you could come across. "They were determined to cause damage and attack anybody really, any man with a bald head who looked like he might be from the right-wing." Siriol Hugh-Jones, who took part in the protest, said: "Where I was there was very little sign of violence." She added: "It was much more a carnival atmosphere. "We were trying to be nice and fluffy and show how tolerant Brighton and Hove is and what a liberal society it is and celebrating that." She said she marched behind some of the masked men but didn't know who they were.	A police chief has accused anti-fascist protesters of turning up at a demo prepared to attack "any bald men who looked right-wing".
It's clearly not the results. Beat Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday and they will have matched New Zealand's all-time tier one record for consecutive victories. It's not the way they finish games; under coach Eddie Jones, they have scored a cumulative 102 more points in the final quarter of matches than their opponents. It's what's been happening at the other end of the games that is raising eyebrows among critics and hopes among their opponents. Scoreless at home against Italy after 20 minutes, struggling to kick from hand, giving away set-piece penalties; 9-3 down to France, with a man in the sin bin; 10-0 down to Australia last autumn after 17 minutes, their opponents with 97% of the territory and 87% of the possession. It goes further back. Down against South Africa earlier in the autumn, six penalties conceded in the first 21 minutes. Two tries conceded in the first 20 minutes in the third of the summer Tests against the Wallabies, 10-0 down after 15 minutes of the first. You might say it doesn't matter. All those games were won. Against Wales in Cardiff England led 8-3 after the first quarter, with 74% of the possession. How could anyone complain when England have won their past 10 Six Nations matches, and are about to take on a team who haven't won in south-west London in 34 years? Jones, all those years of international coaching with four different nations whirring away in his brain, thinks otherwise. Part of that is about standards. This is a team he wants to win the next World Cup in 2019. Give the All Blacks a head-start and you are unlikely to catch them. Part of it is much more short-term: Scotland's revival in Vern Cotter's last year in charge is genuine. They are outsiders once again this weekend, but seldom in those 34 barren years have they travelled in such form. "Mate, if I knew I'd fix it," Jones said when asked this week if he had worked out what was going wrong in those opening exchanges. "And I haven't been able to fix it, so I don't know." "It's something we have been mentioning over the last few weeks," winger Jack Nowell told BBC Sport. "We've got ourselves out of jail a few times now - it is about a fast start, and putting our game on them first." Media playback is not supported on this device England's replacements - the finishers, as Jones likes to call them - have done that jail-breaking to perfection. According to Opta, the men off the bench have created more tries than those of any other nation (three scored, two assisted), made more carries, conceded the fewest turnovers and shipped only one penalty (Scotland's replacements have conceded six, France's seven). It's a wonderful asset for the coach to have. With a bench on Saturday that includes both Vunipola brothers, Jamie George, the returning Anthony Watson and the thundering Ben Te'o, it could be decisive once again this week. It does not mean the starters cannot be expected to match those same standards. Dig a hole often enough, and one day you might not be able to climb out of it. "It becomes a case of, are you riding your luck?" says Paul Grayson, the former England fly-half who is part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team at Twickenham this weekend. "The Italy game was as bad an opening quarter as we've seen from an England team under Jones - and that was nothing to do with 'ruckgate' (when Italy's tactic of not committing to rucks befuddled England). They were just nowhere near it mentally. "Maybe that's a timely wake-up call, because when winning becomes supposedly routine, even if you get away with a couple, you've still got to find a way to motivate yourself. If England are not quite there mentally, they look ordinary, and at some point soon they will lose." "England need to start fast," former British and Irish Lions winger Ugo Monye told 5 live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast this week. "They need to get the crowd on their side - three points, six, nine, score a try, shut out Scotland, and put a seed of doubt into their minds. "Scotland come down here with their fanfare and the bagpipes and their confidence, and everyone is aware of their threat, and if it's a close game you might just have the Twickenham crowd turning on their players a little bit." Jones has been in ornery form this week, irascible in his media conferences, hard-nosed with his players on the Pennyhill Park training pitches. "We're preparing to start well," he said irritably when announcing his selection. "We're not preparing not to start well. "It's an 80-minute game. We've got to be ahead at the 80-minute mark, and that's what we're aiming to be against Scotland. "It's like starting a 100m race. You can be ahead at the 10m mark, but you've got to be ahead at the 100m mark." Jones, a self-confessed cricket nut, might enjoy another analogy: a pair of opening batsmen playing and missing on the first morning of a Test match, the opposition fast bowler fired up and the new ball seaming and bouncing past the outside edge. What does it matter if they are 80-3 at lunch if by the close they have put on 300 for the loss of only one more wicket? "Ian McGeechan, when he was coaching Northampton and telling us how he wanted us to play, brought up the example of Wigan's very successful rugby league team," remembers Grayson. "Every team that played Wigan wanted to beat them. They would be totally up for it, and they would go toe-to-toe with them. They got to half-time, and it would be 10-8, or 6-6, or they would only be four points down. "Then they would get into the second half, and as that effort left them tired and weakened, they would roll over and Wigan would score 40 points. "I used to think, what does a game look like after 20 minutes? If I can get some points on the board, great; if they've thrown a few shots and we've had to defend for a while and they haven't got much out of it, no problem, we'll see you in the last 10 minutes of the first half and the last 15 minutes of the contest. "The opposition are always going to be at their most obstinate and most up for it in that period. Yet, barring the Wales game, England haven't had too much flow in attack in the early part of their games. It's always difficult, but if you're the best side in the world, you do it. The All Blacks always manage to come out of the blocks." Such has been the impact of England's replacements that the impression is that Jones has enviable strength in depth. He does - at prop and hooker, at scrum-half, on the wings. With first-choice lock George Kruis out injured and his preferred partner Maro Itoje shifted to six, stand-in second rows Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes have arguably been England's most effective players. But it is not true throughout the team. England's Test cricket team often find themselves early wickets down because they have struggled to replace Andrew Strauss alongside Alastair Cook. They can struggle on turning pitches because no-one who has come into the team has been able to match the impact of world-class spinner Graeme Swann. "Nathan Hughes looks like the Billy Vunipola of three years ago," says Grayson. "Likely to last 50 minutes or do 30 minutes off the bench, do two or three good things but also disappear for a while. "And that makes a massive difference. Take Lawrence Dallaglio out of England's World Cup-winning team and put in another number eight, and what do they look like? They're just not quite as big or powerful or dominant or vocal. "When Dallaglio wasn't playing, England weren't quite the same. And I think that Vunipola is at that point. He's an 80-minute player heading to world class. And they just haven't got that otherwise. "Billy has been out and with Chris Robshaw being out, that's two-thirds of your first-choice back row. That's a huge loss to England, because they don't have that many great back-row players."	It might sound a curiously mealy-mouthed thing to say about a team that have won their past 17 matches and sit atop the Six Nations table with consecutive Grand Slams a genuine possibility, but England's rugby team might have a problem.
The group, a mix of students and activists, were arrested while taking part in a protest two weeks ago against a new education bill. They face possible jail terms on charges including insulting civil servants and refusing to disperse. Video of the protests showing people being cornered by police and beaten sparked international condemnation. President Thein Sein of Myanmar (formerly Burma) has defended the action of officers, telling the BBC that in many Western countries a similar situation might have ended in gunfire and death. In addition to the 65 people in court in the town of Letpadan on Wednesday, another five have been charged in absentia. Eleven people who were released on bail will be charged at a later date. All could face jail terms of up to six years. The BBC's Jonah Fisher, at the court, says relatives and supporters gathered outside the building with flowers, water and food for the detainees. Riot police were deployed to keep back the crowds. Our correspondent says that while there have been reforms in Myanmar since the end of military rule, the case shows that its laws and legal system remain dated and repressive. The students began a protest march from Mandalay to Yangon (also known as Rangoon) in January, in opposition to a bill which centralises control over higher education. They were calling for more power to be devolved to universities and higher education institutions, the right to form student unions, and teaching in ethnic minority languages. The march was technically illegal as it did not have official approval.  The two sides had been in negotiations, and the authorities had agreed to let the students continue to Yangon. But the students were angered by police opposition when they reached Letpadan, 140km (90 miles) north of Yangon, and clashes broke out as they attempted to break through police lines. Scores of students and some police officers were injured, while more than 100 people were arrested. The government has announced an inquiry into the response of the security services, state media report. Young Burmese have been at the forefront of several protests in Myanmar over the years, including a notorious 1988 uprising against the former ruling junta.	Sixty-five people have appeared in court in Myanmar to be charged over a student protest that ended in violence.
The captain, who retired hurt on 60 with a back problem on the first day in Adelaide, returned to make 128. "The way he played speaks words for the guy," said Steve Smith, who hit 162 not out as Australia reached 517-7. The Test was delayed after Hughes, 25, died after being struck by a ball while playing for South Australia. Clarke, 33, helped carry his team-mate's coffin and made an emotional speech at his funeral on 3 December. Clarke, who received a standing ovation from the Adelaide Oval crowd after reaching three figures, celebrated his century by kissing his helmet and embracing Smith. "He came out here and tried to do something for Hughesy," said Smith. "He certainly did that." Smith also praised Clarke for his efforts over the past three weeks. "It's been tough for all of us, but he's spent the whole time by Hughesy's family's side," said Smith. "Just the strength and courage he's showed throughout those times was unbelievable." Australian batsman David Warner also hit a century on day one of the Test and dedicated it to Hughes. The Test is the first in a four-match series, which ends in January.	Michael Clarke scored a century on day two of the opening Test against India, Australia's first match since the death of batsman Phillip Hughes.
Domenico Scala, who heads up Fifa's Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, is Swiss-Italian - as is Gianni Infantino, one of the five presidential candidates. Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter. LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday. The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time. "Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced," Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday. Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason. "Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality," Fifa wrote at the time. However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says "the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest. "There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa," he told BBC Sport. "For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base. "For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all." It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election. "Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa," Bility wrote. "If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes." Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check. On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same. Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president. The election, which is voted on by Fifa's 209 members, will take place in the organisation's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich.	The man overseeing Fifa's presidential polls should step aside due to conflict of interest, says the Liberian FA.
Attendances have fallen in recent years since the Premiership side moved from Edgeley Park in Stockport to AJ Bell Stadium in Barton in 2012. Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season. "I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience," Cotton told BBC Sport. "That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground. Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. "The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that." Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. "What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level," he added. "That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. "I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games." One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director. "It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him," Cotton continued. "We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them." Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.	New Sale Sharks chairman Fran Cotton has conceded they must work to restore their relationship with some fans.
Researchers said measuring DNA sections in cancer cells gave an "accurate indicator" of disease progression. Shorter DNA structures can leave chromosome ends exposed, accelerating cancer progression and drug resistance. The team believe the study could help doctors in choosing the most effective treatment for individual patients. Researchers from the university's School of Medicine said the tests can be used to predict the outcomes of patients with two different types of blood cancer - the bone marrow cancer myeloma and pre-leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: "Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. "The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome."	A new test that could hold the key to predicting blood cancer patients' survival has been developed by Cardiff University.
The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The reactor was shut down in 2007 but Pyongyang said last year that it was operational again. It has since conducted its fourth test of a nuclear weapon. That and its multiple missile tests broke existing international sanctions and provoked further measures from the UN and individual countries. The IAEA has no access to North Korea after being thrown out in 2009,  so relies largely on satellite data. But the agency's head, Yukiya Amano, said recent images indicated "activities related to the five-megawatt reactor, expansion of enrichment facilities and activities related to reprocessing". Vehicles have also been seen moving at the site and there are indications of warm water being discharged, which would suggest cooling operations. Other North Korean observers have also said in recent months that the plant appears to be working again. At North Korea's recent ruling party congress, leader Kim Jong-un reinforced his policy of economic development coupled with a strong nuclear programme.	North Korea appears to have restarted its nuclear facility at Yongbyon, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said.
The economic research institute questioned 320 businesses following the vote on leaving the EU. The survey found more than 60% of Scottish firms believe Brexit would have a "negative impact" on them. However, the institute said there was little evidence of companies cancelling investment or recruitment outright. The Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent research body based at the University of Strathclyde, carried out the survey between 5 July and 12 July, in the aftermath of the EU referendum. Just over 60% of Scottish firms surveyed said they believed Brexit will have a negative impact on their business, while only 19% said it would have a positive impact. One third said the impact would be "very negative". About 40% believe that leaving the EU could lead to a decrease in their investment and expansion plans, and 34% said that they could cut back on recruitment. More than 70% of firms surveyed as part of the research had done no preparation for the UK exiting the EU. Two-thirds of businesses said resolution of the uncertainty in the economy was a key issue in the negotiation of the UK's exit from the European Union, while 49% of firms cited access to the single market as a key issue. However, the survey found little evidence of companies actually cancelling investment or recruitment plans. A quarter of firms said they had made a decision to change their investment and recruitment plans, though the vast majority - 95% - said that decisions had been postponed rather than cancelled entirely. Prof Graeme Roy, director of the institute, said: "This is the first hard survey evidence post-referendum of what businesses in Scotland are thinking and how they are responding to the unexpected EU referendum result. "A clear majority believe that the impact - certainly in the short to medium term - will be negative. The survey offers some evidence that investment and recruitment plans may be being put on hold. "Resolving the current political and economic uncertainty must now be the key priority. The longer the period of uncertainty continues, the more damaging the impact will be on the economy."	Most Scottish firms believe Brexit is bad for their prospects and the economy, according to a survey by the Fraser of Allander Institute.
Media playback is not supported on this device Saturday's loss to Liverpool was the Swans' third in succession, leaving them a point above the bottom three and increasing the pressure on Guidolin. Although they are alarmed by the club's predicament, Swansea's owners are understood to have no immediate plans to sack the 60-year-old Italian. "I am sure in the future this team can turn this situation," said Guidolin. "The relationship between my players and me is perfect. The best thing in these nine months is to meet my players. I am sure they have good qualities, good character. "I am worried for the table, not my position. It is not good. We need more points." Swansea's American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, were at the Liberty Stadium for the Liverpool game, but have yet to decide on Guidolin's future. However, they are compiling a shortlist of potential successors should they sack the Italian. Chairman Huw Jenkins has met former United States coach Bob Bradley, while former Wales and Manchester United captain Ryan Giggs would be interested in the manager's role if it was to become vacant. Bradley and Giggs are not the only options, with Swansea's hierarchy thought to be considering several other possible candidates in the event of Guidolin's departure. It is likely the nature of Swansea's performances will have as much bearing on Guidolin's job prospects as the results, and the Swans were much improved against Liverpool. Guidolin, however, is in the dark about his future. "I don't know what happens tomorrow, or next week," he said. "My job is to work with the players and prepare the team for games. This is my job. I don't know if the next games brings." Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.	Swansea City head coach Francesco Guidolin believes his side can haul themselves out of relegation danger.
The death toll doubled over the last two days as officials found more than 100 bodies once waters began receding. Officials estimate that the floods have affected 450,000 people in the state. This years monsoon rains have affected millions across at least 20 states in India. The north-eastern state of Assam has also seen dozens killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. The government has announced aid packages for affected areas and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Assam on Tuesday. He has said the aim of his visit is to find a "permanent solution" to the flooding that Assam faces every year. The Press Trust of India news agency quoted an official as saying that many affected people in Gujarat had begun returning to their villages.	Floods in the western Indian state of Gujarat have killed 218 people, government officials have confirmed.
The 29-year-old Irishman is expected to formally sign for the Scottish Premiership club next week on his return from holiday. Sammon has negotiated an early release from his contract with the English Championship club. His deal is due to expire on 30 June, but Hearts need to register players for the Europa League 10 days before that. Sammon, who had a previous spell in Scotland's top flight with Kilmarnock, spent last season on loan to Sheffield United in League One, scoring six times in 33 appearances. Having switched to Derby for £1.2m from Wigan Athletic in 2012, he was also farmed out to Championship rivals Ipswich Town and Rotherham United after falling out of favour in the last two years and has not been offered a new deal. Sammon had joined Wigan, then in England's top flight, in 2011 after they had paid Kilmarnock about £600,000 for his services in January 2011. He had spent two and a half years at Rugby Park after arriving from Derry City and scored 25 goals in 75 games for the Ayrshire outfit. Sammon, who had also been linked with Aberdeen this summer, has been capped nine times by Republic of Ireland but failed to make their squad for the Euro 2016 finals. Hearts had signed Abiola Dauda in January to replace Osman Sow, who was sold to Chinese club Henan Jianye, but the Nigerian has returned to Vitesse Arnhem after scoring five times in 15 appearances during his loan spell.	Conor Sammon has agreed a three-year contract with Hearts as the striker prepares to leave Derby County.
The National Union of Farmers organised the event as a protest about delays in distributing EU farm payments. It was changed to be about "wider rural economy and food chain issues" after the Scottish government pledged Â£200m to support farmers in the interim. Scottish ministers Richard Lochhead and John Swinney,  and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson addressed the rally. Farmers have been hit by delays in processing Common Agricultural Policy payments due to problems with a Â£178m computer system set up to administer the newly-reformed system in Scotland. The Scottish government said 59% of payments have now been made. Some protestors called for Rural Affairs Secretary Mr Lochhead to resign, as he told them "we'll get the payments out, we'll fix the problems." He said: "While we have robust political debate inside the chamber, all political parties agree that food production in this country is an absolute priority. "Helping out our food producers in their hour of need, whether that's because of the issues we've had with payments or the weather, or because of low market prices, we have to do what we can to make sure that the skills you represent and the jobs you sustain and the support you give to Scotland is maintained going forward." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson urged the protestors to keep up the pressure on the government. She said: "If this had been an issue affecting urban Scotland it would have been solved months ago. "There's a real question of what happens now. There's still a real question over next year's claims, given we know the computer system doesn't work." Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie told the protestors that the Scottish government needed to "act quickly to get the money out the door", while Finance Secretary John Swinney told them "your voice has been heard".	Dozens of farmers gathered outside the Scottish Parliament for a rally highlighting rural issues.

He says more new arrivals are imminent with a focus on midfield after gaps were filled elsewhere. Westley saw his side end an eight-game losing streak in League Two with a draw against Colchester on Saturday, but the County manager is still not satisfied. "I'm still expecting to be active in the market," confirmed Westley. Despite the point against Colchester, County remained bottom of the table and six points from safety. Westley has been overseeing a major overhaul of his County squad including bringing back former Exile David Pipe. Westley wants more experience. "We need to strengthen. We've got experience in the dressing room and we've got one or two youngsters. I just need just one or two more experienced ingredients," he said. "I've strengthened the back-line, I've strengthened the front-line so obviously the midfield is going to be next." One midfielder it seems Westley does not have to worry about replacing is Josh Sheehan. The 21-year-old's loan spell from Swansea was due to end this month, but Westley expects Sheehan to now remain until the end of the campaign. The Newport boss added: "We've spoken to Swansea and I hope and expect Josh to stay."	Manager Graham Westley wants to add to the nine players he has already signed for Newport in the January transfer window.
Beat estimates 80% of those affected by eating disorders in the UK have misused laxatives in order to lose weight. It says supermarkets have done nothing to restrict sales of the medicine to young people. UK supermarkets say their sale of laxatives complies with regulation set by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. Beat says eating disorders most commonly develop during adolescence. Teens are turning to stimulant laxatives believing they can quickly lose weight, with some children known to be taking dozens of laxative pills on a daily basis, they say. Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death. Beat wants supermarkets and retailers to reduce the ease with which young people can buy laxatives in large quantities. The charity is calling for a minimum purchase age of 16, the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets, sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label on packets that states "this is not a weight loss product". The Dulcolax and Senokot tablets currently have age restrictions on the packets. Dulcolax states that the dosage instructions are for adults and children over 10, and children under 10 should consult a doctor before taking them. The Senokot packet advises the dosage instructions are for adults and children over twelve, and that children 6 years and older should consult a doctor before taking them. They do not recommend the drug for children under 6. Both and Dulcolax and Senokot say that they treat the issue of eating disorders very seriously and say they fully comply with all the legal requirements made by MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). "We've seen a 30% increase in calls to our help lines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way," Susan Ringwood, chief executive of Beat, told BBC Watchdog. "And that does include a significant number of young people as well," she added. Lottie Hall is 17 years old. She started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was 13 and now has long term damage from laxative abuse. "At first it would start with just a few, 4 or 5. Over time my body just got used to it and in the end I could be taking 20 to 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect. "It was a long time, probably about 3 years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it. "They'll be times where I'm out and all of a sudden it gets really uncomfortable and I have no control over it. "I was a school once and I was in the corridor and was crouching down and holding my stomach in agony and my friend found me and she asked me what was wrong and I had to tell her and it was a really embarrassing situation. "She actually had to tell my teacher and my teacher had to tell my mum." In 2009 Beat warned Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda that children were buying the medicine in large quantities. But the charity says nothing was done. National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and according to research from Beat, 80% of those surveyed by the charity admitted that they had misused laxatives in order to lose weight. Dr Babu Vadamalayan, a paediatrician and gastroenterologist at Kings and St Thomas Hospital, told BBC Watchdog that the eating disorder unit at Maudsley Hospital say they see 140 under 18s with eating disorders every year and 10-15% of them are abusing laxatives. As part of an investigation, BBC Watchdog sent four 14-year-old actors into 25 branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Boots stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives. The actors were not stopped or questioned by staff in any of the stores, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets in each store. MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recognise the concern. The body says it has consulted independent experts and believes that restricting the sale of laxatives or reducing pack sizes would not be appropriate. However, it adds that it is working with manufacturers to get stronger warnings printed on products and will monitor their safety and take further action if necessary. Boots and the four supermarkets said that they fully comply with current government and MHRA regulations on selling laxatives. Sainsbury's and Boots added that they are retraining their staff to better identify signs of laxative misuse. You can see the full report on BBC Watchdog at 20:00 BST on Thursday 16 October.	The UK's leading eating disorder charity has called for the sale of laxatives to children to be more strictly regulated.
Galvani Bioelectronics hopes to bring a new treatment based on the technique before regulators within seven years. GlaxoSmithKline and Verily, formerly Google, Life Sciences, are behind it. Animal experiments have attached tiny silicone cuffs, containing electrodes, around a nerve and then used a power supply to control the nerve's messages. One set of tests suggested the approach could help treat type-2 diabetes, in which the body ignores the hormone insulin. They focused on a cluster of chemical sensors near the main artery in the neck that check levels of sugar and the hormone insulin. The sensors send their findings back to the brain, via a nerve, so the organ can coordinate the body's response to sugar in the bloodstream. GSK vice-president of bioelectronics Kris Famm told the BBC News website: "The neural signatures in the nerve increase in type 2-diabetes. "By blocking those neural signals in diabetic rats, you see the sensitivity of the body to insulin is restored." And early work suggested it could work in other diseases too. "It isn't just a one-trick-pony, it is something that if we get it right could have a new class of therapies on our hands," Mr Famm said. But he said the field was only "scratching the surface" when it came to understanding which nerve signals have what effect in the body. Both the volume and rhythm of the nerve signals could be having an effect rather than it being a simple case of turning the nerve on or off. And even if the approach works theoretically, a huge amount of effort will be needed to make the technology practical. The kits to hack the nerves will need to be miniaturised, customisable to different patients' nerves, durable enough to survive in the body long-term and have sufficient battery power. Dr Famm added: "In 10 to 20 years I think there will be a set of these miniaturised precision therapies that will be available for you and me when we go to a doctor." Verily chief technology officer Brian Otis said: "Bioelectronic medicine is a new area of therapeutic exploration, and we know that success will require the confluence of deep disease biology expertise and new highly miniaturised technologies. "This partnership provides an opportunity to further Verily's mission by deploying our focused expertise in low power, miniaturised therapeutics and our data analytics engine to potentially address many disease areas with greater precision with the goal of improving outcomes."

The NHS Information Centre data shows more than eight out of 10 newborns are now breastfed at least once after birth, up from six out of 10 in 1990. Experts said the increase was welcome and partly due to public awareness that "breast is best" for mother and child. But the figures do not reveal how many mums stick at it for the recommended first six months of a baby's life. Many women struggle to continue to exclusively breastfeed. And the Royal College of Midwives is concerned that some new mothers are not getting the support they need to encourage breastfeeding. Spokeswoman Jane Munro criticised the Department of Health in England for axing funding for National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, which runs this week. "We do not want to see the ground we have gained lost." She added: "We know that many women stop breastfeeding when they leave hospital. "This is why it is so important that they are able to get advice and support from their midwife, and that there are enough midwives with the time to offer these women the help they need." The government said it was committed to training up to an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015 who would "be able to help support women who want to breastfeed but may find it difficult". According to the latest figures, breastfeeding rates were higher in England than in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, although rates have risen in most areas. And the percentage of women who are choosing to smoke either before or during pregnancy has fallen.	More new mothers are opting to try breastfeeding their babies, latest UK figures reveal.
The study, by the Institute of Education, London University, examined the reading habits of 6,000 children. It indicated reading for pleasure was more important to a child's development than how educated their parents were. The researchers concluded a wide vocabulary helped children absorb information across the curriculum. They analysed the results of tests taken at the age of 16 by 6,000 children, all born in one week, from the 1970 British Cohort Study. The findings showed those who had read often at the age of 10 and had been reading books and newspapers more than once a week aged 16 had performed better than those who had read less. There was a 14.4% advantage in vocabulary, a 9.9% advantage in maths and an 8.6% advantage in spelling, the research found, once parents' background and reading habits were taken into account. The study said: "The influence of reading for pleasure was greater than that for having a parent with a degree." The total effect on children's progress of reading often - reading newspapers at age 16 and being a regular library user - was four times greater than the advantage of having a university-educated parent, the study suggested. The Institute of Education also looked at the impact on test scores of having brothers and sisters and found that those youngsters with older siblings were less likely to do well, particularly in vocabulary. It suggests this could be because children in larger families spend less time talking one-to-one with their parents and have less chance to develop their vocabulary skills. There was less effect if children had younger brothers and sisters, although they may score lower on vocabulary, the study found. Study author Dr Alice Sullivan said: "It may seem surprising that reading for pleasure would help to improve children's maths scores. "But it is likely that strong reading ability will enable children to absorb and understand new information and affect their attainment in all subjects." Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "It absolutely makes sense that you would expect reading for pleasure to improve children's vocabularies. "But I think that that also does improve children's ability to take on new information and new concepts across the curriculum. "A child who has a narrow vocabulary may constantly be coming across things they don't understand."	Children who read for pleasure are likely to do better in maths and English than those who rarely read in their free time, research suggests.
They read from Attack of the Shidas about children from different Kenyan communities working together to protect their well from an alien invasion. The event is meant to foster a culture of reading in the country, the organisers told the BBC. The US currently holds the Guinness World Record set by 233,000 people. It will take at least a week to work out whether they have been successful as they need to tally the number of pupils from across the country who participated. Kenyan children's book author Muthoni Muchemi led the event with 1,700 students reading from her book at Hospital Hill Primary School in the capital, Nairobi. Afterwards, she said she wanted to break the stereotype that Africans do not care for books. "Growing up I would always hear that if you want to hide something from an African, put it in a book - and it was really upsetting to me," she told the BBC. "I want to help change that perception and the first step is to re-introduce reading not just as important but enjoyable," she said. "I have seen over the years that a lot of families don't have libraries in their homes but have they have big TVs. We need to get parents to understand that reading for pleasure with their children is an important part of brain development." The 13- and 14-year-olds, dressed in grey and white uniforms, who chorused the words at Hospital Hill Primary School said they enjoyed the challenge. "I enjoy reading because it teaches me about other people and places. It teaches me about the world," one girl said. Another student said he thought Attack of the Shidas had important life lessons about working together and accepting people's differences. It is not the first time Kenya has tried to break the record - last year 142,279 children read aloud in 360 schools. This time, Ms Muchemi is more optimistic about the Storymoja National Read Aloud attempt. But she says in the end it is about building confidence in children. "If you master reading it means you've increased your vocabulary, you have good command of sentence structure, your facility with language is improved. It can't help but build your confidence," she said. "Exposure to different stories makes you more confident in your place in the world because you no longer feel alone. It's served me very well because I grew up in a deep rural area."	Pupils at about 400 Kenyan schools are trying to break the world record for having the most people reading aloud simultaneously from the same book.
The 17-year-old scored 330.70 in Kiev to finish ahead of Russian duo Anna Chuinyshena (326.90) and Iuliia Timoshinina (313.30). "To be honest, I did not expect this victory," said Toulson. "I am not totally satisfied with my dives yet." The World Championships take place in Budapest, Hungary from 14 July. Toulson is expected to compete both individually and with Tonia Couch in the synchronised event.	Britain's Lois Toulson won European Championship gold in the 10m platform as she finalises her preparations for next month's World Championships.
The FTSE 250 company said this was due to customers switching less between savings and current accounts because of low interest rates. The news overshadowed the 16% rise in annual profits to Â£73.5m that the company reported for 2016. Another big faller in the FTSE 250 was transport group Go-Ahead. Its shares dived nearly 14% after the company warned of lower-than-expected full-year profits, partly due to the disruption caused by strikes on Southern rail services. Go-Ahead owns a 65% stake in Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs the Southern rail contract. Half-year profits at Go-Ahead fell 11.7% to Â£67m, and the company said its results had been "significantly impacted by a reduction in rail profitability due to losses from our GTR franchise, as a result of ongoing industrial action on Southern". The benchmark FTSE 100 index gained ground during the afternoon after spending the morning in the doldrums. At the close, it was up 10.44 points at 7,263.44. The biggest riser in the FTSE 100 was support services group Babcock, which rose 7.1% after issuing a positive trading update. On the currency markets, the pound dipped 0.13% against the US dollar to $1.2427 and was 0.4% lower against the euro at 1.1707 euros.	Shares in Moneysupermarket fell more than 6% after the comparison website warned that revenues so far this year were running below last year's levels.
Saints had the better of a scrappy first-half, after Jonny Lomax crossed on the back of penalty goals apiece for both sides. Leeds pulled clear when Adam Cuthbertson added to Ryan Hall's score. Danny Richardson's try kept Saints hopes alive but Leeds held on and are now three points clear of third-placed Hull FC in the Super League table. The defeat leaves Saints a point behind Wakefield, who are fourth with four Super 8s games to play. Leeds cannot catch Castleford Tigers at the top, but are in the box seat for the second home semi-final come the top four play-offs. Headingley's impending redevelopment meant this game was to be the last for the 86-year-old roofed terrace, and it added an emotional tinge to a match that held huge significance to the race for Old Trafford. Unfortunately the pre-match festivities failed to transfer to the field, as neither side found their rhythm in a game high on drama but lacking in quality. Saints' best moment of the first half produced the game's first try when Lomax latched on to Zeb Taia's pass after James Roby put the back-rower into space. The hosts were equally disjointed but gave the crowd some cheer when a smart move to the left was finished off by Ryan Hall on his 300th club appearance. Cuthbertson bashed his way across on the back of Leeds pressure but it was never comfortable until the hooter, particularly when the lively Richardson came off the bench to step his way across the stripe with five minutes to go. Leeds Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott: "I thought we were extremely good, I've never not been proud of out players although I don't say it too much. I'm proud to be their coach tonight. "I don't know where we go the second half from, Saints were great, beating us off the deck in the first half and we never got to grips with their play-the-balls. "We rolled up our sleeves and did some hard work, we should have executed better. It was a great game of rugby league." St Helens head coach Justin Holbrook: "I couldn't be prouder of my team. Unfortunately that's two weeks in a row we've been beaten by two points. "I don't think we played poorly. We didn't have much ball in the second half, we were camped in our own half, but we got within two points away from home against a very tough side. "We just couldn't get going for one reason or another in the second half but full credit to Leeds, they played very well." Leeds Rhinos: Walker; Briscoe, Watkins, Sutcliffe, Hall; Moon, McGuire; Cuthbertson, Parcell, Singleton, Ward, Jones-Buchanan, Ablett Replacements: Burrow, Delaney, Keinhorst, Mullally St Helens: Lomax; Makinson, Morgan, Percival, Grace; Fages, Smith; Amor, Roby, Thompson, Taia, Wilkin, Knowles. Replacements: Walmsley, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Peyroux, Richardson	Leeds Rhinos saw off the soon-to-be demolished iconic South Stand with an error-strewn win over St Helens.
The US ambassador to Bangladesh condemned the killing of Xulhaz Mannan, who also worked at the US embassy. Another person was also injured when the attackers entered a Dhaka flat. Since February last year suspected militants have killed several secular or atheist writers and members of religious minority groups. The two men were murdered two days after a university teacher was hacked to death by suspected Islamist militants. So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility - but the Bangladeshi government insists there is no IS presence in the country. Lurching from secularism to sectarian terror? Who is behind the Bangladesh killings? "I am devastated by the brutal murder of Xulhaz Mannan and another young Bangladeshi," said US Ambassador Marcia Bernicat. "We abhor this senseless act of violence and urge the government of Bangladesh in the strongest terms to apprehend the criminals behind these murders," she added. BBC Bengali Service editor Sabir Mustafa said staff at Roopbaan, a magazine and activist group for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community that had not been condemned by the government and received some support from foreign embassies, had been careful to protect their identities but had not believed their lives were at risk. Suspected extremists in Bangladesh are gaining a sense of security that they can carry out killings with impunity, he says. A British photographer who knew Mr Mannan and the other victim, known as "Tonoy" and named in Bangladeshi media as Tanay Mojumdar, said they and other friends had set up Roopbaan with the aim of spreading tolerance. Homosexuality is technically illegal in Bangladesh and remains a highly sensitive issue in society. Both men were openly gay and believed that if more gay Bangladeshis came out then the country would have to accept them, the photographer, who asked not to be named, said. They were also were behind the annual "Rainbow Rally", held on Bengali New Year, 14 April, since 2014. This year's rally was banned by police as part of widespread security measures. "Both were extremely gentle, non-violent and aware that being openly gay and active in their work was a personal danger," the photographer said. Their killings were likely to spread fear among Bangladesh's gay community, he said. "Until a year ago the only threat to coming out was shame of the family and having to start a new life elsewhere in Bangladesh. Now it's one of danger," he said. Meanwhile Bangladesh's best known blogger said he had received a death threat on Sunday. Imran Sarker, who led major protests by secular activists in 2013 against Islamist leaders, said he had received a phone call warning that he would be killed "very soon". Earlier this month, a Bangladeshi law student who had expressed secular views online died when he was hacked with machetes and then shot in Dhaka. Last year, four prominent secular bloggers were also killed with machetes. The four bloggers had all appeared on a list of 84 "atheist bloggers" drawn up by Islamic groups in 2013 and widely circulated. There have also been attacks on members of religious minorities including Shia, Sufi and Ahmadi Muslims, Christians and Hindus. Two foreigners - an Italian aid worker and a Japanese farmer - have also been killed. Muslim-majority Bangladesh is officially secular but critics say the government has failed to properly address the attacks.	Bangladesh police say a top gay rights activist and editor at the country's only LGBT magazine is one of two people who have been hacked to death.

Holdsworth, 47, beat takeover offers from banker Roger Tamraz and Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Trust. The club, owned by Eddie Davies, are £172.9m in debt and have been trying to find a buyer for a number of months. The Championship strugglers are scheduled in the High Court on Monday over a £3m unpaid tax bill. It is hoped the takeover will soon be completed as Wanderers must let the High Court know by 19 February if they are going to enter administration, and also prove they have funds to continue trading. Former Wimbledon and Brentford forward Holdsworth spent six seasons at Bolton, scoring 52 goals in 188 appearances. BBC Radio Manchester also understands the sale of the Trotters' training ground at Euxton has yet to be finalised, with League One side Wigan making an approach.	Bolton Wanderers have given preferred bidder status to former striker Dean Holdsworth's Sports Shield consortium, reports BBC Radio Manchester.
By studying cubes of sand in the lab, they showed that areas squeezed by vertical stress are protected from erosion, while others wash away. The process had proved difficult to study, because natural slabs of sandstone erode over millions of years. The key to the experiments, published in Nature Geoscience, was an unusual "locked sand" dug from a Czech quarry. The study's first author, Dr Jiri Bruthans from Charles University in Prague, said the results revealed the "Michelangelo" behind some of the world's most famous rocky landmarks. "The stress field is the master sculptor - it tells the weather where to pick," he told BBC News. Erosion by wind and water, it seems, is merely the sharp instrument. The remarkable shapes are controlled by internal stresses and strains within the rock, applied by the pull of gravity. As well as showing they could predict the shapes with mathematical models of that stress field, Dr Bruthans and his team sandwiched small cubes of sand under various weights and submerged them in water. The sides of the cube started to fall away within minutes, leaving fewer and fewer grains of sand to bear the weight. As that process continued, eventually the pressure on the remaining column caused the grains to lock together and resist further erosion. When they added faults or other distortions to the cube, and shifted the direction of the pressure applied, the scientists were able to reproduce a gallery of the sort of shapes seen in natural sandstone landforms. They were only able to watch all this happen because of the strange, sticky quality of the sand they used. From the Strelec Quarry, in the north of the Czech Republic, the team collected samples of a sand with particular interlocking properties: "Strelec locked sand". It is so soft that for many years it was mined in the quarry using hoses - but when it dried out, explosives had to be used. For his experiments, Dr Bruthans used 10cm blocks of this locked sand that were dried out an oven. "It was very clever to find this rock out of a quarry that would behave in an accelerated way, compared to those famous sandstone arches," commented Dr Simon Mudd, a lecturer in landscape dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, UK. "They've really demonstrated convincingly that as you erode this material, it begins to concentrate stress," he told the BBC. To show that the principle also applies to regular sandstone, Dr Bruthans and his team also took small cubes of normal, "cemented" sandstone from the same quarry and attacked them with cycles of heat, cold and salt, to simulate natural erosion. In all cases, Dr Bruthans showed that it was pressure that determined the shapes left behind. "You can control it completely," he said. "You select the pillar direction, by choosing the points where you apply the compression." One experiment even showed that a block of the Strelec sand, placed straddling a small gap and left outside in the rain for 15 months, would naturally form an arch. All of these processes can be predicted by modelling the stress field, Dr Bruthans emphasised. "It's just the stress which controls the shape - nothing else." The results were enough to convince Dr Mudd: "It's a very compelling combination of experimental and numerical work," he said. In an accompanying comment article for Nature Geoscience, Prof Chris Paola from the University of Minnesota, US, described the discovery as "a lovely and elegant formative mechanism for a lovely and elegant kind of landform". "These natural sculptures have delighted countless visitors, some of whom must have paused to wonder where they come from," Prof Paola wrote. "Here is an answer."	Geologists have discovered the secret that gives dramatic natural sandstone monuments their shape: gravity.
His widow Daphne phoned the PM's office on Saturday to "kindly decline" the offer, Mr Abbott said. The commentator himself had wished for "something very, very quiet and very, very private", he added. Benaud, 84, is said to have died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday. He will be remembered in a private funeral attended only by his immediate family, Australian media reported. Mr Abbott told reporters on Sunday: "I thought it was important that as a mark of the respect that we have long had for him that we should offer a state funeral. "But my understanding is that Richie's own wishes were for something very, very quiet, and something very, very private." A pioneering leg-spin bowler, Benaud played in 63 Tests, 28 as captain, before retiring in 1964 to pursue a career in journalism and broadcasting including a long association with the BBC. His final commentary in England came during the 2005 Ashes series, but he continued to work for Channel Nine in Australia until 2013. Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards described Benaud as "the iconic voice of our summer".	The family of the late former Australian cricket captain and legendary cricket commentator Richie Benaud has rejected Australian PM Tony Abbott's proposal for a state funeral.
However goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama declined the chance to appear to answer questions about comments he made about playing an international match in Kaduna. The NFF executive board will have the final say on any punishments, on a date yet to be decided. Keshi, who signed a new two-year deal with the NFF in April, was on a list of 59 applicants published recently by the Ivorian federation (FIF) to take over from Frenchman Herve Renard. Meanwhile, Super Eagles captain Enyeama made "uncomplimentary remarks" regarding safety and security in Kaduna for a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Chad. Enyeama, who plays for French club Lille and is the Super Eagles most capped player with 101 appearances, failed to reply to messages from the NFF seeking an explanation for his comments. The 32-year-old could face a lengthy ban for his comments which the NFF feels broke its recent code of conduct signed by the players as well as his failure to attend Tuesday's hearing.	Coach Stephen Keshi met with the Nigeria Football Federation's (NFF) disciplinary committee on Tuesday to answer questions on why his name appeared on a list of candidates to manage Ivory Coast.
Cornish-born Glover was meant to be back with  winning partner Heather Stanning, but Glover, 27, won the  with Swann last season. "We had a whole year together last year so hopefully it'll click into place," she told BBC Radio Cornwall. "It's clicking into place fairly easily, we just need to get back onto the same page technically and get doing the same things." Swann replaced Stanning last season after she Glover and Swann won three World Cup events together last season as well as the world title in South Korea. And with a good performance in Amsterdam, Glover says there could be some tough decisions for the Great Britain selectors as to who partners her in the coxless pair for the rest of this season. She said: "It's going to be a quite interesting one with Heather coming back after taking a year out with the army and Polly staying here. "There's lots of selection things about who will be in the pair out of those two. "But I want to keep my eye on the World Championships at the end of August in Amsterdam. "It'd be great to try and hold on to our world champion title, whoever else is in the boat with me."	Helen Glover expects her partnership with Polly Swann to develop quickly as they prepare for the European Championships in Belgrade.
Screen grabs showing the website with messages from gay activists are being circulated on social media sites. In one, the prime minister apologises to all homosexuals living in Uganda and gives his support to a gay pride march. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda and gay people have faced physical attacks and social rejection. Earlier this year, a controversial anti-gay bill, which proposes to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in jail to life, was re-tabled in the Ugandan parliament. The bill was first introduced in 2009 but never debated - and the MP backing the legislation says a clause proposing the death penalty will be dropped. It originally said those found guilty of "aggravated homosexuality" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a "serial offender" - would face the death penalty. The Uganda Justice Law and Order Sector website was also reportedly taken over by hackers this week. Ambrose Ruyooka, commissioner for the Information Communications Technology ministry, told the BBC the problem had now been rectified. The government has created a directorate of security for all government websites and tightened cyber laws to counter rising cyber crime, he said. An activist named @DramaSett3r on Twitter is said to be behind the attacks. The operations were carried out by a group known as The Elite Society and the Anonymous hacktivist community, the activist said. On Wednesday, the official website of Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi quoted him as saying: "We have got to expel the narrow mindedness from this country, and begin afresh, starting with a full and formal apology to all homosexuals living in Uganda today," screen grabs on Twitter and Facebook show. A message allegedly posted by the hackers on the prime minister's site on Tuesday said: "Your violations of the rights of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people have disgusted us. "All people have the right to live in dignity free from the repression of someone else's political and religious beliefs." The East African nation is a largely conservative society and many people condemn homosexuality both as unAfrican and unChristian. Western donors have recently said they could withdraw aid from those countries, including many in Africa, which do not recognise gay rights.	The Ugandan prime minister's website was attacked by hackers on Tuesday and Wednesday, a government official has confirmed to the BBC.

Ciara Griffin is handed her first Six Nations start at flanker for Ireland, while Paula Fitzpatrick moves to number eight and Heather O'Brien to the bench. Experienced fly-half Nora Stapleton comes in for Nikki Caughey, who will provide back-up from the replacements. Ireland, led by Tom Tierney, defeated Wales 21-3 in their opening fixture, but went on to lose 18-6 against France in Perpignan. England won their opening two fixtures, against Scotland and Italy. "Ireland is going to present a tough challenge this weekend and there will be no margin for error," said England's lead coach Scott Bemand. "Recent history testifies that our games have been fiercely contested and, as a group, we are very excited to play at the home." Tierney added: "While the result in France didn't go our way, I thought there were a lot of positives to take from that game and we will be looking to carry them into this fixture. "We made too many unforced errors in Perpignan, so if we can rectify that I think we have got a very good chance on Saturday.

The Paralympian was transferred to house arrest last month after serving one year of his five-year term for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, 28, shot her through a locked toilet door in 2013 but insists he thought she was an intruder. No date was set for the judgement that could see Pistorius return to prison. Pistorius and his family did not attend the hearing at South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Ms Steenkamp's mother, June, was present, as well as some women activists of the governing African National Congress who said they came to show solidarity with her. The proceedings were broadcast live on television. State prosecutor Gerrie Nel outlined the state's case for the verdict to be changed to murder from culpable homicide, or manslaughter. The five appeal court judges did not consider the facts but the application of the law, in a highly technical case. What is on everybody's lips is what Pistorius' lawyer Barry Roux was overheard saying at the end of the hearing. "I'm going to lose", he is reported to have said in a conversation with Mr Nel while their microphones were still open. But the context in which he made the comment is unclear so it would be wrong to conclude that he conceded victory to his rival. What is clear, though, is that Mr Roux had a tougher time in court, and there are many here who feel that the scales of justice tilted in favour of a murder conviction. But this case has thrown up so many twists and turns that no-one can confidently predict which way the court will rule. The five judges who heard the appeal are among the most senior in South Africa, and came from across the racial and gender divide. It will, therefore, be difficult to fault their judgement. They did not take new evidence, but heard arguments from both sides on whether the trial judge interpreted the law correctly, especially the charge of dolus eventualis, also known as common-law murder. In South African law, this charge applies if the accused knew they might kill someone but still went ahead with their course of action. The prosecution argued that Pistorius should have foreseen that by firing four shots through a locked door into a toilet cubicle, the person behind the door would have been killed. Trial judge Thokozile Masipa disagreed, and Mr Roux did his best to convince the appeal judges to uphold her verdict. Was it enough to keep Pistorius out of jail? My friend Reeva Steenkamp Pistorius: From prison to mansion Mr Roux told the judges that the athlete suffered from an anxiety disorder, and he fired in quick succession. "The law is not designed to punish you for a wrong state of mind," he added. Pistorius' action was lawful, and he genuinely believed that he was shooting at an intruder, Mr Roux said. During his trial, the athlete said he believed there was an intruder in the house and thought his girlfriend was in the bedroom. The prosecution argued that who was behind the toilet door was irrelevant, and Pistorius' intent was to kill. The prosecution also want his jail sentence to be increased from five years to a minimum of 15 years. The final ruling will not be known for some weeks, reports say. Pistorius was found guilty of the culpable homicide of his 29-year-old girlfriend at a trial in October last year. Ms Steenkamp's relatives have said they think Pistorius is "getting off lightly". The double amputee was released from prison on 19 October. Under South African law, he was eligible for release under "correctional supervision", having served a sixth of his sentence. His family said he would "strictly" adhere to his parole conditions at his uncle's upmarket home in Pretoria. Pistorius competed in the 400m at the London 2012 Olympics, wearing carbon-fibre blades to run against able-bodied athletes.	South African judges have heard an appeal on whether athlete Oscar Pistorius should be convicted of murder instead of culpable homicide.
John Glen, Conservative MP for Salisbury, said any decision to make the A303 a dual carriageway must include protection for the World Heritage site. Mr Glen said a tunnel was the only "realistic solution". A government feasibility study is already under way to consider the various options for the road. Speaking in a Westminster debate, Mr Glen said the road, which runs from Hampshire to Devon, had become the "devil's highway" and "one of the most notorious traffic blackspots in the country". He joined other South West MPs calling for the government to consider the wider economic, environmental and safety benefits of improving the road. However, he cautioned that any plans to turn part, or all, of the 92 mile (148km) road into a dual carriageway must include protection for Stonehenge. Mr Glen said he had been told by English Heritage, the National Trust and the Council for British Archaeology that Stonehenge would be "formally placed on the at-risk register," if a dual carriageway was constructed close to the historic site without adequate protection. Plans for a tunnel were initially shelved in 2007 when the government said the estimated cost of Â£510m was too expensive. "A poorly designed and badly executed" dual carriageway which could "undermine a 5,000 year old world heritage site is not an improvement worth fighting for," Mr Glen said. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said the government hoped an announcement on the future of the A303 would be made in the autumn.	A Wiltshire MP has reignited calls for a tunnel to be constructed alongside the Stonehenge monument.
The Council for Science and Technology (CST) wants "public good" GM varieties to be grown and tested in the UK. It says GM crops should be assessed individually - like pharmaceuticals - taking potential benefits into account. A new UK regulator similar to NICE (the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) should be set up, it says. The UK is a world leader in plant biotechnology research, but GM field trial applications have fallen from 37 in 1995 to just one in 2012. By David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The controversy over genetically modifying plants is riddled with contradictions. Take the European Union. Its internal politics have caused a logjam in approvals but the EU science budget is also funding some of Britain's research. Europe grows very few GM plants but most of its imported animal feed is genetically modified. It was America's agricultural giants whose hard sell of GM put off so many European consumers but it is also US science that provides the evidence, gathered over the past two decades, that supports the assurance that GM plants and food are safe. And while Britain's leading plant scientists appeal to the prime minister to help foster this new technology, its leading supermarket chains avoid stocking GM products because no-one is asking for them. So can anything shift? The key is whether ministers can change minds in Brussels - and that's no easy task given the hostility towards GM in big players like France and Germany. A long haul lies ahead. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has spoken in favour of increasing UK research into GM, which he said offers the "most wonderful opportunities to improve human health." The CST was asked by Prime Minister David Cameron for the latest evidence on the risks and benefits of GM technologies in agriculture, and for advice on UK and EU regulation. In turn, it commissioned a group of leading plant scientists from Rothamsted Research, The Sainsbury Laboratory and Cambridge University to make recommendations to the prime minister. The scientists say they are being held back by strict EU regulations - based on the principle that GM crops are inherently more dangerous than conventionally-bred varieties. Only two GM varieties have been licensed for commercial harvest in Europe - despite the fact that 12% of the world's arable land is cultivating GM crops. The CST report argues GM crops have now been shown to be safe - and may be necessary in future for Britain to grow its own food supply, rather than depending on imports. It says the UK should regulate commercial GM varieties of wheat and potatoes based on their individual benefits and risks - rather than follow the EU's blanket approach. It also recommends a new programme of publicly-funded field trials to test "public good" GM crop varieties, which it calls "PubGM". "Public good" traits could include nutritional enhancement, such as antioxidants in tomatoes, or vitamin A in "Golden Rice". They could also include "climate-proofing" properties such as drought resistance or heat resistance. "With PubGM, seed companies, consumers and regulators will be able to decide, based on results of experiments, whether a GM trait has proved its worth in UK crops under UK conditions," said Professor Jonathan Jones from The Sainsbury Laboratory, one of the report's authors. Sir Mark Walport, chief scientific adviser and CST co-chair, said: "We take it for granted that because our shelves in supermarkets are heaving with food there are no problems in food security. But there are. "We're part of a global food market. Competition is likely to increase. The world is already malnourished and the population is growing. "The challenge is to get more yield from the same area. GM is not a magic bullet, but it is one of a range of technologies that we should consider." The report was welcomed by Dr Julian Little, chair of the Agricultural Biotechnology Council (ABC), which represents companies including BASF, Monsanto and Syngenta. "Current EU regulation has moved in the direction of increasing political influence and undermining science. "Europe risks being left behind and it therefore remains essential that action is taken to address the dysfunctional EU approvals process so that UK farmers may, in the future, be able to realise the potential of great British biotechnology research right here in the UK." But the environmental group Friends of the Earth say GM will not make food more affordable or sustainable. "GM crops have been hugely over-hyped. Despite decades of research they have failed to deliver the benefits they have promised - and have been an expensive distraction from real solutions to the challenges we face," said senior food campaigner Vicki Hird. "Our food production system needs a radical overhaul to ensure everyone has access to healthy, affordable food that doesn't wreck the planet - but putting more power into the hands of multi-nationals is not the answer." Prof Cathie Martin, of the John Innes Centre, one of the creators of GM purple tomatoes, said changing regulations would help scientists make progress with GM varieties that benefit society. She told BBC News: "It takes 10 years to get European regulators to approve a new GM trial, and costs in the order of $150m. How can any small company do that?" "NGOs complain that GM only benefits multinational companies - but that's because they're the only ones who can afford it. We can't afford to trial crops for the public good. "If this promotes field trials where you can look at something for the public good that would be fantastic." Dan Crossley, executive director of the Food Ethics Council, said: "This report, like many focussing on GM technology, is framed around the question 'how can science and technology help secure global food supplies'. "Instead we need to ask people at the sharp end of food insecurity what can be done - by scientists and also by others - to help fix the food system. "In a resource-constrained world where a billion people go to bed hungry and a billion are obese, we must also tackle the scandal of food waste, as well as the issue of what we eat."	A new report on genetically modified (GM) crops, commissioned by the prime minister, calls for more UK field trials and fewer EU restrictions.
Winstone, who will play the EastEnders and Carry On actress in her 20s, said: "I... am so excited to step into her national treasure shoes!" The biopic will also feature two child actors as the younger Dame Barbara. After portraying Windsor in the 1998 stage play Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick and in TV's Cor Blimey!, Spiro reprises the role of Babs in her 50s. Spiro said: "It's absolutely thrilling to be playing Barbara again. Tony Jordan has written a beautiful celebration of her life, but it's not your usual biopic, lots of surprises. She is so adored, so I hope we get it right and that Barbara herself loves it." Babs follows the East End star over a 50-year period from 1943 to 1993, covering her lonely childhood and World War Two evacuation, her complicated relationship with her father, her marriages and her successful career. Dame Barbara, who will be making a cameo in the drama, added: "I am truly thrilled to know that the BBC have secured two such talented and established actresses to portray me in their new biopic of my life. Sam Spiro has already proved herself playing me on stage and TV to great acclaim, as well as, having her own incredible career. "Sam will now be playing me at a later time in my life which will be a new challenge for her and one she will undoubtedly achieve. And then to be lucky enough to have one of today's current dynamic actresses playing the younger me fills me with such excitement, especially knowing that it is Jaime Winstone. Boy, am I a lucky lady!" The one-off 90-minute drama will be broadcast sometime next year.	Jaime Winstone and Samantha Spiro are both cast as Dame Barbara Windsor in BBC One drama Babs.

The 10-year-old was bought by owners Raymond and Caroline Mould as part of a job lot of 22 horses in France that cost a total of 300,000 euros. He banked more than £1.1m from 18 wins, nine at the highest level - Grade One. The total included a rare hat-trick of success at all three of the major spring festivals - at Cheltenham, Aintree and Punchestown in 2013. But more than that, with his ability and striking dark colouring - trainer Nicky Henderson nicknamed him an 'equine James Bond' - Sprinter Sacre gained a vast following amongst the racing public. That only grew when a heart condition was diagnosed and, though successfully treated, the horse spent nearly two years out of form and written off by many. It was a year to the day before his retirement was announced at Cheltenham's Open fixture that Sprinter Sacre returned to the big time on the track with an emotional success in the course's Shloer Chase. He completed what turned out to be his final season unbeaten with further wins at Kempton, at the showpiece Cheltenham Festival - when he regained the Champion Chase crown - and at Sandown, when Henderson believes he was back to his best. The plan had been for Sprinter Sacre to race three times this season - in Sandown's Tingle Creek Chase in December, in January's Clarence House Chase at Ascot, and in the Champion Chase. Jockey Barry Geraghty, who rode the horse 17 times, winning on 13 occasions, said the horse was "just unbelievable". "He's something special and he is to be celebrated," he said. "I've never sat on a horse over fences like him - he was electric. He was just unbelievable." Speaking before the Open meeting at Cheltenham got under way on Friday, Henderson acknowledged the vast public affection for Sprinter Sacre. "We are the curators of this beautiful, very special racehorse," he said. "It's very humbling to think that he gave, and he gives, so many people in national hunt racing, which is a great big family affair really, so much pleasure." Later in the day, another Henderson-trained horse Simonsig was put down after breaking a leg during the Shloer Chase. Henderson added: "Sprinter Sacre's retirement was not a funeral, but a celebration of life, but now we've got the funeral and the tears all of a sudden go the other way. "It is not fair for the team more than anything." Cornelius Lysaght, BBC horse racing correspondent What was it about 'Sprinter' that meant the horse was such a hit? Obviously, he was utterly brilliant, unbeatable indeed for the first two years of his racing career [2011-2013], and achieving that string of wins with a style that was positively transfixing with its power and jumping flamboyance. Then the wheels famously fell off when the heart condition was diagnosed, but we know the public loves a sporting patient and kept the faith even when their favourite proved a shadow of his former self. His return to the top was greeted with cheers and tears, and some of the sport's most emotional times of recent years. He's sure to be a star turn on the racehorse retirement circuit - do they still open supermarkets as Red Rum did?	Sprinter Sacre, the jump racing superstar, has been retired after suffering a tendon injury.
For 70 years, my father has lived with the shame of what happened to his ship, HMS Hebe, in June 1940. During the evacuation of Dunkirk, he was the chief engine room artificer on board the Hebe, a minesweeper deployed to Dover as a control vessel. The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June. "It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment. "The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers. All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us. "There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep." In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England. "As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest". "It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army." The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation. My father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a "lack of moral fibre". "We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others. "Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital. "About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches." The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain. "We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return." To my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo. "This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day," he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.	BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles has been talking to his father, Harold, about his recollections of the Dunkirk evacuation.
Ceredigion-based Lewis Coaches, which runs buses from Aberystwyth to Cardiff via Carmarthen, is to shut on Friday. The Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru said 40 jobs were at risk. Ceredigion council said it was working to continue some services. The authority said plans were already in place to see the on-demand Bwcabus service and the 588 and 585 routes from Aberystwyth University to Lampeter taken over by other firms by Saturday. But the council said it understood the 701 Aberystwyth - Carmarthen - Cardiff service would end on Friday and it did not know if another operator would take it on. Lewis Coaches is the third bus company in Wales to collapse in the past two months, with 300 jobs lost when Wrexham-based GHA Coaches went into administration in July and Pembrokeshire firm Silcox Coaches, ceasing trading after 134 years in June.	Some bus services in mid Wales facing the axe because the firm which runs them went into administration could be maintained, a council has said.
The men were believed to have been working on the northbound carriageway of the A361 at Gornhay Cross, Tiverton, when they were hit. One was flown to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, while a second Devon Air Ambulance flew the other man to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. The van driver has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving. The condition of the two injured men, who are both in their 40s, is not known. Devon and Cornwall Police said a third man was hurt in the incident, but he is described as the "walking wounded". The Barnstaple-bound carriageway is expected to remain closed for several hours and diversions have been put in place.	Two road workers have been seriously hurt in an accident involving a van in mid Devon.
Steven Tolley, 48, from Tiverton was one of three men injured while working on the northbound carriageway of the A361 at Gornhay Cross, Tiverton. He was airlifted to Derriford Hospital after the collision on 29 January but died on Monday. The driver, 43, from Saltash, was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and bailed until 20 May. Another worker in his 40s was airlifted to hospital for treatment for "serious injuries" and a third was described as "walking wounded". Both are now recovering at home. All three were employed by the South West Highways team which said it had informed its staff of the "sad loss" and was in touch with Mr Tolley's family. It added that there would be an internal investigation into the incident "as a matter of course". The police and the Health and Safety Executive are also investigating the incident. Anyone with information is urged to contact the police.	A road worker who was critically injured in a collision involving a van in mid Devon has died.
Russia was suspended by governing body the IAAF for state-sponsored doping in November 2015, a ban extended on Monday to cover the 2017 World Championships. Mutko, who was criticised by the IAAF on Monday, accepted "there were many abuses and breaches" but says "colossal work has been done" over the last year. Russia expects to be back by November. A return to competition will require the reinstatement of the national drug-testing agency, which remains suspended over various allegations of covering up doping. Mutko - who assumed his role in October - has been outspoken since the McLaren report alleged there had been a state-backed Russian doping programme. In January he said female doping results can be distorted if athletes have had sex in the days leading up to a test. But on Monday he said: "Athletes broke the rules and many coaches don't understand how to work without doping and it's high time for them to retire." Russia will miss the World Championships which begin on 4 August in London, but some athletes from the country could compete in London under a neutral banner. The IAAF is so far considering 35 applications from athletes, who could be included if they can show a record of independent drug-testing by agencies other than the suspended national body. Russian track federation vice president Andrei Silnov said he was against the inclusion of neutral athletes in principle but also questioned if the country's problems were as bad as the IAAF outlined. "It's all being solved, slowly but surely. We're doing what we need to do," Silnov said. `"They say we have a culture of doping. What culture of doping?"	Russian coaches who "do not understand how to work without doping" should "retire" says the country's deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko.
Bomb disposal officers were sent to Birmingham's Lee Bank area on Friday and nearby roads were closed and cordoned off. The men, two aged 32 and 37 were arrested in Stoke-on-Trent and three others, aged 18, 24 and 28, were arrested in Birmingham. Magistrates granted police a further seven days to question the men. Detectives from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit appeared before London's Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Saturday to submit their request for a warrant of further detention, a spokesman said. The men were arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Ch Supt Sue Southern, from West Midlands Police, said: "The arrests of the five men were intelligence led and our investigation continues at full pace." A number of properties in the Stoke and Birmingham areas have been searched as part of the investigation. The BBC understands the force was dealing with two suspect devices that were found at a business in Lee Bank on Friday.	Police have been given more time to question five men arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.
It was believed the Irish Army had removed all the wreckage at the time but a group of aviation historians and Queens University Belfast archaeologists thought otherwise. After ground surveys pointed to parts being present just four meters below the surface, a number of items were excavated on Saturday. These included the cockpit door. The pilot - Gordon Hayter Proctor - had safely bailed out of the plane on the northern side of the border after his instruments froze. It glided on before crashing in a field in Figullar, Emyvale, on 20 November 1942. The plane, which had seen action in the Battle of Britain, was considered "war-weary" and had been assigned to a weather-monitoring squadron operating out of RAF Aldergrove in Antrim in 1942. Project organiser Jonny McNee told the BBC the dig had "exceeded expectations" and they had recovered "Monaghan's Battle of Britain forgotten heritage". The aviation historian said they had unearthed internal parts of the Rolls Royce engine and plates inscribed with information, such as manufacturing details. "The cockpit door was a bit of a surprise," he said. "The last person to use it was Flt Lt Gordon Hayter Proctor who was later declared missing while serving in Burma. "He has no grave and now he will be remembered in a bit of Monaghan. The display will be homage to him". He added that the team would love to make contact with any of his family members. Mr McNee said they knew more than 90% of the plane had been taken away at the time and probably scrapped. "We had done our research and by looking at the Irish Army military archives, we knew that a substantial amount of the plane was taken away," he said. "Back in September we applied for and were granted a licence to use ground-penetrating radar which detected the impact crater and showed sizable metallic remains." Pupils from three schools - two in Monaghan and one in County Londonderry, had been invited to help out at the dig, which also attracted the attention of many locals. Josie McCusker, who remembers seeing the Spitfire fall from the sky all those years ago, stayed for the entire duration of the dig. "It was the morning, a Sunday morning and I remember the loud noise of it," she told BBC Radio Ulster. "My father was milking cows in the byre and he heard the noise and he ran into the house thinking it was on fire. "We then discovered it was a plane - it took the tops off the trees and a piece of it fell down in a gooseberry bush behind the house. "I remember much of the plane being removed by the Army, and remember seeing it on a lorry." The job now is to clean, sort, identify and catalogue the items before handing them to the County Monaghan Museum, which will then be able to claim it has artefacts from the only Battle of Britain Spitfire to be legally excavated in Ireland.	Remnants from an RAF Spitfire plane which crashed into a field in County Monaghan in 1942 have been recovered.
Another 130 people were wounded in what authorities said was a "premeditated, violent terrorist attack". Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought Xinhua said. City officials said evidence implicated militants from the western region of Xinjiang, but this was not verified. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have sent condolences to the victims and their families. President Xi urged "all-out efforts" to investigate the attack. "Severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance," Xinhua quoted the president as saying. Witnesses said that the men, who were mostly dressed in black, attacked people at random. A survivor named Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the back and chest, told Xinhua he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers rushed into the station. "I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone," he said. He added that those too slow to flee were cut down. Some who escaped were desperately looking for missing loved ones. Yang Ziqing told Xinhua she and her husband had been waiting for a train to Shanghai "when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them". "I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,"  she said. Social media users in China posted pictures of the attack on the internet, but correspondents say they are being taken down. Images seen by the BBC show men and women lying on the floor in pools of blood following the attack. Kunming officials, quoted by Xinhua, later said that evidence at the scene showed it was "a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces". Xinjiang is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group which has a long history of discord with Chinese authorities. State broadcaster CCTV said top security official Meng Jianzhu would travel to Kunming to oversee the handling of the investigation.	An attack by knife-wielding men at a railway station in Kunming in south-west China has left at least 29 dead, the state news agency Xinhua says.
Severnside Provisions, of Leeway Industrial Estate, was also ordered to pay £400,000 at the city's crown court on Friday. Directors Anthony O'Sullivan, 47, and Martin Lincoln, 46, were given 24-week terms after admitting 12 offences. An investigation was launched in December 2013. In a statement, Newport city council said the pair were warned in 2010 that their company was not permitted to carry out turkey processing. However, it said records showed that large quantities of meat was sold by Severnside Provisions in 2011, 2012 and 2013. After an investigation started, environmental health officers found large quantities of turkey defrosting outside in dirty water and being processed in a garage in "unhygienic conditions". Items seized were destroyed but the Food Standards Agency launched a national recall after finding turkeys had already been sold to butchers' shops and restaurants. The council said O'Sullivan and Lincoln had admitted 12 food hygiene offences, including that they sold food that was unsafe and failed to keep equipment clean. As well as being jailed, the two directors were ordered to pay a confiscation award of £271,815 under the Proceeds of Crime Act and council costs of £35,185. The company was also fined £100,000. Newport councillor Bob Poole said: "This company was putting people's health at serious risk for the sake of profit."	Turkey processing firm bosses have been jailed after leaving large amounts of meat defrosting in dirty water before selling it, Newport council has said.

The US says there has already been a decrease in violence in the city, where dozens have died in clashes this week. The Syrian military said it would abide by a 48-hour ceasefire starting from 01:00 Thursday (22:01 GMT Wednesday). The US and Russia brokered a nationwide cessation of hostilities in February but it has come under severe strain. The agreement does not include so-called Islamic State nor the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. US Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed the new agreement. "We expect all of the parties to the cessation of hostilities to fully abide by the cessation in Aleppo. That means the regime and the opposition alike," he said. US state department spokesman Mark Toner said the cessation of hostilities had actually started early on Wednesday, adding: "There has been a decrease in the fighting, in the violence... specifically in Aleppo, but it has not been, of course, complete." UN envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura said a failure of the overall cessation of hostilities would be "catastrophic" and could see 400,000 more people heading for refuge at the Turkey border. The fighting in Aleppo early this week has been the most intense there for more than a year. Dozens of people were reported to have been killed in fierce clashes, with almost 300 dead over the past two weeks. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels advanced into government-held western districts on Tuesday night but were pushed back by Wednesday morning. A coalition of rebel groups fighting under the name "Fatah Halab" (Aleppo Conquest) launched the assault on the government's defensive lines in the west of the city on Tuesday by detonating a tunnel bomb, the AFP news agency reported. Intense gun battles, air strikes and artillery attacks went on through Tuesday night. UN humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland complained later on Wednesday that the government was still refusing to allow aid deliveries to hundreds of thousands of people in besieged areas of Syria, including rebel-held eastern Aleppo. Russia meanwhile said it had withdrawn about 30 aircraft from its airbase in Syria. The Russian military began the withdrawal of most of its forces from Syria in March, six months after launching an air campaign to bolster President Bashar al-Assad.	A partial, shaky truce between Syria and non-jihadist rebels has been extended to the embattled city of Aleppo, after US and Russian pressure.
"No-one will face a cliff edge," Theresa May said at a Brussels summit. A new "UK settled status" will grant those who have spent five years in the UK equal rights on healthcare, education, benefits and pensions. Guaranteeing EU citizens' rights is the top priority for the EU delegation negotiating Brexit. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). There are two other thorny issues that have to be resolved early on - the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. An estimated 3.2 million EU citizens live in the UK and there is much nervousness - some even fear deportation. Mrs May sought to reassure the UK's 27 EU partners, saying the UK "does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up". Her Brexit statement took up little of the summit's time. There was no debate as the EU is anxious to avoid any splits emerging. The UK election left Mrs May seriously weakened, heading a minority government, which has fuelled uncertainty about the whole Brexit process. The UK's exit deadline is 30 March 2019. A cut-off date for obtaining "UK settled status" is yet to be announced. EU citizens who settle in the UK before Brexit will get a grace period to reach the five-year minimum for residency - but only if they arrive before the cut-off date. There are categories of people whose status may remain unclear, such as children, carers, students and Irish citizens. Ireland has a special relationship with the UK, including a Common Travel Area. The UK is anxious to start negotiating a new trade deal soon, but the EU has already won the argument that its Brexit priorities must be addressed first. As the summit got under way, European Council President Donald Tusk emphasised that the door to the UK staying in the EU was still open. Quoting John Lennon's Imagine, he said: "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one." Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that as an Anglophile, "I hate Brexit from every angle." "It is crucially important we know what Britain wants from Brexit," he warned. The Netherlands is one of the UK's closest EU allies, with a similar stance on free trade. Mrs May has vowed to take the UK out of both the EU single market and the customs union. But there are many voices - including in her Conservative Party - pressing for a softer approach. "I hope we'll come to some form of continued [UK] membership or relationship with the internal market," Mr Rutte said. "I absolutely believe the UK will be hit in the economy and the pound very hard." Counter-terrorism has also been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. The 28 leaders agreed to put legal pressure on internet giants like Google, Twitter and Facebook to remove jihadist content faster and more proactively. Mr Tusk said the bloc was calling on social media companies to do whatever was necessary to prevent the spread of terrorist material and was prepared to pass new legislation. "This means developing new tools to detect and remove material automatically," he said. The EU wants the industry to help tackle the problem of attackers slipping under the radar by using apps with end-to-end encryption.	EU citizens legally resident in the UK will be entitled to the same rights as British citizens after Brexit, the UK prime minister has told EU leaders.
A 67-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident on the A7, a mile north of Stow. She had been driving a Volkswagen Polo which overturned after being involved in a collision with an Audi A6 at 16:35 on Tuesday. Police said a 95-year-old woman, who was one of two female passengers in the Audi, later died from her injuries at a hospital in Edinburgh. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said a driver and a passenger were trapped in one of the cars when they arrived at the scene. He said they were helped by a passing nurse, who administered oxygen to one of the casualties, before paramedics arrived and the injured people were removed from the vehicle. Police said the male driver of the Audi and a second passenger in his car were taken to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh but they did not sustain life-threatening injures. Police closed the road for six hours following the crash and have appealed for information from witnesses. Sgt Brian Smith said: "Tragically, this incident has resulted in the death of two women and we are now working to establish exactly what happened. "I would ask that any motorists who were on the A7 near Stow yesterday and have information that can assist with our investigation contacts police immediately."	Two woman have died following a head-on road crash in the Borders.
A new website has been launched for farmers to find practical advice on dealing with the disease on their land. A five-point biosecurity action plan and poster campaign are also included in the initiative. The measures are being promoted by organisations such as Defra, the Animal and Plant Health Agency and the National Farmers' Union. Recommended actions include asking for a herd's TB history before buying cattle, and taking steps to minimise wildlife access to cattle, their feed and housing. Speaking at the launch of the campaign at Hartpury College in Gloucestershire, Farming Minister George Eustice said "good progress" is being made to  eradicate TB in England. However, he said reducing the risk of disease entering a farm is a "crucial element" to end the "devastation" it causes for farmers and rural communities. "There are simple and practical ways for farmers to reduce risk to their herds and neighbouring businesses from bovine TB which are set out in this new action plan approved by vets and farming experts," he added. Mr Eustice encouraged all cattle farmers to visit the new website and "think about the actions they could take to make a difference to improving the security of their herd". Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease of cattle and is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which can also infect and cause TB in badgers, deer and other mammals. Badgers, which some claim transmit TB to cattle, have been subjected to culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire for three years running. A pilot cull in Dorset is also being held this year. According to Defra, about 30,000 cattle were slaughtered in Great Britain in 2014 because of bovine TB.	The government has unveiled new tools and advice for farmers as part of a fresh campaign to tackle bovine TB.
The versatile 27-year-old has signed a three-year contract and will make his 150th appearance for the Rugby Park club when he makes his second debut. Hamill played at right-back under Mixu Paatelainen at Rugby Park before being used more in midfield while at Hearts. However, his three-year spell at Tynecastle ended after the administration-hit club were relegated from the Scottish Premiership. In her first act as Hearts' new owner, Ann Budge dispensed with the services of Hamill and the club's other two most experienced players, Jamie MacDonald and Ryan Stevenson, along with Gary Locke and his management team. Ayrshire-born Hamill had come through Kilmarnock's youth ranks and was capped for Scotland at Under-21 level. "We are delighted to confirm that Jamie Hamill will be returning to Rugby Park after signing a deal which will keep him at the club until 2017," a Kilmarnock statement confirmed.	Jamie Hamill has returned to Kilmarnock after his summer release by Hearts.
She was discovered by soldiers investigating suspected members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram. Nigeria's military said the young woman is undergoing medical checks. A total of 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram from the town of Chibok in April 2014. About 200 of them are still in captivity. More than 20 were released in October in a deal brokered by the International Red Cross. Others have escaped or been rescued. Over Christmas, 21 of the young women freed under the October deal returned home for the first time. However, family members told the BBC that they were kept in a politician's house and barred from going to their family homes. A statement from the office of state governor Kashim Shettima acknowledged that "armed soldiers... escorted the 21 girls to Chibok and remain their strict guards throughout Christmas". Who are Boko Haram? Chibok girls 'denied family Christmas' Torment of a freed Boko Haram 'bride' Prior to this, the girls had reportedly been held in a secret location for debriefing by the Nigerian government. Two weeks ago, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said the army had driven Boko Haram's militants from the last camp in their Sambisa forest stronghold in north-eastern Nigeria. "The terrorists are on the run and no longer have a place to hide," Mr Buhari said in a statement. Boko Haram has killed 15,000 people and displaced over two million during its seven-year battle to create an Islamic caliphate in the north-east of the country.	The Nigerian army says that one of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls has been found, along with her six-month-old baby.
Laws, 26, had been training with Arsenal but has decided to remain in the north east by swapping Sunderland for WSL 2 club Durham. She will fill in for regular goalkeeper Helen Alderson, who is going to Africa for a three-month charity work stint. "It's a club going in the right direction," Laws said. "I can't wait to start with a new club." She continued: "Obviously it is a bit strange for over 10 years but it's a challenge I'm looking forward to getting started with." The Newcastle-born keeper played 18 games for the Lady Black Cats last season, where she has played the majority of her career barring a loan spell at Liverpool in 2013.	Durham Women have signed England international goalkeeper Rachel Laws for the WSL Spring Series competition.
Carl Tremarco scored a well-worked goal on the break to give the visitors a half-time lead. That was extended early in the second period when Miles Storey's effort found the net via the post before Josh Meekings side-footed a third. Kris Doolan's consolation gave home fans something to clap but Jordan Roberts notched a fourth for Caley. It was an unusually abject performance from the Glasgow Jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left. Media playback is not supported on this device The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for Caley Thistle boss John Hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract Partick players. One of them is Steven Lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by Ryan Edwards. Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at Firhill since 16 January, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in Maryhill. Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo released Tremarco. At first it seemed the Englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot. Sean Welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving Owain Fon Williams in the Inverness goalmouth soon after. Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley Thistle immediately extended their lead when Meekings found Storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle. The Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon. When Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos. Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness. Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead. Richie Foran - who has had so many injury problems over the last two years - came on as a substitute and delivered a cross for Roberts to slam home at the back post and remind everyone which team had been in complete control.	Inverness Caledonian Thistle guaranteed Premiership safety by strolling to victory against Partick Thistle.
Part of Ysgol Glan Clwyd in Saint Asaph will be demolished in November, with new classrooms, assembly, music, drama and dining areas created. Work is aimed at meeting growing demand for Welsh-medium education. Denbighshire council's cabinet will be asked to approve awarding a contract for the work to Willmott Dixon.	A £15.9m Denbighshire school construction project is set to get under way after a firm was chosen to carry out the work.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 2014 European 100m champion held off the fast-finishing James Ellington and his friend and rival CJ Ujah in a showdown that lived up to expectations. Earlier his training partner Asha Philip won her third British 100m title to join him in the GB team for Rio. Tiffany Porter beat her younger sister Cindy Ofili in the 100m hurdles. The 28-year-old Dasaolu got out of his blocks well as Ellington was left, and held a metre lead at halfway. With Richard Kilty and Harry Aikines-Aryeetey struggling, and veteran Dwain Chambers never in the picture, Ujah seemed the only threat to the man who ran 9.91 seconds at these championships three summers ago. But Ellington came through late outside them to steal both second place and the second automatic Olympic place. A tailwind of three metres per second added a gloss to the times - 9.93 secs for Dasaolu, 9.96 for Ellington and 9.97 for Ujah - but with Britain's 200m men also in form, the GB sprint relay squad appears in excellent shape going to Brazil. "Seven guys on the line had the [Olympic qualifying] standard, so I knew that if I didn't finish top two, top three, my dream of going to Rio in the 100m was in jeopardy," said Dasaolu. "Top three under 10 seconds in the same race bodes well for the relay and for sprinting as a whole. Jamaica and America are out there, but if they make any mistakes we'll be nipping at their heels and ready to go for the gold." Find out about how to get into running with our special guide. In the absence of British record holder Dina Asher-Smith - focusing on the longer sprint this weekend - from the women's 100m, Philip upset pre-race favourite Desiree Henry as she dominated in 11.17 secs, with 19-year-old talent Daryll Neita taking second in 11.24 and Henry in third. Andy Butchart and Tom Farrell both sealed Olympic places in the 5,000m, while Sophie Hitchon confirmed her place in the hammer with a characteristically dominant throw and Holly Bradshaw did the same in the pole vault with a season's best clearance of 4.60m.	James Dasaolu ran a wind-assisted 9.93 seconds to win a thrilling battle of the British sprint kings and secure his place at his second Olympic Games.
Leader Brandt Snedeker, who had a share of the lead after the opening round, is on 12 under par - one clear of fellow American Kevin Kisner. Donald, five under par for the day, is 10 under, level with Americans Zach Johnson, Zac Blair and Chez Reavie. Snedeker was third at last week's Tournament of Champions in Hawaii. His short game helped him take the lead on day two as he holed out from 15 foot on his first hole, chipped in from 35 feet on his 12th, and then had a 20-footer at the next on the way to match Donald's five-under-par round of 65. "This is why we spend so much time away from our families as well as so much time on the golf course - to be in contention and have a chance to win at the weekend," he said. Fiji's Vijay Singh, 52, who is hoping to become the oldest winner on the PGA Tour, is four off the lead after a one-under round of 69. Singh had shared the early lead with Snedeker, Kisner, Ricky Barnes and Morgan Hoffman after the quintet all hit 63s in their first round. Padraig Harrington and England's Greg Owen are in a group six off the pace on six under but Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell missed the cut by six shots on three over after a 73 on Friday.	England's former world number one Luke Donald lies two shots off the lead at the halfway point of the Sony Open in Honolulu after a second-round 65.
The Executive Office said the move was made "to enable doctors to conduct a medical assessment". Mr McGuinness was due to join the first minister on the trade mission. A spokesperson said he was "fulfilling his responsibilities as deputy first minister working with his departmental political advisers". "There has been no disruption to the work of The Executive Office during this period," added the spokesperson. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said: "I'm sure everybody who values his work will send best wishes to Martin, Bernie and their family. "I met Martin as normal at Stormont on Monday. I have been in regular contact with him since and he is totally committed to fulfilling his duties."	Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness pulled out of a trip to China this week due to medical advice, it has been revealed.
Australian of the Year and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty said on Thursday the "unsafe" camps must close. Nearly 450 staff at Mr Turnbull's former university have also expressed concern about claims of torture by government employees and contractors. Australia intercepts all irregular boat migrants and holds them in camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Mr Turnbull has defended the rules, a central policy of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, by saying they are tough but save lives. In a letter to Mr Turnbull, Ms Batty said those detained in offshore centres needed care, instead of punishment. "The centres are, by their very design, unsafe and dangerous places. These centres cannot be patched up," she said. The academics, meanwhile, said there was "overwhelming" evidence that "repugnant acts" including torture and abuse had been carried out the camps. This week, the Australian Broadcasting Corp aired allegations made by a Somali woman who said she was raped by two men on Nauru - and that it took police on the Pacific island four hours to respond. Is Australia's Cambodia solution 'an expensive joke'? Australia's controversial asylum policy Mr Turnbull said the rape claims raised in the report were "very alarming", but defended the government's stance on border security. "The one thing we know is these policies, tough though they are, harsh though they are in many respects, actually do work, they save lives," Mr Turnbull said. "We're taking a number of steps to work closely with the Nauru government to ensure the safety and the security of all the refugees living in that community."	Australia's new PM Malcolm Turnbull is facing fresh calls to shut down offshore migrant detention centres.
However, that's at the heart of the media's frustration. The fact is the campaign has become a succession of tightly controlled photo opportunities... by all the main parties. This has become the hi-vis, hard hat election. It's been the predictable campaign gear for both David Cameron and George Osborne. No walkabouts. No risk of a verbal ambush by ordinary voters. But there's a fascinating side to this election where the campaign can offer raw politics, unplugged... where the voters engage with the politicians seeking their support. Election hustings have been one of the big successes of this general election. Magazine Monitor: Where did the word 'hustings' come from? There have been a record number of them held in churches, according to research by one Christian charity. I've been to a number of hustings so far and there's one reason why they work. The debates and exchanges are close up and often personal. Voters are able to question the politicians and get beyond some of the campaign sound bites and slogans. They also often highlight issues that are just overlooked in the "noise" of national campaigning. That was the case at a hustings at the All Nations for Christ church in the Normanton area of the Derby South constituency, where the audience were mostly from the city's African Caribbean communities. On the platform, representatives from all the parties, including Dame Margaret Beckett, who's defending a 6,000 Labour majority in Derby South. There were questions from the audience on immigration, Europe and schools. But one question particularly gripped the audience: Why were graduates from the African Caribbean communities three times more likely to be out of a job, six months after leaving university? The study was carried out by the Bow Group think-tank and Elevation Networks, a youth employment charity, and was based on interviews with 2,500 students over two years. It also found that black students were not being given the same opportunities as white students. One angry voice in the audience shouted: "That's outrageous and disgraceful". It got backing from the Greens. "That indicates there's some form of discrimination going on in the jobs market," said John Devine, the Green Party candidate for Derbyshire's Amber Valley. There was a suggestion from one questioner for employers to be forced by law to audit who and where they recruit staff. A precise solution perhaps required a precise response. But the Conservatives' Derby South candidate Evonne Williams tiptoed round this one. "It's something that we haven't considered but I'm happy to take it back to the party," she told the questioner. And Labour's Dame Margaret? "We're going to be looking at the Equalities Act to see if it needs modernising and updating. So your suggestion is exactly the kind of idea we will be looking at," she said. One platform speaker wanted to go much further. Lucy Care, the Lib Dem's candidate for Derby North, suggested that all job application forms should no longer include the person's name. "We would like to have name blank application forms," she said. "So all you read is their experience and what they've done. Often the name of the applicant can deter some employers from short listing or recruiting." As for UKIP's Derby South hopeful Victor Webb, he didn't completely rule out having such a recruitment audit, but: "I wouldn't do this because of the burden of cost and regulation on small businesses." For this hustings audience, maybe no instant solutions but they got the politicians thinking about their concerns. "The key is getting people engaged," said Marc Grant, the event organiser. "It's the first time we've held a hustings at the church." "We wanted to show why politics is so important to our daily lives and I'm really pleased so many  people came along." Whatever the outcome of this election, the locally organised hustings have emerged as a big campaign winner.	David Cameron has been telling reporters that this election campaign is not about photo opportunities but more about the UK's long term economic revival.
New head coach Paul Clement had confirmed club legend and former caretaker boss Curtis would no longer be involved with the first team. Curtis, 62, played more than 350 games for the Swans, has been caretaker manager three times and has also served the club as first-team coach. The new role will see him monitor players from the first team and Under-23s on loan at other clubs. Curtis will also assist the likes of scout Brian Flynn in the identification and recruitment of young players. The Premier League has made the loan player manager's role a requirement for all clubs. "I'm delighted to take up the new role," said Curtis. "It was an opportunity I jumped at following very amicable discussions. It's a very important role and one that excites me." Former Derby County boss Clement was appointed on Tuesday following the departure of Bob Bradley last week. Curtis was in charge for the 2-1 win at Crystal Palace, the day Clement's arrival was confirmed. Ex-Wales international Curtis has held a number of coaching roles with Swansea, and was appointed first-team coach by Michael Laudrup - a role he subsequently kept under Garry Monk, Francesco Guidolin and Bradley. The former Leeds and Southampton forward has previously been assistant manager, youth team manager and Football in the Community officer at Swansea. As a player he scored 32 goals during the club's promotion season in 1977-78 and was part of the team managed by John Toshack that won promotion to the old First Division in 1981. "While Alan has stepped away from a direct first-team coaching role, we felt it was imperative we kept him as part of our footballing structure and have his presence around the club and training ground," said Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins. "Not only does he have a wealth of knowledge and experience, he is respected throughout the game, not just in Swansea." Swansea have had as many as 12 players out on loan at one time this season. Bafetimbi Gomis (Marseille), Franck Tabanou (Granada), Kyle Bartley (Leeds United), Matt Grimes (Leeds United), Marvin Emnes (Blackburn), Ryan Hedges (Yeovil) Liam Shepherd (Yeovil), Josh Vickers (Barnet) and Josh Sheehan (Newport) are currently on loan, while Connor Roberts (Bristol Rovers), Kenji Gorre (Northampton) and Adam King (Southend) have recently returned.	Swansea City have named Alan Curtis as the club's first loan player manager.
Some 563 were held or arrested by Port of Dover police officers last year - up from 148 in 2013, a BBC Radio Kent Freedom of Information request shows. The figures come days after dozens of migrants attempted to storm the Channel Tunnel's Calais terminal. The Home Office said it was providing funding to bolster security and that many crossing attempts had been foiled. The FoI shows 46 illegal immigrants were detained or arrested at Dover - one of the main gateways to Britain - between January and April this year. The number of detentions and arrests is also up significantly from 2012, when 105 were held or arrested. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan are camped at a site dubbed "the Jungle II" near the Port of Calais. French aid workers have reported a "catastrophic" situation there. Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett, who recently visited Calais, said migrants are going to great lengths to cross the Channel. He told Radio Kent: "They think it's a great place to be and (Britain's) their target. They will do anything they possibly can to get into the UK." Last week, Channel Tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the French side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board UK-bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the Calais area was the "highest ever". Hauliers have been advised by the Freight Transport Association not to stop within about 60 miles (97km) of Calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles. Responding to the latest figures, a Home Office spokesman said 40,000 attempted illegal crossings of the Channel had been foiled last year. He added: "We are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern France and Belgium, including a Â£2m upgrade of detection technology, a Â£1m extension of dog searching capacity and Â£12m to reinforce security at Calais and other ports. "During the current period of disruption to cross-Channel services, Border Force has put its contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained. "We have deployed additional Border Force staff and sniffer dogs in northern France as well as bolstering screening checks at Dover for both tourist and freight vehicles." The Port of Dover Police is a non-Home Office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, Dover Harbour Board. Port of Dover Police is not responsible for border security, which is down to the Border Agency and Kent Police frontier operations.	There has been a large increase in the number of illegal immigrants detained or arrested by police at Dover.
Led by fire officer Dave Curry, the team created a giant Indian bread, weighing 26kg (57lb 5oz) and measuring 3.79m (12ft 5in) by 1.4m (4ft 7in). The cooking feat, carried out at the Eastleigh Mela in Hampshire on 6 July, was confirmed as successful on Tuesday by the Guinness World Records. This beats the 2008 record naan, which weighed 9.5kg (20lb 15oz). That creation was cooked by Loblaw Companies Limited in Brampton, Ontario, Canada and measured 2.89m (9ft 6in) by 1m (3ft 4in). Mr Curry said they were "absolutely thrilled" to have the record confirmed. "We were also able to raise several hundred pounds for charity through selling the naan at the Eastleigh Mela," he said. "As well as being a record-breaker, it tasted good too as it quickly sold out." The Hampshire firefighters' enormous naan bread, which was sold for Â£3 per portion with a curry, raised money for The Fire Fighters Charity, Water Wells Project and Hampshire Hurricanes. It was created with the help of Badi Mirchi and Sanjha restaurants.	A huge naan bread made by firefighters has been confirmed to be the biggest the world has ever seen.
That was just over over half of last year's haul, when the website auctioned a coffee meeting with the Apple boss. The money will benefit the Robert F Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. CharityBuzz declined to reveal the winner, who will get a one-hour lunch with Mr Cook at Apple headquarters (cost of travel not included). Mr Cook also added a second prize on Twitter, which will give the winner a VIP seat at an upcoming Apple event. CharityBuzz had estimated the value of the lunch date at around $100,000. Part of the reason for the lower price tag could be that CharityBuzz implemented a finance authorisation requirement for anyone wishing to bid on the auction. But while appetite for a bite with Mr Cook may have cooled (or Silicon Valley lovers might just prefer a well-brewed cup of coffee), his stock, much like Apple's, remains high. An auction for a similar lunch date with former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke took in just over $70,000, and a still-open auction for a coffee date with AOL boss Tim Armstrong - which also includes a tour of HuffingtonPost Live and a taped interview - currently has zero bids. Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, was one of the first to popularise a "lunch with the boss"-style charity auction 14 years ago. Last year, lunch with the "oracle of Omaha" sold for more than $1m on eBay, off the record $3.5m winning bid in 2012.	A lunch date with Tim Cook has sold for close to $330,000 (£196,000) on the auction website CharityBuzz.
The six male athletes also said they engaged in disruptive behaviour. The admission follows a report that assessed Australia's poor swimming performance at the London 2012 Games which pointed to a "toxic" team culture. Swimming Australia said the swimmers will face an inquiry panel. Stilnox, used to treat insomnia, is not considered a performance enhancer and is not a banned substance, but the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) put it on the prohibited list ahead of the Games. In their statement, the six members of the men's 4x100 freestyle relay team said the prescriptions "were filled in Australia before their departure to their staging camp in Spain and prior to the AOC's announcement the drug was (prohibited)". But they "acknowledge that at the time Stilnox was consumed it had been recently prohibited for use". "We stand here collectively to confirm that we did take part in a bonding exercise during which members of the relay team took Stilnox," the six swimmers said. "We acknowledge by our recent action in continuing a recent tradition in the Australia swim team, we have let ourselves down and the people who have supported us." All but one team member took the medication, they said. Then they engaged in pranks they described as "childish" and "stupid", such as knocking on the doors of other athletes and making phone calls. They said they were asleep by 22:30. "I think one of the reasons I agreed to go along with it was all the pressure I was under," one of the swimmers, James Magnussen, said. "Completely inappropriate in hindsight." The relay team, nicknamed Weapons of Mass Destruction before the Olympics, came in fourth in the event, in which they had been expected to deliver a medal. Magnussen, a favourite to win the men's 100 metres freestyle, won a silver. Their admission follows the release of a review of the sport after the country's worst Olympic swimming performance in two decades. It found that amid a lack of leadership a "toxic" team culture developed that led to bullying and misuse of prescription drugs, and that standards and discipline were "too loose". Australia's swimmers won just one gold medal at London 2012, far short of previous medal hauls at other recent Olympics.	Members of Australia's Olympic swimming team said they used the sleeping medication Stilnox during a "bonding" session before the Games last year.
Some 66 Israelis - all but two of them soldiers - have also died in the mission to destroy rockets and tunnels used by the militant Islamist group Hamas. What do we know about who died and where they were killed? According to figures from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), up to 6 August, 1,890 Palestinians had lost their lives in the conflict. Note: Figures up to 6 August Read more Among the dead were 414 children and 87 men and women over the age of 60. The youngest to be killed was 10 days old, while the oldest was 100. While the UN puts the number of militant dead below 200, Israel claims about 900 Palestinian militants were killed in the fighting. Palestinians were killed right across Gaza - a strip of land 40km (25 miles) long and 10km wide. The highest numbers lost their lives in Khan Younis, in the south of Gaza, and Gaza City in the north. Many took refuge in shelters run by the United Nations, including schools. However, these UN schools also came under fire, including in North Gaza, Jabaliya and Rafah. Meanwhile, two Israeli civilians were killed - one near Dimona and the other near the Erez border crossing into northern Gaza; and a Thai farm worker was killed in Netiv Haasara, which borders Gaza. Produced by Christine Jeavans, Lucy Rodgers, Gerry Fletcher and Laura Cantadori Correction 15 October: Locations of the deaths of civilians in Israel have been changed after being incorrectly reported in an earlier version.	Almost 1,900 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed since the launch of Israel's Operation Protective Edge at the beginning of July.
The newly crowned Women's Super League champions took the lead when Fran Kirby skipped past her marker and hit a sweet strike from the edge of the area. The visitors' best chance fell to Kelly Montgomery just after the break, but she volleyed over the bar. Glasgow keeper Lee Alexander also saved well from Millie Bright and Ana Borges. England striker Kirby had netted twice in the 4-0 win over Sunderland that sealed Chelsea's first league title on Sunday, and proved to be their matchwinner again with her 39th-minute effort. Glasgow, who reached the quarter-finals of the competition last season, struggled to create chances but were left to rue Montgomery's miss. The lively Kirby shot wide after escaping from a crowd of defenders as Chelsea pushed for a second, and after denying Bright and substitute Borges, Alexander did well late on to hold another rising strike from Kirby, giving the Scottish league champions hope for next Wednesday's second leg in Glasgow. Chelsea Ladies boss Emma Hayes told BBC Sport: "To win 1-0 at home with a clean sheet, for the first time (in Europe) in Chelsea's history, we have to savour these moments. "Overall it was a good performance. "If it wasn't for their goalkeeper, we'd be talking about at least a two-goal lead tonight." Glasgow City boss Scott Booth told BBC Sport: "I thought we were excellent. We came here to do a certain job and I couldn't have asked any more of my players. "We came up against some of the best players in the world. We more than matched them at times. "We were undone by a moment of brilliance from Kirby. I'm looking forward to the away leg, because we're still in this."

South Oxfordshire District Council's headquarters in Crowmarsh Gifford, was one of three properties wrecked in blazes on Thursday. Vale of White Horse District Council, which shares the building, said 72 staff would work from its Abingdon office. A 47-year-old man has been charged with arson and is in custody. About 400 people normally work at the fire-damaged council site. A spokesman said from Monday, the housing team would be running as normal, along with waste collections, street cleaning and leisure centres. Oxfordshire chief fire officer Dave Etheridge, said the county had faced its "biggest challenge" in more than a decade when the fires broke out. He said: "We had gale force winds, coupled with freezing temperatures, coupled with a huge fire - absolutely one of the most challenging nights we've had in Oxfordshire." At their peak, 27 crews tackled three blazes at the offices, an undertakers and a thatched cottage, which all started shortly after 03:00 GMT. The councils, which share a number of services, said a skeleton staff of 40 people worked from temporary accommodation last week. A spokesman said it would take about a week to restore the authorities' IT systems. He said: "Some parts of our website work on systems that we are still restoring and might not work as normal, for example online application forms and reporting. Also, as our phone service isn't completely restored, some phone numbers may not work. "So, we're kindly asking residents to please only get in touch if they have a genuine emergency. "Once our basic services are up and running, we will then turn our attention to expanding those services and establishing a long-term location for all of our staff." A helpline has been set up for urgent enquiries.	Some council staff have returned to work after a major fire destroyed their offices.
The visitors went close after 15 minutes when Reuben Reid forced Matt Macey into a save at his near post. Luton threatened sporadically in the opening half hour, Jonathan Smith volleying over and Jordan Cook narrowly missing the target with a 30-yard free kick. Exeter goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik made a fine save to keep out Jack Marriott's header, before Hylton missed the follow-up. After the break, Reid's close-range shot was blocked by defender Alan Sheehan, with the striker then firing woefully over the top from eight yards. The visitors took the lead just before the hour mark when Jack Stacey teed up Jake Taylor to calmly beat Macey. Luton pressed for an equaliser and after Ollie Palmer saw his effort cleared off the line by Luke Croll, the substitute crossed for Hylton to power a header home in the 68th minute. Hylton had an effort ruled out for offside, while Macey denied Ollie Watkins at the other end as neither side were able to find a winner. Report supplied by the Press Association.

Ward was on loan with the Terriers from Liverpool in the Championship and does not want to leave after his penalty shoot-out heroics helped take them up. The 23-year-old's saves helped them beat Sheffield in the semi-final and Reading in the play-off final. "On a selfish point, yes, I would like to stay at Huddersfield," said Ward. "I am only young for a goalkeeper and to have a chance of playing week-in week-out in the Premier League would be good experience for someone of my age." Ward accepts Liverpool will decide his future as they contemplate a season in which they return to the Champions League, but he would prefer regular games with Huddersfield to the likelihood of sitting on the Reds' bench. "It's in the hands of Liverpool because ultimately I'm their player," said Ward. "They've got to decide what's best. "Liverpool have my contract and their needs come first, especially with the Champions League." Ward and his Wales team-mates are preparing for Sunday's 2018 World Cup Pool D qualifier against Serbia, but he is expected to be on the bench with Crystal Palace's Wayne Hennessey preferred. He will go into the game having been congratulated for his efforts with Huddersfield by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. "After the final he said, 'Congratulations and keep it up'," said Ward said. "His relationship with the Huddersfield manager David Wagner has been well documented and that's been good for me. "I know they were in constant contact and hopefully he (Klopp) has heard only good things."	Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward wants to remain at promoted Huddersfield after helping them rise into the Premier League.
The birds, which are native to southern Europe, set up nests by burrowing tunnels in the banks of Low Gelt Quarry, near Brampton. An RSPB viewpoint on the perimeter of the quarry has attracted more than 1,000 people in two weeks. The RSPB said all chicks had hatched and would fledge in the next few weeks. The pairs were discovered by a foreman, who noticed the colourful birds flying among the site's colony of nesting sand martins. They are expected to leave the nest in about four weeks. Two pairs successfully raised chicks on the Isle of Wight last year and previously in County Durham in 2002. An RSPB spokesman said they were "delighted" the birds had bred in the UK for a second consecutive summer. Bee-eaters can burrow up to 10ft (3m) and usually lay clutches of four to nine eggs.	Visitors have flocked to Cumbria to see two pairs of rare bee-eater birds which set up their home at a quarry.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Blues boss says his side have "almost" won the Premier League title after their 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge moved them 10 points clear at the top. United dominated possession and had more chances than the league leaders. Mourinho said: "We prepared for it to be like this. It was the game we wanted and expected." Chelsea will be champions if they win at Arsenal and Leicester in their next two matches, having beaten third-placed United with a first-half goal from Eden Hazard. Visiting manager Louis van Gaal said it was his side's "best display of the season" but Mourinho insists it was part of the game plan. "It was difficult, but less than you think," he said. "Control their direct football to Marouane Fellaini and control the wingers from making crosses on the inside foot. "When we know Wayne Rooney plays in midfield, we control his progression into the box. Control set-pieces and don't give away direct free-kicks as they have three specialists. "Wait for a mistake and score a goal. We were able to make their important players disappear. Nobody saw them. They were in our pockets." United went into the match knowing they needed to win for the first time in five league visits to Chelsea to have any realistic hope of winning the title. But, despite big celebrations at the end of the match, Mourinho was careful to point out his side are not champions yet. "We are not celebrating," he said. "Football is not about 'ifs' and 'almosts', it is about mathematics. When it is done, it is done, and until that moment we don't celebrate. "The celebration is because we have beaten one of the biggest clubs in the world. The celebration is because they have everything to win that game and the result is because of the work they did all week to prepare for this game. "I feel we are almost there but there are no 'almosts' in football."	Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said Manchester United's important players were "in our pockets" in a match that went "exactly" as they wanted.
A two-hour walkout on Friday by the examiners will be followed by a week of short strikes in the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). The Public and Commercial Services union said more will be held throughout June at the Department for Transport (DfT) head office and several agencies. The DfT said contingency plans were in place to keep vital services running. The PCS union said the planned closure of Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) offices would "wipe out the high quality face-to-face services these offices provide to the public and motor traders". The closure of eight of the UK's 18 coastguard stations would mean "the loss of life-saving local knowledge", it added. But the government said the changes to its coastguard provision would modernise the service. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: "With unemployment high and our communities suffering as a result of the government's cuts, ministers should be providing all the help they can to local economies that are crying out for support and investment. "Instead they're ploughing on with entirely unnecessary and unpopular cuts to vital transport services. "These strikes across the whole range of transport services form a major part of our ongoing fight against cuts to pensions, jobs and pay." The PCS said more than half of its members had backed walkouts with four out of five supporting industrial action short of a strike. Mark Peacock, head of BSM driving school, said: "Taking your driving test is a big day and can be nerve-wracking enough without the thought of strike disruption. "However, candidates who have chosen to keep their test booking for the afternoon of 8 June should still attend their test so it can go ahead if possible." The DfT said it was "disappointed" at the decision to strike while it was still in discussions with the union. The MCA said those striking would be staff responsible for co-ordinating rescues and "the rescuers themselves will continue to operate as normal". Helicopters would continue to fly and the RNLI would still send out its lifeboats, a spokeswoman added. Last week, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) staff voted to take industrial action over jobs and privatisation after a third of workers took part in the ballot. The PCS represents 55,000 members in HMRC, including tax advisers and call centre staff. The union says thousands of jobs face the axe over the next few years on top of 30,000 posts already lost since 2005. PCS members were involved in a 24-hour UK-wide strike by public sector workers last month over government changes to pensions. The union is one of the largest in the UK with around 250,000 public sector members.	Driving examiners and coastguards are to hold several strikes against plans they say will hit jobs and pensions.
Labour MP for Bassetlaw, John Mann, a Leave campaigner, said people voted to leave because of immigration, zero-hour contracts and job prospects and said a "divide in Britain" had been exposed. Mansfield voted most strongly to leave, with 70.9% backing Brexit. Rushcliffe, which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham, was the only area to vote for Remain. It saw the East Midland's highest turnout. Meanwhile, the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8%. Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city. Mr Mann said his party was "somewhat out of touch". "With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that's the divide in Britain," he said. Latest reaction and updates from Nottinghamshire Like large parts of England, Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union. The margin of victory in Bassetlaw, Ashfield and Mansfield was huge, with less than a third of people voting remain. Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham, which narrowly backed Brexit. Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain. Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9% for Leave and 42.1% for Remain. Conservative Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner, tweeted it was "a dreadful decision". "People like me were told you're scaremongering, we don't want to listen to the experts," she said. "All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate. We have made a very, very, very bad mistake." Labour MP for Nottingham North, Graham Allen, said David Cameron had "gambled with Britain's future" by calling for a referendum, saying people voted to leave "in protest" at the current government. Turnout was 81.5% in Rushcliffe - the highest in the East Midlands and the only council area to vote Remain. The vote was close elsewhere, including in Nottingham, where the split was 50.8% Leave, 49.2% Remain. Alice, a caller to BBC Radio Nottingham from the Carrington area of the city, said she felt "frightened of the future". "It potentially gives a mandate for a lot of prejudice against people who have immigrated here, whether from the EU or elsewhere," she said.	All but one council area of Nottinghamshire, including Nottingham city, has voted to leave the EU.
In September the 20-year-old opted to play for England over the Republic of Ireland and has been awaiting clearance from Fifa. Grealish played for the Republic at under-21s level but turned down a call-up to the senior squad for a friendly against England in June. Birmingham-born Grealish qualifies for the Republic through his grandparents. After an impressive first full year for Villa, Grealish has struggled this season, making only 17 appearances and scoring once. He has been struggling with an ankle problem and has not featured since coming on as a substitute against Manchester City in the FA Cup on 30 January.	Fifa has given Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish permission to play for England.
The bird, known officially as LF15, and her partner LM12 bred three chicks in both 2015 and 2016 at the Dunkeld reserve. Lassie arrived back in Scotland on 23 March, six days after her mate. Viewers from around the world have been watching the pair's progress on the Loch of the Lowes live webcam. Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, said: "LF15 has settled down to begin incubating, and we would expect the egg to hatch in about six weeks' time. "It's now clear that the pair's attempts at breeding have been a success and they are on track to repeat the hat-trick of chicks that were hatched in both 2015 and 2016."	A female osprey nicknamed Lassie has laid her first egg of the season at the Scottish Wildlife Trust's Loch of the Lowes nature reserve.
The Social Mobility Commission warns of many "treadmill families running harder and harder but standing still". It points to an unfair education system, a two-tier labour market, a regionally imbalanced economy and unaffordable housing. Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to tackle social inequalities. The commission's State of the Nation 2016 report, laid before Parliament on Wednesday,  says young families now can no longer expect to do as well as their parents' generation. It highlights that home ownership is in sharp decline, particularly among young people. The commission urges the government to commit to building three million homes over the next decade and to expand the sale of public sector land for new homes. It should also allow targeted housebuilding on green-belt land and modify the starter home initiative to focus on households with average incomes. Alan Milburn paints a depressingly familiar picture of a "them and us" Britain divided along the fault-lines of wealth and opportunity. But the conclusion of his report - most families are now doing worse than their parents' generation - is staggering. It means social mobility is going backwards not forwards, despite successive attempts to tackle it. Phrases such as: "Huge swathes of Britain feel left behind," and: "The chickens have now come home to roost," pepper the report. "So many families are struggling to get by, let alone get up," Mr Milburn said. He highlights that of the 65 parts of the country identified by his commission as "social mobility coldspots", only three voted to remain in the EU. Mr Milburn, himself immersed in issues surrounding the social mobility conundrum for six years, clearly feels the country's mood is now becoming dangerous. And with a nod to 1930s Europe, he told reporters:  "We know from the history of our own continent, when people feel they are losing out unfairly, the mood can turn ugly." The commission notes that a child living in one of England's most disadvantaged areas is 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged areas. And young people from low-income homes are one-third more likely to drop out of education than better-off classmates with similar GCSEs. The report says the government should have "as its core objective" the narrowing within the next decade of the GCSE attainment gap between poorer children and their better-off classmates by two-thirds. It also urges the government to rethink its plans for more grammar schools and more academies. The report says grammars are "at best, a distraction, and, at worst, a risk to efforts aimed at narrowing the significant social and geographical divides that bedevil England's school system". The report notes a growing gap between the generations, warning that those born in the 1980s are the first post-war cohort not to start their working lives on higher salaries than their immediate predecessors. It says the government must work with large employers, local councils and Local Enterprise Partnerships to bring high-quality job opportunities - backed by financial incentives - to Britain's social mobility "coldspots". The report also calls for an end to unpaid internships, arguing that work placements lasting more than four weeks should be paid at the minimum wage. The commission says the problem is not just social, but also geographical, with a widening divide between the big cities - particularly London - and the many towns and counties being "left behind economically and hollowed-out socially". It says that in London, the number of top-end occupational jobs has increased by 700,000 in the past 10 years compared with just under 56,000 in the north-east of England. The report warns: "The growing sense that we have become an us and them society - where a few unfairly hoard wealth and power - is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a society. "The EU referendum in June this year exposed deep divides that go well beyond the box that people crossed. "Public concern - even anger - about issues of identity, immigration and inequality found a voice on 23 June and a target to aim at. "Of the 65 parts of the country we identified as being social mobility coldspots - those with the poorest education and employment prospects - only three areas voted to remain in the EU." Other concerns raised by the report include: The chair of the Social Mobility Commission, Alan Milburn, said the rungs on the social mobility ladder were growing further apart. "It is becoming harder for this generation of struggling families to move up," he said. "Whole sections of society and whole tracts of Britain feel left behind. "As the EU referendum result showed, the public mood is sour and decision-makers have been far too slow to respond." Theresa May took over as prime minister in July with a promise to lead a "one-nation" government that worked for all, not just the "privileged few". Mr Milburn said the commission applauded her determination to further social progress but warned this was a "big ambition" and should be the "holy grail" of public policy. A government spokeswoman said ministers would  consider the recommendations in the report. "We want to make this a country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few - whether it's education, jobs, or housing, this means giving families more control over their lives  and doing more to help those who are just managing. "As the prime minister said on the steps of Downing Street, this government is committed to fighting injustice wherever it arises and ensuring that everyone in our country has the opportunity to go as far as their talents will take them." Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner  said the report should make "sobering reading" for the Conservatives. "Since they came to power in 2010, we have seen our country go backwards on the progress the Labour government made on social mobility," she said. "The educational attainment gap between lower-income children and their wealthier classmates is getting bigger, and these children still have little chance of going into high-level professions. "And under Theresa May we can expect more of the same: grammar schools for a select few, overcrowded classrooms for the many." The report was published as a survey of 1,655 British adults for the commission found nearly half believed where people ended up in life was mainly down to their background and parentage. Fewer than a third (29%) of people questioned thought Britain was a country where everyone could get as far as their talent and hard work would take them. One-third of those surveyed said they could not save any money each month.

Rees says they felt there was "no drama" trailing 14-7 at half-time. But defeat left Ospreys - and Welsh regional rugby - without a top-tier knockout place since 2010. And as they trail in the Pro12, captain Alun Wyn Jones admitted Ospreys face a tough task to make the 2016-17 tournament. They are currently seventh in the Pro12 table, four points behind Ulster, who occupy the sixth and final Champions Cup qualification place. Wales lock Jones said: "We have to focus now on a tough Six Nations period because we are currently not in a position to play in this competition this year." Hanno Dirksen crossed in the opening period against Exeter and Ospreys were awarded a penalty try that gave them late hope. But two tries apiece for Thomas Waldrom and James Short in addition to Kai Horstmann's opener saw off the visitors. Rees said Ospreys felt "pure disappointment" at failing to to take their opportunity to progress against the second-placed team in the Aviva Premiership. "We spoke at half-time that there was no drama, we could build our way into the game and create some pressure without overdoing it against Exeter," said Rees. "And I think we did that at the start of the second half, even at the end when we were 26-17 down. If we can negate their work in the 22 you'll get another shot and that potentially takes you through. "We knew all that. Al [Jones] was getting messages - he was pretty clear, but it's redundant anyway." Jones said: "It wasn't the ideal start. Two quick tries put us on the back foot, but in the same breath it was probably the best time to have them because we've got another 70 minutes to go. "Unfortunately we probably chased a bit too much. "We brought ourselves back into contention, but the game got away from us and and we had too much to do." Ospreys went into the final round top of Pool Two after earning two bonus points in defeats at Clermont Auvergne and Bordeaux-Begles and beating both French Top 14 teams and Exeter at their Liberty Stadium home. Jones said: "There's a lot of emotion involved in those performances we've had. We've probably lived off emotion and performed off emotion, but you can't really afford to do that in this competition. "I remember being away in London Irish in the same competition. We went out there with a team that was probably on paper far superior and had the same result, so I think Gruff has nailed it on the head with the word 'devastated'. "I said to the guys at the end that none of you in here [the media] said we would be in contention to get out of the pool and it's true. I remember doing the interview at the start of the season and somebody laughed, which is fine. "And it's not about defying the odds or proving other people wrong, it's about working for each other and trying to do something different. "We've made a point about all the big names that have gone through this jersey and not got ourselves in the position that we have. "Ultimately we've faltered again and we haven't done that [gone through], but I can say credit to the team and we're proud to have come so close."	Ospreys backs coach Gruff Rees says they were "emotionally devastated" at missing out on a European Champions Cup quarter-final by losing to Exeter.
A penalty try and scores from Alex Goode and Chris Wyles gave Sarries a 24-3 lead at half-time. The bonus point was wrapped up four minutes after the break as Maro Itoje crossed, shortly before Richard Wigglesworth touched down. Arthur Aziza went over for Oyonnax but Schalk Brits was awarded a late effort to complete the rout for Saracens. Aziza's try was a deserved consolation for the French side, who were committed and spirited in their first ever home game in the Champions Cup, but were outclassed by a Saracens team that sits nine points clear at the top of Pool One. The Premiership leaders dominated the scrum, until the introduction of a series of replacements in the second half upset their rhythm, and attacked with speed and purpose to signal their credentials as title candidates. New England head coach Eddie Jones will name his first squad next month, and there were plenty of performances from Saracens' English contingent that would have caught the attention of the Australian. But it was Farrell who stood out with creativity and quickness that belied his reputation as a defensive, pragmatic fly-half. The England number 10 crashed through a gap in the Oyonnax rearguard before swinging a looping pass out wide to Wyles, who slipped in Goode for the visitors' second try. And Farrell was central to the next score, popping up an offload from the ground to allow Will Fraser to find the on-rushing Wyles on his way to touching down under the posts. In fact, it may be 26-year-old Fraser who gave Jones the most to think about after this display. The uncapped open-side flanker was impressive with the ball in hand and could provide competition for the England number seven shirt, particularly with the future of England captain Chris Robshaw under scrutiny. Saracens can take a step closer to progressing when they host Oyonnax in the reverse fixture next weekend. Saracens full-back Alex Goode said: "We are really coming alive when we get the ball in good positions at the moment. "We are using our strike runners very well. We are getting them in the game and we are picking them out. "Guys like Chris Ashton are doing brilliantly in terms of the support lines they are running. "We have had a young team over the last few years and we have grown together and added layers to our game. "We have been close in this tournament before, we have our foundations, we are in a good place but we know there is a long journey ahead yet." TEAMS Oyonnax: Etienne; Tian, Bousses, Taufa, Codjo; Clegg, Cibray; Tonga'uiha, Maurouard, Pungea; Power, Fabbri; Ursache, Missoup, Wannenburg. Replacements: Lespinas for Clegg (51), Aziza for Cibray (51), M. Clerc for Pungea (53), Guillamon for Fabbri (63), Faure for Wannenburg (60). Not Used: Bordes, Rapant, Gunther.

Peers defied the government by backing calls to set up a joint parliamentary committee to look at the proposals. Lord Lawson and Lord Forsyth were among Conservative peers to rebel as the government lost by 320 votes to 139. Ministers have had to redraft plans to give English MPs an effective veto on laws deemed to apply to England only and to delay a vote amid opposition. The Conservatives made a manifesto commitment to give English MPs a decisive say over legislation exclusively affecting England but have run into trouble over the details of the plan and how it will be introduced. The plan is for a new Commons stage to be introduced for laws passing through Parliament with England's MPs asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting England before it passes to a vote of all UK MPs at third reading. Ministers say this will address the longstanding anomaly by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting England but English MPs have no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved. A similar process would be used, including Welsh MPs, where matters covered only England and Wales. But the SNP has said they will be excluded them from votes on matters affecting Scotland and create two classes of MP in the Commons while Labour has said the proposals are being rushed and need more detailed scrutiny. Peers have now backed calls by Lord Butler, the former cabinet secretary and crossbench peer, for a special committee of MPs and peers to look into the proposals in depth. Lord Butler said he backed the principle of requiring laws affecting England to have the consent of a majority of English MPs but there were better ways of approaching what has long been known as the "West Lothian question" "Surely it is more important to get the proposals right than to rush them through," he said. The vote does not bind the government unless the House of Commons also agrees to such a move. The Leader of the Lords, Lady Stowell, maintained that peers would get a debate on the plans in the autumn, but after 30 years of trying to find a solution to the problem of English-only laws it was time to take action. "There does come a point where we need to stop talking and get on with taking some action," she said.	The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over plans for so-called "English votes for English laws".
Webb has not played since suffering a serious foot injury in a World Cup warm-up with Italy in September. The 27-year-old says he is close to a return, giving him time to get fit before the Six Nations in February. "I'm back up and running now and going through a pre-season sort of stage at the moment. It's all coming along well," he said. "I'm going to take each week as it comes now and see where I am then. "It's been talked about [returning] at the beginning of February, but I did ask the physios if they could scrape a couple of weeks off that and they said 'yes'." Wales begin their Six Nations campaign away to Ireland in Dublin on Sunday, 7 February. Webb, capped 16 times by Wales, has renewed his national dual contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union. He turned down offers from elsewhere to stay at the region for whom he made his debut in 2007. "It's my home region and I enjoy the club," Webb told BBC Wales' Scrum V Live. "I want to put myself in the best possible position to play for my country and I'm not going to give that up that easy. "Wales and the Ospreys came together and I'm happy to get it done."	Wales and Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb expects to be back in action sooner than expected following injury.
More than 12,600 cases were discontinued from 2014 to 2015 - one in every eight Crown Court cases. At the same time, the proportion of Crown Court cases resulting in a conviction fell below the 80% mark for the first time since 2010-11. The CPS said cases were kept under "constant review". A study of the data suggested the principal reason for the fall in the proportion of cases resulting in conviction was because of the rise in the number that were dropped by the CPS after charges had been brought. The total number of cases dropped at that point was 12,615 last year - an increase of nearly 1,700 on the year before. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said: "In 70% of the dropped prosecutions, the CPS offered 'no evidence'. "In other words the case was discontinued at a late stage, after the defendant had pleaded not guilty, and often after many months awaiting trial." He added the figures "are likely to fuel claims that the criminal justice pendulum has swung too far in favour of victims and away from the accused". A CPS spokesman said: "All cases are kept under constant review as they progress through the criminal justice system. "If new evidence comes to light, a witness decides to no longer support a prosecution or a co-defendant pleads guilty to the offence, the CPS will then review the case. "If there is no longer sufficient evidence or if it is no longer in the public interest, the CPS will stop a prosecution." He added: "In 2014-15 the CPS offered no evidence in 8.8% per cent of cases. This compares to 8.3% the previous year and 9.4% the year before that." Nazir Afzal, former chief Crown prosecutor of the CPS for north west England, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We have to ensure that we don't have the baying crowd mentality. "There are lots of people who are desperate for cases to be brought for all sorts of reasons. "A prosecutor must look at it in the cold light of day, professionally, ensure that they recognise any issues about the credibility of the allegation and make the decision that stands up." He added: "The accused person needs to have as much information given to him about what happened. That would not necessarily make life any better for him but certainly give an understanding that maybe, just maybe, the decision was right at the outset and something has changed."	The number and proportion of prosecutions dropped at Crown Courts in England and Wales has risen to its highest level in five years.
The former London Irish man, 29, who can play in the second or back row, was injured in Friday's loss at Newcastle. "He really hurt his neck and he has got pins and needles in his arms and through his hands," director of rugby Todd Blackadder told BBC Points West. "So he could be out for a little while yet but it's hopefully not too serious. But to lose a big boy like that is an opportunity for someone else."	Bath forward Matt Garvey is to have surgery after sustaining a neck injury.
In a bid to promote password security, Strathclyde University produced a poster saying: "Bet Jennifer Lawrence wishes she'd used a StR0nG_Pas5w0Rd%." The image attracted criticism on social media, with the Glasgow-based university accused of "victim blaming". The university said the poster had been removed and should not have been made. An image of the poster was tweeted on Monday by Billy McCauley who said: "Pretty shocking victim blaming here. Will you take it down?" A short time later, Strathclyde University tweeted: "The posters are being removed now. They should not have produced and we are looking into how this happened." A spokesman for the university later said: "The posters are in bad taste and have now been removed from campus. The sentiment expressed is not consistent with the values of this university." Dozens of private pictures of Hunger Games actress Lawrence were released on the internet in September. Other celebrities targeted in the leaks included Rihanna, Kate Upton, Selena Gomez and Kim Kardashian. It is thought the photos were taken off the stars' iCloud accounts and were shared on other websites.	A university has withdrawn a poster which appeared to ridicule Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence after her nude pictures were leaked on the internet.
Natalia Wilkanowska, 50, disappeared in 2003 after travelling to visit her ex-husband Gerald Doherty in Luton. Her body was found in December 2015, Luton Crown Court was told. Mr Doherty's brothers, Joseph and Daniel, are on trial accused of helping conceal her remains and lying to police. The court heard Natalia was last seen by her children in April 2003 when she left her Eastbourne home to travel to Luton. Prosecutor Neil King said her ex-husband was responsible for her death. The couple had separated in 2001 after 23 years of marriage. Mr Doherty took his own life at a flat in Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, on their wedding anniversary in July 2003. He had been receiving psychiatric care. His two brothers, who both wore hearing loops in the dock, face a total of seven charges. Natalia's death came to light in 2014 when Joseph Doherty revealed Gerald had murdered her, but that her remains had been "chopped up". Mr King told the court Natalia's body was found a year later - intact - under rubble in the garden of Daniel Doherty's house in Icknield Way, Luton. She had suffered "a blunt force trauma" inflicted by a third party, but the cause of death could not be established. Read more on this and other Bedfordshire stories Mr King said Daniel Doherty, who worked as a builder, must have "connived in the deposition of the body". He said both men lied to the police and obstructed the coroner. Daniel Doherty, 67, of Icknield Way, Luton denies two charges of perverting the course of justice and two charges of obstructing the coroner, by aiding and abetting the concealment of a body and lying to police. Joseph Doherty, 73, of Old Greenock Road, Port Glasgow, denies perverting the course of justice and obstructing the coroner by giving a false account of her death. Both men also deny preventing lawful burial. The trial continues.	A woman's body lay under builders' rubble in a back garden for more than 12 years before it was discovered, a jury has heard.
The UK and Scottish governments and Dundee City Council have agreed a public service obligation (PSO) contract worth almost Â£3.7m. Loganair will continue to operate the route from 26 March. The service will see two return flights each weekday and one return flight on a Sunday. The UK Government will contribute 50% of the total funds, with the Scottish government putting in Â£1.4m and Dundee City Council providing Â£400,000 of funding. UK Aviation Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said: "I am delighted that Loganair will continue to operate this direct air service between Dundee and London Stansted for another two years. "Passengers and businesses will continue to benefit from the connectivity this route provides. It will further boost trade and tourism opportunities will continue to flourish in Scotland." Scotland's Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: "The award of this contract to Loganair is welcome news which provides continuity of service on this important route. "This flight not only provides a direct link to London, but also offers passengers a wide number of onward connecting destinations from Stansted. This will continue to benefit business and leisure travellers alike." Dundee City Council leader Ken Guild added: "Securing the route for a further two years through this latest PSO gives the council and its partners an opportunity to build on the service and attract other routes." The UK government funding is through the Regional Air Connectivity Fund, which aims to maintain connectivity between London and smaller regional airports, where routes are at risk of being withdrawn.	A new deal to secure the air link between Dundee City Airport and London Stansted for another two years has been announced.
Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer "concrete solutions". "We want someone who can speak for the royal family," he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. "We welcome it, we are ready for it," he said. "We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary." The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. "A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. "We had an agreement with the crown prince," he said. "The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue." Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was "hopeful" that he would "do more than his predecessor", Hillary Clinton. "US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more." On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. "If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. "It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. "So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy." Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for "peaceful demonstrations", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. "It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government." He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. "These people have a lot of followers in the street.  If they are not part of the dialogue than the dialogue will fail."	The leader of Bahrain's main opposition group, al-Wefaq, has called for the crown prince to attend talks aimed at ending nearly two years of unrest.
The scrum-half was allowed to return to the field after belatedly being sent for a head injury assessment. The group said Murray "did not meet the criteria for immediate and permanent removal from the field of play". Munster were not fond to have broken concussion management protocols. Ireland's Murray said he did not lose consciousness in the European Champions Cup game at Scotstoun on 14 January. In a statement on Wednesday, the EPCR Untoward Incident Review Group summarised its decision. "In the 62nd minute of the match, Murray went to ground following a tackle on an opposition player and was attended to by the Munster medical team. Following an on-pitch assessment, the player resumed play. "After real-time video footage of the incident was reviewed by the Munster medical team pitchside, the player was then temporarily removed from the field as part of the HIA process for further assessment, before subsequently returning. "After studying footage and documents submitted by Munster Rugby, the Review Group was satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Murray did not meet the criteria for immediate and permanent removal from the field of play. "The Review Group concluded that Munster's medical team and more specifically, their Team Doctor, followed the World Rugby Head Injury Assessment (HIA) protocol and used the MyPlayXPlay real-time video system that the club had invested in, to review the initial on-field assessment of the injury." Sale Sharks were cleared of wrongdoing by the Concussion Management Review Group (CMRG) for an incident involving back-row forward TJ Ioane in a Premiership game in January. However, Northampton were found to have breached rules by allowing Wales winger George North to play on after a head injury a month earlier.	Munster have been exonerated by the European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) over their management of a head injury sustained by Conor Murray against Glasgow in January.
It comes as a documentary, The Betrayed Girls is being shown on BBC One about nine Asian men jailed for grooming teenage girls in the town in 2012. Laura, who was abused by the gang from the age of 13 until she was 17, said the targeting of girls by Asian men was still going on in Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was "committed" to tackling abusers. Laura, whose identity is protected as a victim of a sex crime, told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire show said she was walking in Oldham town centre through an Asian community a couple of months ago. "I was still getting cars pulling over to me asking me if I wanted to go for a drink," said Laura. "It's not bothering them. I don't actually think they understand that they are doing something wrong." Nazir Afzal the north west's former chief crown prosecutor who brought the case against the Rochdale gang said five years on some victims nationally are still not being listened to. Mr Afzal overturned a decision not to charge nine men who ran the child sex exploitation ring. He said there have been "significant rises" in investigations and prosecutions into the crime and victims were more confident in reporting abuse and they are getting better support. However, he said: "Victim support groups nationally are still telling me victims are not being consistently listened to and told the case is too difficult to bring [to court]." He also said some victims of historical child sex exploitation were being told that police were focusing on current cases, too. Mr Afzal said agencies must be more proactive and more "collaborative working" was needed between the police, councils and other agencies and voluntary groups. GMP said it was "vital" they learnt the lessons from the past and it was "absolutely committed" to working with partners across Greater Manchester to tackle the sexual exploitation of children and young people. "We have been working tirelessly for many years to prevent this abhorrent crime from happening and provide support to victims and their families." Rochdale Council said public services "collectively failed" the victims but lessons have "been learnt from it". Steve Rumbelow, chief executive of Rochdale Borough Council, said: "Since 2012 the council and its partners have worked to make the changes needed, to increase knowledge, prevent harm, challenge those who wish to exploit children and better support victims and survivors." The documentary which features testimonies from victims for the first time follows a BBC One drama Three Girls.

The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a "short sharp" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people "did not see the strengths" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a "je ne regrette rien" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate what they were standing for. It will now hold a series of meetings across Wales as it tries to rally members for an election that it'll be able to fight unshackled of being in coalition government which was clearly a burden to many of them.	Another election is probably the last thing the public want to hear about after what we've just gone through but that's exactly what the parties at the assembly are gearing up for next year.
The fashion designer had told Yahoo that casting directors dressed Hadid in a poncho for a fashion show because she was not as thin as the other models. But he has now clarified his comments and said the story was misleading. Hilfiger said: "The suggestion that I thought [Hadid] wasn't thin enough upsets me to no end. Gigi is the epitome of perfection." In the Yahoo interview, Hilfiger referred to a 2015 fashion show in which Hadid wore a poncho which covered most of her body. Hilfiger said he wanted Hadid to be dressed in something which better showed off her figure, but members of his creative team disagreed. "Our casting director said, 'She doesn't really fit because you know she's not quite as tall as the other girls, she's not quite as thin,'" Hilfiger originally said. "So they put a red, white, and blue poncho on her. It covered a lot of her body unfortunately, but it received millions of hits." Hadid's appearance in the poncho proved hugely popular, and she later went on to collaborate with Hilfiger, launching her own line of clothing for the brand earlier this year. After Hilfiger's comments sparked criticism, the designer criticised the original story's headline as "misleading". Speaking to Page Six, Hilfiger said: "The casting people put Gigi in the poncho, and I was not happy. "I was saying, 'Don't hide her body.' Even though the poncho ended up being the best-selling piece, I was very unhappy." The designer also released a statement to Entertainment Tonight, in which he said he was "extremely proud" to have Hadid representing his brand. "Gigi is truly the definition of a 'Tommy Girl' - her magnetic personality is bright, confident and always optimistic," he said. "I've known her for many years, and am extremely proud to have her as the ambassador of my brand and as a collaborator of our collections. "Any statement to the contrary is completely false. The headline from the interview with Yahoo was misleading and has since been corrected."

Interior Minister Abdikarim Hussein Guled told the BBC that 15 people had been injured after a car exploded outside the Hotel Maka. The hotel lies on one of the capital's main roads, which the authorities say is usually safe. Islamist militant group al-Shabab was driven out of Mogadishu two years ago but often stages attacks in the city. The BBC's Ibrahim Mohamed Adan in Mogadishu says a loud explosion was heard in the city's administrative centre just before 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT). The Hotel Maka is on the Maka Mukaramah road which links the presidential palace to the airport, one of the most heavily guarded areas of Mogadishu. It is popular with members of parliament and other officials. One report stated that a senior Somali diplomat was among the dead. Our reporter says witnesses nearby told him they could see the wreckage of a car burning outside the hotel. Senior police officer Farah Aden told Reuters news agency that four policemen were among the six dead. The agency reported that four cars and two motorbikes were burnt out at the scene. A police officer told AFP news agency that he could see "several burning cars, dead and injured people on the ground" following the attack. Witnesses told the BBC there were actually two explosions; the car bomb detonated after a smaller device planted in a laptop computer went off inside the hotel's reception area. The bombings came as Somalia's football season kicked off on Friday evening with a first division match at the newly refurbished Banadir Stadium in northern Mogadishu. It was the first time in more than 22 years that thousands of fans had been to the stadium. Correspondents say there was much excitement in the city in anticipation of the match at Banadir Stadium, which has Somalia's first artificial grass pitch. The Somali government is fighting al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, for control of the country. The militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers, which is backing the government. But the Islamist group still controls many towns and rural areas of southern Somalia. In September, the group said it was behind the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in which at least 67 people died during a four-day siege.	At least six people have been killed after a suspected suicide attack at a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.
They said the Syrian government had failed to respect the 1 June deadline for widespread aid distribution agreed by world and regional powers. Only a small amount of aid was delivered on Wednesday and a convoy to the town of Darayya near Damascus did not carry food. The UN Security Council will meet on Friday to discuss the air drops. Syrian town in 'extremely dire' state What's left of Syria? US State Department spokesman John Kirby said hundreds of thousands of Syrians needed "sustained and regular" access to aid. He said the UN food agency, the World Food Programme, had briefed the US on how the air drops could be carried out. Meanwhile British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond described the limited access for aid allowed on the day of the deadline agreed by the International Syria Support group (ISSG) as "cynical". "While air drops are complex, costly and risky, they are now the last resort to relieve human suffering across many besieged areas," he said. The US and UK called on Russia and Iran, which back the Syrian government, to use their influence to ensure the air drops could proceed safely. Russia said the arrival of Wednesday's aid convoys was a positive step. The ISSG, co-chaired by the US and Russia, comprises 17 world and regional powers, as well the Arab League, the European Union and the United Nations. In April, the UN said at least 4,000 people were besieged in Darayya by Syrian government forces, which have surrounded the suburb for four years. The Darayya convoy - the first since November 2012 - contained vaccines, baby milk, medicine and nutritional goods. Separately, the rebel-held town of Muadhamiya, north-west of Darayya, received deliveries of food parcels and wheat flour on Wednesday, a month since aid convoys last visited. Darayya's electricity supply was cut off more than three years ago. UN emergency relief co-ordinator Stephen O'Brien said in April that the Syrian government had ignored "countless" requests for aid to be allowed in. An aid convoy was blocked from entering the town last month, despite all involved parties agreeing aid could be delivered. The latest delivery was made by teams from the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Red Crescent. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday it had agreed a pause with the Syrian authorities for 48 hours to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid in Darayya. It borders a military airport used by Russian planes in support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad. It was one of the first towns to report demonstrations against the Assad regime, and has been under siege since late 2012. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported clashes this week between rebel groups and government fighters on the outskirts of Darayya. The UN believes there are more than 4.6m people living in hard-to-reach areas in Syria, including nearly 600,000 in besieged areas.	The US, UK and France have urged the UN to begin air drops of humanitarian aid to besieged areas in Syria.
For a second time, he's giving up a role he didn't inherit, but gained on merit. After stints in the RAF and the air ambulance, his days as a pilot are coming to an end. He will miss them.  He's spoken of how he's loved working in a team. Something, he said, "his other job" didn't necessarily offer. The prince is the only senior royal to have a deep understanding of the National Health Service the majority of the population experience. With his family moving from Norfolk to London, Prince George will go to a private school from September. And Prince William and his wife will be available to do more royal work.  The demands will increase now the Queen has turned 90. The future king's exclusive focus will very soon be on his role as a Windsor and a destiny he'll one day embrace.

Ryan Morse, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent, died on 8 December 2012 from undiagnosed Addison's disease. Dr Leonard Peter told Cardiff Crown Court Dr Joanne Rudling, of Cardiff, did not ask enough questions about Ryan's condition hours before he died. She and Dr Lindsey Thomas, 42, of Tredegar, deny manslaughter. Dr Peter, who has worked as a GP for 41 years, told the court 46-year-old Dr Rudling, one of his GPs, should have shown more curiosity about Ryan's state. Zoe Johnson, defending Dr Rudling, put it to Dr Peter that medical notes suggested Ryan was "feeling a bit better from a temperature point of view" the day before he died, but still suffering from sickness and diarrhoea. She said Dr Rudling had offered him the chance to see a male doctor on Monday after she was told of a change in the colour of Ryan's genitalia, something she felt was a symptom of puberty. "Looking at the record I'd be concerned that a child had serious symptoms in the morning, sickness, delirium...and had now developed a symptom I'd never seen before (the skin colour change). "Doctors are curious, or at least they should be curious...and you can't risk manage it if you haven't seen it." Dr Peter replied. "She had a lot of this information in the records and nor did she seek the information that wasn't in the records. "She didn't take an overall view of what was happening...this was a 12-year-old whose mother was changing him (because of such severe diarrhoea). "Had she seen it, she wouldn't have thought it was puberty, she'd have thought 'I've never seen anything like this in my life.'" The court has previously heard Ryan's death could have been prevented if he had been examined at any point up until a couple of hours before it happened. Both doctors deny manslaughter through gross negligence. Dr Rudling also denies attempting to pervert the course of justice with an entry made in Ryan's medical notes two days after he died. The trial continues.	A GP should have been more curious about a 12-year-old boy's symptoms and seen him "as soon as possible" the day before he died, a court has heard.
In a speech, Ian Murray said the party could take inspiration from dominant figures such as John Smith, Donald Dewar and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Murray added that a new generation must now be responsible for safeguarding the party's future. Party members are set to vote for new leaders at Holyrood and Westminster. The Shadow Scottish Secretary has given his backing to Scottish leadership contender Kezia Dugdale, ahead of her MSP rival Ken Macintosh. He is also backing Yvette Cooper to become the next Labour Party leader. In his speech at Morningside Parish Church in Edinburgh, he said: "Our lowest points can be the catalyst for our greatest victories. "We will elect a new leader in a matter of weeks and the hard work will begin. "A fresh team, a fresh approach, a new generation. I'll play my part in whatever way I can. "A party which takes inspiration from those who went before - Smith, Dewar, McConnell, Brown. All of them made their own unique and lasting contribution to our party and to our country. "But the Scottish Labour Party can no longer turn to the big beasts. It falls to a new generation to take the Scottish Labour Party forward." For many years, Scottish Labour figures played a dominant role on the UK political stage and in government. Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, John Reid, the list goes on. But these figures have since stepped down from frontline politics, while the party has fallen out of favour with voters. Today, Labour supporters gathered at Edinburgh's Morningside Church - where former Labour leader John Smith's funeral was held 21 years ago - not to dwell on the past, but to look forward. Speaking at the event, Ian Murray - now Scotland's only Labour MP - told them that while the legacy of these "big beasts" should serve to inspire, the party must now turn to a new generation of party talent. His comments were, in part, a nod to one of the youthful audience members, Kezia Dugdale, who Mr Murray has backed to become Scottish Labour's new leader over Ken Macintosh, an MSP since 1999. At the same time, he also gave his support to Yvette Cooper for the UK Labour leadership at a time when veteran MP Jeremy Corbyn is seen by some as a favourite to get the gig. Ian Murray and his Labour colleagues are all too aware of the challenge ahead, and with polls indicating victory for the SNP in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the party knows it will have to work extra hard to win back the trust of voters. Mr Murray added: "I want us to look back 20 years from now, in government in the UK and in Scotland, and be able to say that when the burden of responsibility passed to the next generation we were up to the challenge. "This will be the work of the new generation. It has to be the work of the new generation because we cannot go back." Mr Murray was the only Labour candidate to win in Scotland at May's election, when the SNP took 56 of the 59 seats. Recent polling suggested the SNP is also on course for a landslide in next year's Holyrood election.	Scottish Labour can no longer turn to the "big beasts" as it recovers from the general election defeat, according to the party's only MP in Scotland.
The 25-year-old Ghana defender, who arrived from League Two side Barnet in May 2016, was left out of Saturday's home defeat by Ipswich having started their two previous games. Heckingbottom said talks with Premier League newcomers are ongoing. "In my eyes I don't have Yids until I'm told different," he said. Talking to BBC Radio Sheffield, Heckingbottom added: "It wasn't right for me to involve Yids in the game on Saturday and if it is still the same, it won't be Tuesday because it is not fair on the other players. "We are all preparing for our game and obviously Yids is in limbo at the minute. "Until it is resolved one way or another and I'm told, I'm not considering him." Heckingbottom added that negotiations for the player, who made 33 appearances for the Championship club last season, "can't go much longer" and that he "expects" Yiadom's future to be known by Thursday. "I'm not thinking about it until after the game on Tuesday," he said.	Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom says Huddersfield Town target Andy Yiadom will not be considered for selection while he is "in limbo".
HP split into two separate companies in November - one focused on the printer and PC businesses and the other on corporate services. Shares of Hewlett Packard Inc fell 4% while services focussed Hewlett Packard Enterprises rose 2.3%. The Dow Jones gained 19 points to close at 17,812, after a bumpy start. The S&P 500 rose 2 points to 2,079.22, while the Nasdaq gained 20 points to 5,102. Hewlett-Packard's revenue fell 9.5% to $25.71bn in the fourth-quarter. On a broader theme, concerns about global political tensions weighed on early trading after it was reported that Turkey had shot down a Russian warplane. Stocks regained their footing, though on the back of news that the US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter of the year. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product rose at an annual pace of 2.1% in the quarter, up from the 1.5% rate it reported last month. Oil prices rose sharply on concerns that there could be more uncertainty in the Middle East. Brent crude jumped by 2.5% or $1.14, to $45.97 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude climbed $0.94 to $42.96 a barrel. As a result, shares in oil firms rose, with Exxon Mobil up 2% and Chevron 1.5% higher.	(Close): Shares of the two newly split Hewlett Packard companies diverged after its last report as a consolidated company.
Rangers led early through a scrappy goal from a corner, with Nedum Onuoha appearing to bundle in from a yard out. Onuoha almost provided a second goal before the interval, but Sebastian Polter saw his low left-footed shot hit a post from the defender's ball in. Tjaronn Chery's penalty made it 2-0 after Ronaldo Vieira clumsily fouled Jordan Cousins, before Polter fired in a third with the game's final touch. New Leeds head coach Garry Monk saw his side get off to the worse possible start within four minutes. The visitors, including former QPR goalkeeper Rob Green on debut, failed to clear a corner and Onuoha was among a number of bodies competing inside the six-yard box for the decisive final touch. QPR striker Polter caused Leeds' defence problems and twice hit the upright in the opening 45 minutes as the visitors looked off the pace. Monk's side showed glimpses of an attacking threat in the second half, but £3m summer signing Kemar Roofe was among those who struggled to impose themselves. Another new recruit, Swedish striker Marcus Antonsson, missed perhaps their best chance at 2-0 behind when he failed to hit the target with a one-on-one against QPR goalkeeper Alex Smithies. Leeds' misery was compounded with Polter's strike just before full-time, as the German volleyed home from a tight angle. QPR head coach Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "It was a good start. Perfect? No. But it was a good start as we were organised, had control in the first half and especially in the second. "Half-time came at the right time for us but then in the second half we controlled it, had more energy and we played really well. "We only gave away one chance really with our sloppiness and it was a good performance where we can have a look and work on things we need to improve and get better at." Leeds head coach Garry Monk: "It is obviously disappointing and not the start we wanted. "But this is just one game and I am confident we have the quality and the character in the group. "It's a process and I said when I walked in that it's not going to happen overnight. I trust all my players and trust they're good enough and will improve."

It took the World War Two prime minister's coffin from London to Oxfordshire in 1965. The restoration cost about Â£30,000. Look North's Ian Reeve reports.	A railway carriage that carried Sir Winston Churchill's coffin to his final resting place has been restored in County Durham.
The Bosnia-Herzegovina international is bidding for full match fitness after recovering from a hernia injury but is unlikely to start against QPR. The visitors are without midfielder Jordan Cousins, who will miss the rest of the season with a quadricep injury. On-loan winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in training after an ankle injury but is still a doubt for the visitors. Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol: "We move into Friday after a good performance that was much desired against Wolves. Friday is going to be really, really important. "If we can get a win, it really puts everybody else on the back foot, we'll claw another couple in and hopefully we'll push away as well. "It is a massive game. I'm sure the players will give their all. We want to look ahead of us and make sure we overtake a couple of people, with Forest and Burton only a point ahead of us. "Even QPR, six points ahead of us, if we beat them, we cut that gap to three points. That's really important. The more people we draw into it, the better."	Bristol City remain without midfielder Gary O'Neil (leg), but striker Milan Djuric is back in training.
The Island's Conservative executive council voted against a motion of no confidence in Andrew Turner. Opponents said Mr Turner caused "turmoil" over his personal arrangements and past expenses. Mr Turner, who has been the island's MP for 14 years, said he was "very pleased" at the vote. The Isle of Wight's Conservative Association Executive Council met for over three hours on Friday evening to debate whether they should "rescind" their choice of Mr Turner as the parliamentary candidate. Mr Turner, who had a stroke in 2006 and now suffers from the speech disability known as aphasia, said he won over members of the executive by "telling the truth, as I always do." "The truth is that we're busy working towards the election and we're very pleased about that," he said. The motion which had been submitted by an association member, proposed: "The executive council can no longer have confidence in Mr Turner's candidature and requests him to stand down as the candidate with immediate effect." Two Conservative Association trustees had written to Mr Turner saying he was "in thrall" and "totally dominated" by his parliamentary aide and former partner Carole Dennett. Concerns have also been raised over his past expenses claims. Earlier this month, Mr Turner told the BBC: "In the end, I make the decisions". By designating his home in Newport as a second home, Mr Turner was able to claim Â£103,000 in allowances in 2004. The MP has said he "can't remember" what happened around that time, in terms of why he was spending more time in London. After Friday night's meeting Chairman Allan Wells said party rules prevented him giving a breakdown of the vote about Mr Turner, but said it had "secured his future". "It wasn't an easy meeting, there were lots of different opinions. There was no unpleasantness. The party will move forward in a united manner," he added.	The Isle of Wight's Conservative MP has survived an attempt by his own party to force him to stand down as a general election candidate.
Gerald Lavey, 30, said his children clung to him during the attack by up to six men at his home at Ballymagowan Avenue, Creggan, on Monday. He said the gang dragged him from his living room to the front garden where he was beaten with iron bars and nails. Hours after the attack, a wheelie bin was set alight next to the house. Police said they consider both incidents to be linked. "Any other night I would normally lock the door and put the keys out of reach so nobody could break the glass," said Gerald Lavey. "But the wee'uns [children] didn't lock the door and the next thing we heard was footsteps coming up the stairs and I just knew then that's what it was. "They were dragging me down the stairs into the garden and started battering me with iron bars. Just before, my wee girl clung onto me when she seen them and they just pulled her off me." Mr Lavey said he feared for the safety of his daughter, 9, and his five-year-old son. "Its terrible, I don't think they should have had to witness anything at all. They were squealing. I was lying on the garden and they were just welting into me with iron bars with nails in them. "While I was in the front garden getting battered they [the gang] were smashing up the house. One of them said that's enough, that's enough but the last boy out had to hit me five or six slaps more and then they ran off down the street." Gerald Lavey called those behind the attack "cowards". "They were shouting about coke but I don't take any sort of drugs. I'm addicted to prescribed medication and that's it. I don't bother anybody I just keep myself to myself. "Cowards. They had to all come in masks and iron bars and it took five or six of them."	A man beaten with iron bars by a masked gang has blamed dissident republican paramilitaries for an attack at his home in Derry.
The study by Napier University found those on benefits were anxious that changes to their circumstances would push them into "crisis situations". Scottish Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil urged the UK government to rethink its reforms. But the Department for Work and Pensions said the changes were designed to help people into work. The Welfare Reform Tracking Study, which was carried out by Edinburgh Napier University on behalf of the Scottish government, also highlighted criticism of how the details of reforms were communicated to recipients of benefits. Some disabled people who took part in the study said they felt they had to present themselves in a "negative light and focus on their limitations" when claiming. Other participants spoke of stress, anxiety and depression brought on by assessments, and a fear of further changes. Mr Neil accused the UK government's "austerity agenda and benefit cuts" of having a "damaging effect" on people in Scotland. He added: "Their approach is slashing the incomes of some of our poorest households and pushing 100,000 children into poverty. "The study is further evidence that people are living in constant anxiety about changes to their entitlements and are already suffering from the effects of around Â£6bn of cuts taken from Scottish welfare expenditure over the last five years. "Despite these frustrations we will do all we can to use our new powers to make our system fairer and simpler and work to improve the experience for people." However, a spokesman for the Department of Work and pensions said the reforms were about giving people peace of mind. He added: "Reforms to welfare are designed to help people into work, giving more people the peace of mind and security that comes with a steady income - there are now near record numbers of people in Scotland in a job. "The government provides a safety net to support millions of people who are unemployed or on low incomes, spending Â£94bn a year across the UK on working age benefits."	Welfare reforms are making people live in "constant fear" of cuts to their benefits, according to a report.
Tait, who picked up a medal alongside Kate Hornsey in the women's pair, was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2013. Australian Rowing head coach Chris O'Brien said: "Sarah has been, and will continue to be, an inspiration to many Australian rowers. "She was a strong role model to young athletes, and particularly influential with our emerging female athletes." Tait and Hornsey finished behind Great Britain's Heather Stanning and Helen Glover in the 2012 pairs final, which was GB's first gold of London 2012. Glover became friends with Tait following the final and told BBC World Service she was an "incredible personality". She added: "To achieve so much in her too short life - two beautiful children, a husband, an Olympic silver medal, the list goes on. "Above all that, she was an inspirational and truly lovely person that has paved the way for women in sport at home in Australia and all over the world."	Australian rower Sarah Tait, who won silver at the London Olympics in 2012, has died aged 33.
The Stanford University analysis of 68 million days' worth of minute-by-minute data showed the average number of daily steps was 4,961. Hong Kong was top averaging 6,880 a day, while Indonesia was bottom of the rankings with just 3,513. But the findings also uncovered intriguing details that could help tackle obesity. Most smartphones have a built-in accelerometer that can record steps and the researchers used anonymous data from more than 700,000 people who used the Argus activity monitoring app. Scott Delp, a professor of bioengineering and one of the researchers, said: "The study is 1,000 times larger than any previous study on human movement. "There have been wonderful health surveys done, but our new study provides data from more countries, many more subjects, and tracks people's activity on an ongoing basis. "This opens the door to new ways of doing science at a much larger scale than we have been able to do before." The findings have been published in the journal Nature and the study authors say the results give important insights for improving people's health. The average number of steps in a country appears to be less important for obesity levels, for example. The key ingredient was "activity inequality" - it's like wealth inequality, except instead of the difference between rich and poor, it's the difference between the fittest and laziest. The bigger the activity inequality, the higher the rates of obesity. Tim Althoff, one of the researchers, said: "For instance, Sweden had one of the smallest gaps between activity rich and activity poor... it also had one of the lowest rates of obesity." The United States and Mexico both have similar average steps, but the US has higher activity inequality and obesity levels. Global sleeping patterns revealed by app data Has wearable tech had its day? Is that fitness tracker you're using a waste of money? The researchers were surprised that activity inequality was largely driven by differences between men and women. In countries like Japan - with low obesity and low inequality - men and women exercised to similar degrees. But in countries with high inequality, like the US and Saudi Arabia, it was women spending less time being active. Jure Leskovec, also part of the research team, said: "When activity inequality is greatest, women's activity is reduced much more dramatically than men's activity, and thus the negative connections to obesity can affect women more greatly." The Stanford team say the findings help explain global patterns of obesity and give new ideas for tackling it. For example, they rated 69 US cities for how easy they were to get about on foot. The smartphone data showed that cities like New York and San Francisco were pedestrian friendly and had "high walkability". Whereas you really need a car to get around "low walkability" cities including Houston and Memphis. Unsurprisingly, people walked more in places where it was easier to walk. The researchers say this could help design town and cities that promote greater physical activity. Follow James on Twitter. Reporter conflict of interest: I made 10,590 steps yesterday but clocked up only 129 on Sunday, I left my phone on the kitchen table all day - that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.	US scientists have amassed "planetary-scale" data from people's smartphones to see how active we really are.
At second glance, you think: "It's a statue." At third glance, you notice the holes in the feet - where the nails went in that nailed him to the cross. Jesus, the Homeless, is a life-size bronze statue that has divided opinion in America and England. Some people love the Banksy feel of it - the sense of art for the people, reaching out to the individual on street corners and parks. Others consider it an insult to the figure of Christ Jesus - leaving him out in the rain. They considered it "insulting" and "demeaning". It is the work of Canadian sculptor Tim Schmalz, inspired by a glance sideways as he drove along a busy street in Toronto. "I was driving into the biggest city in Canada and along the biggest street. I turned and saw a human form shrouded in blankets in the middle of the day," he said. "It just shocked me. In that initial moment my experience was of seeing Jesus there." The image stayed with him and he went home and created Jesus the Homeless. Now, he is setting about finding him a home and Belfast is on his list. An anonymous Episcopalian benefactor is funding 12 casts of the statue to go to big cities across the world, free of charge. Rome is one destination and London is another. But Schmalz has a special place in his heart for Ireland. A man who was sleeping rough died of hypothermia on the streets of Dublin, close to the Irish parliament in early December. Now the Irish Times is working with the sculptor on a suitable place for the statue. People have been invited to offer their suggestions. But Belfast, too, is a possibility. Fr Michael Sheehan who is the administrator of St Patrick's Church in the city's Donegall Street said the sculpture is "unique and inspiring". "You walk past people sleeping in doorsteps and on park benches. The marks of the two nails on the feet remind us that Christ is present. "So if you are passing Jesus the Homeless, hopefully you will be reminded that there are others who are in need." The church would be happy to have it - if the fine details and agreement are reached. "We have a perfect place for it, between the old church and the old school, the space is open to people coming and going. "It is a reminder that we are called to serve the homeless and to recognise Christ in each other." That goes for parading too, said Fr Sheehan. The street outside St Patrick's became a flashpoint during Orange Order parades in 2012. This statue would help people to recognise the Christ in each other, Fr Sheehan said. Also, as the church prepares to celebrate 200 years since its foundation, 2015 would be a perfect year to host Jesus the Homeless, he said. Tim Schmalz defines himself as a Christian sculptor. In his studio, in the countryside outside Toronto, he works while recordings of the St James' Bible play in the background. He did not grow up in a religious family, but became committed to Catholicism at 18 and, at one stage, considered becoming a priest. He did not do so but nevertheless considers that his art and his beliefs go hand-in-hand. Now he is married with children and works as a sculptor in the countryside outside Toronto. His work is indelibly bound to his faith. He had a clear plan of what he wanted for Jesus the Homeless. "I wanted to make visible what was invisible. Those people [the homeless] are very much invisible, there is no eye contact, no acknowledgement," he said. In his statue, the face of Jesus is shrouded, but the feet, a very private part of a person, are bare.  The statue offers that epiphany moment - when you realise who is depicted. Sometimes, the dawning is slow. In North Carolina, a woman called the police on Jesus as what she saw was a homeless person lying out on a park bench. Some people hate the statue.  They object to the depiction of Jesus as a tramp. Their criticism is that Jesus is not a helpless person who needs help. He is the one who gives help. Others say Jesus should never be represented as a beggar. But some people love the humanity and the echoes of the gospel that reverberate in the bronze:  "Whatsoever you do to the least of my brethren, that you do onto me". Among those who appeared to love it is Pope Francis.  Schmalz presented him with a scale model of his statue at an audience in the Vatican. The Pope stopped, laid a hand on the statue, closed his eyes, and prayed. There are plans for a bronze to be placed on the Via della Conciliazione, the great approach to the Vatican. "It is going to be at a spot close to where a homeless woman died. She was very well loved in that community," said Schmalz. In London, the offer of the sculpture was turned down by St Martin-in-the-Fields because of a rule banning anyone from sleeping or lying down inside the church. According to the Anglican Church Times, it was felt that given their rule, accepting the statue could leave the church open to ridicule. There was also a belief that the sculpture objectified the homeless. Schmalz begged to differ. Now, he said, there is the possibility for the statue to be placed outside the Methodist Central Hall Westminster close to the Houses of Parliament. He would be happy with that. There was a period of time when Schmalz did not know where his statue would go. "It sat in a crate for year and I thought about the irony of Jesus the Homeless being homeless," he shrugged. But that has changed. In January, Schmalz hopes to travel to Ireland to find suitable locations for his bronze. Belfast has a place in his heart and he is always open to suggestions for suitable places. "This is my perspective; If we can use this sculpture to introduce peace and understanding in Belfast, let's try our best, I am game," he said. On his park bench sculpture, there is a small space - just enough, at a tight squeeze, for one person to sit. "I made it that way," said Schmalz. "I deliberately left a little bit of the bench so that you can sit, uncomfortably, beside it." He would like as many people as possible to sit there and think. "The power of Christianity is my inspiration," he said. "Jesus the homeless is my frozen sermon."	At first glance, you see someone huddled in blankets and clutching at sleep on a cold park bench.
The 19-year-old was held in Barking on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. Police said six other suspects remain in custody and searches are ongoing. Eight people were killed when three men drove at pedestrians on the bridge and stabbed people in Borough Market. The man arrested on Sunday is being held at a police station in south London. The six men still in custody, all aged between 27 and 30, were also arrested in east London - four in Ilford, one in Newham and one in Barking. Thirteen people arrested as part of the investigation have been released without charge, while a 33-year-old man held in Ilford on 8 June has been bailed. Over the weekend, police released images of fake explosive belts worn by the three attackers, named as Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba. Borough Market is hoping to re-open "later this week", managing director Darren Henaghan has said. Traders were officially given access to the market on Monday - for the first time since the terror attack - to allow them to start clearing up and prepare to resume business. On Saturday night, bars and restaurants across the capital donated money to a British Red Cross UK fund for victims of terror attacks and their families, as Londoners were encouraged to show "unity and resilience" a week after the attack. The fund has raised more than Â£700,000 since it started on 4 June. And on Sunday, Southwark Cathedral - which had been cordoned off in the days after the attack - re-opened its doors for the first time.	Another man has been arrested in connection with the 3 June terror attack on London Bridge, bringing the total number of arrests to 21.
Steven Dunne, 42, failed to return to Southview Low Secure Unit, Hellingly, at 17:00 BST on Wednesday. After a police appeal on Saturday, Dunne later went into Bootle Street police station in Manchester, where he is in custody. Dunne will return to hospital under a higher level of security. Earlier, in their appeal, Sussex Police had said they believed he had gone to Manchester because he had family links in the city. In November 2010, Dunne admitted the manslaughter of Gordon Stalker, 51, on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely. Sussex Police said the level of security he was originally detained under was approved by the Ministry of Justice. After Dunne handed himself in, Lisa Rodrigues, chief executive of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: "We were concerned for Mr Dunne's welfare and we worked closely with Sussex Police throughout their investigation." The NHS trust had said Dunne posed a "low risk" after he was reported missing. During the court case, Dunne, formerly of Chates Farm Court, Brighton, told Lewes Crown Court he believed Mr Stalker was controlling his mind and he could only be freed by killing him. The pair were neighbours in a shared house in Elm Grove, Brighton, where they were friends and often socialised together. But Dunne's mental health deteriorated and he began to believe that Mr Stalker was a witch who had captured his soul. He stabbed Mr Stalker repeatedly in their communal hallway. The judge ordered him to be detained under the Mental Health Act.	A paranoid schizophrenic who killed a former neighbour and went missing from his secure unit in Sussex has handed himself in to police.
Liverpool-bound striker Dominic Solanke picked up Lewis Cook's pass to score the winner shortly after the interval. England played the last 17 minutes with 10 men after Josh Onomah was sent off. Freddie Woodman was required to make key saves late on as Paul Simpson's side held on to reach the semi-finals for the first time in 24 years. Italy beat Zambia 3-2 after extra time and will face England in Jeonju on Thursday. The other semi-final sees Uruguay take on Venezuela. After a goalless first half, Bournemouth midfielder Cook split the Mexico defence with an exquisite ball from deep that Solanke, who will join Liverpool from Chelsea next month, ran on to before firing past Abraham Romero. England also saw a goal-bound deflection cleared off the line and Onomah hit the post before the Tottenham midfielder was dismissed in contentious circumstances. The 20-year-old appeared to make accidental contact with Juan Aguayo as he ran past his marker but was shown a second yellow card that rules him out of the Italy game. England Under-20s last reached the final four of this competition in 1993, when a squad featuring Nicky Butt and Nick Barmby lost to Ghana in the semis before beating Australia to finish in third place. BBC sports editor Dan Roan These are encouraging times for English youth football. Last season, the Under-21s won the Toulon tournament for the first time in 22 years. Last month the Under-17s reached the final of the European Championships. The U20s have now done something no England team has managed since 1993. In fact, England failed to qualify for five of the last 11 Under-20 World Cups, and did not win a game in the other six. The FA believes this current success is testament to the continuity and technical support representative teams receive at the National Football Centre at St George's Park, and improved trust with clubs over the release of young players. But with the top clubs awash with TV money and increasingly able to buy proven foreign talent, the concern will be that the path to first-team football for home-grown youngsters is harder than ever.	England will face Italy in the semi-finals of the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea after a 1-0 victory over Mexico in Cheonan.

The emergency services were called to the property in the Sangomore area of Durness at about 02:00. Police Scotland said it was not known if she was in the house at the time. Her relatives have been informed. Det Insp Richard Baird said the fire was not thought to be suspicious, but the damage caused had prevented entry to the property. He said: "A joint investigation with the fire service will be carried out. "Enquiries are at a very early stage, however, initial enquiries would suggest there are no suspicious circumstances. "Due to the extensive structural damage and uncertainty of the building, gaining access to the property will take some considerable time. "Structural engineers will advise when it will be safe to enter the property."	Police are trying to trace a woman who is unaccounted for after a fire at her home in the Highlands.
Government figures show 59,090 households were accepted as homeless by councils in England between April 2016 and March 2017. This is 17% higher than the number made homeless in the year 2011-12. The Department for Communities and Local Government says it is investing Â£550m to 2020 to tackle the issue. But the figures, just published, also show nearly 200,000 people are at risk of homelessness and have sought help through their local authority. Homelessness and housing charity Shelter said the fire tragedy at Grenfell Tower had put the issue of homelessness into the spotlight. Its director of communications, Anne Baxendale, said: "While Shelter is calling for those affected to be placed in good quality temporary accommodation nearby, and [we] hope officials make good on their promise to do so, we know many local authorities simply don't have enough affordable accommodation for those on low incomes. "It's a similar story across all London boroughs and the country more widely, so it's no surprise that today's homelessness stats reveal the problem is getting worse nationally, with more households becoming homeless every year." The charity highlighted that a quarter of households staying in temporary accommodation had been doing so for more than a year. While 1,290 families were spending more than the six-week legal limit living in bed and breakfast accommodation. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "This government is determined to help the most vulnerable in society, and is committed to ensuring people always have a roof over their heads. "Statutory homelessness acceptances are less than half the 2003 peak. "However, the government is committed to do more to prevent more people becoming homeless in the first place."	The number of families finding themselves homeless over the past year has risen by nearly a fifth on five years ago, official data shows.
Lesbos used to get more than 5,000 a day. On Monday there were just four. But with Europe's borders closed, more than 50,000 migrants remain in Greece waiting for a decision about their futures. Angus Crawford visited three sites to find out how they are living. Miracle is sleeping. He cannot tell me anything about the conditions in Moria camp. He is unaware of the smell of raw sewage that hangs around the entrance gate.  He does not know about the fighting between migrants that insiders say breaks out on a regular basis. Luckily on Tuesday the tear gas fired by police at young migrants throwing stones never reached him. He does not have to stand in line for hours to get food. Miracle is just 10 months old and is strapped to his mother's back. She tells me her name is Blessing. She says she is Nigerian, a Christian from Kano, and that she left because of the Islamist militants, Boko Haram. I have no way of independently checking her story. But here she is in Moria, once a transit camp for migrants, now since the EU deal with Turkey, a detention centre, run by central government. There are several thousand people inside even though it was never built to house so many. It is another sign of how Greece was simply overwhelmed by the numbers who came, while itself in the middle of an economic crisis. Most of those who arrived before March 20, the start of the EU-Turkey agreement, are free to come and go, but cannot leave the island. Those who came after that date are locked in, waiting for a decision about their asylum claims. Moria's chain link fence, topped with razor wire, snakes on its way up into olive groves.  It surrounds a collection of converted shipping containers, large white plastic shelters and small tents. I meet one man who says simply, "in here, I fear for my life". 'A hellish Glastonbury' Five minutes drive away, another camp. There is no razor wire, no police guarding the gate. The first thing I see is an electronic display board. It reads "the camp director wishes you a pleasant and safe stay". There are orderly lines of white UN refugee agency tents. Children run up and down the pathways between them. This is run by the council, for migrants who arrived before the 20th, and for the vulnerable: families with children, pregnant women and the disabled. They can leave the camp, but not Lesbos. One aid worker tells me it is the best camp he has seen. It sits on top of a hill, surrounded on three sides by the Aegean. In the distance lie the ruins of a castle. The facilities may be better and site picturesque, but those who I meet inside tell me it is still in effect an open air waiting room. Amiyah is 19 and from Damascus. The rest of her family are in Germany. But she cannot join them. Abdul, who is 16, complains about the food and says everyone is getting sick. Tareq tells me he had only â‚¬50 left after paying a smuggler, but yesterday even that was stolen. The migrant crisis in seven charts The Plaza is an eight storey hotel not far from the centre of Athens. It has three stars and more than 60 rooms. There are more than 140 guests, but none of them have to pay to stay. The hotel was a casualty of the economic crash, going bankrupt in 2010 and closing its doors. But last Friday a group of activists and former workers unlawfully reopened the Plaza, with migrants as guests. The reception is manned by volunteers 24 hours a day and the kitchen turns out food. There are more than 70 children staying here. When we visit there is laughter and singing from the playroom on the first floor. And in a rack by the entrance, yellowing maps of Athens still waiting for the tourists who never came.	There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of migrants arriving in Greece since an agreement between Turkey and the EU came into force.
The pages from a 13th Century text of the holy book of Islam were purchased by the council in 1951. Conservator Richard Hawkes said: "This is the earliest example of paper that I have worked on." Leeds City Council said the paper's age and origin were confirmed by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2014. The pages mainly show surahs (or chapters) 29 and 30, said the council. Councillor Brian Selby said: "The painstaking work of the museum team has ensured the pages can be displayed in a way which fully captures their significance as well as how ornate and beautiful they are." Leeds City Museum's display starts on Saturday and is to run for a year.	Two pages from an 800-year-old copy of the Koran decorated with gold leaf are to go on show in a Leeds museum display looking at Islam.
Pedro Sanchez has been trying to secure support for a coalition government with the centre-right Ciudadanos party following inconclusive December polls. In an often acrimonious debate, acting PM Mariano Rajoy said a Socialist-led coalition would be a threat to Spain's national interests. Another vote will be held on Friday. If that vote is also unsuccessful, parliament will have a further two months to choose a government. If it is unable to do, fresh elections will be held on 26 June. Blame game begins in earnest Strain of Sanchez's bid to rule Kiss that showed real political passion Mr Sanchez needed an absolute majority in Wednesday's confidence vote but lost, with 219 votes against, 130 in favour and one abstention in the 350-seat lower house. Mr Rajoy - leader of the incumbent conservative Popular Party (PP) - called Mr Sanchez a "fictitious, unreal candidate". He told Mr Sanchez the PP's 122 deputies would vote against him "because you plan to eliminate what was achieved in Spain throughout these past four years which prevented this country from needing a bailout, created jobs, improved its competitiveness and caused it to grow economically". Conversely, Mr Sanchez was also under attack from the left. "You want to consolidate the main policies of the PP," said Pablo Iglesias, the pony-tailed leader of the far-left Podemos party, which represents 69 seats. However, he did not rule out a united front with the Socialists entirely, urging Mr Sanchez to "write the future of Spain together with us" - but leaving aside Podemos's ideological foes, Ciudadanos. On Friday, Mr Sanchez will have another chance in a vote that requires only a simple majority. However, correspondents say that now looks doomed too - leaving the country in limbo at a time when the economy is growing but still suffers serious weaknesses, primarily an unemployment rate of nearly 21%. In an address to parliament on Tuesday, Mr Sanchez called for the formation of a coalition based on common interests. He said a Socialist-led government would enact a series of progressive measures such as a minimum wage increase and a gender wage-gap law. Between them, the Socialist PSOE and partner party Ciudadanos command only 130 seats in the lower chamber. The Popular Party gained most votes in the 20 December election but Mr Rajoy was unable to secure enough backing to form a government. The PSOE performed badly, hit by the emergence of Podemos and Ciudadanos, and the fragmented political landscape has eluded efforts to agree a governing coalition.	Spain's Socialist leader has lost a bid to form a government after both main rival parties voted down his attempts to form a coalition.
The only goal of an entertaining game came from Reuben Reid in the fifth minute after Jordan Moore-Taylor's long ball was needlessly handled inside the penalty box by Jake Carroll. Although Reid saw his penalty saved by David Forde, the ball came straight back to him to tap in the rebound. David Wheeler saw a header come back off the inside of the post, while Cambridge almost levelled when Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym completely missed a kick, but he managed to get back to scramble Luke Berry's shot off the line. Liam McAlinden then missed a golden chance for Exeter, heading wide from six yards, before Lloyd James skied another glorious chance for Exeter high from 10 yards with just Forde to beat. McAlinden skied another great chance high shortly after half-time before being denied by Forde, while a rare Cambridge attack saw Berry volley over after good work by Uche Ikpeazu.

Mark King, 21, earlier admitted stabbing 37-year-old Steven Downes in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow at 01:30 on 17 January 2015. He was told he would also be supervised for three years after his release. King is already serving four-and-a-half years for another stabbing carried out in July 2015 while he was on bail. For that offence he was also ordered to be supervised in the community for two years following his release. The court heard that in the January attack, Mr Downes had been stabbed in the back, face, arm and side and had suffered a punctured lung. Judge Lord Clark highlighted the "pattern of knife-carrying" King was developing and told him a substantial prison term was the only appropriate sentence. King was assessed as being at "maximum risk" of re-offending or causing harm to the public. During his evidence, Mr Downes said he had asked King and his friends in the close to keep the noise down because his children were sleeping. King, who was armed with a knife, ran up the stairs towards him. Mr Downes said: "I think I got stabbed when I got dragged out of my house with my jumper over my head. "A group were kicking my door open and bottles were getting flung. "I blacked out and ended up in the Western Infirmary suffering from a punctured lung." Passing sentence at the High Court in Livingston, Lord Clark told King he had been convicted of assaulting Mr Downes to his severe injury to the danger of his life and of attempting to murder him. "You tried to force entry to Steven Downes' flat. The door was kicked open and Steven Downes was dragged out of the flat and struck on the head and stabbed," he said. "He had a stab wound to his back, stab wounds to his face and arm and a stab wound to the left side resulting in a collapsed lung and bleeding into his chest cavity. "The injury to his left arm required to be stapled, the injury to his back was life-threatening and other injuries have resulted in permanent scarring." He added:  "Your repeated involvement in offences involving knives is a very serious matter. "The report notes you are beginning to develop a pattern of knife-carrying which is assessed as representing an increased risk to local communities. "I see no alternative to a substantial custodial sentence." He warned King that any breach of the licence conditions could see him taken back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. Matt Jackson, defending, revealed his client had been convicted of assault to severe injury and danger of life, along with other offences, and was on High Court bail when he committed the crimes. Mr Jackson said King had been "a young lad with terrific prospects" before he turned to offending while out of work. "Every once in a while in one's professional career one encounters an individual [whom] its baffling to understand how he's involved in and is convicted of these very serious offences.	A man has been jailed for 10 years for the attempted murder of a father who had asked him to keep the noise down in a common close of his flat.
The Canal & River Trust said the path at Pontcysyllte Aqueduct would close between 09:00 GMT and 15:00 from Monday until 17 February. The towpath will be open outside these hours from Monday to Saturday and will be open all day on Sundays. Repair work is needed on the parapet of the 126ft (38m) tall structure. The Canal & River Trust said said: "These measures are to protect the public whilst we undertake these important works, allowing them to be undertaken safely by our operatives."	Maintenance work on a Wrexham aqueduct means the towpath will be closed for six hours a day.
The club beat Derby County 6-2 in a memorable Championship clash on 30 April 2005. "The buzz in the pubs that night was brilliant," says Dave Kaczur, who has supported the club for 50 years. "Even though you were apprehensive about moving to a new ground, the result gave you a real sense of optimism. "Unfortunately though, we haven't had much to cheer about since then." Coventry's Highfield Road years are now regarded by many fans as the club's golden era. The ground was the first all-seater stadium in English football and its position, on the fringe of the city centre, meant it was always at the heart of Coventry life. "You used to walk up the hill and you were there," said Mr Kaczur. The club's greatest achievement - a cup run which saw them beat Tottenham Hotspur in the 1987 FA Cup Final - was the highlight of that era. "That was the best weekend of my footballing history," says Mr Kaczur. "Six of us hired a stretch limo and drove down to Wembley on the Friday night because we wanted to see the sun over the twin towers. "The next day, thousands of fans were dancing and singing on Wembley Way - and that was before the match even kicked off." Through the Highfield Road years, Coventry had many heroes. The main one - Jimmy Hill - achieved promotion to the old Division One in 1967. The club remained in the top tier for the next 34 seasons - one of the longest serving top-flight clubs - until their relegation in 2001. As a mark of their gratitude to Mr Hill, fans raised Â£100,000 for a 7ft bronze statue of their former manager at the Ricoh Arena. However, the club's move to the Ricoh Arena has not brought the success many fans hoped for. The Sky Blues faced further relegation in 2012 and may yet be relegated to League Two for the first time in their history. Mr Kaczur says the move from Highfield Road has "torn the heart out of the city". "The trouble was, we only moved to the Ricoh Arena. We didn't own the ground," he says. The failure of the club's current owners, Sisu, to secure ownership of a new site has seen a succession of legal battles between them and the ground's former owners, Arena Coventry Limited. During the 2013/14 season, Coventry played their matches at Northampton Town's Sixfields Stadium. "There was a big drop in support," said Mr Kaczur. "We used to get 30,000 fans - suddenly, it was down to 1,000. "I didn't bother going - not even to sit on the hill outside as a protest. "The passion and excitement has gone." Today, the site where Highfield Road stood has been developed as housing. "What surprised me was how quickly it was developed," said Mr Kaczur, who has kept part of Highfield Road's brickwork "as a memory". "In the part of town where you used to see the Spion Kop all those years, now all you can see is a housing estate. "It's just weird."	Ten years ago, Coventry City played their last match at Highfield Road - the ground that had been their home for 106 years.
Anne Marie Waters, a former Labour activist and founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, has previously called Islam "evil". Her leadership bid has split the party, with some MEPs threatening to quit if she was allowed into the race. But the UKIP National Executive Committee, which vets all would-be candidates, has allowed her to stand. The other candidates to replace Paul Nuttall - who stood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election - are: Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay on the 29th and 30th of September. Ms Waters's leadership bid was backed by former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson and she has previously been blocked from standing as a UKIP election candidate. James Carver, UKIP West Midlands MEP, said he "sincerely hoped" Ms Waters did not win - but added that she should be allowed to stand. He said: "Her train of thought, I think is going about it the wrong way... there are many British Muslims in this country and that is a good thing." The party's former leader, Paul Nuttall, has previously said her views made him "uncomfortable". Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on the burka, the closure of all sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will strike a chord with many voters. She has argued that UKIP could regain support if it had the "guts" to be "honest about Islam" and challenge the view that it had "nothing to do" with jihadist violence. Last month, former leader Nigel Farage told BBC's Sunday Politics that "if UKIP goes down the route of being a party that is anti the religion of Islam, then frankly it's finished".	An anti-Islam candidate has been allowed to stand for the UKIP leadership.
John Ridsdel, 68, was taken from a tourist resort along with three others by the Abu Sayyaf group in September last year. The group had threatened to kill a male hostage on April 25 if a ransom was not paid. Confirming the death, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it "an act of cold-blooded murder". Mr Ridsdel was kidnapped from a marina near the city of Davao along with another Canadian, Robert Hall, Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad and a Philippine woman, Mr Hall's girlfriend Marites Flor. They were taken 500km (300 miles) to the island of Jolo. Abu Sayyaf released a video of the group in November, in which they demanded $80m (Â£55m) for their release. Mr Ridsdel later warned that he was due to be killed if no ransom was paid. Several hours after the deadline, a severed head was found in a street on Jolo. The Philippine authorities said it belonged to a foreign man but it has not yet been formally identified. "It's hard," a friend of Mr Ridsdel, Bob Rae, told CBC News. "It's just very hard. I've been involved behind the scenes for the last six months trying to find a solution and it's been very painful." A former mining executive, Mr Ridsdel is described by Canadian media as semi-retired. He also worked as a journalist. Offering his condolences, Mr Trudeau gave few details, saying he would not compromise the safety of the other captives. Abu Sayyaf was set up in the 1990s and received funding from al-Qaeda.  It is fighting for an independent Islamic province in the Philippines. Several of its factions have declared their allegiance to the militant group Islamic State. Abu Sayyaf is also holding several other foreigners. Eighteen Philippine soldiers were killed in clashes with the militants on Basilan island near Jolo island earlier this month.	A Canadian man held captive by Islamist militants for months in the Philippines has been killed.
The demonstration came after the deaths of several helpers in recent months. They also called for a pay rise, a limit on working hours and better accommodation. Eman Villanueva, spokesman for the Asian Migrants Co-ordinating Body, told the South China Morning Post:  "We are hopeful that our demands will be met." He added: "There are no reasons to reject them unless this is an anti-immigrant government." Early last month, a 35-year-old Filipino domestic worker fell to her death as she was reportedly cleaning the windows of her employer's flat. At least four other helpers are reported to have died this year from work accidents or suicide. "Cleaning windows from the outside is not a domestic worker's duty. It's a responsibility of the building management," said Mr Villanueva, himself a domestic worker from the Philippines. "It's necessary to have proper training and safety equipment to do that sort of job." The protest also called for a rise in the minimum wage for foreign domestic workers to HK$5,000 (US$645; Â£485) a month. The minimum wage is currently HK$4,210 per month, and employers are required to provide "suitable accommodation" as well as free food or a food allowance. The South China Morning Post quotes a study by the non-profit Justice Centre which suggests the average domestic worker in Hong Kong works nearly 12 hours a day, and nearly 40% did not have their own room. Mr Villanueva said there were domestic workers living in "boxes" similar to "dog houses".	Domestic workers have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to demand a ban on them being asked to clean windows in high-rise buildings.
A woman, a man in his 30s and two girls aged three and five were involved in the accident near Junction 11, Reading, at around 14:10 BST on 7 May. The woman, 37, from London, died at the scene while the younger girl later died of her injuries. The man and the five-year-old girl were discharged from hospital.	A three-year-old girl has died in hospital after the car she was travelling in crashed into a tree next to the M4 in Berkshire.
A total of 1,400 tickets have sold out for the opening weekend at Bramall Hall in Stockport, Greater Manchester after renovation work began in 2014. Stained glass windows and ceilings have been restored, while the public will be able to visit the dining room and butler's pantry for the first time. Councillor Kate Butler, from Stockport Council, called it the "jewel in the crown" of the town's heritage. The manor dates back to the reign of William the Conqueror when he bestowed the lands upon one of his followers, Hamon de Masci, who became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. Since then the estate has been under the ownership of just three families: the Davenports, De Bromales and Nevills. In 1936, the timber-framed hall and its surrounding parkland was handed over to the local council. The transformation followed a £1.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £400,000 in council funding.	A Tudor manor house has reopened following a £2.2m makeover.
Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order. When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case. It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education. Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled. According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17% between July 2013 and July 2014. Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential. Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels. Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction. "I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him," she says. "I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like.  It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick." Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him. "Freedom is what makes learning still fun," he says. "In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker." Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children. Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum. "A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change.  I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime." Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children. "I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life." These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education. They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong. But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do. Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis. It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information. The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy. But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos. In a statement, Kensington and Chelsea Council acknowledged the right of parents to educate their children at home. But it said "when this happens we believe that we have a duty of care to establish that the child is receiving a suitable education".	A London council has withdrawn an order forcing a mother to send her home educated child to school.
The stand-in captain faced 535 balls across two innings, moving from 174 not out overnight to end 219 not out in Surrey's first-innings score of 483. Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: "I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. "We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. "There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. "They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket."	Rory Burns scored 287 runs in more than 12 hours at the crease to earn Surrey a draw with Hampshire at The Oval.
The UK government gave Northern Ireland the power to reduce the level of the tax because it said it had a special economic case. That prompted calls from Scottish and Welsh airports for similar treatment. The UK Treasury said it had not ruled out devolving APD to Scotland and Wales in the future. A report published following a consultation on reform of APD said the government at Westminster would "continue to explore the feasibility and likely effects of devolution to Scotland and Wales". Earlier this year Chancellor George Osborne announced the duty would be cut for direct long-haul routes from Northern Ireland airports, and he would devolve control over the tax to the Northern Irish Assembly. The move came in response to fears that some routes could be scrapped due to competition from Irish airports where APD is much lower. Commenting on the UK Government's decision not to grant the Scottish government similar powers for now, Jim O'Sullivan, managing director of Edinburgh Airport, said: "APD is already costing Scotland passengers and having an impact on tourism revenues. "We know from discussions with our airline partners that it is a major factor in their decision to connect further routes to Scotland. "We would urge the Westminster Government to see Scotland as it does Northern Ireland and understand the need to both reduce and devolve this unfair and damaging tax." Amanda McMillan, managing director of Glasgow Airport, said: "On the question of devolution of APD, Glasgow Airport has always been supportive of this proposal given the Scottish government's more progressive approach to aviation and its greater appreciation of the role the industry plays in supporting the growth of the Scottish economy." Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown said the case for devolving APD was "compelling" and had been backed by all four of Scotland's biggest airports, and recommended by the Calman Commission. He added: "We need to be able to deal with the competitive and connectivity disadvantages that Scotland faces and if APD were devolved now we could provide the means to incentivise airlines to provide new direct international connections to Scotland, benefiting our aviation industry and our passengers and supporting the growth of the Scottish economy. "The UK government needs to listen to the many voices in Scotland who clearly want to see full devolution of the policy on APD."	Scottish airport operators have said they are dismayed and disappointed that the control of air passenger duty (APD) will not be devolved to Scotland.
Ministers shelved Wednesday's vote on relaxing hunting laws in England and Wales after the SNP said it would vote against the changes. The party had previously said it would not vote on issues affecting England and Wales only. Mr Cameron said the SNP's position was "entirely opportunistic". Downing Street said it was "disappointing" that the vote had to be postponed, and said new proposals on the Hunting Act would be introduced "in due course". The government has said the hunting vote will now be held after plans to give English MPs a veto on matters affecting only England - although this would not stop the hunting issue having to be voted on by the whole House of Commons. Ms Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, said the decision to delay the hunting vote showed "David Cameron can't carry his own parliamentary group", and that he only had a "slender and fragile" majority. She said he had also been forced to pull his English votes for English laws plans, showing that he was "not master of all he surveys in the House of Commons". She said if he "had any sense", he would come back with proposals based on "fairness and reasonableness" that "work in both directions". Earlier she had explained her party's decision to take part in the hunting vote, saying there had been "overwhelming demand" from people in England. Another reason, she said, was because David Cameron was making Scottish MPs "second-class citizens" in the House of Commons. Mark D'Arcy, BBC Parliamentary correspondent With two strategic retreats in the space of a week, the intersection of Hunting and English Votes for English Laws (EVEL) is generating some really interesting politics. Last week, the government paused its attempt to bring in EVEL, replacing a vote on Wednesday with a consultative debate. Today another "turn your back and run away, and live to fight another day" moment on the proposed changes to the Hunting Act. Read the blog in full The government plans to change Commons rules to allow English, or English and Welsh, MPs a "decisive say" on legislation only applying there. However, the current proposals would not prevent SNP MPs from voting against the changes. Downing Street said there were no plans to change the current proposals. This is because the statutory instrument ministers want to use to change the law would require the support of the whole of the House of Commons. The government's decision to reschedule the vote came as anti-hunting protesters gathered at the Houses of Parliament to protest against changing the law. The changes would have brought the Hunting Act in line with Scotland, where an unlimited number of dogs can be used to "flush out" a fox to be shot, compared to just two in England and Wales. It's been a rollercoaster week for the old, bitter enemies on each side of this debate. Last Wednesday - Budget day - there was quiet jubilation in hunts in England and Wales at the prospect of the loathed Hunting Act being relaxed. Dignity would be restored: they could hunt without their every move being filmed. Animal welfare groups were devastated: it was a sneaky step, hunting would be back, and they only had a week to mobilise. Now with the abandonment of the vote, their fortunes have apparently been reversed. But this isn't a tale of victory and defeat. Both sides now know the government's desire to change the Hunting Act. They are digging in for a much more protracted fight that could - believe it or not - become even more bitter. But the 56 SNP MPs, plus Labour and some Conservative MPs opposed to hunting, meant the government's change stood little chance of being approved in Wednesday's free vote. The SNP says it will now consider tightening the law in Scotland to match England and Wales. Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said: "David Cameron is now running scared because he knew he was going to lose the vote on fox-hunting." Meanwhile, a poll for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show has suggested almost three in four British adults are against making fox hunting legal. The poll, conducted by ComRes, asked 1,005 people if the practice "should or should not be made legal again?".	SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has told David Cameron he is "not master of all he surveys" after her party forced a delay in a planned fox-hunting vote.
The approval depends on Shell getting a nod from other US regulators, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said. Shell stopped Arctic exploration more than two years ago after problems including an oil rig fire and safety failures. Environmental campaigners oppose the move. Shell has spent about $6bn (Â£3.85bn) on exploration in the Arctic - a region estimated to have about 20% of the world's undiscovered oil and gas. The Anglo-Dutch company wants to drill up to six wells in water about 40 metres deep, using two vessels that can serve as backups in the event of an emergency. "We have taken a thoughtful approach to carefully considering potential exploration in the Chukchi Sea," said Abigail Ross Harper, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, in a statement. This conditional approval means Shell must obtain permits from the federal government and the state of Alaska to begin drilling this summer. Susan Murray, an official at Oceana, a group against Arctic drilling, said: "Our government has rushed to approve risky and ill-conceived exploration in one of the most remote and important places on Earth." Among Shell's woes the last time it tried to drill in the area were its failure to have a spill-response barge on site before the drills reached oil-bearing zones, as it had promised, and the outbreak of fire on the Noble Discoverer rig that Shell had hired. The Kulluk, a circular drilling barge, broke away from its towing vessel and ran aground on its way to a shipyard in Washington state. "The approval of our Revised Chukchi Sea Exploration Plan is an important milestone and signals the confidence regulators have in our plan," said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith.	Oil firm Royal Dutch Shell has won approval from the US Department of Interior to explore for oil in the Arctic.
It is a tiny signal seen in the way the waters at the ends of the 35km-long lake rise and fall. When combined with the direct tug from the gravity of the Moon and Sun, the loch surface goes up and down by just 1.5mm. The study is reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research. "If you were on a boat in the middle of the loch, you certainly wouldn't notice it," said Philip Woodworth from the UK National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Liverpool, "but a tide like this has never been observed in a western European lake before." Prof Woodworth, David Pugh and Machiel Bos say their precision measurement technique could be used in other lakes around the world to understand better how the Earth's crust deforms as a result of ocean movements - rather like a carpenter will use a spirit level to gauge how a length of wood deviates from the horizontal. "I have described Loch Ness as the largest spirit level in the world," David Pugh, who is a visiting professor at NOC, told BBC News. None of us can feel it, but Britain rises and falls by centimetres every 12 hours and 25 minutes as a great bulge of ocean water washes around the country. The pencil-shaped Loch Ness is the largest UK lake by volume, and although inland, is close enough to the North Sea to be influenced by this loading effect. The team placed pressure sensors a few metres under the lake surface at six locations, from Fort Augustus in the far southwest to Aldourie in the far northeast. They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days. What the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. But they could also tease out a second signal stemming from the way water rises and falls as a result of the tilting of the land. And, in fact, the latter effect sits on top of the first and is responsible for most of the amplitude change. The team says the measurement was made to an accuracy of just 0.1 mm over the loch's 35 km length. "We had to extract the tidal signal and get rid of all the noise. This involved very high precision," explained David Pugh. "For example, the loch surface itself goes up and down every day by four centimetres just due to the pump storage scheme for hydroelectric generation, and we have to pull out a very small signal within that. "The holy grail would be to learn from the effects of the tides something about the Earth's crust.  So the more precise we can get, the more we may learn about the crust."

If that happens, the ice loss could push up global oceans by 2m, or more. The claim is based on an assessment of the rocks underlying the ice stream. Scientists tell the journal Nature that should the front of the glacier retreat about 150km from its current position, it will then enter a runaway reversal that takes it 200-250km further inland. Most of the big glaciers in the east of the White Continent appear relatively quiescent; Totten is something of an exception. It is experiencing a thinning rate of about half a metre per year, according to the latest satellite measurements. Previous research indicates this is probably being driven by warm ocean water getting under and melting the floating front of the glacier. What Alan Aitken and colleagues have now done is examine a possible future for Totten if the shrinkage continues. They have used gravity and magnetic data recorded over the entire catchment feeding the glacier to understand its past behaviour. They find that the underlying sedimentary rocks at the modern front of Totten are heavily eroded, as are the rocks in fjords deep in the interior of the catchment. The inference is that these sections are where persistent, moving ice has had time to grind down the geology. It is the mid-region, however, that piques the team's interest. Here, the sediments are relatively thick, suggesting that ice fronts have historically been resident in this section for only short periods. This mid-region is also where the rock bed dips inland - a geometry that glaciologists say is naturally unstable and accelerates any glacier retreat. "What this all tells us is that once the ice margin starts to go back, it goes back quite rapidly to a newer, stable position way inland. And if you do that our modelling indicates you will lose ice equivalent to 1.5-2m of sea level rise," co-author Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The last time Totten retreated to the deep interior of the France-sized catchment was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, he added. "Three-point-five million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were in the region of 400 parts per million - so about where they are now. The atmosphere was a couple of degrees warmer than it is now, which is in line with what we expect for the end of this century if we do nothing about it. The Pliocene is where we're headed." Even so, the timescale for the far retreat inland would be on the order of centuries, on current trends. The international community has of course committed itself to doing something about climate change, promising at the Paris talks in December to try to keep the global atmospheric temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to "well below 2C". Various analyses, however, suggest a 2.7C increase is a more likely outcome, based on the voluntary national curbs to greenhouse gas emissions promised at the meeting. And that variance could be significant, according to research presented at the recent European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna last month. Prof Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US, has modelled possible ice losses from the Antarctic continent based on the two temperature figures. For a 2C rise, he found minimal change by the end of this century. On the other hand, for 2.7C he identified ice losses equivalent to many tens of centimetres of sea-level rise. "There's threshold behaviour in the Antarctic ice sheet system," Prof DeConto told reporters at EGU. "We don't know exactly where that line is, but according to these results somewhere between 2C and 2.7C makes a very big difference."

Paw Patrol's Skye and Marshall did not appear at a Christmas lights switch on in Londonderry on Thursday night. Derry City and Strabane District Council has since apologised. Broadcaster Nickelodeon said they had not "organised or authorised" the use of the characters at the event. Nickleodeon's Paul Hamilton said there are no official PAW Patrol appearances anywhere in the UK or Ireland at present. The character's appearance had featured prominently on pre-event promotion. Derry City and Strabane District Council marketing officer Jacqueline Whoriskey said every effort was made to secure Skye and Marshall,  and that the council was " sorry to disappoint people". She added: "We were contacted very late in the day by the official licensee in America to say that the company we were using did not have the appropriate licences. "We tried our best to resolve it in time - unfortunately it didn't work out - and are really, really disappointed". Strabane's Christmas lights will be switched on on Saturday but Skye and Marshall will not be there. They had been due to share top billing with Santa Claus. Despite the PAW Patrol no show, thousands gathered in Londonderry's Guildhall Square and Waterloo Street for Thursday night's switch on.	Characters based on a Nickelodeon cartoon were dropped from a Northern Ireland council's Christmas celebrations - after it emerged they were unauthorised.

Telford and Wrekin Council believes the proposals for MoD Donnington could create up to 700 new jobs. Donnington provides logistics support for the Army, handling military equipment and weapons. The local authority said it was putting together a planning application for a one million sq ft (93,000 sq m) development at the site. The council said it had been in talks with the MoD over the past 18 months to turn Donnington into one of the main support depots. Telford and Wrekin said the plans were still at a very early stage, and depended on winning investment from the MoD. Councillor Bill McClements, responsible for finance and enterprise, said it was a great opportunity for both the MoD and the local economy. "It's looking good and we're very optimistic," he said. "Potentially it safeguards over 1,000 jobs and can bring in between 500 and 700 new jobs, plus extra jobs and investment in the supply chain. "We're removing any barriers. We're offering incentives, we're offering to train and even help to build it." Mr McClements said the planning application was expected to be submitted before the end of the year. In a statement, the MoD said it was too early to talk about job opportunities and that it was also in talks with a number of other councils. The MoD said the negotiations were part of a project to rationalise its procurement and logistics operation.	Plans have been unveiled for a major expansion of a Ministry of Defence (MoD) base in Telford.
Wearing boxing wraps around their palms and seated on a bench inside a gym in the eastern Indian city of Calcutta, two players match moves while huddled over a chessboard. Caught between the mind and muscle, the recently-introduced game of chess boxing is seeing an early surge of interest in India. The game involves alternate rounds of chess and boxing. In less than two years of its launch, 10 state-level associations organising championships have come up, while seven more states have shown interest in the sport. While bigger states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have formed state-level teams, smaller north-eastern states like Tripura and Manipur are also represented. Of about 300 registered chess boxers in India, 195 and 245 players participated in the two national-level tournaments held in 2013. The figures are indicative enough for Iepe Rubingh, president of the Berlin-based World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO), to report in an email to the Calcutta-based Chess Boxing Organisation of India (CBOI) on India's potential to become "one of the leading nations in chess boxing". Globally, 13 countries, including the US, Germany, Russia, the UK and France, play the game. Newer entrants like Iran, China and India have bolstered its profile further. Twenty-seven-year-old Shailesh Tripathi from Mumbai became the first-ever Indian participant at the World Chessboxing Championship held in Moscow on 28 November. He put up a good fight at the competition. Tripathi, who has been a boxer for a decade and a chess player since his college days, says "the limits of body and brain are assessed at a global arena". "It is this combination that attracted me to the sport. If promoted well, chess boxing can gain immense popularity in India," he adds. To popularise the sport in India is the job of CBOI and its founder, Montu Das. Having been involved as a player in high-combat games, including kick boxing, since his childhood, Das was introduced to chess boxing through an online video and subsequently, the WCBO website. He was captivated by a game where the 11 competing rounds are split between six alternating rounds of chess and five three-minute rounds of boxing. At any stage, a checkmate or a knockout can decide the winner, besides other criteria. As a sport, chess boxing is still in its infancy. First conceptualised in 1992 by French cartoonist Enki Bilal in a graphic novel, it was reformatted for "modern times" by Mr Rubingh who felt having shorter-timed alternating rounds of chess and boxing would make the game more appealing for spectators. Mr Rubingh himself was a participant in the first WCBO tournament at Amsterdam in 2003. Chess boxing, according to the current Indian national champion in the senior 75-80kg category, Anurag Mathur, is balanced wonderfully between the mind and body. A former engineering student from Calcutta's Jadavpur University, he believes it takes some of the "mindless machismo out of boxing and the staidness out of chess". Mathur trains at the south Calcutta gym owned by Das. The same address also doubles as the India headquarters of the game, where young hopefuls like 22-year-old Mousumi Bar, silver medallist in the women's category in the first national tournament, practice their punch and marshal their minds. She became a kick boxer against the wishes of her parents so chess boxing has been a happy compromise for all involved. "My parents are happy that it isn't an all-out combat game," says Bar. "As a kick boxer, they would worry that an injury might hamper my marriage prospects." About 30% of registered chess boxers in India are women, informs Das. Ever since Das introduced the sport in India, his native city and state - Calcutta and West Bengal respectively - have seen multiple neighbourhood chess boxing clubs open up which have contributed about a third of CBOI's total membership. While it is reported that WCBO is lobbying for the game to be included as an Olympic sport, Das, on his part, is canvassing for official recognition from the Indian government's ministry of youth affairs and sports. So far, he says he has spent 250,000 rupees ($4,000; Â£2,443) in organising tournaments and promoting the game. At his gym, young chess boxers are aspiring to make it big, even if it takes much more than the sweat carried from the boxing ring to drip onto chessboards.

The head of the mission, Peter Graaff, met the Ghanaian president to thank the country for hosting the agency since it was set up in September last year. A small team will stay until the end of June to co-ordinate air operations, the agency, known as Unmeer, said. Ghana has not been affected by the epidemic in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people. Africa news: Tuesday 9 June as it happens Why Ebola is so dangerous Ebola basics: What you need to know The BBC's Africa health correspondent Anne Soy says the mission set up its headquarters in Accra as it was far enough away from the affected countries, where there was logistical lockdown, but close enough the epicentre of the outbreak. "By allowing us to set up our headquarter in Accra, President [John ] Mahama demonstrated extraordinary leadership and solidarity," Mr Graaff said in a statement. "He made Ghana the only open gateway to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone thus allowing the movement of thousands of Ebola responders and medical and essential supplies when they were most needed." As a result, Unmeer said Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone now had the necessary response capabilities in place to efficiently test, treat and isolate Ebola patients. 11,164 Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected (Includes one in the US and six in Mali) 4,806 Liberia 3,912 Sierra Leone 2,431 Guinea 8 Nigeria President Mahama said the downsizing of Unmeer was a sign of success for "short and sharp interventions". Most of the mission's staff and assets have been moved to Sierra Leone and Guinea, where 24 new cases of Ebola were reported in the last week. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Liberia free of Ebola as the country had had no new cases in 42 days. The basics: What you need to know	The UN's emergency Ebola response headquarters in Ghana's capital, Accra, is to close as the outbreak slows.
Hull city councillor Steven Bayes also pleaded not guilty to possessing an extreme pornographic image when he appeared at the city's crown court. The 55-year-old was suspended from the Labour Party in October after it "became aware of a police investigation into him", a party spokesman said. He was released on unconditional bail and is due to stand trial on 5 February 2018 at the same court. Mr Bayes was first elected as a councillor in 1985. He was involved in Hull's bid to secure the UK City of Culture title and is a former vice chair of the Hull 2017 company, which is organising arts activities and events for the year-long celebration.	A councillor has denied two counts of making indecent images of children.
Church members have voted to raise the cost of a wedding from £296 to £415 and for a funeral service from £102 to £160 from January next year. The fees include the costs of lighting and administration for the first time. The moves come despite a warning from some members of the Church's governing body, the General Synod, that the rises could have an impact on poorer couples. The Rev Canon Simon Killwick, a vicar in Moss Side, Manchester, said: "Such a fee increase seems to me hard to justify in times of financial austerity and even harder to justify in poor inner-city parishes. "The Church of England ought not to be seen to be making a big increase at this time and ought not to be making it difficult for the poor to access these services at a time when a simple ceremony can be had at a register office for around £100." Canon Killwick said the right to waive fees in cases of hardship put clergy in the "invidious position" of means testing parishioners. "Waiving can cause real ill feeling," he said. "The poor don't want to be patronised by fees being waived, they want their church to be affordable to them. "It would be a crying shame if poor people end up being married in register offices because the Church of England has priced them out of their parish church." But the Rt Rev John Packer, the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, said the changes reflected the "reality" of the costs, and  reduced confusion over different fees being charged by different parishes. He told the General Synod that the fees raised about £35m a year for the Church, including £15m towards the pay of clergy. "The reality of what it costs matters, and it seems to me that those who are being married within our churches do understand that," he said. The increases were approved after a 4% rise in the number of Church of England weddings in 2010. Last year the General Synod rejected plans to increase the price of both weddings and funerals by 50%.	Fees for Church of England weddings are to increase by 40% and the cost of a funeral service by more than 50%.
They have not been seen since 17 May after visiting their home country of Bangladesh. It is believed the family stopped in Turkey on their way home before entering the war-torn country. A statement from relatives in the UK said they were "devastated" and the disappearance was "out of character". Bedfordshire Police said it had not confirmed whether the family had crossed the border, but inquiries were ongoing. It has not said whether any family member was on any terror lists. The family is: The BBC understands Muhammed Mannan has diabetes and his wife Minera Khatun has cancer. The couple live in Luton with other family members. The family was reported missing to police by two sons, understood to be Mr Mannan's from a previous marriage, who live in Luton. One of the sons declined to talk to the BBC. Police said the family flew to Bangladesh on 10 April and flew back to Istanbul on 11 May. They were due back at Heathrow three days later but failed to return. Community leader Ashuk Ahmed said he had known the family for 35 years, with Mr Mannan going to the local mosque a number of times a day. "Initially they went to Bangladesh and on the way back they stopped at Turkey," he said. "Many families do - Turkish Airlines offers a break in Turkey either to Bangladesh or on the way back. "The community is extremely worried about the family. There are three generations." He said no-one knew if they had joined a specific extremist Islamist group in Syria. However, he said people in the community had told him some women in the family might have been radicalised and took the rest of the family with them to Bangladesh to avoid detection. Neighbour Syed Hussain said police visited the family house after they went missing and took out paperwork. He said he heard the family went to Syria and he "felt sorry" for the elderly couple who "probably don't know anything about it". Bedfordshire Police said a family member had been in touch with relatives in the UK but they did not say where they were. So far 42 other British jihadists are thought to be in Syria or Iraq. The total includes Luton man Abu Aziz who fled the UK after being convicted of an attack on a member of the public. Luton mother-of-six Runa Khan was jailed last year for inciting terrorism in Syria. It is not known if the missing family knew Aziz or Khan. In a statement, Bedfordshire Police said: "Police can confirm they are investigating the disappearance of a missing family of 12 from Luton who failed to return home from a holiday to Bangladesh. "There is a suggestion that the family may have gone to Syria, however police have so far been unable to corroborate that information. "Police are continuing with their enquiries and are working with relatives who are still in the UK." A statement from relatives said: "We are devastated by the disappearance of these 12 and are very concerned for their safety. "This is completely out of character and we are very worried of the danger they may now be in. "This just does not make any sense. We can only think they have been tricked into going there, it is no place for elderly or young people. "We would urge any of them to please make contact with us or the police to let us know they are ok."	A family of 12 from Luton, including a baby and two grandparents, could have travelled to Syria after going missing, police have said.
Officers believe the local man, who was working at Fruehauf on Houghton Road, fell from a cherry picker at about 13:45 GMT on Thursday. Lincolnshire Police said it was carrying out a joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive. The company was cooperating fully with the investigation, the force added.	Police are investigating the death of a 64-year-old man who died after an industrial incident in Grantham.
The company also says its franchisees were helped by a "record low cheese price, favourable wheat price and a fall in fuel costs". Pre-tax profits were Â£73.16m, up from Â£62.1m in 2014. E-commerce sales now account for 77.7% of all UK deliveries and 48.6% of online sales are made using its app. Domino's says online orders in the UK rose by nearly 29% last year and app-based orders shot up by more than 41%, with 11.5 million people now having downloaded the app in total. "The thing that customers want more than anything else is convenience and that means food that's delivered to their home," chief executive David Wild told the BBC. The second most important thing, he said, was food that can be ordered online. "We have seen a massive increase in our online orders - a total of 11.5 million app downloads since we launched our app two or three years ago - and what we have learnt is that customers like to find it easy to get hold of a pizza and that's the most important trend," Mr Wild said. The chain opened a record 61 new stores in the UK in 2015, taking its total number of outlets to 869 by the end of the year. Domino's said its franchises had seen increased profitability over the course of the year "primarily as a result of the benign food price environment combined with the group's purchasing power". "In 2015 we passed on savings of Â£11m from lower food costs primarily from cheese and dough and the outlook remains favourable for 2016." Apart from the UK business, Domino's Pizza Group also owns the franchises in the Republic of Ireland, where it has 47 stores, and Switzerland where it has 15, as well as Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Last December, it entered into a joint venture to buy Germany's biggest delivery chain, Joey's Pizza. That deal was finalised at the beginning of last month and as a result Domino's Pizza Group is no longer directly operating in Germany. In the UK, Domino's featured in a Channel 4 documentary called "A Slice of Life" which was viewed more than a million times and which it said, resulted in a significant increase in recruitment applications. During the year Domino's launched the Tikka Pizza and reintroduced the hot dog stuffed crust pizza. In the first nine weeks of trading in 2016, UK like-for-like sales grew by 10.5%, in Ireland they were up 13.7% and in Switzerland 4.3%. "Momentum continues with a good start to 2016 despite increasingly tough comparatives through the rest of the year," Domino's said.	Domino's Pizza has revealed what it describes as "excellent" results for last year, driven primarily by the growth in its digital sales.
DR Congo could only draw 1-1 with their rivals in Kinshasa, having drawn the first leg of their qualifier 0-0. It put Congo Brazzaville through on the away-goals ruling. In other shocks South Africa, Mali and Algeria were also eliminated. DR Congo boasted an outstanding record in the previous four tournaments for home-based footballers with two titles and two quarter-finals finishes. They were expected to beat Congo Brazzaville in front of their home fans in Kinshasa and qualify for the 2018 Championship in Kenya next January and February. Jean-Marc Makusu Mundele put the title-holders ahead on 36 minutes only for Jaures Ngombe to equalise just two minutes later. DR Congo needed at least one more goal to survive, but Congo defended bravely to clinch only a second appearance at the 16-team tournament. Severely depleted South Africa contained Zambia for 79 minutes in Ndola before conceding two goals in three minutes to lose the match 2-0 and the tie 4-2 on aggregate. Justin Shonga bagged a brace for Zambia against a South Africa side deprived of many first choice players because clubs refused to release them. Mali, who lost the 2016 final against DR Congo in Kigali, were another shock casualty as they had a man sent off when losing 1-0 at home to Mauritania. Karamoko Traore scored on 38 minutes in Bamako and the hosts were reduced to 10 men before half-time when Boubacar Samassekou was shown the red card with Mauritania advancing 3-2 on aggregate. Nigeria secured a ticket to Kenya by overcoming Benin 2-0 in Kano. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, the Nigerians secured their place through goals from Rabiu Ali and Kingsley Eduwo. Ivory Coast, third behind DR Congo and Mali at the 2016 Nations Championship, scored seven minutes into stoppage time to pip Niger for a place at next year's finals. Sanfo Sylla scored the crucial goal to give the Ivorians a 1-0 victory and an away goals victory after the tie ended 2-2. Angola missed a penalty in Luanda before Dany scored the only goal of the tie just past the hour to inflict a first loss in 11 matches on Madagascar. Rwanda staged a brave comeback to defeat Uganda 2-0 in Kigali but failed 3-2 on aggregate, with Cameroon and Sudan also booking places in Kenya. On Friday, Morocco and Libya knocked out Egypt and Algeria respectively as they booked their places at Kenya 2018. Morocco beat Egypt 3-1 in Rabat on Friday to win the tie 4-2 overall. Libya held Algeria to a 1-1 draw in Sfax to go through to the finals with a 3-2 aggregate victory. Despite CHAN matches only featuring locally-based footballers the games have full international status and count toward the monthly Fifa rankings.	The African Nations Championship (CHAN) holders, the Democratic Republic of Congo, failed to qualify for the 2018 finals in Kenya following a shock elimination by Congo Brazzaville.
The bloc's leader, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, looks likely to succeed Helle Thorning-Schmidt as prime minister. But difficult talks lie ahead. Mr Rasmussen's own Venstre (Liberal) party saw great losses in Thursday's poll, and the biggest party in the right-bloc is now the anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DPP). As a result, the bloc that will rule Denmark is likely to be very different from the one Mr Rasmussen led when he was prime minister in 2009-2011. We have yet to fully understand the roots of the DPP's success, but its calls for tougher asylum policies combined with demands for border control seem to have paid off, amid concern over the public cost of immigration. It was expected to make huge gains, but on election night it was clear that it had done even better than expected - increasing its share of the vote by 8.8%. The DPP took 21.1% of the vote, while Venstre - the party of the likely premier - saw its worst election result since 1990, with less than 20%. A lot of long-serving Venstre MPs will lose their seats. Their election party was a strange mix of worried faces and joyful cheers. Much of Venstre's failing support is due to Mr Rasmussen himself. Polls have indicated he scores poorly when voters rate him for trustworthiness, following a string of scandals and media stories over the years. As the likely prime minster, he will have to manoeuvre carefully with a strong DPP. Another strong force within the right-wing bloc will be the Liberal Alliance, which also saw large gains after campaigning for tax and spending cuts - quite the opposite of the DPP's more social-democratic economics. Many questions about Mr Rasmussen's government remain unanswered, and the coming weeks will see tough talks. The questions pile up: Will Venstre form a government on its own? Or is the DPP ripe for the responsibility of forming a coalition government? Either way the right-wing bloc will have to deal with differences in terms of euroscepticism and Denmark's position vis-a-vis David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate the UK's EU membership terms. So far the right-wing bloc has signalled support for Mr Cameron's bid. Back in the losing left-wing bloc, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt - Denmark's first female prime minister - announced that she would step down as leader of the Social Democrats. Everything points to Mette Frederiksen as her successor. Mrs Thorning-Schmidt did not mention any names in her succession speech, but noted that she would not be the last female prime minister her party would have. It is still unclear what she will do next. At the age of 48, she is a relatively young former PM, and she has previously shown an ambition for a position in international politics. It is summer time in Denmark - but for everyone involved in politics, vacations will have to wait. Asmus Leth Olsen is an assistant professor at the department of political science at the University of Copenhagen.	The centre-right bloc which won Denmark's general election has begun negotiations to form a new government.
The away side were 43-4 when the impressive Tom Taylor (6-61) trapped Alviro Petersen lbw, but Ashwell Prince (97) and Steven Croft (70) put on 160. Lancashire were 264 ahead when their ninth wicket fell, but Davies (89) and Jarvis (17 not out) added valuable runs to leave a far tougher target of 365. Derbyshire then lost both openers cheaply to end the day on 27-2. Wicketkeeper Davies struck nine fours and five sixes to reach his highest first-class score as he dominated the partnership with Jarvis. Peter Siddle and Tom Bailey then took the wickets of openers Ben Slater and Billy Godleman with Derbyshire needing to make the highest score of the match to win. Lancashire's Alex Davies: "A lead of 250, 260 is quite slender going into a full day tomorrow so we knew we had to hang around and help the team get into a good position. "Those extra runs will give us a bit more scoreboard pressure. The pitch is still doing a bit laterally and will start to go up and down as well which will help us. "I think the weather is set fair and if we bowl anything like (we can), we should be able to knock them over." Derbyshire's Tom Taylor: "I think it's definitely possible (for Derbyshire to win), it's just how many big partnerships we can get and we've got to chip in. "The ball has swung and it will swing again in the morning so it would be a great win but we fancy ourselves to try and get them tomorrow."	Lancashire's Alex Davies and Kyle Jarvis put on 100 for the 10th wicket to frustrate Derbyshire on day three.
The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check whether landing gear had deployed and the failure of the cabin PA system. The initial fault was caused by a loose connection the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded. Because of the landing gear problems, the pilot - flying from Ibiza last September - was forced to fly over the airport at 1,000 ft (300m) so ground crew could check if it had come down, the report said. But it was too dark to tell and the co-pilot had to look out of windows in the main cabin, before the pilot was cleared to land. As the plane taxied on the runway, passengers reportedly panicked when the smoke began to seep into the cabin. Because the PA system was not working, cabin crew tried to use a loud hailer to tell passengers but the volume button had fallen off. The escape chute then failed to deploy effectively, forcing some of the passengers to run out on to the wing before leaping onto the ground. One member of cabin crew only realised the plane was being evacuated when she saw passengers on the wing. According to the report, a problem was first spotted when the pilots realised the address system was not working. Several other failures were noticed including an equipment cooling fan, a radio, weather radar, the autobrake, power to the standby altitude indicator and compass. It was realised there was a problem with a battery connection, known as a busbar, forcing the pilots to request a quick landing at the airport. After a successful landing, passengers and crew could smell smoke but the commander could not announce a full evacuation. Since the incident, Jet2 has included a procedure within its manual which will better-prepare pilots in the event of a repeat and also reduce the chance it will result in an evacuation, the report said. The AAIB concluded all the problems - bar the escape chute - stemmed from the loose connection possibly caused by the over-tightened nut. It also noted smoke started to seep into the cabin because a fan stopped working creating a build up of dust and oil in the air conditioning. It was suggested the problem with the escape chute could be because a crew member was more used to opening a door on the opposite side of the plane.	Passengers escaped a smoke-filled plane by jumping from the wing after a series of problems caused by an electrical fault, investigators say.
The unnamed pair waited nine months for their Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) to be paid by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). They brought the test case to the High Court, claiming the delay was unlawful. A minister said "significant progress" had been made in processing claims. PIPs started replacing disability allowance in April 2013. Labour, along with several charities, criticised the government for the way it handled the switchover, which left about 3,000 people waiting more than a year to have their welfare claims processed. The High Court is now conducting a judicial review into the payment system. The claimants said they struggled to pay for food and fuel because of the delays and their health declined as a result. They had a right to such benefits under the law and should have received them within a "reasonable time", their lawyers told the court. One of the claimants, Ms C, from Kent, said she had to leave her job because of ill health. She suffers from ME and severe depression. "I was completely isolated during the nine months I was waiting for my payments. "While my wait came to an end, it is worrying that many, many others have still not received a decision." Justin Tomlinson, the minister for disabled people, said that PIP claims were being processed "at five times the rate they were in January 2014". He added: "In addition 21% of claimants have been awarded the highest rate, compared to 16% under the disability living allowance, demonstrating that the benefit is being targeted at those who need it most." But counsel for the claimants said the "most challenging phase" of the PIP rollout was still to come. About 1.5 million recipients of disability allowance will be moved into the new scheme at the same time as existing PIP claimants face reassessment. Currently, up to 16% of applicants are still waiting more than 30 weeks for their claims to be completed, the claimants' lawyers said.	Two disabled people had to turn to loan sharks and food banks because the government took so long to process their benefit claims, the High Court has heard.
Nationalist MPs will take control of the UK Parliament's energy and climate change select committee and Scottish affairs select committee. The SNP won 56 of the 59 Westminster constituencies at the general election two weeks ago. That resulted in the party being the third largest, behind the Conservatives and Labour. Parliamentary convention dictates that the official third largest party at Westminster gets to chair a number of select committees. SNP chief whip Mike Weir said both committees were especially important to Scotland in this parliament. He said: "We will be seeing one of the major bills coming forward in the Scotland Bill on more powers for Scotland, and of course the energy and climate change committee is of particular importance with our oil and gas sector and renewables industry. "The SNP chairing these committees will allow us to make progress on these important issues, and will help us get the best deal for Scotland."	The SNP will chair two House of Commons select committees at Westminster, it has been announced.
Lord O'Donnell told the Times it would take Parliament "years and years and years" to separate fully from Brussels. "It very much depends what happens to public opinion and whether the EU changes before then," he said. He later told the BBC he did not think the EU would make the radical changes needed for the UK to remain a member. As Gus O'Donnell, he was cabinet secretary from 2005 to 2011 and is now a crossbencher in the House of Lords. Lord O'Donnell told the Times: "Lots of people will say 'we've had the referendum, we've decided to go out, so that's it, it's all over'. "It might be that the broader, more loosely aligned group is something that the UK is happy being a member of." Asked about these comments, he told BBC Radio 4 this was an example of a "low-probability event that might mean we don't leave". He also said his "central assumption" was that the EU would not radically change. "The probability of us not leaving is very, very low and we need to get on and implement the people's decision," he added. Lord O'Donnell said making Brexit happen would be difficult, partly because article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - the step required to officially begin the process - was designed "in a way that is very strongly in favour of those who are staying, not the leaving party". He said he "wouldn't be in a rush" to trigger article 50, as the government must first work out a "strategic plan to say 'what kind of UK do we want, what's our place in the world, what are we trying to achieve in these negotiations'". Handling Brexit would be an "unprecedented challenge" for the government and the civil service, he added. In his interview in the Times, Lord O'Donnell said Theresa May - who replaced David Cameron as prime minister after the UK public voted by 52% to 48% to leave the EU - now faced a "really difficult job". "She's got to corral all these different individuals, come up with precisely what version of Brexit we want, what works best for the British people, and then go about implementing it," he said. He said he was "not a big fan of referenda", adding that there were "ridiculous claims" on both sides in the UK's debate on EU membership. Mrs May has said formal talks on Britain's "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU will not begin until next year - but she has been clear that "Brexit means Brexit". Gus O'Donnell served as a press secretary under John Major, and then as cabinet secretary - the UK's most senior civil servant - in the cabinets of Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron.	A former head of the civil service has said the UK might remain in a "more loosely aligned" European Union, despite the referendum vote to leave.
For Fahad bin Mohammed Al-Attiya, it is the nightmare scenario. He is the executive chairman of the Qatar National Food Security Programme. The small Gulf state is 100% dependent on desalinated water. Mr Al-Attiya says such a scenario would threaten the very survival of Qatar and its population of more than two million. "We need to have clean water," he says. "A situation like the Gulf of Mexico where BP lost two or three million barrels of oil - if that happens in the [Persian] Gulf the consequences would be severely different." Qatar sits on the world's third largest gas field and is investing billions into mega-reservoirs at home to give it some kind of water security. But water is not the only problem. Despite being the richest country per capita in the world, Qatar also needs to import 90% of its food. "Qatar is... hydrocarbon-rich," said Mr Al-Attiya, speaking on a special In the Balance discussion on food security for the BBC World Service. "But certainly water-poor and food-poor. "Not only that, but for our own development we have to import the... labour to develop our country so we need to import even further to feed the nation." Where the solution to water security is largely domestic, food security involves a tangle of trade, diplomatic and political issues. Qatar joins a growing list of countries that includes other Gulf states, India, China and South Korea, that are not just importing food but buying the land abroad on which it is grown. These countries are often accused of "land grabs" - the buying up of millions of hectares of overseas agricultural land with scant regard for the livelihoods of local farmers or the environment. The charity Oxfam claims land eight times the size of the UK was sold off globally in the last decade, enough to grow food for a billion people. It says that more than 60% of investments in agricultural land by foreign investors between 2000 and 2010 were in developing countries with serious hunger problems. Two-thirds of those investors plan to export everything they produce on that land. But the truth is, for all its wealth, an investor like Qatar can itself be at the mercy of global weather, disease and politics. The price Qatar pays for losing imports is not just financial - it is often the physical loss of food to eat. Mr Al-Attiya points out that many of Qatar's trading relationships fell apart in 2010 when India, Russia and other countries blocked exports in the face of the worst droughts in a century. "That made countries like ours question how much faith we put in free trade." So he says that Qatar has to have a bigger vision. "We will not go in and invest simply to service our population of 2.5 million people.  It doesn't make any economic sense. "We will go in and invest to service the country, and the region - and the globe at large. "I say there is no direct link between investment in a foreign country and food security of the country that made that investment. "Because the country that received that investment is a sovereign state and it could say, 'Thanks for the investment but in times of crisis I am not going to export that food.' What we do... is really enhancing the availability of a food at a global level." Such a global perspective is not the norm. Land grabs get bad press - for good reasons. Ahmed Soliman, research assistant on the Horn of Africa at Chatham House, says land grabs put pressure on local communities. "Many of the populations are involved in either subsistence agriculture or very low-level agriculture. "Taking into consideration what is sustainable for them in terms of how they are able to feed their families and future generations is very important. And when it gets down to national level those concerns are not being met." But there may be ways of meeting them. Prof Jacqueline McGlade, chief scientist of the UN Environment Programme, says: "The kind of investments the Qataris are talking about is a very 'soft' power, because they are talking about raising the whole global food production system. "But in a more aggressive world perhaps there is space for an investment bond that says if things go horribly wrong and you have denuded the land we're going to use that fund to reinstate some kind of productive farming." But there is also a need for a relationship between investor and host country that works day-to-day as well as in a crisis. "It's a very complex problem," says Ken Ash, director of trade and agriculture at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). "People are hungry because they are poor, because they don't have money to buy food when they need it. It isn't just about producing more grain or more rice. It's about generating income opportunities in rural areas so that people can increasingly feed themselves." The question of food security could have some very prosaic solutions. For Prof McGlade it is a question of too much waste. "It's waste at the farm level, it's waste through the supply chains and delivery, and the lack of refrigeration. "You look under just one tarpaulin and you see the extreme loss of potential at every stage of the food supply. So if we can tackle food waste at the very beginning then I think food security becomes something that is realisable." In the Balance's discussion on food security is broadcast at 08:30 GMT on Saturday, 6 December on BBC World Service.	Imagine this: an oil spill the size of the Gulf of Mexico 2010 disaster, but this time in the Persian Gulf.
The unmanned cargo ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday, but contact was lost with it soon afterwards. Russia's space agency says Progress M-27M is now orbiting in an uncontrolled spin. It cannot reach the ISS and is likely to break up on re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The craft carried on to a higher orbit after contact was lost. Igor Komarov, the head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said: "The craft's continued flight and its docking with the ISS is not possible." Two astronauts spending a year on the ISS, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, told the Associated Press news agency that flight controllers had given up hope of controlling Progress again. Progress is likely to re-enter Earth's atmosphere some time between 5 and 7 May. Other capsules - including one Progress craft last year - have burned up and disintegrated on re-entering Earth's atmosphere without posing a threat to the planet's population. Cathleen Lewis, a specialist in Russian space programmes at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said it was not yet known where debris will fall - but that it was highly unlikely to hit urban areas. "I always remind people that two-thirds of Earth's surface is water," she said. "The likelihood of it coming down and hitting someone is so remote as to be minuscule." The problem with the loss of the Progress is that it puts further pressure on the volume of stores held on the space station. ISS managers like to keep a good six months' supply of food, water, fuel and other resources in reserve at all times. Currently, however, this volume is somewhat depleted - in part because of the explosion on launch last year of the American Cygnus freighter. The responsibility for keeping the stores topped up leans heavily on Progress and the second American freighter, Dragon. The latter is due to make its next supply run in June. As long as it keeps working well, ISS officials in Houston and Moscow will not be unduly concerned. If, for some reason, supplies did become marginal, the space agencies would simply reduce the size of the normal six-person crew until matters could be improved. Progress was to deliver food, water, fuel, oxygen and clothing to the crew of six people on the space station that orbits about 420km (250 miles) above Earth. Even after Progress' loss, the astronauts have enough supplies to keep them going until the next expected delivery on 19 June. A Roscosmos spokesman told Reuters that the loss was valued at 2.59 billion roubles ($50.7m, Â£32.9m).	A Russian spacecraft delivering supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) is out of control and will fall back to Earth, officials say.
Three operators have been shortlisted for the Northern Rail franchise and three for First TransPennine Express (TPE), with the winners due to be announced in October 2015. The Campaign for Better Transport and the RMT transport union are concerned rail services could be cut. But, rail minister Claire Perry promised a "world-class rail network". The franchises connect passengers travelling between the key strategic cities of Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester, Newcastle and Carlisle and onwards to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The companies competing for the Northern franchise are Arriva, Govia and Abellio, which has held the contract in a joint venture with Serco since 2004. The three shortlisted for TPE are FirstGroup, Keolis and Stagecoach. FirstGroup and Keolis currently operate TPE in a joint venture. The government said franchise bidders would need to improve customer service and passenger satisfaction on the two networks which carry more than 110 million passengers last year. Ms Perry said: "Building a railway that is fit for the 21st century is a vital part of our long-term economic plan, connecting businesses and communities, generating jobs and boosting growth." Over the next five years, more than Â£1bn will be spent on the rail network in the north, the government has said. This includes Â£600m for the Northern Hub project and electrification projects in the north-west and across the Trans-Pennine routes. The RMT held a protest outside Westminster on Monday opposing plans for the Northern and TPE franchises. Mick Cash, RMT acting general secretary, said: "This was just round one of the fight to stop the carve up of jobs and services on Northern and TransPennine Express."	The shortlist of companies bidding to run rail networks in the north of England has been announced.
West Indies, who were 11-3 in pursuit of England's 155-9, needed 19 off the final over to win and did it in style. Marlon Samuels' 85 not out kept them in contention before Brathwaite's match-winning blitz off Ben Stokes. Joe Root scored 54 for England but nothing could stop the Windies joining their women as World T20 champions. In the process, the West Indies also became the first two-time winners of the men's World Twenty20. Despite the devastating loss, England can take a lot of encouragement from their performance in this tournament, which has showcased an attacking philosophy and resilience that was completely lacking during their group-stage exit of last year's 50-over World Cup. But for Brathwaite and Samuels, it would have been Eoin Morgan's side capping their rapid improvement with their own World T20 title. Brathwaite came in at number eight, joining Samuels at the crease in the 16th over with the West Indies on 107-6 and needing 49 from 27 balls. The tall bowler had only batted twice in the competition prior to the final, scoring 10 not out against South Africa and 13 against Afghanistan in the group stages. But, with 19 needed off Stokes' last over, he seized his moment with the bat in spectacular fashion. Brathwaite will take the headlines, but man of the match Samuels was the real architect behind the West Indies' victory courtesy of his 66-ball unbeaten 85 - the highest individual score in a World T20 final, beating his own record of 78, scored in 2012. He was brought to the crease in just the second over following the dismissal of Johnson Charles, who, along with fellow opener Chris Gayle, was one of two wickets claimed by surprise opening bowler Root. Lendl Simmons, who scored a match-winning 82 in the semi-final against India in his first appearance in the competition, was trapped lbw by David Willey in the next over to leave the West Indies reeling. Samuels was given a reprieve in the first over after the powerplay as replays of his edge from Plunkett showed it fell just short of Jos Buttler's gloves, leading to the umpire calling him back to the crease after initially raising his finger. But Samuels kept a cool head after this, scoring at around a run a ball to reach 50 and help his side to 86-3 before accelerating with two sixes and a four in a key 15th over from Plunkett. Two wickets in the 16th over by Willey in the following over swung the game back England's way, but Samuels remained to watch on from the non-striker's end as Brathwaite turned the game decisively in the West Indies' favour. It was a cruel end to the game for Stokes, who had excelled in the field, taking four catches. He left the field in tears. England also got off to a horror start in their innings, with Jason Roy bowled through the gate from just the second ball of Samuel Badree's opening over. Alex Hales (1) and captain Eoin Morgan (5) followed soon after as they faltered to 23-3. This united England's best two batsmen at the crease with plenty of overs to attack and Joe Root and Jos Buttler steadied the ship before taking the game to their opponent to forge the best partnership of the innings - 61 from just under seven overs. However, Buttler fell just as he was looking to accelerate and Root was dismissed with just over five overs remaining as the pressure on his shoulders produced the first false shot of his innings - a mistimed, premeditated attempted scoop that gave a catch to short fine-leg Benn and Brathwaite the second of his three wickets. Only Willey would make another notable contribution, hitting two sixes and a four in a quick-fire 21 to help England to their modest and ultimately insufficient total. England captain Eoin Morgan: "It was filled with ups and downs. We let ourselves down with the bat and probably fell about 40 short. "The decision to open the bowling with Joe Root came about in the last couple of days and golden arm took two wickets in his first over. "Throughout this tournament we have shared a lot of good times but we are all in pain tonight. Ben [Stokes] plays all three formats, it will take him a while to come back but I have no doubts he will have a long career and do well in an England shirt." West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "This win is something we are going to cherish for a long time. We have 15 match-winners but nobody gave us a chance. "We felt disrespected by our board, [commentator] Mark Nicholas described us as having no brains and all this brought us together. The ability to put adversity aside and to play this type of cricket is just tremendous." England head coach Trevor Bayliss: "If you add up the white-ball cricket games these guys have played, it's a long way behind other teams. It's a promising side and the signs are good. "Whatever words I come up with the in the dressing room won't be enough. They're hurting, but it will steel them for the future. "We have still got work to do, but we have a lot of good players to work with. England cricket is in good hands." BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: "Four successive sixes to win, I have never seen that before. England looked absolutely crushed. It's really good to see a smile on the face of West Indies cricket. It's a unique brand of the game and it needs to be nurtured and encouraged." Former England spinner Vic Marks: "It was a staggeringly good final and a very good tournament. I feel desperately sorry for England who played so tenaciously to get back into the match, and especially for Ben Stokes. On the other hand you have to admire Brathwaite and the way he finished the game." BBC Test Match Special commentator Charles Dagnall: "An incredible tournament with an impossible end... Love T20. But feel for Stokes, like the penalty taker who misses in sudden death."	Carlos Brathwaite hit the first four balls of the final over for six as West Indies stunned England to win the World Twenty20.
So, it's no small achievement that Star Citizen's creator says he has raised more than $108m (Â£75m) to develop the title via online crowdfunding campaigns. In fact, it makes the sci-fi space simulator the biggest crowdfunded project of all time. Not bad considering its creator, Chris Roberts, had originally hoped to raise about a tenth of the amount. That would have funded a much smaller game than Star Citizen has evolved into, Roberts told the BBC. "I never thought we would raise the money we have, I was going to start more contained and over time its sort of filled out," he said. But with the title running years behind its originally announced schedule, he has still to prove he can meet the backers' expectations. Roberts is famous among video game fans for the popular 1990's spaceship combat Wing Commander series. The popularity of these games built Roberts a huge fan base, which dug into its own pockets to fund his new PC game. Roberts' development company is called Cloud Imperium. It operates four studios spread across three different countries (the US, UK and Germany), all working to realise Star Citizen's grand vision. It's what's known as a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, which allows the player to pilot space ships, big and small, and even become part of the crew on huge vessels. The universe is planned to be a huge explorable sandbox. Players should be able to engage in first-person combat, spaceship racing, visiting and exploring space stations and planets. It is a persistent universe of huge ambition - so ambitious it's taking much longer to develop than originally anticipated. The game was first announced back in 2012, with a release planned for 2014. But at present only small taster portions of the game are available to play. Inevitably some backers and internet observers have taken to forums and blogs to vent their anger at the delays. "People who make games are optimists," Roberts admits. "If you are building a two-bedroom house and suddenly change to building a castle it's going to be a different timeline." But he also thinks this game is far from unique when it comes to delays. "In the games business, games get cancelled all the time, games get pushed back and by the time you hear about the game it's probably been in development for years. "Things always took longer than anyone thought." He concedes that "there are always going to be some people that say, you told me it was going to be two years, I want it to be this big , I want it in two years." "That isn't necessarily possible," he adds. "Most of our customers aren't like that. They say: 'Take the time you need. If you need 10 years for a really great space game don't rush it out and make a bad one.'" With the development studios spread out across the US and Europe, Roberts is often travelling between them all, checking the progress of the individual teams. BBC Click visited the Los Angeles studio in California and the Wilmslow studio in the UK. The atmosphere inside the studios was almost identical: dozens of artists and designers working on spaceship designs and character animations as well as painstakingly sifting though lines of code in search of bugs. There was a sense of calm, but the size and complexity of the project is mind boggling to the outside observer. There are almost 300 people working on this game and they are taking advantage of their different time zones. The studio head in Los Angeles said that when a bug is found by his team, they can work on the problem and then, at the end of their day, hand it over to workers in the UK to crack, and vice-versa with bugs found at any of the other studios. They call this "follow the sun" development. It means that work on Star Citizen is pretty much a 24-hour operation. As well as the persistent universe there will also be a single player story-driven game called Squadron 42. It sounds very much like Roberts is working in familiar Wing Commander territory here. In Squadron 42 the player assumes the role of a rookie pilot, embroiled in a war with a vicious alien species. While the set-up is a little on the familiar side Roberts has assembled a star-studded cast for the game including Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Gillian Anderson. While the larger universe is still in development, Roberts says he aims to release Squadron 42 by the end of this year. So, it looks like we are going to have to wait a little bit longer to play the full Star Citizen experience.	Few video games have a budget as big.
It follows suggestions third-party software had been used to steal intimate photos of celebrities - posted online last month - from iCloud. The action should stop the tool from being able to infiltrate Apple's internet storage service if the safety measure is implemented. However, the security facility remains an opt-in choice. One expert suggested that Apple should instead make it the default option. The process works by introducing an extra step after an account holder has typed their username and password into a device they have not used before. They are also required to enter a four-digit code that is either texted to a trusted mobile phone number or sent via Apple's Find My iPhone app. If the person does not enter the code, they are refused access to iCloud and are blocked from making an iTunes, iBooks, or App Store purchase. They can, however, use a 14-character recovery key to regain access to the account in the event their trusted device is lost or stolen. They are told to keep this in a safe place to avoid being locked out. While Apple had offered the two-step verification system in the past, until now it had not come into play when device owners used the firm's back-up service. That meant that even if people had switched on the two-step feature to prevent cyber-thieves logging into their accounts with a stolen or guessed password, the attackers could still download a complete back-up of their data by using Elcomsoft's Phone Password Breaker. Several hackers' forums contain discussions about using of pirated copies of Elcomsoft's "forensic" software, which is marketed as a tool for law enforcement agencies to access iCloud content without needing to be in possession of a suspect's iPhone or iPad. ElmcomSoft's Moscow-based owner told the BBC earlier this month that he believed his software had been used in the recent hacks, as it was "the only one able to do that". He has now acknowledged that Apple's changes guard against the technique he had used. "I think that implementation is secure, and so there is no workaround," Vladimir Katalov told the BBC, adding that his program could no longer even get a list of devices and back-ups linked to a user's account. "The other security improvement, which I like, is that now the owner of the Apple account gets a notification by email immediately when a back-up starts downloading - whether or not two-factor authentication is enabled." However, he added that he still had concerns about Apple's security system. "The recovery key is hard to remember. And as far as you are not going to use it frequently - it is not needed at all while you have the trusted device handy - there is a good chance that you lose it," he said. "And if you lose your device too, there will be no way to get your data back. "Secondly, the recovery key might be stolen. And someone who managed to get your Apple ID password and your security key could make a lot of trouble for you, not just downloading your selfies." But another security expert downplayed the risk of lost recovery keys, and said that Apple should do more than just recommend people switch on the two-factor test. "We've seen so much in recent times that single-step verification - ie passwords - is vulnerable, we're at the stage that two-factor authentication should be the default," said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. "It's a case of turn it on by default, and let people turn it off if they really don't want it. "And that applies to not just Apple, but companies like Microsoft and Google too." Apple has told the Wall Street Journal that it "plans to more aggressively encourage people" to turn two-factor authentication on and use stronger passwords. "When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece," chief executive Tim Cook told the newspaper. "I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing."	Apple has expanded its use of "two-step verification" checks to protect data stored online by its customers.
SP Manweb is set to put up 18 pylons linking two wind farms in Clocaenog Forest with a substation at Glascoed, near St Asaph. The plans were approved by Energy Secretary Greg Clark last year. Opponents argued it would impact the countryside and farming, and called for the cables to be laid underground. The judicial review focused on the impact the scheme would have on a Grade II-listed farm complex at Berain, near Llannefydd, which was home to Katheryn of Berain, a descendant of Henry VII. But the presiding judge, Mr Justice Lewis, ruled that Mr Clark had applied the relevant policies when deciding whether to give the application the go ahead.	A legal challenge to try and stop overhead cables being erected across parts of rural Conwy and Denbighshire has been dismissed by the High Court.

City will pay an initial £28.5m for the Argentina international, who was named in La Liga's 2014-15 team of the season and played in the Copa America final. "To be here inside a club that looks so wonderful from the outside is a dream," said the 27-year-old ex-Porto player. City manager Manuel Pellegrini said: "He's strong, he's excellent in the tackle and he's very good technically." The Chilean added: "He is an established international for one of the best nations in world football and I have no doubt that he has the right mentality to fit into a squad where he will find many familiar faces, including Eliaquim [Mangala] and Fernando, who he played alongside in Portugal." Former Argentina coach Diego Maradona gave Otamendi his first senior cap when he was called up for the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Panama. He was a member of the squad that qualified for the tournament in South Africa, but was dropped by coach Alejandro Sabella for the World Cup in Brazil four years later. Otamendi is City's third major summer signing following the arrival of England internationals Raheem Sterling and Fabian Delph. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Manchester City have signed defender Nicolas Otamendi from Valencia on a five-year deal worth £32m.
After two hours of talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, he said that the "two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this relationship". Although there was some "common ground" on Syria, "broad differences" remained. Mr Lavrov said the two sides needed to overcome "time-bomb issues" inherited from Barack Obama's administration. Tensions have risen since a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead. The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government, and the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase in response. Syria denied carrying out the chemical attack and has the support of its main ally, Russia, which on Wednesday vetoed a motion brought to the UN Security Council which would have required Bashar al-Assad's government to co-operate with investigators. It is the eighth time Moscow has used its veto to protect Syria. Both Mr Tillerson and Mr Lavrov said the discussions were frank. Mr Tillerson said: "I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. There is a low level of trust between our two countries." He added: "We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of greatest importance to both of us." It was a view echoed by President Donald Trump later, who said at a press briefing with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: "We may be at an all-time low in terms of our relationship with Russia." Mr Trump said "it would be a fantastic thing" if the nations improved ties, but warned "it may be just the opposite". Mr Lavrov said a pragmatic conversation was needed to remove the "irritants that piled up under the Obama administration". Both ministers said there was agreement on working towards a stable and unified Syria, and in defeating so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Both agreed to work towards an international investigation of the chemical attack. But it was obvious there were many differences. Mr Tillerson said there was clear evidence that the recent chemical attack "was planned, directed and executed by Syrian regime forces". He said the reign of Bashar al-Assad must end and that Mr Trump's description of the Syrian president as "an animal" was "a characterisation President Assad has brought on himself". Mr Lavrov said there was no evidence Syria was behind the chemical attack and pointed to the turmoil that had been brought to other nations when leaders had been removed. There was little concrete to come from the meeting, although the fact Mr Putin granted Mr Tillerson an audience - which had been in doubt - was a measure of success. Mr Putin did say he was ready to restore the US-Russia air safety agreement over Syria, and Mr Tillerson said there would be working groups set up on smaller issues. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Lavrov said Russia had "a lot of questions regarding very ambiguous and contradictory ideas... coming from Washington". Afterwards he said "we understand each other better" and there were "many prospects for co-operation with the US". He said there were "certain time-bomb issues inherited from the previous administration - we know to overcome these obstacles we have to make efforts and that the Americans must move towards us as well". Earlier, the US and Russian presidents revealed the wide gulf between them over Syria. Referring to Mr Assad in a Fox Business Network interview, Mr Trump said: "Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person... if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now." He later called Mr Assad a "butcher". Speaking on Mir television, Mr Putin rejected allegations that Syria was behind the chemical attack, saying Syria had given up its chemical stockpile. He said: "Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any." Referring to the US air strike, he said: "But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact." And despite hopes that US-Russia ties would improve under a Trump presidency, Mr Putin said: "One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved, but rather has deteriorated."	US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says ties with Russia are at a low point and must improve.
Kazi Islam was said to have used "flattery and threats" in exchanges on social media to try to persuade Harry Thomas to kill two soldiers and buy ingredients for a pipe bomb. Islam, 18, of Newham, east London, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of preparing to commit acts of terrorism. He claimed he was conducting research. Islam was convicted by a majority of 10 to two and will be sentenced on 29 May. He was remanded in custody and told by Judge Richard Marks that a custodial sentence was inevitable. The trial was told Islam befriended the then 19-year-old Mr Thomas in October 2013 - five months after Fusilier Rigby was attacked in the street near Woolwich Barracks - after meeting him the previous year on an IT course at college. He had pretended to sympathise with Mr Thomas over a break-up with a girlfriend. But a series of exchanges on BlackBerry Messenger and social media sites were uncovered when police raided the house in east London where Islam lived with his family, jurors were told. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Thomas, who has learning difficulties, described Islam as a "very, very manipulative person" but said he had no intention of carrying out his requests. He said: "He makes out he's this really kind person because that's how he comes across at first but deep inside he's evil." Mr Thomas added: "He's not scared to go to prison, he told me that.  And he says he'll end up in a better place for the crimes he's committed. He said his God will look after him and think he's done a really good thing." Commander Richard Walton, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said: "We continue to appeal to anyone who may have knowledge of people with similar intentions. The earliest we can intervene to prevent terrorism the better. "We also remind the public that there is currently a need to protect vulnerable or impressionable adults or children from this brand of Islamic extremism." Prosecutor Annabel Darlow QC had told the court that Islam had tried to encourage Mr Thomas to kill a soldier by telling him innocent children were being murdered by military forces. Ms Darlow told the jury: "Thomas was a vulnerable, not particularly bright young man who was desperate to impress Islam and to try and forge some sort of friendship with him. "Islam ruthlessly exploited to the utmost Thomas's vulnerability and obvious wish to try and ingratiate himself with Islam." The plot was said to have been unwittingly sabotaged by Mr Thomas, who failed to buy any of the right ingredients for a bomb and revealed what was going on to "a few friends" . Giving evidence, Islam told the jury he had talked to Mr Thomas about getting the ingredients for a bomb as an "experiment" in radicalisation and "would have told him what I was doing" if he had actually gone ahead with the purchases. While the court heard he had also downloaded a document on explosives himself, Islam said his interest in extremism was "purely for research purposes and to understand the political side of my religion".	A teenager has been convicted of grooming a vulnerable young man after being inspired by the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.
The allegations were made in a BBC Spotlight programme on Tuesday. Mr Adams has denied any involvement  in the murder of Mr Donaldson in 2006. In a statement, BBC Spotlight said: "The Spotlight programme dealt with matters of great public interest and the BBC stands by its journalism." A lawyer for the Donaldson family spoke to the BBC on Friday after meeting Garda Deputy Assistant Commissioner Derek Byrne and two other senior police officers. Ciaran Shiels said the officers provided an update on progress in their investigation during the meeting in Belfast. "The one theme that has come out of today's meeting is that the theory that was being advanced by BBC Spotlight earlier this week, that this was in some way carried out by the Provisional IRA or authorised by Gerry Adams, I think it's absolute nonsense," he said. Asked how the family responded to the claims that Mr Donaldson was killed by the Provisional IRA, and that the killing had been sanctioned by the Sinn Féin leader, Mr Shiels said: "It just does not stand up. "It does not marry in any way with the lines of inquiry that have been progressed by the guards ([Garda] or by the the (police) ombudsman." A man who said he worked as an informer for the intelligence branch of the police told Spotlight that he had been told the Provisional IRA had killed him. The former spy, who was in the IRA and Sinn Féin., told the programme that in his experience such a murder would have to have been sanctioned by Gerry Adams. The man could  not be identified because of fears about his safety. What Spotlight was told Agent: I know from my experience in the IRA that murders have to be approved by the leadership. They have to be given approval by the leadership of the IRA and the military leadership of the IRA. Presenter: Who are you specifically referring to? Agent: Gerry Adams, he gives the final say. Mr Donaldson was shot dead in a remote cottage in Donegal in April 2006, months after admitting that he had been an MI5 agent for more than 20 years. Three years later, the Real IRA said it was responsible. Mr Donaldson had worked for Sinn Féin as an administrator at Stormont.	The family of murdered Sinn Féin official Denis Donaldson have said they do not believe the Provisional IRA killed him, or that his shooting was authorised by Gerry Adams.
The Hugh Fraser Foundation has pledged £300,000, with £250,000 to come from the Cameron Mackintosh Foundation. GSA aims to raise £20m to restore the famous building which was badly damaged by fire on 23 May. The most recent pledges and individual donations by members of the public mean the fund currently stands at £6.4m This figure is made up of the Hugh Fraser Foundation £300,000; the Cameron Mackintosh Foundation £250,000; £150,000 in individual donations; £700,000 of Scottish government match funding (increasing to a total of £5m in line with future donations) and a £5m pledge from the UK government. The Hugh Fraser Foundation was established in 1960 by Sir Hugh Fraser with shares in House of Fraser and other investments. Dr Kenneth Chrystie, chairman of the Hugh Fraser Foundation, said the trustees were clear that they "wished to make a major and public show of support" for GSA following the fire. "We felt that it was a great privilege to be able to support the GSA to begin the process of reconstruction and recovery," he said. "I am confident that the fundraising appeal will attract world-wide support from those who share with us the desire to see the school not only recover, but regain momentum towards its future success." Firefighters managed to save 90% of the building, named after internationally renowned designer and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and 70% of its contents. GSA estimates the cost of restoring the building to be between £20m and £35m and believes the work could take up to four years. The appeal fund, which has Hollywood star Brad Pitt and Dr Who actor Peter Capaldi among its trustees, was set up last month to help raise £20m. British theatre producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh said that he hoped the donation through his foundation would encourage others to follow. "It is hardly surprising the tragic news of the fire spread globally and we are all encouraged by the GSA's clear determination to restore the wonderful building," he said. "My admiration for Charles Rennie Mackintosh and my personal passion for original architectural design makes me even more pleased to be able to become one of the first donors to your appeal. "The contribution from my foundation will, I hope, encourage others to follow suit and it comes with enormous gratitude and respect for what you have achieved and will continue to do." GSA director Professor Tom Inns said everyone at the school had "been moved by the incredible generosity" they had been shown since the fire. "The GSA has been honoured to have the financial and personal support of the Hugh Fraser Foundation over many years, and this most recent donation is very much appreciated," he said. "The kind words of Sir Cameron and the support of The Mackintosh Foundation are also most welcome at this difficult time. "I would also like to extend the heartfelt thanks of The Glasgow School of Art to all the institutions and individuals who have donated to the appeal to date. "This support along with the many, many messages of good will and offers of academic and other expert support have meant so much to us."	A fund set up to help restore Glasgow School of Art's (GSA) fire-damaged Mackintosh building has received two donations totalling £550,000.
The area's MP Brendan O'Hara is hosting a reception detailing plans for the former Nato base at Machrihanish to be the centre of space tourism in the UK. Machrihanish is among five sites across Britain - three of which are in Scotland - hoping to be a spaceport. The UK government has previously said it wanted to establish a spaceport by the end of 2018. It launched a consultation in 2014 and two years ago it drew up a shortlist of potential sites. These also included Prestwick in South Ayrshire, Stornoway in the Western Isles, Newquay airport in Cornwall and Llanbedr airport in the Snowdonia National Park. In May last year, the government included plans for spaceport licensing in its Queen's Speech. It also opened up the competition in favour of an airport-style licensing system, meaning any suitable location could become a spaceport. The Department for Transport said this would help create "viable business models at a range of locations". This meant that Prestwick and Campbeltown are both vying to attract investment to prove they are "best-placed" to become the UK's first operational spaceport. Ministers said any future spaceport would be used as a base for space travel and tourism, as well as satellite launches. The Machrihanish base, near Campbeltown, has twice been approved for space flight and was a certified emergency landing site in Europe ahead of a launch of the NASA Space Shuttle in 1981. Tom Millar, chairman of DiscoverSpace UK and the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company, said the local community was behind the bid and the potential economic benefits it could bring. He added: "Our site offers enormous scope with a runway of more than 3,000 metres and large areas of land available for development, allied to a positive and supportive planning framework put in place by Argyll and Bute Council. "Our safety case is very strong as the site is in a depopulated area and offers the ability to launch directly over the sea." Brendan O'Hara, the SNP MP for Argyll and Bute, said basing the spaceport in Kintyre was a "no-brainer". He added: "A spaceport would bring important economic benefits to Argyll and Bute and it is a hugely exciting prospect for Scotland to be at the forefront of space travel in the UK. The sky is not the limit."	Plans for the UK's first spaceport on the Kintyre peninsula are being unveiled at Westminster.
Councillors have discussed plans aimed at improving the city's transport network and changing its image as what a report calls a "motorway city". City Square could be closed off to through traffic by 2021, as could Neville Street that runs past Bridgewater Place into the city centre. The move forms part of the city's 2023 European Capital of Culture bid. The plan was to get more people cycling and walking around the city, the report said. Cycles, buses and taxis would still be allowed in City Square that lies close to the railway station. Councillor Richard Lewis said: "It's about how me make the city both liveable and prosperous in the future." An upgrade of Armley Gyratory, one of the busiest junctions in the city, was also in the council's plans, he said. There were still many details to be worked out and there would be feasibility studies and consultations, Mr Lewis added. The plans are part of a discussion on a 20-year vision for the city. The HS2 high-speed rail network is planned to stop at a new city centre station in Leeds by 2032/33. The council must register its capital of culture interest by December 2016 and submit a final bid in 2017. The winning bid is expected to be announced in 2018.	Parts of Leeds city centre could be closed to traffic in a bid to make the city less "road heavy".
L/Cpl James Brynin, who served with the 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), was shot while on patrol in Helmand Province on 15 October. The 22-year-old, who was born in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, joined the Army in February 2011 and entered the Intelligence Corps. He was repatriated via RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. L/Cpl Brynin worked as an intelligence analyst and had been selected for promotion to corporal when his patrol was attacked in Kakaran, north east of Lashkar Gah. L/Cpl Brynin, known as Jay, received immediate medical attention but died from his injuries at the scene. After his initial training, he was posted to 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), which is based at Cawdor Barracks in Pembrokeshire, and had already served a tour in Afghanistan in 2012. He returned to Afghanistan this August as an intelligence analyst working for a light electronic warfare team (LEWT) within the Brigade Reconnaissance Force (BRF) of 7th Armoured Brigade. In a tribute, L/Cpl Brynin's family said: "Heart of a lion, we will always stand strong for you. We will never forget. Rest in peace." Lt Col Mark Purves, commanding officer 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), said: "Bright and engaging, Lance Corporal Brynin was immensely popular and an outstanding soldier in every respect. "Having already completed one tour to Afghanistan, his appointment to support the Brigade Reconnaissance Force was indicative of his talent and leadership qualities. "He was fit, determined and genuinely wanted to make a difference."	A soldier who was killed while on patrol in Afghanistan has been repatriated to the UK.
Stoneman, who resumed on 83, reached 111 before he was run out to leave the visitors 252-7, still 13 runs behind. Paul Coughlin (49) and John Hastings took them ahead, but both fell to Rikki Clarke after lunch and Keith Barker finished the innings with his fifth wicket as Durham were all out for 327. Warwickshire lost two quick wickets but Ian Westwood (32no) saw them to 63-2. The win, which earned the home side a maximum 24 points, saw them maintain their unbeaten start to the season in Division One, while Durham have now lost two games, but remain second. However, the match will be remembered primarily for Barker's efforts with both bat and ball as he narrowly missed out on becoming the first Warwickshire player since 1911 to score a century and take 10 wickets in a first-class game - as his 5-103 gave him match figures of 9-157. Resuming on 189-4, still needing 76 runs to make the hosts bat again, Clarke removed skipper Paul Collingwood lbw early on although the former England batsman looked from from impressed with the decision. Stoneman soon brought up his first century of the season from 179 balls, but Durham were further in trouble when the out-of-form Phil Mustard edged Barker to William Porterfield at third slip. Then, just as it looked he would take Durham into the lead, Stoneman was farcically run out from the non-striker's end as he went for a single, but was sent back by Coughlin and 17-year-old substitute fielder Aaron Thomason swooped to send the ball back to Jeetan Patel who whipped off the bails. Coughlin and Hastings upped the scoring rate before lunch with a fifty stand, but any hopes of saving the game were extinguished shortly after the interval when both were out to Clarke (3-61) in the same over. Barker ended the innings when he had Chris Rushworth caught by Clarke to finish with his 10th five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. Requiring just 63 for victory, but without captain Varun Chopra who was hit on the leg while fielding, the hosts soon found themselves 12-2 after Porterfield fell third ball and Jonathan Trott was run out. Westwood and Laurie Evans steadied any nerves to see their side home in 17.4 overs. Warwickshire all-rounder Keith Barker: "In these last two games we have been more 'Warwickshire' than we had before and hopefully we can carry that on. "I think we will always be up there or thereabouts in Championship cricket especially. "It is just a question of getting on a roll and making sure we are in contention towards the end of the season." Durham coach Jon Lewis: "We were pretty positive this morning. We felt that with six wickets left we were in with a chance of making something of the day. "Mark played really well but the run-out wasn't a great piece of communication, and unfortunately Mark was the victim. "It's a busy time coming up but we've shown resilience before. I'd like to not have to show resilience after defeat but that's something we're going to have to do."	Warwickshire wrapped up an eight-wicket victory over Durham despite a battling century from opener Mark Stoneman.
As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. "I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' "He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' "So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'" Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. "I'm up for use any time," he said. "If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!" But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.) "MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it," he said. "All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know. "'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy." Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. "He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his." In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â£5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â£4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. "Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. "Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. "Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole." One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked "secret", to his minister of defence. "I do not understand," he wrote, "how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? "I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters." And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as "the D notice affair" began with a "walk-in", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. "I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay," he said. "When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts."	Chapman Pincher was known as "the lone wolf of Fleet Street".

Solly Msimanga, from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said the vehicles would instead be given to a police anti-hijack unit. However, he will continue to use the luxury car used by the previous mayor. The DA took control of Tshwane, a metropolitan area including the capital Pretoria, from the African National Congress (ANC) in local elections. Mr Msimanga said no more luxury cars would be bought under his leadership. He took over from the governing ANC, which lost control of  the capital for the first time since 1994, last month. More on this and other African stories Four things from South Africa election The ANC bought 10 new BMW 3 series vehicles, which are yet to be delivered, for 5 million rand ($356,000; £266,000), local reports say. The cars were meant for members of the mayoral council, with the ANC said to be confident it would retain control of the municipality in the elections. He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website. Mr Msimanga's spokesman Matthew Gerstner told the BBC that this vehicle could not "be dispensed with because it's been bought and paid for already and treasury regulations prohibit that". He added: "But, as soon as he can replace it, he will, with a sensible, low-cost vehicle". Mr Msimango says the DA-led coalition government wanted to embark on cost-cutting measures. He said in a statement: "No new luxury cars will be bought or leased for politicians‚ and if vehicles currently owned by Tshwane require replacement‚ sensible and low-cost vehicles will be procured. "I will not allow public money to be spent on luxury cars‚ while our people struggle for services‚ houses and jobs. "A Hyundai i20 or Toyota Corolla can do the same job for a politician as an expensive sedan." The ANC national government has been criticised for wasteful expenditure, so South Africans will be closely watching what the opposition do differently in the key urban areas they won in the August elections, says the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg. South Africans will be keen to see if the opposition, which has until now only run one province, will be able to make good on its ambitious election promises, our correspondent says.	A new mayor in South Africa says he will give away a fleet of new luxury cars ordered by his predecessors.
The 28-year-old has scored 37 goals in 98 appearances since joining the Lions from non-league Halifax in 2014. "Lee committing his future to us is a big boost for everybody and a sensible decision from the boy," boss Neil Harris told the club website. "He has played his best football under me and he is a big part of this squad."	Striker Lee Gregory has signed a new contract with League One side Millwall, which will keep him at The Den until the summer of 2018.
In a match reduced to 17 overs per side at Old Trafford, only seven were possible with Lancashire on 39-0. But Warwickshire's win at Yorkshire and Worcestershire's victory over Notts saw the 2014 champions finish fifth in the North Group with a worse net run-rate. Lancashire remain bottom of the group with just two wins. Following a delay of more than four hours, play eventually got under way at 18:15 BST with each innings reduced to 24 overs, and Lancashire's Karl Brown raced to 30 not out. The players went off for rain 30 minutes later, but it was hoped they could start again at 19:45 BST, with the match now 17 overs for each team. However, the weather closed in again and they did not return - meaning both sides take one point.	Durham were eliminated from the One-Day Cup after their match against Lancashire was abandoned and other results went against them.
But Ms Atwell has promised to donate the money from the Global Teacher Prize to the school that she founded. There was one UK representative in the top 10, Richard Spencer, who teaches science in Middlesbrough. The prize was created to raise the status of teaching. The winner of the inaugural Global Teacher Prize, who received her award at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai on Sunday, was recognised for her work in teaching reading and writing. On receiving the award, she said it was a "privilege" to work as a teacher and to help young people. Giving away the prize money was "not being selfless, but being committed to public service", she said. Former US president, Bill Clinton, told the audience that he could still remember almost all the names of his teachers and that the prize would help to remind the public of the importance of the profession. It was "critically important" to "attract the best people into teaching" and to hold them in "high regard", said Mr Clinton. In 1990, Ms Atwell founded a school, the Center for Teaching and Learning in Edgecomb, Maine, where ideas for improving the teaching of reading and writing could be tested and shared. This school, which will receive Ms Atwell's prize cash, has a library in every room and pupils read an average of 40 books a year. She is also a prolific author, with nine books published about teaching, including In The Middle, which sold half a million copies. The award has been created by the Varkey Foundation, the charitable arm of the GEMS education group, as a high-profile way of demonstrating the importance of teaching. The attention-grabbing top prize is meant to show that teaching should be recognised as much as other high-paying careers, such as finance or sport. "We introduced the prize in order to return teachers to their rightful position, belonging to one of the most respected professions in society," said Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation. The prize is "not only about money, it's also about unearthing thousands of stories of inspiration", he said. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, said that the status of teachers was reflected in international test results, with a high value put on teaching in high-performing Asian countries. "Where teachers feel that society values their job, outcomes can be a lot better," he said Among those supporting the project have been Bill Gates, UK Prime Minister David Cameron, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai. The winner was one of three US entries in the final top 10, which included Stephen Ritz, a teacher in the South Bronx in New York, who has developed a project growing food in the inner city, so that pupils can eat healthily as well as learning. Ahead of the announcement of the winner, the US secretary for education, Arne Duncan, rang the US finalists to congratulate them. Another finalist was Phalla Neang from Cambodia, who has been working with blind students in that country since the 1990s. She helped to develop a Braille version of the Khmer language and worked to prevent blind children from being treated as "outcasts" by the education system. Richard Spencer, who teaches science at Middlesbrough College in the north east of England, was commended for his success in making science accessible, with an active style of teaching that includes using song and dance. The international panel of judges included educators, entrepreneurs and leaders of education charities. The 10 finalists were: Nancie Atwell, US Guy Etienne, Haiti Jacqueline Jumbe-Kahura, Kenya Neang Phalla, Cambodia Stephen Ritz, US Azizullah Royesh, Afghanistan Kiran Bir Sethi, India Madenjit Singh, Malaysia Richard Spencer, UK Naomi Volain, US	Nancie Atwell, an English teacher from Maine in the United States, has been named as the winner of a competition to find the world's best teacher, with a prize of $1m (Â£680,000).
And it's tucked away for a very good reason. Inside, your senses are greeted by the smell of rotting dog food, the buzz of blowflies and the purple UV light of the fly killer ready to zap escapees. This is where the museum's forensic entomologists breed different species of fly in a bid to help the police solve crimes. Museum scientist Amoret Whitaker is one of just three forensic entomologists in the UK who regularly works with the police to determine the time of death of a corpse. "As soon as a person dies, their body starts to decompose and they give off specific odours. These different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects. And in the inital stages it's especially blowflies." "So when someone dies, fairly soon, it could be within minutes blowflies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately. These will hatch into larvae or maggots and the developmental cycle will continue." "You get a lot of male blowflies hanging around, sitting on plants around the body, waiting for suitable female mates." And it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone's death. By understanding the "succession" rates or the speed of growth of flies, from an egg to the larval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died. But scientists only have developmental data on perhaps half of the twelve or so species of fly that are regulary found on dead bodies. By breeding them in "captivity" under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death. The accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been decomposing. If she can get to see a corpse within days of its death,  when that person died can be worked out to an accuracy within hours. But, if the body has lain undiscovered for weeks, or even months, then the precision of timing can be narrowed to a matter of days. This timing can even be used to help determine whether a suspicious death should be treated as murder. "In some cases of assault, if someone has been seen leaving a pub after a fight say, then that person is found dead a few days later, if we can determine when they died to a matter of hours, we can help establish whether the person died from the assault or other causes." The time of year can dramatically affect how a body decomposes. In one case Amoret and colleagues were involved in, a man disappeared in November but his body was not discovered until the following February. One pathologist report suggested the body had been dead for just a few weeks. In fact because he had died in winter his body had effectively been "mummified". The critical evidence came from Calliphora vicina, a bluebottle blowfly often found on dead bodies. C vicina grows all year round but in winter its development slows right down. While it remains alive, it becomes inactive at temperatures below 1C. This peculiarly slow rate of development meant Amoret and colleagues could prove the man had died months ago rather than weeks. The man had left a pub, taken a short-cut home then slipped and broken his neck. The police regularly use Amoret and her colleagues' expertise. "We can go two months with nothing but then be asked to help with six cases in a couple of weeks." "It's rare that our evidence is used in court. It's more common that we give police a time window and they can then gather further evidence." Forensic entomology can even be used in cases of burnt bodies, as insects may still be found, feeding within the body cavities. If a cadaver has been burnt this makes estimating time of death difficult for the pathologist. Between working with police in the UK and research at the Natural History Museum, Amoret also works at the anthropology department at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. There she compares the decomposition of dead pigs and human cadavers. Some people have nicknamed this place the "body farm". In the summers of 2008 and 2009 she compared the decomposition of three pigs and three human cadavers. Her research isn't finalised but initial results are positive, confirming that pigs are a good model for how a human corpse decays. "The same species of insects are attracted during the same time periods to both types of cadaver.  Large numbers of blowflies from days 1-5, fewer on days 6-7, and a large drop from day eight onwards," she told BBC News. She also says this research will be very useful for all cases where insect evidence is used. "This work will have a big impact when it's published, for forensic entomologists all over the world.  As it will show that pigs are a good model for humans, and therefore all the data gathered using pig cadavers can be applied to cases involving human cadavers." Amoret Whitaker is just one of the scientists demonstrating their research at the one night only event "After Hours: Science Uncovered" at the Natural History Museum on Friday 24th September between 1600 and 2200	At the top of a long staircase in a room in a tower, far away from the throng of visitors and other scientists and laboratories is the Natural History Museum's insectory.
University of Brighton student Janet Muller, 21, from Eastbourne, was found by fire crews in a Volkswagen Jetta in Ifield, West Sussex, on Friday. Christopher Jeffrey-Shaw, 26. from Lakeside, Beckenham in south London, is due to appear at Guildford Magistrates' Court on Thursday. The cause of Miss Muller's death was smoke inhalation. The student, who was based at the university's Eastbourne campus, had been reported missing from Mill View Hospital in Hove on Thursday.	A man has been charged with the murder of a student whose body was discovered in the boot of a burning car.
This is not because of panic, but possibly as a way of suppressing it. As one MP put it: "The wise heads will need to tell any hotheads to calm down." The prime minister will meet her internal critics head on. Having phoned over the weekend candidates who were defeated in an election she didn't need to call, she will find that many of those who escaped that fate are cross. But widespread demands for her to go are not expected. Instead, there will be demands for her to consult more, including meeting regularly with the 1922 executive, and to turn Downing Street from a bunker into an open house by broadening her range of staff. However, few MPs expect her position to be strong and stable for the next five years. One senior backbencher told me: "It is inconceivable she will lead the party into the next election. Her authority has been diminished unquestionably." Another said: "Party members have been too bruised by her." "She has bought herself some time", said a senior backbencher, but added: "How she behaves will determine how long she's there." There is a feeling that the party is holding on to nurse for fear of something worse. "There is zero appetite for another election," as one MP put it, and a feeling that, in an early poll, victory wouldn't be guaranteed. Some say Labour's digital campaign and mobilisation of young people was particularly impressive, and another election would give Jeremy Corbyn the opportunity to do what he does best - campaign. Equally, a leadership election could be destabilising ahead of Brexit talks - though it's widely expected one will take place well before 2022. Some kind of arrangement with the DUP is seen as inevitable, but one MP cautioned "the devil is in the detail". One of the reasons the 1922 meeting has been moved forward is so any deal can be discussed before it is sealed. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that the most flexible of arrangements is likely to be put in place; one that would mean there would have to be negotiations with the DUP on an issue-by-issue basis. Theresa May is expected to hear strong criticisms of what one backbencher dubbed "her miserable manifesto". Of course, some individual policies, such as social care - "It went down like a lead balloon" - will be singled out, but the presentation of policy will also be attacked. MPs will say that an effective fourfold lifting of the floor on residential care costs wasn't widely understood. And a campaign which barely mentioned the economy will come under fire. "We didn't dodge a bullet but were winged," said one. "If Labour had a more credible leader we could have been in even bigger difficulties." There has been speculation that there may now be a "softer Brexit", partly because of an influx of Scottish MPs who favour close trading relationships with the EU, but also because of the elevation of Damian Green to First Secretary of State. He is a friend of Mrs May's, a Remainer in the referendum campaign, and he has warned that concessions may have to be made in negotiations. But some senior Tories have told me that they will urge her to stick to her manifesto commitments on Brexit and, for them, controls on immigration and coming out of the single market are "bottom lines". Others will want to insist on the freedom to strike trade deals, so coming out of the customs union is seen as essential. "We must hold our nerve on Brexit," said one. However, another senior backbencher recognised that it would now be inevitable that Parliament would have greater influence over the process. "She will be walking a tightrope", and, while MPs seem to see the necessity, in the words of one former minister, to "shore her up in the short term", if she stumbles, she can fall at any time.	A meeting of the Conservative Party's influential backbench 1922 committee - in effect all Conservative backbenchers - has been brought forward by 24 hours to 17:00 BST on Monday.

"I have just been to see Her Majesty the Queen and I will now form a majority Conservative government. "I have been proud to lead the first coalition government in 70 years and I want to thank all those who worked so hard to make it a success, and in particular, on this day, Nick Clegg. "Elections can be bruising clashes of ideas and arguments and a lot of people who believe profoundly in public service have seen that service cut short. "Ed Miliband rang me this morning to wish me luck with the new government. It was a typically generous gesture from someone who is clearly in public service for all the right reasons. "The government I led did important work. It laid the foundations for a better future and now we must build on them. "I truly believe we are on the brink of something special in our country. We can make Britain a place where a good life is in reach for everyone who is willing to work and do the right thing. "Our manifesto is a manifesto for working people and as a majority government we will be able to deliver all of it. Indeed it is the reason why I think majority government is more accountable. "Three million apprenticeships, more help with childcare, helping 30m people cope with the cost of living by cutting their taxes. Building homes that people are able to buy and own. "Creating millions more jobs that give people the chance of a better future. And yes, we will deliver that in-out referendum on our future in Europe. "As we conduct this vital work we must ensure that we bring our country together. As I said in the small hours of this morning, we will govern as a party of one nation, one United Kingdom. That means ensuring this recovery reaches all parts of our country, from north to south, from east to west. "And indeed it means rebalancing our economy - building that northern powerhouse. It means giving everyone in our country a chance - so no matter where you're from, you have the opportunity to make the most of your life. "It means giving the poorest people the chance of training, a job, and hope for the future. It means that for children who don't get the best start in life, there must be the nursery education and good schooling that can transform their life chances. "And of course it means bringing together the different nations of our United Kingdom. I have always believed in governing with respect. That's why in the last parliament we devolved power to Scotland and Wales - and gave the people of Scotland a referendum on whether to stay inside the UK. "In this parliament, I will stay true to my word and implement as fast as I can the devolution that all parties agreed for Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Governing with respect means recognising that the different nations of our United Kingdom have their own governments, as well as the UK government. "Both are important and indeed with our plans the governments of these nations will become more powerful with wider responsibilities. In Scotland, our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world, with important powers over taxation. And no constitutional settlement will be complete if it did not offer also fairness to England. "When I stood here five years ago, our country was in the grip of an economic crisis. Five years on, Britain is so much stronger. But the real opportunities lie ahead. "Everything I have seen over the last five years, and indeed during this election campaign, has proved once again that this is a country with unrivalled skills and creativeness, a country with such good humour and such great compassion. "And I am convinced that if we draw on all of this, then we can take these islands, with our proud history, and build an even prouder future. "Together, we can make Great Britain greater still."

A spokesperson said it had taken the move because the post violates Facebook's community standards. It comes after a series of paramilitary-style attacks in the Turf Lodge area. The PSNI said they were not linking the post to recent shootings at this stage. Police said such paramilitary style attacks in west Belfast had doubled in 2016 compared to 2015. The police figures do not take into account the Turf Lodge shootings. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, before the post was removed, Sinn Féin MLA, Pat Sheehan, said that some people on the list had already been shot. Mr Sheehan said the name of the 26-year-old, who was shot in both legs on Tuesday night, was on the list. "My understanding is that this man's name has appeared on a list on social media, a list that contains eight names and photographs of people," he said. Mr Sheehan added that the list accuses people of so-called joy riding. There have been a number of shootings since the beginning of the year. Mr Sheehan said: "A number of people on this list have already been shot and it's my understanding that police have begun to visit others whose names are on this list to warn them about their security. He said the community did not believe there was a drugs link to the attacks. "The people who have been shot, and I exclude the couple from last week, mostly have been involved in anti-social behaviour and petty crime. "It's a well-known fact that these people who are carrying out the shootings actually tax drug dealers and if these people pay up their tax, they aren't being shot. "The community is having to deal with the fall-out of all of this," he added. West Belfast People Before Profit MLA, Gerry Carroll, said he was "deeply concerned" that an "apparent hit list" of people had been published on social media, with three of those on the list being the victims of recent punishment shootings. "So-called punishment shootings are inherently undemocratic, inhumane and wrong," he said. "Nobody in west Belfast selected the individuals who compiled this list as their judge, jury and executioner. This is a community that understands the effects of repression and injustice. "People don't want an even more repressive 'punishment' system foisted upon them without their say."	Facebook has confirmed that it has removed a post on its site which included names and photographs of people accused of anti-social behaviour in west Belfast.
The International Cycling Union (UCI) said it was "extremely unhappy" with the poster which shows a hand moving towards a girl's backside. "We have reminded the organiser of its responsibility," said a UCI statement. The poster mimics the antics of 2014 winner Peter Sagan who pinched a podium girl at the 2013 Tour of Flanders. Although the UCI press release states that organisers have agreed to remove the poster, which also carries the tagline, 'Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?', it is still being used to promote the event on social media. In 2014 UCI president Brian Cookson described a cycling team's kit as "unacceptable by any standards" after it appeared to make the female riders look naked. Photos of the Colombian team's outfit for the Giro della Toscana in Italy showed what seemed to be a skin-coloured fabric around their waist and hips and caused controversy on social media. The E3 Harelbeke, which is on 27 March this year, starts and finishes in Harelbeke and covers 210kms of the Flanders region. The race is part of the UCI World Tour and is regarded as a preparation for the  seven Spring Classics which include the Tour of Flanders..	Cycling's governing body has condemned E3 Harelbeke organisers for a controversial billboard poster that promotes this year's race in Belgium.
First one of the Yazidi women started crying, then one of her friends. And then one of the visitors could be heard stifling a sob. We were listening as a group of Yazidis recounted the now horribly familiar story of how IS came to their homeland on Mount Sinjar in 2014, killing thousands and driving many thousands more into exile. "Some of our neighbours were running away, but before reaching the mountains, Islamic State gangs captured them and took them," one of the women said. "The men were killed, and the women and children taken. "So many died." None of these women wanted to give their name. The experience of two years ago has apparently left them with a deeply ingrained sense of fear - of other people, and of the future: "They might be able to drive Islamic State out of our area, but it would be very difficult for us to return to where we came from, because we're scared something might happen," one of the women said. "They might come back." The possibility of returning is on the minds of many Iraqis, as IS comes under sustained attack in Mosul and is defeated outright elsewhere. But even Yazidis not scared to go home would find it extremely difficult because the city of Sinjar and the villages that surround it have been so thoroughly destroyed. "From houses to roads to bridges, the area is razed to the ground," says Dara Yara, a minister in the Iraqi government, with responsibility for housing and construction. He makes no bones about the long time it will take before they can even start proper rebuilding in the Yazidi areas. "This kind of situation needs peace, stability. This is a long process," he says. For now, many Yazidis languish in refugee camps, contemplating another winter under canvas. Others have given up on the idea of returning home, and have sought asylum in Europe and North America. It is a trend that worries Luqman Suleiman, a teacher, who also takes people round the Yazidis' most holy temple, in the town of Lalish. "They want to go to Germany, to France, to Australia," he says. "There is no future for the Yazidis in Kurdistan." As far as Mr Suleiman is concerned, the problem is not a matter of houses and roads. What will ultimately dissuade Yazidis from returning to their homes and lives on Mount Sinjar, he says, is the fact their own neighbours helped IS. He is one of many Yazidis who insist that Sunni Muslims already living in Sinjar told IS who was Yazidi and who was not. "The people in the villages helped Islamic State kill the men, kill all the men, and take away the girls," he says. "How can people live again together?" No-one is sure how many Yazidi girls were taken away by IS, but a United Nations report suggested it was between 5,000 and 7,000, and that some, perhaps many, were being held as sexual slaves across the border in Syria, but also in Mosul. It is another thought that occupies the minds of Yazidis, as they watch Iraqi army tanks make their way through Mosul's streets. "They are there. Recently, one member escaped, but the others - we don't know," another Yazidi woman says, another who does not want to give her name, lest there be reprisals against members of her family still inside IS-held territory. She was speaking at a rehabilitation centre in Qadia refugee camp, run on behalf of a British charity, The Lotus Flower. Here, Yazidi women are taught various skills, including how to sew. The hope is that this may one day provide them with a source of income, but the manager running the project acknowledges that the main purpose is therapeutic. "We have to help them to be busy with something," says Vian Ahmed, "rather than thinking a lot about what happened to them, about what horrible memories they have." "Islamic State survivors tend to want to be alone. "We are helping them to get out, which will be a benefit to them, psychologically and socially." Of course, what would really benefit the Yazidis would be if they could get out of the refugee camps in which so many of them are living, and for those who want to, to have a chance to see again the villages in which they have lived for so many generations. But that remains a very distant prospect, if not an impossible one.	As so-called Islamic State (IS) militants are driven out of Mosul, Paul Moss reports on the continuing plight of the Yazidis, the Iraqi religious group who the United Nations says has suffered more destruction than any other at IS hands.
In the aftermath of Khalid Masood's assault on London, the BBC received a number of questions from people concerned about safety and security on our streets. Here, BBC London's home affairs correspondent Nick Beake answers the most popular. Why don't the unarmed police officers at Westminster have protective body gear, stab- or bulletproof vests? And do they carry Tasers? Nick Beake: PC Keith Palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the Palace of Westminster, but Scotland Yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack. The force said during the post-mortem examination "the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene". Armed officers working at Parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a Taser. And an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central London. Will the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby London Bridge be restored? Nick Beake: The use of safety barriers varies from location to location. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public. The mayor of London's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed. Why not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic? Nick Beake: An independent review commissioned by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of London to protect pedestrians from a Nice- or Berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, Lord Harris of Haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick Beake: The current terrorist threat is rated as "severe", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: "Run, hide, tell." More information can be found on the gov.uk website. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick Beake: If you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related? Nick Beake: It can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be. It's better to be safe than sorry.	The attack in Westminster, on Wednesday, 22 March, left four victims dead, dozens injured and millions of people around the world asking why.
Harry Maceachen, from Shrewsbury, was born with a rare disease and had the life-saving transplant on Thursday. His father Simon donated part of his liver after no suitable match was found from the organ donor register. Grandmother Alison Price, a former theatre sister, said: "The consultants are very happy with their progress." She said it had been a "very, very difficult 12 months", adding: "The operations were satisfactory. Everything is going on according to plan....the consultants are very happy with their progress." Harry was born with biliary atresia, which meant he had blocked bile ducts. He had a transplant before his first birthday but that liver had begun to fail, so a second one was required. Harry underwent the operation on Thursday at Birmingham Children's Hospital and Mr Maceachen was operated on at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in the city. His grandmother said: "I used to look after him (Harry) three days a week when his mother went back to teaching and he got to know me very well. "I think we've got a special bond. He was born on my 63rd birthday." She said Harry's two-year-old brother, Sam, has been "impeccably behaved". "It's hard for him. It's the first time he's been away from his mother for as long as this and he obviously misses Harry, as we all do." She added: "It's brilliant with the support (the family have) had and the support we've had as grandparents. "The whole family's pulled together and they have a wonderful lot of friends."	The grandmother of a four-year-old boy who received part of his father's liver has said all is going "according to plan" following the operation.
Welshman Compton, 27, joins on a one-year deal after leaving Yeovil Town. Rigg has signed a two-year deal after helping AFC Wimbledon to League Two promotion, playing 44 times last term. "The squad is starting to shape up nicely. There are a couple more to come in," manager Warren Feeney said. "I'm very happy with the signings we have been able to secure so far." Former West Bromwich Albion player Compton started his career with Portsmouth and joined the south coast club again for a short spell in 2012. Compton also featured for Bradford, Colchester and Hartlepool United in addition to a spell in Scotland with Falkirk. Last season he scored four goals in 20 appearances for Yeovil, including the winning goal in the Glovers' 1-0 win over the Exiles in April. Rigg, also 27, started at Newport's rivals Bristol Rovers before spells with Port Vale and Oxford United and scored twice for the Dons last season. "I'm delighted to have signed for Newport County," Rigg said. "I took to Warren Feeney straight away and that was a big draw in me signing." In a summer where several players have departed Rodney Parade, Jamie Turley, Scot Bennett, Mark Randall, Joss Labadie Jennison Myrie-Williams and James Bittner have all been recruited.	Newport County have signed winger Jack Compton and striker Sean Rigg.
Notts slumped to 73-7 before Luke Wood (65 not out) Steven Mullaney (63) shared an eighth-wicket stand of 92. Onions took 5-56 as the hosts were dismissed for 204 in 54 overs, which meant Yorkshire were crowned county champions for the second year in a row. Durham closed 30 runs behind on 174-2, with Mark Stoneman making 62 and Scott Borthwick unbeaten on 56 The visitors won the toss and invited Notts to bat on an overcast day and Jake Libby, playing in his first game of the season after recovering from a cruciate ligament injury, fell to Chris Rushworth (2-15) in the first over for a second-ball duck. Onions got rid of Brendan Taylor and Michael Lumb, both for one, with the hosts slipping to 7-3 in the sixth over and Riki Wessels (13) then became a first wicket for 22-year-old Durham debutant Barry McCarthy (2-51). McCarthy dropped Mullaney, who was on 41 at the time, in the deep, but later trapped the former Lancashire player leg before. Wickets continued to fall and it was only the partnership of Mullaney and Wood - who passed fifty for the third time this season - which pushed Notts past 200 and earned a single batting bonus point. Durham started at pace in their reply with Stoneman and Jack Burnham putting on 78 for the first wicket in 15.5 overs. Stoneman, who was caught by Mullaney off Jake Ball, and Borthwick, who reached his ninth half-century of the season, then put on a second-wicket partnership of 53 as the hosts reached the close in a strong position. It meant Notts wicketkeeper Chris Read still requires two dismissals to become the 26th player in history to reach 1,000.	Graham Onions claimed a five-wicket haul to help Durham have the better of day one against Nottinghamshire.
Chris Erskine crossed low for Kris Doolan to tap home and give the Jags an early lead. Adam Barton and Steven Lawless came close to doubling the hosts' advantage. After a poor first half Well carved out chances to score in the second, Zak Jules's header kept out by goalkeeper Tomas Cerny. Media playback is not supported on this device With one more round of fixtures to play before the Premiership splits in two, Thistle have a seven-point gap over Kilmarnock and will face Celtic, Aberdeen, Rangers, St Johnstone and Hearts in the final few weeks of the season. Before then, they will visit Rangers next weekend, when Motherwell host basement side Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Having come from a goal down to beat Ross County last week and drawing away to champions Celtic on Wednesday, Thistle's confidence was high and they were in a hurry to make that count. Doolan scored both goals against County - his 100th and 101st for the Jags - and the striker marked being captain for the day with a simple finish off Erskine's ball across from the left. Barton's free-kick drifted narrowly past the left-hand post and Lawless's shot was deflected on to the crossbar. And Doolan should have got Thistle's second following an incisive pass by Ryan Edwards, the striker firing across the face of goal from the right of the six-yard box. Other than an early Scott McDonald header that was blocked out for a corner, Motherwell failed to seriously trouble their hosts in the opening period. Manager Stephen Robinson needed a reaction in the second half and sent on Keith Lasley and Lionel Ainsworth in place of Elliott Frear and Craig Clay. Shea Gordon flashed the ball across goal but the stretching McDonald could not apply the finish, Cerny clawed away Jules's header and Lasley's effort did not trouble the Jags goalkeeper. A late scramble in the box did not provide the telling shot at goal the visitors needed as Thistle held on, leaving Motherwell four points above Inverness and below Lanarkshire rivals Hamilton Academical on goal difference. Lawless dragged a shot wide after driving at the Well defence but Alan Archibald's side struggled to create as many openings in the second half. But one goal proved to be enough to ensure they will claim their highest top-flight finish since 1981. They had been bottom of the division in December, a couple of months after Archibald stayed at the club following an approach by Shrewsbury Town. He will now have the chance to get Thistle even higher in the Premiership with only three points separating the Jags from Hearts. Match ends, Partick Thistle 1, Motherwell 0.

US prosecutors had been expressing their wish to put him on trial in a US court since his arrest in February 2014. Guzman, who was named Public Enemy Number One by the Chicago Crime Commission in 2013, has been indicted by at least seven federal district courts. As the head of the Sinaloa cartel, he is accused of overseeing the smuggling of huge amounts of drugs from South and Central America to the United States. He is also facing charges of money laundering, racketeering and arms trafficking in courts as far apart as Arizona and Texas. But since his 2014 arrest in his home state of Sinaloa, Mexico, there has been little movement on the extradition front. While US courts were arguing about who had the best case against Guzman and should therefore get priority putting him on trial, Mexican officials were making it clear they were in no rush to send him across the border. Mexico's attorney general at the time, Jesus Murillo Karam, said as early as April last year that he had "no intention" of handing Guzman over to the US authorities. In an interview with Mexican daily El Universal, Mr Murillo Karam said he was annoyed at a plea bargain an extradited Mexican drug dealer had struck with the US authorities. Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, also known as Vicentillo, pleaded guilty in a court in Chicago to smuggling tonnes of cocaine and heroin to the United States. In exchange for promising the US authorities "full and truthful co-operation", his sentence was reduced from a potential life sentence to 10 years. The US authorities believed Vicentillo could prove a key witness if Joaquin Guzman was ever extradited to the United States. The son of Guzman's number two, Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, and a key player in the drugs trade himself, Vicentillo was seen as a valuable asset. But Mr Murillo Karam said he felt "uncomfortable" with the deals the US reached with "criminals" such as Vicentillo. The then-attorney general pointed out that there were plenty of charges Guzman faced in Mexico as well as in the US and that he wanted to see him tried in his homeland. He reiterated his position in January of this year, when he again stated that he wanted to see Guzman serve his sentence in Mexico first. 'El Chapo [Guzman] has to stay here to serve his sentence and then I'll extradite him. That could be in about 300 to 400 years, there's still a long time to go." At the time, he said that he thought a formal extradition request by the US was imminent, but it seems that following Mr Murillo Karam's strong words, the request was not filed. He argued that keeping Guzman in Mexico was also a question of sovereignty. But Mr Murillo Karam is more likely to regret another statement he made back in January. He said that extradition should be considered in instances where there was a flight risk, something he said did "not exist" in the case of Guzman. Given the fact the Guzman had escaped from another top security jail in 2001 and was on the run for the next 13 years, this was a surprising assurance. Comparisons have been drawn between Joaquin Guzman and the late infamous Colombian drug lord, Pablo Escobar. Both made immense fortunes in the illicit drug trafficking trade, and through bribery and intimidation managed to sway huge power and infiltrate parts of the security forces. Both have also mounted successful and spectacular escapes from jail. It was Pablo Escobar's jail break that played a major part in changing the Colombian approach to extradition. In a 1991 deal with the Colombian authorities, Escobar agreed to hand himself in to the Colombian police and to serve five years in a jail built to his own specifications in his hometown of Medellin. La Catedral (the cathedral), as the luxury jail was known, boasted a football pitch, a jacuzzi and a bar among its many amenities. After little more than a year, Escobar escaped from the jail and went on the run, much like Guzman did on Saturday. He was eventually killed a year later while still on the run. But before he was jailed, Escobar had threatened and cajoled members of a constitutional assembly to enshrine a ban on extraditions in the Colombian constitution. It remained in force until December 1997, when a constitutional amendment reversed the ban. Since then, Colombia has extradited many drug dealers to the United States saying that it is both a cheaper and safer option for the Colombian justice system. Colombian officials argue that in the US, Colombian drug dealers will find it harder to intimidate guards and their families or to access their riches to bribe prison staff. With 30 prison staff and the warden under questioning over the escape of Chapo Guzman at Mexico's Altiplano jail, this argument may well be met with more open ears in Mexico, too, now.	The escape on Saturday of Joaquin Guzman, one of the world's most wanted drug lords, from a maximum-security jail in Mexico, has reignited the discussion about whether he should have been extradited to the United States.
His body was found on concrete steps in North Street in the early hours of Sunday morning. He was treated by medical staff but was pronounced dead at the scene. Gardaí (Irish police) have appealed for information about the incident.	A man in his 50s has died after being seriously assaulted in Swords, County Dublin.
The closure of the tunnel near Linlithgow in West Lothian will mean rail services between Edinburgh and Glasgow will be severely hit. The work is part of a Â£750m upgrade to enable faster, bigger and greener electric trains to run on the line. The disruption will last from 13 June to 27 July. Engineers said the tunnel closure was necessary so tracks could be lowered to create space for overhead power lines for the new trains, which will be introduced at the end of next year. The upgrade is the latest phase of the Scottish government's Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP). Train operator ScotRail has a dedicated website to advise on the disruption, which will mainly hit travel between Glasgow - or Stirling/Dunblane - and Edinburgh but it will also have a knock-on effect in areas such as the Fife Circle. Many passengers will have longer journeys or bus replacements. ScotRail advised passengers to add at least 30 minutes to their planned journey times. The closure will mean passengers looking to travel end-to-end from Glasgow to Edinburgh will no longer be able to take a train from Queen Street high level platforms, as the trains will only go as far as Linlithgow. Instead, they will have to switch to the slower Queen Street low level trains or travel on the longer route from Glasgow Central Station. ScotRail said the main routes affected would be: In addition, the following services will be busier than normal in both directions: How will you be affected by the work? Rodger Querns, programme director of EGIP for Network Rail, said the tunnel work over the next six weeks would see the track removed and the floor of the tunnel lowered to create headroom to install new electrification equipment. He said: "We can't avoid the work in Winchburgh tunnel. We do appreciate the inconvenience this will cause passengers. We have planned the work meticulously and are working hard to minimise that disruption. "We are working round-the-clock. We have engineers on the site 24/7 to get the railway back running as planned on 27 July." Phil Verster, managing director of train operator ScotRail Alliance, said: "The EGIP programme is a Â£750m investment in this very important corridor between Edinburgh and Glasgow. "It electrifies the line and the magnificent benefit it brings for our customers is we are going to have longer trains, about 30% more capacity, shorter journeys because we are going to run trains faster and shave about eight to 10 minutes off a 50-minute journey time, and it is going to be greener as well. "So on all counts it is good for customers and good for the country." About 150 years ago when this tunnel was built the challenge was creating enough headroom to allow the funnels of steam locomotives to fit through as they thundered along the track. Today the challenge is about making enough space for the overhead lines for electric trains. The engineers can't go up so they have to go down, dropping the level of the entire track. Some have questioned why the rail improvement work was taking place at the same time as major upgrades to the road network in Central Scotland. Work on the Â£500m M8 M73 M74 Motorway Improvements Project in Lanarkshire is already leading to disruption as traffic restrictions are in force. Transport Minister Derek Mackay advised people to plan their journeys and assured them it would be worth it. He said: "For both the road and rail network the best time to do it would be over the summer. That's when the least people will be travelling. "These are major improvements and they are necessary improvements. We can't just let the infrastructure disintegrate. "This is better than that. It is not just maintenance, it is upgrading of our rail and road infrastructure so it is fit for the future and can unlock even more economic potential and improve the connections in our country." Mr Querns said the EGIP project would continue on sections of the line over the next year but most of the work would be carried out at night. He said: "Next year we will be working in the Queen Street tunnel clearing that for electrification in April 2016." Mr Verster said Glasgow Queen Street would be "transformed" by the changes, with the whole concourse being remodelled. He said: "It will put Glasgow Queen Street on a par with what we have at St Pancras or King's Cross. It is going to be absolutely stunning."	Train passengers in Scotland's central belt face six weeks of disruption from this weekend when work begins on the Winchburgh tunnel.
The mosaics, part of a 1,700-year-old town house, were found on the site of a development in Leicester. Open days attracted thousands of people but a question mark hung over the fate over the most spectacular finds. Now city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has confirmed they will form part of a Â£7m revamp of the nearby Jewry Wall museum. The excavation recovered hundreds of artefacts - including a gruesome carved handle depicting people being fed to lions - but the mosaics were the largest found in the city for 150 years. Speaking at the final open day on Sunday, archaeologist Jon Coward said: "The big mosaic will be lifted and conserved but quite where it will end up I couldn't tell you but it should be made available. "One of the things that could happen is it could go in the Jewry Wall Museum or it could go in the foyer of the building on this site, that is up to the developers." Sir Peter Soulsby said has now said that after discussions with developers and archaeologists, a decision had been made. "The Jewry Wall Museum is the obvious place for this to go and after 1,700 years beneath our feet they could not have been found at a better time. "Other mosaics are currently undergoing restoration so this mosaic will join the wonderful artefacts we already have to  make a world class visitor attraction." It is hoped the refurbished museum will open in two years.	High-status Roman floors discovered by archaeologists during building work will go on permanent display, it has been confirmed.
He's been disqualified in the final at Queen's Club for kicking out at an advertising panel. But it wasn't just the panel that felt his frustration - the sign broke and cut the leg of a line judge. Nalbandian was disqualified for unsporting behaviour and the match was awarded to his opponent Marin Cilic. After the match, Nalbandian admitted he went too far saying, "I am very sorry, sometimes you get frustrated on court." Maybe he should think about a new career in sport - karate perhaps?	Argentinian tennis player David Nalbandian might be wishing he'd kept a lid on his temper.
Ms Sturgeon had said she hoped the "national survey" would involve two million people across the country. It had been due to run until St Andrew's Day - 30 November. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland on Tuesday that the latest assessment suggested 1.7 million people had taken part. The SNP leader and Scottish first minister added that "this was never an opinion poll, it is not a scientific for or against independence. "What it was was an SNP exercise to engage with the Scottish people on some of the issues around independence, and obviously we will take the time to analyse the responses we've had." When asked what the results showed, Ms Sturgeon said: "I will tell you once it has concluded tomorrow." When she launched the initiative at an event in Stirling, Ms Sturgeon - the SNP leader and Scottish first minister - said she wanted to hear in detail how people felt about Europe, Brexit and independence. Members of the public were invited to take part through a dedicated website, and the party's MPs and MSPs were also told to hold town hall meetings. The SNP's 120,000 members were encouraged to "hit the doorsteps" to ask people to take part, and were sent a pack of "survey cards" which they would ask five people a month to fill in. Data gathered during the exercise could be used by the SNP if Ms Sturgeon decides to call another referendum on leaving the UK. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme at the weekend, the Scottish government's culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said she did not know whether the results of the survey would be published. She said there had been a "lot of interest" from people who voted No in the independence referendum two years ago but were "rethinking their position" after voting Remain in the EU referendum. When asked whether the results of the survey would be published, Ms Hyslop replied: "I don't know because I'm not part of the party operation doing that." She also said: "It is a listening exercise, it is a party exercise. I'm not running the consultation process", and that she was "expecting to have the results of what has come forth in some shape or form". Ms Sturgeon told the upper house of the Irish Parliament on Tuesday that another vote on independence remained "firmly on the table" if it was felt to be the best way of protecting Scotland's interests in the wake of the Brexit vote. However, a YouGov poll for the Times newspaper that was published on Wednesday morning put support for independence at 44%, with 56% backing the Union. Polling expert Prof John Curtice said it was the first time a poll had suggested support for independence had slipped from the 45% who voted Yes in the referendum in 2014. The poll also suggested only 31% of people want the Scottish government to campaign for independence in the next two years, while 56% do not. And respondents were asked about whether they think it would be "realistically possible" for Scotland to remain part of the EU after the rest of the UK leaves, regardless of their support for such a move. Only 22% said they thought this would be "probably possible", with 62% saying "probably not possible" and 16% said they did not know. And 13% said they had been contacted by the SNP as part of the national conversation survey while 82% said they had not. YouGov polled 1,134 people from November 24-29. It is the latest in a series of polls which have suggested the Brexit vote has not yet led to a surge in support for independence. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said it was time for the SNP to "finally pay heed to what Scotland is saying - 'no' to a second referendum and 'no' to more division, more uncertainty and more rancour". But an SNP spokesman pointed out that the poll suggested the SNP still has a commanding lead over the opposition in Holyrood voting intention, with the party on 48% in the constituency vote and 39% in the regional vote. He added: "That is a very strong endorsement of the party's record in office and of Nicola Sturgeon as first minister."	The SNP's "listening exercise" on Scottish independence, which was announced by Nicola Sturgeon in September, is due to end.
A monthly travelcard costs £135 ($174), according to a Deutsche Bank report - £33 ($43) more than Dublin, which was ranked second priciest city. Auckland, where a ticket costs £95 ($123), came third, while New York City, at £91 ($118), came fourth, and Tokyo fifth at £86 ($111). Transport for London (TfL) said the findings did "not show the true cost of transport in other countries". The survey also found the cost of travel in the capital dropped since 2014, when commuters paid £165 ($213). Source: Deutsche Bank Its authors ranked London tenth most expensive for petrol, and the third for car hire. Hong Kong had the priciest petrol, while Amsterdam was the most expensive for a daily car rental, the report said. London's taxis fared slightly better, ranked 20th in a list of 47 cities, with Zurich topping the list for the most expensive fares. For quality of life, London was ranked 33rd in the world, similar to other "mega cities" such as Tokyo, Paris and New York. According to the report, these cities "rank very low" for quality of life, mostly due to "high living costs, crime, pollution and commuting time". "This is highly subjective and one person's long commute may be another person's chance to catch up on Netflix," the report said. "Megacity dwellers may also forsake short-term quality of life for aspirational reasons," the report added. Wellington, in New Zealand, was ranked as the best city to live in in terms of quality of life, followed by Edinburgh, Vienna. Melbourne and Zurich. In February, TfL revealed its fares income was down £90m last year. TfL is currently planning to cut £16bn from its budget by 2020/21 as it  aims to become self sufficient with its operating costs. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has frozen fares on buses and trams until 2020, but travelcard prices are set by train operating companies and so are not under full TfL control. A TfL spokesman said: "London also has one of the most extensive set of travel concessions in the world with free or discounted travel for children, the over-60s, students and veterans."	Public transport in London is the world's most expensive, a report says.
The Holy Trinity fighter had a 3-2 majority win against the World and European light-welterweight title holder to reach the quarter-finals. Monday's victory also secured his place at the World Championships in Hamburg, Germany in August. Belfast flyweight Brendan Irvine is also through to the quarter-finals. The Rio Olympian beat Turkish opponent Bathuhan Citfci on a unanimous 5-0 decision to advance to the last eight, the victory also securing his place at the World Championships. McComb, who easily dealt with Czech Erik Agateljan in his 64kg opener, had previously defeated the top-ranked Russian at a multi-nation tournament in Dublin in April. However this victory is much more significant, the fighter tweeting "nothing won yet, I'll just keep trucking" after his great win in Kharkiv. He now meets England's Luke McCormack in the quarter-finals.	Belfast boxer Sean McComb is one fight away from a medal at the European Championships after stunning world number one Vitaly Dunaytsev in Ukraine.
Mr Murray, who was elected as Labour's only Scottish MP in 2015, held the Edinburgh South seat with 26,269 votes. The SNP came second with 10,755 votes. His majority increased significantly from 2,637 two years ago to 15,514. Across the capital, the SNP held three seats - Edinburgh South West, North and Leith and Edinburgh East, while the Lib Dems gained Edinburgh West. In his victory speech at the Meadowbank count in the city, Mr Murray told his supporters: "I stood here two years ago bemoaning the loss of my colleagues but tonight the Scottish Labour Party is back. "Nobody wanted this general election. Theresa May called this election to get rid of scrutiny in parliament for the hard Brexit she wanted to deliver. "Well the people of this country, the people of Scotland, have said tonight that we do not give the prime minister a blank cheque for a hard Tory Brexit." Mr Murray also told Nicola Sturgeon that his party's result was a verdict on SNP calls for another vote on independence. He said: "And to the first minister, we said at the start of this campaign that Scotland didn't want a second independence referendum. "The people of Edinburgh South have hammered the final nail in that coffin tonight." Tommy Sheppard won Edinburgh East with 18,509 votes, beating Labour's Patsy King into second place on 15,084. "The overwhelming story of tonight is that this is the Conservative Party snatching defeat from the jaws of victory," Mr Sheppard said. "There is one clear victor in the general election in Scotland, one party that is on course to win more seats than all other parties put together, and that party is the Scottish National Party. "Ruth Davidson sought a mandate in this election to try to prevent the people of Scotland having a choice about their future and she has overwhelmingly been rejected by the Scottish electorate." Nationalist Deidre Brock held her constituency Edinburgh North and Leith with 19,243 votes, despite a strong challenge from Labour's Gordon Munro on 17,618. The SNP's Joanna Cherry also kept her Edinburgh South West seat, with 17,575 votes to the Conservative Miles Briggs on 16,478. But Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine took Edinburgh West with 18,108 votes to 15,120 for the SNP's Toni Giugliano. The seat was won by Michelle Thomson in 2015, who later resigned the SNP whip after allegations relating to property transactions. Ms Jardine said: "We've been away for a wee while but the Scottish Liberal Democrats are back." Across the Forth in Fife, the SNP held the area's North East seat with just two votes. It was the final Scottish seat to declare in the UK general election, after a third recount. The SNP's Stephen Gethins won 13,743 votes compared with Janet Riches of the Scottish Liberal Democrats who polled 13,741. It is the joint-third narrowest victory in UK general election history and the closest since the Lib Dem's Mark Oaten won Winchester by two in 1997. Mr Gethins saw his majority cut from 4,344 in 2015. Labour's Lesley Laird took Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath from the SNP with 17,016 votes, while the SNP's Peter Grant held Glenrothes with a much reduced majority over Labour's Altany Craik. The SNP also held Dunfermline and West Fife, with Douglas Chapman securing 18,121 votes compared with Labour's Cara Hilton on 17,277.	Labour's Ian Murray has increased his majority by more than 15,000 to secure his seat in Scotland's capital.
Mohammed al-Barghathi earlier said he had decided to step down in the wake of the recent sieges by armed groups of the justice and foreign ministries. But he was subsequently told by Prime Minister Ali Zeidan not to present his resignation at a cabinet meeting. The gunmen had demanded parliament pass the Political Isolation Law, which bars Gaddafi-era officials from office. The General National Congress did so on Sunday despite criticism from human rights groups, who said the legislation was too vague because it potentially barred anyone who worked for the authorities between 1969, when Muammar Gaddafi came to power, and 2011, when he was ousted. Despite this, some gunmen have refused to withdraw from the ministries. Addressing a news conference in Tripoli on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Barghathi cited the sieges as the reason for offering his resignation. "I will never be able to accept that politics [can] be practiced by the power of weapons," he was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. "This is an assault against the democracy I have sworn to protect." However, Mr Zeidan's office later issued a statement saying: "The cabinet would like to clarify that the resignation was not officially presented to the prime minister. "The prime minister has asked the defence minister to renounce it and [he] has confirmed that he will continue his work and expressed his understanding of the present circumstances in the country." The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli notes that the Political Isolation Law will apply to Mr Barghathi when takes effect. He was commander of the air force in Benghazi before retiring on a government pension in 1994, The law could affect other senior members of the government, including the head of the General National Congress Mohammed al-Megaryef. He defected from Gaddafi's government in the 1980s after serving as Libya's ambassador to India. Gunmen who have remained at the foreign ministry - the first to be targeted on Sunday 28 April - said they were prepared to go but have not done so as yet, our correspondent says. The gunmen outside the justice ministry, which was surrounded last Tuesday, have said they are waiting to be replaced by official security forces, she adds. The various militias around the ministries have different allegiances. The Higher Revolutionary Council, which claims to represent various ex-fighters and is believed to control some of the armed groups, told the BBC it wanted to see the prime minister removed from office. Our correspondent says Mr Zeidan, who it seems will not be affected by the new law, recently described those behind the armed protest as the "losers" in last year's nationwide elections.	Libya's Defence Minister has withdrawn his offer to resign, hours after saying he was leaving his post.
In the other semi-final Salford Red Devils play Wigan Warriors, the only side outside of Super League's top four left in the competition. Hull were the final side to confirm their place in the final four, after defeating Super League leaders Castleford 32-24 on Sunday. The semi-finals will take place at neutral venues on the 28 and 29 July. Hull FC are just one place and one point behind Rhinos in the Super League table, and Hull forward Mark Minichiello told the Rugby League Forum: "It's a tough game. It's at a neutral ground. "They're playing really well at the moment, they're above us in the table, and they've got their mojo back. "It's going to be a great outing and I can't wait for it. It's two form teams going at it in the semi-final." Meanwhile, last season's Super League champions Wigan are down in eighth, while Salford, who only maintained their top-flight status with a Million Pound Game win last season, are second in the table. Warriors full-back Sam Tomkins told BBC Sport: "I wouldn't say Salford have surprised me this season, they've got talented players. "With (brother) Logan Tomkins being there, I speak to him about what they do, they've got a good set up. "It's taken a bit of time for Salford to really get some consistent form and they've got it at the moment."	Defending champions Hull FC will play Leeds Rhinos in the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup.

Australian businessman David Prior said he hoped to double production at Bladnoch Distillery, near Wigtown. The single malt will be relaunched and he also has plans to introduce a new blend called Pure Scot. Mr Prior said it would be aimed at a new generation of whisky drinkers in his homeland and hoped it would have a considerable local economic impact. "I think there's some great things happening in other parts of the world with whisky - but it has got a long way to go to catch up with Scotch," he said. "So I wanted to invest in that, I wanted to be part of that. "I didn't want to try doing it back home or some other market, I wanted to do it here." He said it was "very exciting" to have Bladnoch in his "stable of businesses". "I suppose our vision is to see this as a very, very vibrant and big, functioning distillery creating a lot of employment for this region and to be the cornerstone of this community," he said. "That is what we are working towards." Get live news updates from the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway throughout the day on our South of Scotland live page service.

Two men were convicted for carrying out abuse during the 1970s, 80s and 90s at the now closed Skircoat Lodge. Victim Kaz Gray said inquiries did not go far enough and some individuals were allegedly still working with children. Calderdale Council said no one involved in the historical cases still worked for the authority. In 2001, Malcom Phillips, who ran Skircoat Lodge for nearly 20 years, was jailed for seven years for repeated abuse of children in his care. A social worker there, Andrew Shadders, who abused boys, was jailed for 15 years. Another man, Terence O'Hagan, was charged with abuse but died before conviction. Ms Gray, who is leading the protest at the council's social services offices, said the scale of the abuse in care homes in Calderdale over that period of time was "rampant". She said: "When I went into care one of the first things they did was put me on the pill. "I was 14, the youngest lass I knew of at the time on the pill in Skircoat was 11 years old." Ms Gray, who has waived her right to anonymity, was abused at Skircoat and said she was trafficked to a care home in North Wales where she was raped. She said she considered there were people still working with children in the area who had been "complicit in the abuse" of youngsters decades ago. "Nothing's changed, nothing will change until everything comes out," she added. The council said it fully supported the investigation at the time. It added: This was an appalling case and we regret that children suffered when they were in the care of the local authority. "I would like to reassure people that nobody involved in the historic cases works for the council, and in the intervening years our safeguarding practices have changed beyond recognition." Chief Supt Dickie Whitehead, Calderdale District Commander, said a thorough investigation was carried out by police and the council between 1997 and 2002 following allegations against a number of employees at Skircoat Lodge Assessment Centre and Dobroyd Castle. He said: "This led to a number of arrests and prosecutions, resulting in a number of substantial prison sentences." Mr Whitehead urged victims of abuse to come forward, adding: "We can promise that reports will be investigated and victims will be treated with the utmost sensitivity."	Victims of child sex abuse in Halifax are staging a protest calling for an inquiry into historical abuse at care homes in Calderdale to be reopened.
The medal - won as a teenager at his first World Cup - was estimated to be worth between £70,000 and £140,000. The three-time World Cup winner is selling all three of his winner's medals at auction, along with more than 2,000 items of personal memorabilia. His winning medal from the 1962 World Cup in Chile was sold for £140,800. The memorabilia, which includes shirts and trophies, is being sold over three days and his winner's medal from the 1970 World Cup, where he was part of the Brazilian team regarded as one of the greatest in history, has yet to go under the hammer. A one-off Jules Rimet trophy made for the former striker after Brazil's triumph in Mexico in 1970 is the most expensive item being auctioned, with an estimated price tag of £281,000 to £420,000. On the first day of auction, the boots worn by Pele in the classic football film Escape to Victory sold for £8,025. Other items sold include L'Equipe athlete of the century trophy with book (£20,480), his 2007 Fifa presidential award (£30,720) and a 1,000th goal tribute crown with book (£162,500). Pele is the only player to have won the World Cup three times and is regarded by many as being the greatest footballer in history, scoring 1,281 goals in 1,363 matches and appearing 91 times for Brazil.	Pele's 1958 World Cup winner's medal has been sold at auction in London for £200,000 - at least £60,000 more than its estimated price tag.
The crossing in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was concreted over in 1904 when the tram network expanded. It re-opened to pedestrians after a Â£5m project, which also exposed a section of the River Roch in the town. Work on uncovering the bridge started 18 months ago and is part of a Â£250m transformation of the town due to end in 2019. A Rochdale Council spokeswoman said the crossing is believed to have been built in about 1324 when Edward II ruled England. It expanded as the town grew, with sections added in the Restoration and Georgian eras. Merchants travelled over the bridge to Yorkshire to buy wool which was then finished in Rochdale's mills. In the 1700s it was one of two main routes from Lancashire to Yorkshire, making Rochdale one of the most important towns in the region ahead of the Industrial Revolution. The council said the re-exposed section of the river would help prevent flooding.	A bridge built in the 14th Century has reopened after it was hidden from view for more than a century.
Walker, who has 27 caps and spent eight seasons at Spurs has signed a five-year deal with City. The deal, which comes to £50m including £5m of add-ons, could make him the most expensive English player ever. "I am thrilled to be signing for City and can't wait to get started," said Walker. "Pep Guardiola is one of the most respected managers in the world." Walker, who joined Spurs from Sheffield United in 2009 and made 183 Premier League appearances, added: "I feel he can help me take my game to a new level." The 27-year-old, who will wear the number two shirt, is expected to travel with City on Monday for their tour of the USA. City boss Guardiola released three full-backs at the end of last season, including both right-sided players - Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna. He missed out on the signing of free agent Dani Alves, with the Brazilian joining Paris St-Germain on Wednesday. Walker, selected in the 2016-17 Premier League team of the year, is City's third signing of the summer, after the arrivals of midfielder Bernardo Silva and goalkeeper Ederson Moraes. Walker made 31 league starts under Mauricio Pochettino last season as Tottenham recorded their highest top-flight finish since the 1962-63 season. The right-back recorded five assists for the Premier League runners-up, the joint-most for a defender in the division alongside Bournemouth's Adam Smith and Spurs team-mate Kieran Trippier, who made six of his 12 appearances from the bench. Walker also ranked highly among chances created by defenders and his 75 dribbles attempted was only less than Cherries full-back Smith (87) and Watford's Jose Holebas (88). Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker on Twitter: Kyle Walker becomes the world's most expensive defender at £50m plus. Imagine how much he would cost if he could cross the ball. Former Spurs midfielder and Match of the Day pundit Jermaine Jenas‏ on Twitter: I think it's great business for City. I am surprised Spurs are selling to a direct competitor. He's been a huge part of why Spurs have had one of, or the best defence in the league for two years.

"Every Premier League club now has more money and are willing to spend that on players," said Chris Stenson, a senior consultant from Deloitte's sports business group. "It is the wealthiest league in the world and increasing its value makes it more attractive to sponsors and commercial partners. "So far we estimate Premier League clubs have spent about £500m in the transfer window, compared with £340m at the equivalent stage last year."

The Transocean Winner, which has diesel on board, was under tow west of Lewis when it was hit by severe storms. It became detached from the tug boat overnight, before running aground at the beach of Dalmore in the Carloway area. Stornoway Coastguard said there were no personnel on board the rig and there was no risk to life. However, coastguard personnel have blocked access to the beach for health and safety reasons. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun an investigation into the incident. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it was monitoring for any pollution from the rig. The agency said Transocean Winner has 280 metric tonnes of diesel on board. Scotland's Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said key agencies were doing what was necessary to "ensure the rig is secured and to minimise any immediate safety or environmental risks". A spokesman said: "Following the grounding of the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner on the Isle of Lewis, the Secretary of State's Representative (SOSREP) for Maritime Salvage and Intervention Hugh Shaw is now in discussions with the owners Transocean and the salvors. "The Maritime and Coastguard Agency's counter pollution branch and the SOSREP have both been monitoring the situation since yesterday evening and the local authority, police and Marine Scotland have all been kept informed." Salvage company Smit has been mobilised to deal with the incident, the MCA added. The Transocean Winner was being towed from Norway to Malta. BBC Alba reporter Angus Macdonald said the structure was "towering over the beach". He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: "The rig has more or less come ashore at the beach of Dalmore. "Dalmore is a well-known beauty spot. It is a sandy beach where a lot of surfers turn up because the waves are so good." Foster Evans, who visited the stretch of beach involved last week, sent BBC News Scotland online an image showing how the wide sweep of sand usually looks. Western Isles SNP MSP Alasdair Allan and MP Angus MacNeil said the incident underlined the need for Scotland to have two emergency tugs. An emergency towing vessel has been sent to the scene from the Northern Isles. Scotland used to have two of the boats available to the coastguard to cover the north and west coasts, before the UK government reduced the service to a single ship in 2012. Mr Allan said: "This morning the tow line between a tug and the Transocean Winner oil rig snapped in heavy weather, resulting in the rig going aground at Dalmore on the west side of Lewis. "I am grateful to hear that there have been no injuries reported after this incident but it does leave us with a significant environmental threat to deal with. "I am also deeply concerned to hear that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's nearest emergency towing vessel was in the region of 14 hours away."	A 17,000-tonne drilling rig has run aground after being blown ashore on the Western Isles.
Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment "problem solved". It was shared in 2014, before she became Bradford West MP. The Board of Deputies said the post, highlighted by the Guido Fawkes political website, was "appalling". The graphic said relocating Israel would be a "solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", and that it would allow Palestinians to "get their life and their land back". In a statement, Ms Shah said: "This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused." Labour confirmed she had stepped down as Parliamentary Private Secretary - an unpaid backbench assistant - to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. In a second statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict. "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise." She said she would be expanding her "existing engagement and dialogue with Jewish community organisations and will be stepping up my efforts to combat all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism". The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	A Labour MP has stepped down as an aide to the shadow chancellor over a Facebook post suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States.
Wa-ays Dhaye, 18, died from multiple knife wounds after being attacked in Thurston Street, Slough, in August. He was walking home after spending the day at Notting Hill Carnival. Khianni Gordon was jailed for life with a minimum of 19 years for murder while Kaneel Huggins and Antwon Clarke were given 10 and nine-year sentences respectively for manslaughter. Gordon, 18, was also convicted of perverting the course of justice. Clarke and Huggins' sentences were referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme. Huggins, 19, had his sentence increased to 16 years, and Clarke, 18, had his sentence increased to 15 years. Gordon's sentence was not considered by the court. Speaking after the hearing, Attorney General Jeremy Wright said: "These offenders knowingly participated in the plan to assault and injure Wa'ays Dhaye knowing full well that really serious harm or death could be caused. "Knife crime is a real scourge of our society and it's important that prison terms for this type of crime reflect the seriousness of the offending." Mr Dhaye, who was born in Holland but lived in Slough for 10 years, was stabbed while walking home after spending August bank holiday at the Notting Hill Carnival. He died later in hospital. Det Ch Insp Kevin Brown of Thames Valley Police, said the three had "hunted down" Mr Dhaye following a minor altercation between two groups at the carnival. He said: "The three of them left Wa-ays dying in the street and it was members of the public who found him and came to his aid." Update 21 November 2016: This story has been amended following updated information supplied by the Attorney General about the sentencing	Two men from High Wycombe jailed for a fatal stabbing have had their sentences increased by the Court of Appeal.
Chris Packham, who is in Malta, said rare species were being targeted, and hunters were even shooting Montagu's harrier birds on the ground at night. "It's a desperate situation," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A Maltese wildlife official insisted that patrols to stop illegal hunting had been stepped up. Malta has an exemption from the EU Birds Directive, allowing its hunters to shoot turtle doves and quail during the spring migration, a crucial stage in the birds' life cycle. But according to Mr Packham, turtle doves were vulnerable, with their numbers down by 95% in the UK. Malta is the only EU country to have a recreational spring hunting season allowing birds to be shot. Mr Packham, a presenter of TV documentaries on wildlife, said Maltese hunters were ignoring restrictions under the exemption, or "derogation" in EU jargon. He said they were killing many other birds which are supposed to be protected. He is in Malta with the conservation group Birdlife Malta to draw attention to the annual spring shoot, which has been criticised by environmentalists for years. "Yesterday I'm afraid to say I had a dead swift in my hand that had been illegally shot and also a dead little bittern," Mr Packham told Today. Sergei Golovkin, head of Malta's Wild Birds Regulation Unit, insisted that the authorities were controlling the hunters. He said enforcement of the restrictions had "improved dramatically in the last few years". Malta has "the highest ratio in Europe" of enforcement staff deployed against illegal hunting, he told Today. Thirty-three MEPs have jointly lobbied the European Commission to put pressure on Malta over the hunting exemption. A British Liberal Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder, says the EU must "stop Malta from breaking EU rules, by systematically failing to apply the derogation correctly".	A leading British naturalist has accused the Maltese authorities of failing to prevent large-scale illegal shooting of migratory birds by hunters.
Four police were wounded as they tried to arrest a man in the Bavarian town of Georgensgmuend, south of Nuremberg. The suspect, described as a member of the extremist Reichsbuerger movement, opened fire on the officers before he was eventually detained. Officials said a permit had been revoked for the 31 guns he owned. Local authorities had called in the police after the man repeatedly refused to co-operate with them. When a special forces team moved in early on Wednesday he began shooting through his door, officials said. Police confirmed the officer's death on Thursday, having announced it prematurely late on Wednesday. Another policeman is being treated for serious gunshot wounds. Two others were lightly wounded. The gunman was lightly injured in the exchange. The Reichsbuerger ("Reich Citizens") group does not recognise the authority of the post-war German federal republic, seeing it merely as some sort of private company. It believes in the continued existence of a German empire, or Reich, dating back to 1937 or even earlier. Its roots are said to go back some three decades. Bavarian officials said the group's ideology was "nationalist and anti-Semitic.... clearly extreme right". Their circle had grown in recently years, they said, and included "whingers, nutcases, conspiracy theorists, but also the far-right". The diversity of beliefs and views within the group militates against a simple hierarchical structure or clear leadership. But the group should not be dismissed simply as an "association of crackpots", said Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. Some of its members were obviously capable of brutal violence, particularly targeting representatives of the German state, he warned. Others use their rejection in the authority of the German state as grounds to refuse to pay taxes or creditors.	A German 32-year-old special forces officer has died of his wounds after being shot during a raid on the home of a man linked to a far-right movement.
Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the year, with air traffic controllers expecting to handle more than 8,800 flights - a record number. They have called for a drastic modernisation in the way aircraft are guided across UK airspace. It comes as the government launches a discussion to shape the UK's aviation industry for the next 30 years. Air traffic controllers expect to manage a record 770,000 flights in UK airspace over the summer - 40,000 more than last year. But the ability of the the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) to deal with this surge is being stretched to the limit, it is claimed. Nats director Jamie Hutchison said: "In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly." The Department for Transport estimates that, if airspace management remains unchanged, there will be 3,100 days' worth of flight delays by 2030 - that is 50 times the amount seen in 2015 - along with 8,000 flight cancellations a year. The government wants the public to submit ideas on a wide range of subjects, from airport bag check-ins in town centres to noise reduction targets. The six themes it will consult on over the coming months are: Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: "Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. "It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK. "Our vision puts the passenger at the heart of what we do, but also recognises the need to address the impacts of aviation on communities and the environment." Meanwhile, airport capacity is expanding way beyond Heathrow's new runway. Friday also marks the start of a Â£1bn investment programme to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2. The number of planes taking off and landing at Stansted has gone up every month for almost four years. Cardiff Airport has seen an 11% rise in traffic, and Luton is recording growth of 7% this year alone. The problem of volume has been complicated by shifts in travel patterns. Destinations including Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have lost out to Spain, Italy and the US, which means major changes in the flows of traffic into UK airspace. Nats itself is rolling out a new Â£600m ($747m) computer system known as iTec that could result in more flights and fewer delays. But Juliet Kennedy, Nats operations director, said: "What is needed is a clear and stable UK policy that recognises how important our airspace is as a critical part of our national infrastructure. "It is essential that we are able to balance the needs of airspace users with the environment and, of course, with the communities who experience aircraft noise."	Air traffic controllers are warning that UK skies are running out of room for record numbers of planes.
Boro were the busiest Premier League club in July, making a total of eight new signings. "We are not in a rush. We have the nucleus of the team so we just need to keep going," Karanka told BBC Tees. "The better players we have, the more chance we have to stay in the Premier League." Having narrowly missed promotion via the play-offs in 2015, Boro drew with promotion rivals Brighton on the final day of last season to earn promotion on goal difference and seal a return to the top flight after a seven-year absence. The Teesside club have since been unbeaten throughout pre-season, but went a goal down after only 14 minutes of their 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Saturday - and Karanka is concerned about defensive frailties. The 42-year old continued: "We need more [players], especially central defenders. That's the danger, where we need to improve. "I don't want to put all the pressure on Dael Fry for example. He's brilliant, his future is more than brilliant and he's improving a lot every single day. "But he needs to keep going forward doing the right steps and for that reason I think we need to bring [more players]." Whilst Karanka wishes to bolster his defence, the Spaniard's priority is that any new signings fit into the team quickly. "The main things for me is that [the new players] are settled in the team really well," he added. "We are mixing players who two-and-a-half years ago were fighting to stay in the Championship with players who were playing in the Champions League two years ago, one year ago. "But the spirit of the changing room is the same." Middlesbrough will begin their Premier League campaign at home on Saturday, 13 August against Stoke City.	Boss Aitor Karanka says Middlesbrough are in no hurry to make further signings as they prepare to return to the Premier League.
The 17-year-old has made seven appearances for the Bairns this season and it had been suggested several English clubs were also interested. "Trust me, it's 100% speculation and it gathers arms and legs," said Houston. "If any of our players were subject to a bid from a team - if it was a good bid - the directors will take it. Simple as that." Sunderland manager David Moyes was in the stand watching Falkirk's 2-1 win at St Mirren but did not confirm if he was there to watch the teenage left-back. The youngster was dropped to the bench for that victory after playing six consecutive games in the first team. "He's 17 years of age, and one of the things as a manager that you need to know is when to put a player so young and so good as Tony into the team," said Houston. "Luke Leahy played exceptionally well for 18 months and Tony had to bide his time. Tony might have been able to go in a bit earlier if Luke had been injured. "[Recently] I felt Luke had just slightly dipped and we had a discussion about it and it was time to put Tony in there. "But there's also a time to know when to take the pressure off a young lad. He went into a side over the last seven games when we have been inconsistent. "Tony was exceptional in the period he was in the team but it's the right time just to bring him back out and take the pressure off him with all the media speculation and hype that's going on about him. "He'll get back in there again and when he does he needs to make sure he's bigger, stronger and better for it." Several other players like Scott Arfield, Stephen Kingsley and Jay Fulton have left Falkirk and gone on to experience English Premier League football. Houston stressed the importance of knowing when is the right time to let that happen. "Thankfully Tony's parents are sensible," he said. "He could have signed for a lot of big clubs when he was 13 but he chose Falkirk because he thinks the best development pathway to play football is through Falkirk. "If he's good enough he'll get picked up by these other teams again."	Falkirk manager Peter Houston has played down newspaper reports that Barcelona are pursuing Tony Gallacher.
Four tickets were purchased by Bournville College in Birmingham under former principal Norman Cave, a Freedom of Information request has revealed. The Longbridge further education college also held a Â£170,000 centenary event, a Â£35,000 staff party, and paid consultants Â£2.8m over three years. Mr Cave, who has since retired, denied any claims of financial mismanagement. Updates on this story and more from Birmingham New bosses at the college said they no longer had the season tickets. A whistleblower, who wished to remain anonymous, said previous management was "chaotic" and it was "clear funds were spent where they shouldn't have been". Referring to the Manchester United tickets, the source told the BBC: "I could possibly understand it if it were a local team [and] you would be showing off Birmingham at its best, but Manchester? No." More than 100 redundancies were made at the college during the last year- almost a quarter of the workforce. New interim principal Michelle Sutton said: "The college has experienced a period of financial challenges as a result of some of the strategic decisions that have been taken in the past." She said the management team had been halved in size and that a recovery plan was now in place. Regarding the football tickets, the college added: "The previous management team pursued a strategy of growth, of which the relationship with Manchester United was part. "The new management team and board cannot comment further on the rationale and detail behind decisions taken by the previous management team. "However, we can confirm that these arrangements no longer exist."	A college bought Manchester United season tickets in a "growth strategy" before cutting more than 100 jobs.
"I thought it was great, fantastic," says Tom, one of the 450 or so full-time workers who work shifts preparing and packaging chilled fish destined for the supermarket shelves. Tom is not his real name. He's too scared of revealing his true identity for fear of losing his job. His employer is about to impose new terms and conditions and the workers aren't happy. "The workforce are up in arms about it. Everybody is really really annoyed with the company the way they've done things... we feel as though they're robbing us," he says. On 1 April, the government increased the minimum wage from £6.70 to £7.20 an hour for workers aged 25 and over. Seachill relies on overtime to keep its conveyor belts running.  It's a requirement written into staff contracts. On top of a 40-hour week, Tom says workers can end up doing another 20 hours, especially when there's a big order to complete. His employer wants to increase the basic rate of pay to £7.35 an hour but cut overtime payments.. Tom reckons he will earn up to £80 a month less than he was expecting. Workers have to decide whether to accept the new contracts or risk losing their jobs. "Even with the new rate they've offered us at £7.35 an hour, at time and a quarter, it's less than what they would've been paying us at £7.20 an hour and time and a half and double time. "We are losing out big style," he says. The company is part of the Icelandic Group. It made more than £8m in profit last year. In a statement, it says its changes are designed to make it more efficient and says most workers will be better off. Tom disagrees and says he's 100% certain the changes are being made to help offset the costs of the new National Living Wage. "It's not on. As far as all of us are concerned, it's not on. How can they say in one breath that the firm is doing really well, and then expect us to take a pay cut?" Seachill is not the only company that's been reviewing its pay arrangements. At Pennine Foods in Sheffield, owned by the huge food group, 2 Sisters, workers have voted for strike action after the company announced it would cut Sunday and bank holiday pay as part of plans to standardise payments to staff. Elsewhere, staff benefits are also being trimmed. At Caffe Nero, workers are no longer entitled to a free panini whilst staff at Eat will no longer have paid-for breaks. In a recent parliamentary debate on the issue, both companies along with some other household names were in the firing line from MPs; DIY chain B&Q came in for particular criticism. "Companies such as B&Q use the introduction of the national living wage to 'reform their pay and reward structures', as they put it. That is a euphemism for cutting staff pay," said Joan Ryan, Labour MP for Enfield North. "I have found disturbing and, quite frankly, shameful the way in which some large employers in the service sector have used the introduction of a living wage as an excuse to cut basic work entitlements," added Julie Cooper, Labour MP for Burnley and Padiham. More than 130,000 people signed a petition against B&Q's planned cuts to employee benefits. It announced in February that it would be cutting Sunday pay and reducing bank holiday pay and bonuses for some staff, although it raised its basic pay to £7.66 an hour in April. B&Q said many workers would be better off or unaffected by its changes but that it had now extended compensation to staff who would lose out. Caffe Nero said its workers would still get a discount for food. Eat said all employees would be compensated through a pay rate above the current national living wage. In the last year, Morrisons, Tesco and Waitrose have also altered payments but they all insisted that it wasn't anything to do with the introduction of the national living wage. Some aren't surprised that employers are having to make changes. "Increasing the national living wage was the right thing to do but no-one can doubt that there will have to be adjustments," says Simon Walker, the boss of the Institute of Directors. "Companies have to be profitable so they are going to have to make adjustments and cut backs if they have to pay higher wages in order to break even. "They also face a number of other cost increases including the apprenticeship levy and auto enrolment for pensions." The chancellor cut corporation tax to help ease the burden on employers. He's called on companies to follow the spirit of the law. The owners of Seachill say it has a very loyal, long serving workforce and ensuring that they were fairly rewarded, whilst continuing to provide a first class service to its customers, is a priority. But for Tom and many of his colleagues, the cuts to overtime are proving hard to swallow.	When workers at the Seachill fish factory in Grimsby first heard about George Osborne's National Living Wage they were very happy.
A police source told BBC Radio WM a passenger was seen pouring a liquid into a box, which then started smoking. The 48 passengers on the Megabus Preston to London service were led off the coach and forced to sit apart in a cordon on the opposite carriageway. Police said a report of vapour escaping from a bag which led to the security alert was caused by "a health improvement aid for smokers". The motorway was closed between junctions T3 and T4 near Lichfield before police said they were no longer treating the incident as suspicious, but it has now reopened. Staffordshire Police said the coach stopped on the hard shoulder "of its own accord" at 08:20 BST. About four hours after armed officers arrived, police confirmed the scene as safe. Shortly before 1500 BST the M6 Toll reopened. The passengers have been allowed to continue their journey to London, although some have chosen to return north, to Manchester. A police spokesperson said: "We received a report from a genuinely concerned member of the public about suspicious activity on a coach travelling on the M6 toll at Weeford, near Lichfield. "Given the nature of the report we responded swiftly and proportionately, treating the information as credible and extremely seriously. "The M6 Toll carriageways were closed in both directions, the coach was directed to the hard shoulder of the motorway and armed officers calmly evacuated passengers with their full support and co-operation. "Following an initial assessment, we can confirm that no-one has been injured and that there is no danger to passengers at the scene or any other travellers who were on the motorway at that time. "We are also not treating anyone as a suspect." A Megabus spokeswoman said the coach had left Preston at 05:10 and was due in London at 10:55. Earlier, armed police officers could be seen next to the single-decker coach on the southbound carriageway, as passengers were led off one by one. Passengers were made to sit on the northbound carriageway, apart from one another, while surrounded by officers. Sniffer dogs and forensic officers were also brought in to aid the search, as officers in forensic suits and others in military fatigues checked the area. The Ministry of Defence confirmed military personnel were assisting police, at their request, under routine procedure. One of the passengers on the bus told the BBC that she had no idea what was going on, that she didn't see anything supsicious, and wasn't told why they were pulled over. She was made to sit cross-legged on the tarmac and still was not told what was happening. She said the whole experience had been very "scary and frightening". The fire service, police from the West Midlands and Staffordshire forces and ambulance crews were all involved in the operation. Nick Jones, a sales manager from Cambridge, said he was about four vehicles behind the coach when police stopped traffic. "I've never seen so many ambulances turning up, also armed police, helicopter and dozens of police cars. "We were told to stay in our cars, keep windows up and not put air conditioning on. "Police were looking in hedgerows and verges on the northbound carriageway. "It all just took off, ambulances left right and centre and armed police in black caps." Another eye-witness Barry Jarvis told the BBC that cars were cleared from toll booths. He said: "It was very puzzling as to what was going on at first as there weren't that many police there. "It was only after 20 minutes or so when all these unmarked cars [were] coming through that we thought something major was happening. "As we were diverted, we could see armed police at the toll booths, and the fire brigade." Motorists on the M6 itself are experiencing delays of up to two-and-a-half hours. In a statement, Staffordshire Police said: "We would like to apologise for any inconvenience and hope that the public understand that we have our duty to safeguard public safety."	Armed police swooped on a coach on the M6 Toll motorway in the West Midlands.
Mr Ruto and his family were not at the compound near the western city of Eldoret at the time. Specialist troops had been deployed to deal with the intruder, who was hiding in a partially-constructed building, police said. Earlier reports suggested a number of gunmen had entered Mr Ruto's home. "In circumstances that are yet unclear, he hit an officer on duty with a machete and managed to enter the farm complex," National Police Inspector General Joseph Boinnet said in a statement. There were also reports of gunfire. The wounded police officer was in a stable condition, police said. The incident comes 10 days before Kenya holds presidential, legislative and regional elections. The deputy president had left hours earlier for a campaign rally in the town of Kitale, where he joined President Uhuru Kenyatta. Mr Kenyatta is seeking re-election next month. While Kenya's 2013 elections passed relatively peacefully, there was serious post-election violence following the 2007 polls, which left more than 1,000 people dead and 600,000 displaced from their homes. However, experts say they do not expect to see the same level of conflict following the 8 August vote.	A man armed with a machete has forced his way into the rural home of Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto after wounding a police guard, police say.
Remarkably, this year's finale features the two franchises who have waited longer than any other to win a championship. Cleveland's last title came way back in 1948. In ordinary circumstances a win for "the Tribe" would be a baseball fairytale: this year it would mostly be remembered for crushing Chicago's dreams. The Cubs, despite being one of the most popular and historic franchises in baseball, have not won a World Series title since 1908. They have not even played in the Fall Classic since 1945, when legend has it that a curse was placed on the team when a local tavern owner was asked to leave a game because the smell of his pet goat was upsetting other fans. Baseball is fond of hexes. The "Curse of the Bambino" - placed on the Boston Red Sox when they sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees - was blamed for the Red Sox's 86-year World Series drought, while the 1920 Black Sox betting scandal was fingered as the reason for the failure of the Cubs' cross-city rivals, the Chicago White Sox, to win a championship for 88 years. Media playback is not supported on this device But the Sox, red and white, finally came good in successive years a decade ago. The Cubs' winless streak stands at 108 years and counting. Various, possibly more likely, reasons have been advanced for the Cubs' epic failure, including playing more daytime games than most (which some believe denies the players the opportunity to settle into a rhythm), a failure to tap into Latin American talent and a poor system for developing young in-house stars. Some also believe the innate pessimism of the fans creates a counter-productive atmosphere of tension at their beautiful but capricious Wrigley Field home - where the wind can swirl unpredictably - when things get tense at the business end of the season. In 2003, the fan effect was more tangible when Steve Bartman covered himself in infamy by impeding a fielder's attempt to catch a key fly ball in a post-season game against the Florida (now Miami) Marlins. Needless to say the Cubs went on to lose the game, and the series and Bartman issued a public letter of apology. As he puts it on his Twitter feed: "Some people are remembered for a lifetime of great work, I'm remembered for five seconds." In 2008, a priest even sprinkled holy water in the Cubs' dug-out before their National League Division Series against Los Angeles. They did not win a single game, losing the best-of-five series 3-0. So why does 2016 finally promise something better? It seems the key was to make Theo Epstein president of baseball operations in 2011. He is now the highest paid manager in US sport, reportedly on a five-year contract paying more than $50m (£40.87m). Epstein had already tasted success at the Red Sox, relying on a scientific, analytical method to identify talent. He has repeated the process in Chicago, transforming a team that finished in last place in the National League Central Division for the first three years of his presidency. The batting line-up was the third most productive in the majors during the regular season. Dynamic infielders Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo both achieved the notable double of driving in more than 100 runs and hitting more than 30 home runs. But the Cubs' domination of their division, which they won for the first time since 2008 with three weeks of the season still to go, was primarily down to a group of pitchers as daunting as any seen in the major leagues in recent decades. The key measure of a pitcher's effectiveness is the earned run average (ERA) - the average number of runs they give up during a full nine-inning game. The Cubs' Kyle Hendricks posted the lowest ERA in the major leagues, and team-mate Jon Lester was second. The Cubs' bullpen - the group of relief pitchers who come into the game in the later stages when the starter has run out of steam - was also among the strongest in baseball. Sceptics thought the Cubs might again struggle to maintain their form into the postseason, but they eased past the San Francisco Giants 3-1 in the National League Division Series, and then came roaring back from 2-1 down to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. Just reaching the World Series prompted scenes of wild celebration. As David Haugh from the Chicago Tribune put it: "The reaction was visceral, the elation indescribable and the relief undeniable as a crowd of 42,386 fans unleashed 71 years' worth of frustration and disappointment." The Indians comfortably won the American League Central Division, despite losing their best hitter Michael Brantley to injury for most of the season. But with injuries to two of their key pitchers, few expected them to beat the Red Sox in the AL Division Series. In fact they swept the Sox, and went on to beat the Toronto Blue Jays in a low-scoring AL Championship Series. Deftly managed by Terry Francona, who won championships at Boston in 2004 and 2007, the Indians have proved themselves to be consummate battlers this year. Reaching a World Series is an impressive achievement for a franchise with one of the smallest payrolls in baseball. But many expect the Cubs to end their years of pain - if they can overcome their internal demons, and a smelly goat.	The Chicago Cubs will be hoping to end the most infamous run of failure in US sport when they face the Cleveland Indians in the World Series, which starts on Tuesday.
Shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz joked that cries of "Don't panic! Don't panic!" were being heard around 10 Downing Street as the government tries to organise its policies on Brexit. Commons Leader David Lidington speculated that his Labour opposition "don't like it up 'em'". Mr Perry, who also created sitcom Hi-de-Hi, died on Sunday aged 93. During the business statement, Ms Vaz said she grew up watching Dad's Army, adding: "It struck me that you could hear those catchphrases ringing around Number 10, so we hear the cry of 'Don't panic! Don't panic!' "Or as the Prime Minister slaps down her recalcitrant and wayward colleagues you can hear her muttering 'stupid boys'. "When you ask their position on Brexit, the infamous 'don't tell 'em Pike!'." Mr Perry worked with the late producer David Croft and the pair were also responsible for It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi and You Rang M'Lord? Commons Leader David Lidington also paid tribute to Mr Perry, who often wrote the theme tunes to his shows. He said: "I thought it was a wonderful gesture when outside Buckingham Palace earlier this week the military band in the changing of the guards ceremony played the theme tune to Dad's Army as a tribute. "But I do think when I look across at the Opposition, in particular when I look at their faces during Prime Minister's Questions, the phrase that comes into my mind is 'they don't like it up 'em'." The SNP's Commons leader Pete Wishart also chipped in, saying: "I would hate to say that we are all doomed but perhaps we are under this particular Government." TV references also came up in the Commons on Wednesday at Prime Minister's Questions when Jeremy Corbyn likened Theresa May's plan for the UK leaving the UK as one of Baldrick's "cunning plans" from the Blackadder series.	MPs have paid tribute to Dad's Army creator Jimmy Perry, using his show's famous catchphrases in the Commons.
Jamie Peacock, Kevin Sinfield and Kylie Leuluai ended their rugby league playing careers with the 22-20 win over Wigan Warriors at Old Trafford, which completed Leeds' domestic treble. "I do believe it gave us an edge," McDermott told BBC Sport. "For Kylie, JP and Sinfield to go out on that note, that is fitting as well." Speaking after the win, which attracted a Grand Final record crowd of 73,512, McDermott added: "Everybody wanted to tip in, that was the difference." For Sinfield, the longest serving of the trio, it was his final game in the 13-man code before switching to rugby union's Yorkshire Carnegie, starting next month. The Leeds and former England captain admitted it was an emotion-charged send-off. "It was joy," Sinfield said when asked what it felt like to finish as a treble-winning captain. "Thankfully the guys jumped on me and hid a few of the tears. They were tears of joy. It was an unbelievable way to finish." The defeat marked the end of Wigan full-back Matty Bowen's career, while winger Joe Burgess also said farewell as he joins Sydney Roosters. Bowen, who scored a brilliant solo try to put Wigan 18-16 ahead in the second half, said it was a "surreal" occasion, having become a father for the third time just before midnight on the eve of the game. Daughter Tatum was in the stands with the rest of Bowen's family, 16 hours after being born. "It's been a busy two days at the hospital... we've had a beautiful little girl," said Bowen, who will take up a role with former club and newly crowned NRL champions North Queensland Cowboys as part of their community coaching team. "She is healthy, that's the main thing. We haven't told anyone, for nine months nobody knew. I surprised my mum two weeks ago. "I just want to relax now and enjoy time with the family and watch them grow."	Leeds Rhinos were given a decisive boost for the Grand Final by the emotion surrounding their departing trio, says head coach Brian McDermott.
FirstGroup takes over on Sunday amid ongoing disputes over driver-operated doors and the role of train guards. The company said it would be "retaining a second person" on board trains. The RMT union said in talks the firm refused to provide a guarantee "despite what they have been telling the press". FirstGroup and Hong Kong company MTR will provide 90 new trains by December 2020 with doors that can be operated by the driver. Franchise managing director Andy Mellors said: "Our commitment with the 750 new carriages for the suburban routes out of Waterloo is that we will be retaining a second person on board those trains." But following talks the RMT said FirstGroup altered the wording to say it was "planning" to keep a second person. General secretary Mick Cash said: "The company refused to give a guarantee that there will be a second person â€Žon their trains despite what they have been telling the press. "They also failed to clarify what safety competencies and role a second member of staff would have on their services." The union sees a second member of staff on board its trains as "critical" to passenger safety. In an earlier BBC interview, Mr Mellors said the new trains would "retain a second person" on board, but could not say what that person's role would be. A company statement said: "We know that a second member of staff provides assurance to our passengers on trains and ensures we have capable colleagues on board to deliver assistance during the journey for anyone that needs help or advice while travelling on our trains." Disputes over driver-only operated trains on other rail services have led to 16 months of industrial action by the RMT. The South Western rail service currently operates routes between London Waterloo, Reading, Bristol, Exeter, Weymouth, and Portsmouth, as well as Island Line on the Isle of Wight.	The new South Western rail franchise holder has been criticised by a union for allegedly refusing to guarantee a second staff member on board its forthcoming trains.
Sean Buckley, 28, of Tonypandy, carried out a "deliberate and vicious" attack on Finley Thomas in September 2014, but claimed the boy had fallen down stairs. Finley was taken to University Hospital of Wales but died the next day. Buckley was also found guilty of child cruelty, a charge his partner Chloe Thomas, Finley's mother, had already admitted at Cardiff Crown Court. Sentencing will take place later on Thursday. Jurors were told Finley suffered "catastrophic" head injuries in the attack by Buckley. Doctors who examined his body found previous multiple bleeds and injuries to his head and spine, consistent with "non-accidental injury", including bleeding to his eyes 72 hours before he died. Traces of cocaine and cannabis were also found in his system. Finley last saw a doctor in July 2014, around the time Thomas got together with Buckley. The court heard she was infatuated with the drug dealer and was herself hooked on illegal drugs and the tranquilliser diazepam. She denied Buckley harmed her son and told the court the toddler had a "brilliant relationship" with her partner who considered him "his own". "He never put his hands on me and never put his hands on Finley," she said. On the day Finley died, Thomas said she had left him alone with Buckley but received a call asking her to "come back quick". She dialled 999 and told the operator her son had "banged his head" and was "lying floppy". Standing close by, Buckley was heard saying "he fell from the top of the stairs". Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting,  showed the jury a garden chair which he said was responsible for causing significant injuries to the back of Finley's head. "Whether he was hit with it or it was propped against a surface or wall and he was struck against it we can't say," he said. The court was told the chair was found near the back door in the house and the pattern on it matched two distinct lines of patterned bruising on the back of Finley's head. Speaking after the verdicts, Des Mannion, head of NSPCC Cymru, said the abuse suffered by the "defenceless toddler" was "horrific". "It is a sad reality that cases of abuse and neglect take place every day in homes across the country," he said. "We now expect there to be a detailed case review which should provide much-needed answers into how this tragedy took place and help prevent children like Finley suffering in this way again." Nicola Rees, acting head of the Crown Prosecution Service Wales complex casework unit, said Buckley had "refused to take any responsibility" for his actions. "A jury has now ensured that he must do so," she said. "Finley's tragic death has brought grief to his family and those close to him and our thoughts and sympathies are with them."	A man who beat a 17-month-old toddler to death with a garden chair has been found guilty of his murder.
A cabinet source has said that a "big reset" on subsidies paid by consumers, which push up household energy bills, is coming in the autumn. "There is a hardening view in the cabinet that we've got to deal with green subsidies," the source added. Last month, the government announced that new onshore wind farms would be excluded from a subsidy scheme from April next year. Within a few weeks, the solar power industry is expecting its subsidies will be cut. The issue of renewable energy subsidies was discussed at the weekly meeting of the government's most senior ministers on Tuesday. Subsidies to the renewable energy industry, paid for by consumers, are expected to add up to Â£4.3bn this year. This week, the think tank Policy Exchange said the average household energy bill has risen by Â£120 over the last five years due to what they called "ill-thought through energy and climate policies". A spokeswoman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: "Reducing energy bills for hard-working British families and businesses is this government's priority. We've already announced reforms to remove subsidies for onshore wind, and that work to make sure bill payers are getting the best possible deal is going to continue." But the renewable energy industry fears a cut now could seriously damage an industry at a crucial point in its development. "We are getting very anxious about what might be coming," Leonie Greene, from the Solar Trade Association, told the BBC. "The British industry is already very significant today. It employs over 30,000 people and turns over billions of pounds. It is quite clear that globally this industry is going to be worth trillions. So it is incredibly important that in terms of the global race that the prime minister talks about, that we make sure we have a strong solar industry in the UK." In a speech last month, the Energy Secretary Amber Rudd warned the renewables industry and campaigners that support for the environment has to be weighed against the impact on energy bills. "All that support costs money," she said. "We cannot ignore the fact that, obviously, people want subsidies if they are on the receiving end of subsidies, but we have to ensure that we get the good measure of it." And there lies the conundrum for the government: attempting to keep bills low, supporting emerging industries and keeping to climate change targets - with the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris just a few months away now in December.	Green taxes are set to be cut further, the BBC has learnt.
The increase of 15,000 seeking work was precisely matched, according to the Office for National Statistics survey, by the fall of 15,000 in the number of Scots seeking work at some point during the spring months. One thousand more Scots were in work. Watchers of the Scottish figures won't feel this more welcome jolt to be much of a surprise. It's been a bumpy ride in recent months, most of which have seen the Scottish employment picture worsen relative to the UK as a whole. These most recent figures return Scotland to a better position (just) of 5.5% unemployment, while the UK is at 5.6%. The Scottish employment rate remains higher. The unusual aspect of the UK-wide jolt is that rising unemployment has been accompanied by a sharp increase in pay. Economists don't usually expect those to go together. But these continue to be abnormal times, as the labour market adjusts towards something like normality, or perhaps a new normal. The Scottish job statistics show that most jobs growth is in full-time work. The number of people in part-time work is growing more slowly, and fewer of them are telling ONS surveyors that it is because they can't find full-time posts. The numbers in temporary posts have been falling. It appears that women have been the ones leaving temporary posts and going full-time, while there's also a rise in women taking a second job (more than 60,000 of them in Scotland). The number of men in temporary roles is on the rise too, but they're much slower to get a second job. The overall picture emerging from this reflects the strengthened bargaining position of workers, while employers accept they have to sacrifice some of the flexibility of the temporary, contractorised job market if they're to get the people and skills they need. At 3.2% annual growth rate for June earnings, including bonuses, that's the fastest rate for five years, and with consumer price inflation back at noflation, it means a significant rise in real earnings. It helps fuel speculation that there could be more inflation coming back into the economy, for which the Bank of England may have to consider an interest rate rise. The pay figures bear out the view shared by trade unions and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that "Britain deserves a pay rise". Not the public sector, though. It has been pegged back to no more than 1% for each of the next four years, though Holyrood could choose to vary that, if John Swinney can find the money. You can see tensions stoking up between public and private sector pay. George Osborne's announcement of a "national living wage" in the Budget last week, which caught the headlines, is now catching the ire of business bosses, in some sectors at least. The chairman of Wetherspoon's has weighed in with a warning that the higher pay creates "considerable uncertainty" about the future of the pub industry. It's already suffering from very tough competition from off-licences, notably supermarkets, while drinking habits are changing unfavourably. His reckoning is that a Â£1 pint of beer sold in an off-licence carries staff costs of about 10 pence. But a Â£3 pint sold in a bar carries staff costs of 75 pence. With his trading update, he's reporting squeezed margins. What, then, of Scotland's growth figures? A rise of 0.6% for January to March is reasonably healthy, given other more negative indicators at the start of the year. It is slightly ahead of the UK thanks, once again, to the figures showing construction in Scotland has been out-growing that of the UK more widely. Construction output is up 21% compared with the start of 2014, whereas it was up only 4.5% in the UK figures. That may be partly explained by the big projects currently under way, many of them funded by the Scottish government; the Border railway, the Forth Replacement Crossing, the M8 upgrade in Lanarkshire. Also helping to grow the economy more than most were hospitality (in a strong year for tourism), transport equipment (such as bus-building in Falkirk) and chemicals and refined petroleum (at Grangemouth). The sector that's been performing much less well is textiles, with output down 13% in the year to March.  The metals and machinery sector has performed poorly too. The Scottish economy grew by 2.8% between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of this year, while the UK economy grew by 2.9%. But remember that the population is growing at different speeds, largely due to migration, and the output per head is an important measure of whether productivity is on the rise. That growth rate per head in the year to March was 2.5% for Scotland and 2.2% for the UK. Since 2012, output per capita was up 5% in Scotland, ahead of 4.6% in the UK as a whole. That suggests something is going relatively right. But it's relative to a poor performance. The whole of the UK needs to do more to get productivity rising, not least to make those wage rises sustainable.	The rise and rise of UK employment has taken a jolt, with a fall of 67,000 in March to May and the first rise in unemployment for two years.
Officers were called at about 02:30 BST following reports that a man in his 30s had been attacked in Greenbrow Road, Wythenshawe. He was taken to hospital but he died from his injuries. Supt Steve Howard, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "We are working hard to piece together what happened to the man."	A murder investigation has been launched after a man was found stabbed in Manchester, police have said.
Jackie Stokes, from Burton-upon-Trent, said she spent Â£9,500 on implants in Hungary but an investigation found her treatment plan caused "irreversible damage to otherwise healthy teeth". Dentist Dr Zsolt Csillag was given a one-year supervision order by the General Dental Council. He did not respond to attempts to contact him. The Forest and Ray Medical Care Group said he had left the company due to "personal reasons". The clinic said it "always puts patients first" and treated Mrs Stokes with extra care, above and beyond its normal routine. Mrs Stokes said: "It has left me feeling like I have been assaulted, butchered and robbed of my life savings. "I was advised by an NHS dentist to go down the implant road... because it wasn't on the NHS I would go seek help elsewhere. "A friend of mine had been over to Hungary so we decided to go down that line," the 65-year-old added. Mrs Stokes had implants in her upper jaw and crowns on eight teeth in her lower jaw, over two trips to Budapest. On her second visit in June 2013, she said she was left with a "bulldog bite" - a gap between her gums and upper teeth through which food would seep. The implants failed and were later removed. She now has to wear dentures. In total, Mrs Stokes said she had 27 visits to the dental group over four years. The General Dental Council found Dr Csillag should not have put crowns on her eight lower teeth because they were healthy. In relation to Mrs Stokes and another patient, his treatment plan for them included "irreversible damage to otherwise healthy teeth", the investigation found. The restrictions placed on Dr Csillag can only be imposed when he is working in the United Kingdom.	A woman who spent her life savings on dental implants that had to be taken out feels "butchered" by the dentist.
The watchdog assessed the authority's services between January 16 and February 9 and found improvements since its last inspection in 2011. Inspectors said parents had told them new services, brought in over the past 18 months, were "making a difference". The council welcomed the report, but said it was "identifying areas where can do better". See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Inspectors assessed three key areas and ranked two - leadership and services for looked-after children - as "good". The third area - children who need help and protection - was rated as "requires improvement". In 2011, services in the city were ranked "adequate". In 2013 the council closed two children's centres and reopened eight others as "strengthening family hubs" and inspectors said this seemed to be a difference. "Services have been reconfigured in such a way as to bring together... family workers with health visitors, midwives and social workers," the report said. "Parents told inspectors that it is making a difference to them and their families and that, increasingly, they are able to get the right help in the right way." However, the report added the help and protection which children and young people receive requires improvement. "The quality of analysis, assessments and plans... is variable," it said. "Some children are not getting the help and support that they need quickly enough." Val Gibson, the authority's cabinet member for children and young people, said: "Inspectors have scrutinised our services in minute detail, highlighting the many areas where we are performing well, and identifying areas where we can and will do better." "We have developed a robust action plan to raise standards still further."	Children's services in Wolverhampton have been rated "good" following an inspection by Ofsted.
The 85-year-old F1 supremo likened the sport to a rock concert at which the band turned up but could not perform. "We are not putting on a very good show," he said, in the build-up to Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix. "Imagine if people turned up to watch the Rolling Stones and Mick (Jagger) couldn't sing and the others couldn't play their instruments." In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Sport, Ecclestone also: Last week, the drivers wrote an open letter saying the decision-making process in F1 is "obsolete and ill-structured". Responding the following day, Ecclestone said he agreed with the drivers. But he told BBC Sport he thought the drivers were saying "probably what their teams had told them to say". Alex Wurz, the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, was not immediately available to respond to Ecclestone's claims. Ecclestone added the governance of F1 was "nothing to do with me". On the issue of qualifying, Ecclestone blamed governing body the FIA for the new format, which was supposed to spice up race weekends. It did the opposite at the season-opening race in Australia, prompting teams to call for a return to the 2015 system. However, the move was blocked by FIA president Jean Todt. Asked if the new qualifying system worked, Ecclestone said: "Depends how you looked at it. The whole idea is we were hoping one or two of the hot shoes would be in trouble in Q1 and Q2. It didn't happen." He added the idea "wasn't mine at all" but the FIA's. However, he rejected calls for a return to the 2015 format because he felt that did not work well either. There will be a meeting of team bosses on Sunday before the race in Bahrain to discuss the qualifying system again. Ecclestone has said he would like to switch to a different system that either decides the grid by ballot or shuffles the order by adding "time ballast" to drivers' times based on either the result of the previous race or the championship order. Ecclestone also discussed the new fuel-efficient turbo hybrid engines, arguing he would prefer a return to the naturally aspirated V8s in use until 2013. "I said this engine would be a disaster and was criticised for that," he said, claiming the lack of noise meant F1 had lost some of its appeal. He also claimed only one engine manufacturer - Mercedes - managed to adapt well to the new engines, which meant competition had suffered. Mercedes have dominated F1 since the new engine came in, winning both the drivers' and constructors championships for the past two years. "Mercedes have done an incredible job with that power unit," he said. "It is unbelievable.  but it is not F1." Asked what F1 should be like, he said: "Like it used to be. I didn't find anything wrong with the V8s and neither did anyone else."	Bernie Ecclestone says Formula 1 is "cheating" its fans because the quality of the show is poor.
On Wednesday, the electric carmaker reported a first quarter loss of $282m (Â£195m) up from $154m last year. The loss was in line with investors' expectations, and the announcement that it was increasing production sent its shares up 4% in after-hours trading. Tesla had been struggling to ramp up production of its cars including its newest Model X SUV. Production of the Model X rose from 507 in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2,659 in the first quarter of 2016. The company confirmed it was on track to deliver 80,000 to 90,000 electric vehicles this year. Tesla said it had seen demand rise across all its models, especially its Model 3 - the carmaker's first mass-market product. Deliveries of the Model 3 are due to hit the market in 2017 and the company received 325,000 orders for the car within a week of announcing it. This could result in $14bn in future sales. To meet that demand Tesla has cut two years off its timeline for ramping up production. "Increasing production five-fold over the next two years will be challenging and will likely require some additional capital, but this is our goal," chief executive Elon Musk said in a latter to investors. Tesla said its capital expenditure - money spent to grow the company - would probably increase by 50%. Some investors have been concerned about Tesla's cash flow. The company has been spending money to increase its manufacturing facilities. Though it has seen orders rise, the carmaker has yet to make a profit. Since the start of the year Tesla has faced some production hurdles. A shortage of parts for its Model X stalled production in January and February. On Wednesday, Tesla announced two of its manufacturing heads were stepping down from their roles. Greg Reichow, vice president of production will take a leave of absence as soon as a successor can be found. Josh Ensign, vice-president of manufacturing, is also leaving the company.	Tesla Motors says it is on track to produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018, two years earlier than expected.
He is among thousands of Burmese Tamils living in the north-eastern Indian town of Moreh in Manipur state, which borders Myanmar, also known as Burma. Mr Sarlan and other Indian-origin people were forced to leave the country following a military coup in the 1960s. Their businesses were nationalised and Mr Sarlan, who used to live in Rangoon (now called Yangon), and others became penniless refugees overnight. It is estimated that nearly 300,000 Indians fled the country following the coup. "After we reached India, for the first three months we were living in a refugee camp in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu was the land of our forefathers, it was difficult to live there without any support," recalls Mr Sarlan, 74, who is now a social activist. 'Mini-India' Indians lived in Burma for centuries, but large-scale migration took place during British-colonial rule, when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were used as civil servants, traders, farmers, labourers and artisans - and came to be considered the backbone of the economy. Burmese nationalists always viewed them with suspicion and there were a series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s. Once the British left in 1948, Indian-origin people became increasingly vulnerable and they were swiftly forced to leave following the 1962 coup. They found it difficult to settle in India, so many decided to return to Burma by land. They vaguely knew that India's north-eastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh shared a border with Burma. After weeks of travelling by train and bus a small group managed to reach Moreh, around 3,200km (2,000 miles) by road from Tamil Nadu. When they reached the border crossing, Burmese soldiers prevented them from entering the country. The Tamils settled in Moreh hoping one day to return to their homeland - but those dreams have never been fulfilled. "Moreh was a tribal village when we first came here. There was hardly any infrastructure at that point. But many Burmese people came to Moreh looking for Indian goods like automobile parts, clothing and cosmetics. Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses," Mr Sarlan recalls. Soon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them. Many went on to become Indian citizens. By the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a "mini-India". "We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu," says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school. Chinese goods At one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others. Several people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then. "We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately," says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman. Tamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh. Traders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay "extortion money" were shot dead. The violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500. 'Gateway' The insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises. Moreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential. The story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement. Many elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment. "If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai," says B Revathy, a university student. Emotional attachment it seems may not be enough for Moreh to keep its Burmese Tamils.

But more than 400 years on, it has become a sticking point in the Stormont talks. In response to demands for an Irish language act, the Democratic Unionist party is understood to want more formal protection for Ulster-Scots too. But what form would that take and what do Ulster-Scots speakers want? According to the 2011 census, 8% of Northern Ireland's population claim some knowledge of Ulster-Scots - just over 140,000 people. That included 13% of Protestants and 3% of Catholics. By contrast, more than 179,000 people claimed to have some knowledge of Irish. The former Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure published proposals for an Irish language act in 2015. However, in the same year the department published a strategy to enhance and develop the Ulster-Scots language, heritage and culture up until the year 2035. Although a strategy is not legislation, that document gives some pointers about what form any enhanced status for Ulster-Scots may mean. It included these proposals: Those were all important for Ulster-Scots enthusiasts at the Ullans centre in Ballymoney, County Antrim - a hub for the Ulster-Scots language, music, dance and history. But more money is also a big issue, according to Louise Morrow who teaches classes in Ulster-Scots. "Equality of funding is a big thing for me," she said. "The Irish language does get more funding and is more recognised than the Ulster-Scots language. "We would also like to see more Ulster-Scots townland names being recognised. "Ulster-Scots is forgotten about in some ways I feel." For fellow volunteer Johnny Crawford, more education is vital. "We'd like to see more provision in schools and more curriculum-based Ulster-Scots," he said. "It's also mostly primary school driven, as there isn't a lot of resources for post-primary pupils." The Ullans centre is also home to Northern Ireland's only dedicated Ulster-Scots radio station, Fuse FM. One of its presenters, Liam Logan, says any legislation or strategy to protect and promote Ulster-Scots can be introduced gradually. "At the bottom of it is that notion of education, so people have an idea of their Ulster-Scots linguistic heritage," he said. "And a wee bit of respect that says just because you speak in an Ulster-Scots way, it doesn't mean you're stupid." So while the talking goes on at Stormont - and like their counterparts who speak Irish - Ulster-Scots enthusiasts say they want action and not just words. And according to fluent Ulster-Scots speaker Jack Kyle, from Ballymoney, the stakes are high. "I was born here, my father was born here and my mum and my grandparents," he said. "People around here still speak Ulster-Scots like they did. "We just don't want to see it dying out."	Ulster-Scots is a language which has been part of life here since the first Scots planters arrived in Ulster in the 17th Century.
The video of Bailey Matthews showing him abandoning his walking aid to cross the finish line has been viewed on Facebook more than 27 million times. Bailey, from Doncaster, was given the Richard Whiteley award at a ceremony in Leeds on Friday night. Cricketer Joe Root received the Sporting Achievement award. The Yorkshire Awards, now in their 27th year, "recognise the many and varied achievements of people and businesses in the county". Bailey competed in the children's event at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire in July, swimming 100m, riding a bike for four km and running for 1.3 km. Despite stumbling twice on his way to the finish line, he picked himself up and ran the final 20m of the course without his walking frame. Bailey's family said: "We are extremely honoured to receive the Richard Whiteley award for Bailey's efforts and it makes it all the more special with being proud northerners." Sheffield-born Root became the leading batsman in the ICC world rankings after helping England beat Australia to regain the Ashes. The 24-year-old has established himself as one of England's key performers and is closing on 3,000 test runs. Root said the award was a "real honour" and he wanted to thank everyone who had supported him. TV chef Rosemary Shrager, who has worked and lived in Yorkshire for many years, was presented with the Woman of the Year award, while Rotherham-born William Hague was named Man of the Year. Mr Hague, former MP for Richmond, said: "Whatever I have done, and wherever I have been in the world, I have never stopped being a Yorkshireman, and never will." Sir David Wootton picked up the Lifetime Achievement while Huddersfield-born poet Simon Armitage won the Arts and Entertainment award. Mr Armitage's numerous accolades include a BAFTA winning film Feltham Sings for which he received an Ivor Novello award. The Business Enterprise award was given to timber company Howarth Timber. Starting in Leeds in 1840, it has expanded from a one-man business to an employer of more than 1,000 people. North Yorkshire famer Gareth Barlow was presented with the Countryside award while junior football coach Stephen Shipley won the Community Hero award.	An eight-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who was filmed completing his first triathlon unaided has been honoured at the Yorkshire Awards.
The lawsuit filed in a federal court in San Francisco argues that the policy is unconstitutional. Women can serve in front line positions in the US military, but they are barred from ground combat units. A Pentagon spokesman said 14,500 combat positions had been opened to women under the current defence secretary. He added that Defence Secretary Leon Panetta had "directed the services to explore the possibility of opening additional roles for women in the military". But ACLU lawyer Ariela Migdal said the changes so far were "not enough". The lawsuit argues that continuing restrictions violate servicewomen's constitutional rights to equality. One of the plaintiffs, Marine Corps Capt Zoe Bedell, said existing rules had blocked her advancement in the Marines. "The military is the last place where you are allowed to be discriminated against because of your gender," she said. Women account for about 14% of the 1.4 million active US military personnel. The lawsuit launched on Tuesday says they are barred from 238,000 positions, but also alleges that they are already serving unofficially in combat units.	The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a challenge on behalf of four US servicewomen against a ban on women being deployed in most combat roles.
Thomas Hunter, 59, of Mansfield Road, Mansfield, had admitted causing the eight-vehicle crash on the A34 at Hinksey Hill, Oxford, on 25 August. Isla Wiggin, of Fleet, Hampshire, died two days later. Her mother Collette's unborn son also died in the crash. She told a court Hunter had "completely ruined" her family's lives. Collette Wiggin also suffered a broken neck when Hunter drove his Volvo lorry into the back of a stationary queue of traffic at 43mph. At Oxford Crown Court, prosecutor Michael Roques said another driver described the lorry "ploughing through all the other vehicles in the queue, scattering them like skittles". Defence barrister Alexander Stein said his client could not remember the crash and had no idea why he had lost concentration for between eight and 10 seconds. The crash forced the closure of the northbound carriageway of the road for almost 10 hours. Mrs Wiggin read her own victim impact statement in court, asking for an example to be made of Hunter to send a message to other drivers. She said: "My perfect life was ripped away from me, as the result of the thoughtless act of another. "I am broken, all I ever wanted to be was a mother, and I absolutely loved being mummy. "He has completely ruined the lives of good people who did nothing at all to deserve it." She added: "A huge part of me died with my children." Hunter admitted causing death by dangerous driving and serious injury by dangerous driving at a hearing last month. Judge Ian Pringle told Hunter he had been "completely oblivious" to the queue of traffic, and had caused "catastrophic damage" to Mrs Wiggin's car. Sgt Beth Walton of Thames Valley Police said the crash was "entirely preventable". "If Hunter had taken care over his driving, and had been paying full attention to the road, Isla would be here today along with baby Harry. "This case shows what the catastrophic consequences can be when drivers are not concentrating when at the wheel."	A lorry driver has been jailed for six years for causing the death of a three-year-old girl in a pile-up in which her pregnant mother suffered a miscarriage.
Residents and an official said the victims were travelling in a pick-up truck that was targeted in the Hiran district of Hajja province. They had been heading to a local market, according to the residents. There was no immediate comment from the coalition, which is fighting the Houthi rebel movement in a bid to restore the internationally recognised government. The coalition says it does not target civilians, but the UN says air strikes have caused the majority of the more than 4,125 civilian deaths recorded since the conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015. Wednesday's incident comes two days after a 48-hour cessation of hostilities ended. Both sides accused each other of repeated violations of the truce, which brought a brief respite from air strikes for residents of the rebel-controlled capital, Sanaa. Fighting continued in and around the south-western city of Taiz throughout the weekend, however, and on Tuesday clashes there reportedly left 11 people dead. Military officials said pro-government forces had repelled an attack on Taiz's western outskirts by Houthis and allied security personnel loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The International Committee of the Red Cross expressed alarm on Tuesday at the situation in Taiz, where some 300,000 people have been under siege by rebel forces for more than a year. "Sniper fire and indiscriminate shelling has trapped civilians. Dead bodies are in the streets and people are unable to attend to their most basic needs. The situation is desperate," said the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen, Alexandre Faite. Mr Faite added that the main hospitals in Taiz had reported receiving an average of 200 wounded in three days. Many patients were suffering from blast injuries and had to have limbs amputated.	Twelve civilians are reported to have been killed in a Saudi-led coalition air strike in north-western Yemen.
The home side had an Alfredo Morelos goal disallowed and saw Bruno Alves' header cleared off the line. Hearts struck the crossbar through John Souttar, but Caixinha was positive about Rangers' display. "One team dominated from the beginning to the end," Caixinha told Rangers TV. "I'm disappointed with the result, of course, which is the most important thing, but I really liked the team. "[Hearts] tried to create something at the beginning of the game to delay our pace, they did it, but we finish the first half completely dominating, with some very good chances to score, which we could not do. "I'm happy with the way they fought until the end. "You cannot control this type of situation but what you can control is what the boys did, the effort, the hard work, the teamwork, not allowing the opponent to play and always looking to play our game." Rangers have now dropped five points in consecutive home games - against Hearts and then Hibs - as Caixinha integrates the nine new players who arrived during the summer. The Ibrox manager insists his side are playing well, but failing to convert chances and not maintaining a high enough intensity to their play. "The only point I need to refer to is the pace of the passes needs to be higher, a higher tempo of passing and moving," Caixinha said. "Regarding to the overall and especially the ending position on attack, we were very good. "I don't remember one single transition from the opponent, or one single time where they could get the confidence to try to beat our last line. "We did everything we could to win the game, we had the chances to win it but we could not do it. "The timing and the tempo of the passes, the way we move in attack, yes definitely we need to improve that - that's all I take because the boys leave everything, they play the way we want them to play. We created chances and avoided the opponent having transitions, but we didn't score goals. "We are controlling the moments of the game but should be more aggressive in the last third. To win you need to score goals, and we didn't do that."	Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha declared himself "happy" with Rangers' performance but "disappointed" with the outcome of the goalless draw with Hearts.
The 48-year-old ex-Oxford manager has guided the Cobblers to promotion from League Two this season, after a series of financial problems at the club. Wilder is currently on a one-year rolling contract with the League Two side. Jimmy Phillips has been in charge of Bolton since Neil Lennon left in March but could not prevent relegation. Wanderers chairman Ken Anderson said on Monday that the club had a shortlist of three managers from applications they had received and hoped to make an appointment soon. The Championship's bottom side have also confirmed that assistant manager Steve Walford and first-team coach Garry Parker have left the club.	Northampton's Chris Wilder is Bolton's preferred choice to be their next manager, BBC Radio Manchester reports.
Darren Turk, 53, of Fontridge Lane in Etchingham, is charged with 14 offences including rape and indecent assault between 1996 and 2002. At the time he was a member of the care staff, and later head of care, at Frewen College in Northiam. He has been bailed to appear before Hastings Magistrates' Court on 1 July. Sussex Police said the charges did not involve any staff or pupils currently at the school. Frewen College is a day and boarding school for children aged between seven and 19 with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia.	A man has been accused of committing sexual offences against boys at an East Sussex school where he worked more than a decade ago.

The judge held that Mr Durkan acted unilaterally and unlawfully in authorising the Belfast Metropolitan Area Plan (BMAP) without securing consent from executive colleagues. His verdict came in a challenge to the SDLP environment minister's decision. It was brought by former enterprise minister Arlene Foster of the DUP. The judge backed claims that because its significance stretched across departmental responsibilities it needed approval from the Stormont cabinet. A decision on what remedy to grant in the case will be taken at a later date. BMAP identifies zones for retail, residential and commercial development across the city and outlying areas such as Carrickfergus, Lisburn, Newtownabbey and north Down. Among the most contentious aspects of the blueprint is a retail zoning which restricts future expansion at the Sprucefield shopping centre to bulky goods only. That would mean a long-proposed John Lewis store could not be built there. Mrs Foster, now the first minister, issued proceedings amid claims her colleague in the power-sharing administration breached the ministerial code. Mr Durkan had said efforts were made to get the issue on the agenda at executive meetings. During the hearing it was confirmed that the legal action involved a disagreement split down party political lines. The DUP is opposed to the restrictions adopted by the SDLP minister in BMAP, the judge was told. Counsel for Mrs Foster repeatedly argued that the planning framework was a cross-cutting, controversial matter which needed the agreement of the whole executive. He claimed "battle lines were well drawn" in the debate over allowing unrestricted retail development at Sprucefield, with the potential impact on town and city centre shopping. He alleged the environment minister was only interested in securing approval for his own pre-determined outcome. The judge was told seven of the other 10 Stormont departments were concerned enough about BMAP to want to take part in a special executive sub-group set up to deal with the issue. Mr Durkan's barrister contended that attempts were made to coerce him into ignoring his legal duties in dealing with the planning blueprint. He also claimed the environment minister was put under pressure by DUP ministerial colleagues over a policy which effectively blocked attempts to build a John Lewis store. However, the judge held that the decision did cut across responsibilities of others in the executive under the terms of the 1998 Northern Ireland Act. He confirmed: "It was therefore a function of the executive committee to discuss and agree upon it, rather than for the respondent to act unilaterally." In a statement following the ruling, the Department of Environment said: "DoE planning is carefully considering Mr Justice Treacy's full judgement and the outcome of today's decision."	Environment Minister Mark H Durkan had no legal power to approve a major new planning blueprint for greater Belfast, a High Court judge has ruled.
Denis O'Brien was granted a high court injunction in May to stop RTÉ reporting details of his personal finances. TD Catherine Murphy later made comments regarding his finances under privilege in the Dáil (parliament). Media organisations returned to court to seek clarity. Ms Murphy told the Dáil that Mr O'Brien owed the former Anglo Irish Bank upwards of 500m euro (£362m). Ms Murphy, an independent left-wing TD, said Mr O'Brien was attempting to pay loans back at an interest rate of just over 1%, when it was arguable that the correct rate should be over 7%. But those comments went largely unreported in the Republic of Ireland because of the high court injunction restraining RTÉ from reporting on Mr O'Brien's personal finances and his relationship with the former Anglo Irish Bank, now the nationalised Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC). On Tuesday, lawyers for several media organisations returned to the high court to hear judge Donald Binchy say that he never intended nor could he order any interference with what a TD may say under privilege in the Dáil. He could not stop any media organisation from reporting those remarks, he said. That clarification has been welcomed by the national broadcaster RTÉ and other media organisations, and by the National Union of Journalists.	A high court judge in the Republic of Ireland has ruled that the media can report what was said in the Irish parliament under privilege about the country's richest man.
Glamorgan's total was dominated by Nick Selman's mature 101 off 144 balls, his second first-class century. But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital. Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day. Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea. Aneurin Donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prospered in the afternoon. Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point. Gloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced. Glamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph, who has a neck problem. Glamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport: "It was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred. "(My season) was going well up until after (a century in) Swansea, after Swansea four ducks in a row, but it was good to spend some time in the middle at Northants. "Opening the batting in county cricket over here (in the UK), it's definitely hard, you get some good balls, you play on some green wickets and I was struggling a bit. "I was happy to get a few today and hopefully I can continue that for the rest of the season." Gloucestershire seamer Matt Taylor told BBC Radio Bristol: "There's definitely a bit on offer out there (for the bowlers), we didn't start exactly how we'd like but we got there in the end and we'd take bowling them out for 220. "I was pretty happy with that (hitting the stumps three times), the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-stump and luckily they missed them today. "I was pleased to get an opportunity in T20 and the white-ball stuff this year, now I'm getting an opportunity with the red ball it's great. "It's definitely going to be tough (for the Gloucestershire batsmen), they're a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score."	Gloucestershire finished day one on 62-3 in reply to Glamorgan's 220 all out at the SSE Swalec Stadium in Cardiff.
The 21-year-old had been at Hednesford Town on loan this season, but has experience in the fifth tier with Southport and Wrexham. Adam Lockwood's Guiseley are currently five points from safety. "Joel's a rapidly developing talent and we've been watching him for some time. We're excited to have signed him," said football secretary Adie Towers.	National League's bottom side Guiseley have signed former Rochdale winger Joel Logan on an undisclosed deal.
Scientists trying to understand the rise of antibiotic resistance, considered by some to be the great health threat of our time, believe they could provide clues to the mechanisms behind its spread. In an increasingly global society, travel can be pointed to as one of the reasons for the rise of antibiotic resistance. Now an international team of researchers from Newcastle University and the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, is studying how large gatherings of people could become hotspots for the spread of the genes that cause resistance. In order to do this, they needed to find a site that was free from pollution where they could study the effects of human activity. Rishikesh and Haridwar - which became famous when the Beatles dropped in during the 1960s -  provided the perfect case studies. Every year, in May and June, these cities welcome hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and the cities' populations swell from around 300,000 to over a million. Most of the year, the river running through the cities is pristine. But, during this influx, it is exposed to pollution such as human waste. "When there's that many people the local infrastructure gets exceeded - and the chances of being exposed to faecal matter increases," Prof Graham, from Newcastle University, one of the authors of the study, explained. This increased level of human waste is key to understanding how genes for antibiotic resistance spread. That's due to where the resistance genes are located in bacteria, and how these bacteria are carried by humans. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is controlled by naturally occurring genes. These genes are found on plasmids, small rings of DNA that are separate from chromosomes. Plasmids can move easily between bacteria, allowing them to acquire traits, such as antibiotic resistance, very quickly. Many people have some organisms in their gut that contain these genes. Generally, these do not affect a person until they take certain antibiotics. The river samples that Dr Zia Shaikh, from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, analysed showed that, when the amount human waste entering the river rises during May and June, levels of antibiotic resistance genes are up to 60 times higher. The indicates that the resistant organisms in people's guts can be washed into the river in faeces. The faecal organisms tend not to live very long, but the plasmids that carry antibiotic resistance genes can be quickly transferred to other organisms in the river. This increases the probability that people will ingest bacteria with antibiotic resistant genes when they drink or bathe in the water. Once they are exposed, they can then carry them back to their own towns and cities in their gut - carrying antibiotic resistance genes to the wider world. The research suggests that, when the large numbers of people are in close proximity without adequate facilities, the probability that antibiotic resistance genes will spread increases. This could affect any large gathering around the world. The spread of the antibiotic resistance genes adds to existing health concerns. Prof David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says: "Mass gatherings provide opportunities for infections to spread from human to human, and to humans from other sources through faults in sanitation, water supply, and food from vendors and other sources." He said the research was "another important indicator of the importance of the environment in evolution of antimicrobial resistance". However, phenomena like the pilgrimage to the River Ganges are an important part of culture. "Our goal here isn't to impair the social activity, it to help to make to safer," said Prof Graham. Prof Heymann agrees: "Mass gatherings are important and must continue. They can be made safe by ensuring that the risks of infection are minimised." Prof Graham hopes that governments, physicians, clinicians, epidemiologists around the world will understand the importance of this kind of research in tackling the spread of antibiotic resistance. "The role of the environment has been underappreciated," he said. "Just because you haven't acquired direct resistance from drinking the water doesn't mean you haven't increased the potential for acquiring resistance in the future."	The Hindu holy sites in the Indian cities of Rishikesh and Haridwar attract millions of pilgrims each year - but they are now the destination for another group of devotees.
After a drab game with few chances for either side, Mohamed Salah teed up El Said, who struck firmly past Uganda keeper Denis Onyango on 89 minutes. Uganda's Joseph Ochaya earlier had a goal correctly disallowed for offside. The win means Egypt play Ghana on Wednesday with top spot of Group D still at stake, while Uganda are out of their first tournament since 1978. Ghana secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Mali earlier on Saturday. On a deteriorating pitch in Port-Gentil, seven-times champions Egypt failed to break down a resolute Cranes defence for long periods. Onyango made an impressive clearing header to deny the onrushing Salah at the end of an otherwise lifeless first half. Uganda began the second half brightly, forcing veteran Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary to punch several set-pieces clear but ultimately failed to register a shot on target as Ochaya turned in Faruku Miya's through ball from a clearly offside position on 52 minutes. El Said blasted a shot well over when unmarked and Marwan Mohsen went close for the Pharaohs with a header, but Egypt appeared to be heading for their second consecutive goalless draw. However, an otherwise quiet Salah showed great composure late on to check his shot and play in El Said with a reverse pass, the substitute's close-range shot evading Onyango. Uganda now face Mali in the final round of group games on Wednesday, with Mali needing a win and for Ghana to beat Egypt by two goals or more if they are to qualify. Match ends, Egypt 1, Uganda 0.

The Sunday Times says the missile veered off course during a test in June last year - weeks before the Commons voted to spend £40bn renewing Trident. Questioned by Andrew Marr, the PM refused to say four times if she had known about the test ahead of the vote. The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon called for a "full disclosure" of what happened. According to the Sunday Times, an unarmed Trident II D5 missile veered off in the wrong direction towards the US - instead of towards Africa - when it was launched from a British submarine off the coast of Florida. In July - days after Mrs May had become prime minister - MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of replacing Trident. During the debate, Mrs May told MPs it would be "an act of gross irresponsibility" for the UK to abandon its nuclear weapons. MPs backed its renewal by 472 votes to 117. However, all 52 SNP MPs voted against it - as did Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. When asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show whether she had known then that a misfire had happened, Mrs May said: "I have absolute faith in our Trident missiles. "When I made that speech in the House of Commons, what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our Trident." She was asked a further three times - but did not answer the questions. The Ministry of Defence did not give details of the test process but said it had been a success. Scottish First Minister, Mrs Sturgeon - a long-standing opponent of Trident, whose submarines are based at Faslane, on the River Clyde - said the apparent misfire was a "hugely serious issue". She tweeted: "There should be full disclosure of what happened, who knew what/when, and why the House of Commons wasn't told." Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn said the reports called for "a serious discussion". He told Sky News: "It's a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction, and while it wasn't armed, goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been." Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, said it was "completely unacceptable" that Mrs May had "side-stepped" questions. She called for the prime minister to give "a full explanation" to Parliament on Monday. Admiral Lord West, the Labour peer and ex-Royal Navy officer, said it was "bizarre and stupid" to not tell anyone about the test. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) described reports of a misfire as a "very serious failure". "There's absolutely no doubt that this would have impacted on the debate in Parliament on Trident replacement," its general secretary Kate Hudson said. A statement issued by both Downing Street and the MoD said the capability and effectiveness of Trident was "unquestionable". "In June the Royal Navy conducted a routine, unarmed Trident missile test launch from HMS Vengeance, as part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew. "Vengeance and her crew were successfully tested and certified, allowing Vengeance to return into service. We have absolute confidence in our independent nuclear deterrent." The Sunday Times says the test fire was launched from HMS Vengeance. It says the Trident II D5 missile was intended to be fired 5,600 miles (9,012 km) to a sea target off the west coast of Africa but veered towards the US. The cause remains top secret, the paper says, but it quotes a senior naval source as saying the missile suffered an in-flight malfunction after launching out of the water. HMS Vengeance, one of the UK's four Vanguard-class submarines, returned to sea for trials in December 2015 after a £350m refit, which included the installation of new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems. According to the Sunday Times, it is expected that Defence Secretary Michael Fallon will be called to the Commons to answer questions from MPs. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said while the MoD has described the test as a success for the crew and the boat, it has not denied the report that the missile itself might have veered off course. In the past the MoD has issued a press release and video of successful tests but its silence on this occasion has raised questions as to whether any fault was deliberately kept quiet ahead of the key vote, our correspondent added. The Trident system was acquired by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s as a replacement for the Polaris missile system, which the UK had possessed since the 1960s. Trident came into use in the 1990s. There are three parts to it - submarines, missiles and warheads. Although each component has years of use left, they cannot last indefinitely. The current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the late 2020s. A guide to the Trident debate	Theresa May is coming under pressure to say whether she knew about a reported misfire of the UK's nuclear weapons system before a crucial Commons vote.
Imran Khawaja tried to sneak back into the UK last year - and while his exact activity in Syria remains a mystery, police say he is one of the most dangerous British jihadists to return from conflict. He was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online, but always masked. But now, Imran Khawaja, 27, from Southall, west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria's battlefields. Khawaja left the UK last January. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani. And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory, he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad. In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but "thanks to Allah's will" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on. Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home. Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and "through the keyhole" tours of fighters' quarters. Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. He says: "The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic," he says. "They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims. "They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers. "Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing." But Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption "my first time". And another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head. The only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting. And last June, its opportunity came. Imran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police. His cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks. As Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle. The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven. He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed. As the pair arrived at Dover, the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey. Cdr Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, says: "Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enticed to travel to Syria. "This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism, who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp. "We don't know why he came back, we don't know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death. This is a dangerous man." Imran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison. He has admitted four offences: Tahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. Khawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.	A British man who went to fight in Syria - and then faked his own death in order to secretly return - has pleaded guilty to four major terrorism offences at the Old Bailey.
Katharine of Aragon died at Kimbolton Castle in 1536, and was buried at the cathedral following a lavish funeral. A festival marks the anniversary of her death and a Catholic mass is celebrated - a rarity in an Anglican cathedral. This is one of a number of unusual stories to be told in the BBC's People's Passion, which explores the purpose of cathedrals today. Katharine was cast aside by Henry VIII for being unable to provide the Tudor dynasty with a male heir. Stuart Orme, from Vivacity Heritage which co-organises the Katharine of Aragon Festival, said: "She was revered for her piety and dignity. "Many of the population had a good deal of sympathy for Katharine after the divorce and felt she had been hard done by." Despite living in reduced circumstances after the end of her marriage, she was given an elaborate funeral on 29 January 1536, involving four bishops and six abbots. Her tomb was of black marble, with gilded letters and decoration. Mr Orme said: "But Oliver Cromwell's soldiers stole the gilding during the sack of the cathedral in 1643, while a dean of the cathedral used the marble for the floor of his summerhouse in the 1700s." It was not until the late 19th Century that a wife of one of the cathedral canons, Katharine Clayton, started a public appeal asking all the Katharines of England to donate to the replacement marble slab which can be seen today. The cathedral now marks the funeral date with the Katharine of Aragon Festival on the Friday and Saturday nearest the 29 January. A representative of the Spanish embassy is invited to a civic service on the Friday and a Catholic mass is held on the Saturday. Hundreds of children are encouraged to dress in Tudor costume, and learn how people lived in the early 16th Century from historic re-enactors. Flowers, and Katharine's heraldic symbol, the pomegranate, are laid upon her tomb. She had chosen the fruit when she was still a princess in Spain because to the medieval world it symbolised fertility.	The connection between Peterborough Cathedral and Henry VIII's Spanish queen is little known outside the city.
The service was held at the 22-year-old's school in Ohio, before his burial at a nearby cemetery. His death has heightened tensions between the US and North Korea. Pyongyang has called President Donald Trump a "psychopath", while he describes N Korea as a brutal regime. Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper claimed Mr Trump might launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korea to divert attention from his domestic difficulties, and warned South Korea "that following psychopath Trump... will only lead to disaster". Earlier in the week, after announcing Mr Warmbier's death, President Trump said he was determined to "prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency". The thousands of funeral goers formed two lines as Mr Warmbier's coffin was carried into Wyoming High School for the 45-minute service, and then along the three-mile route to the cemetery. There was only space for 800 people inside the school's auditorium so most attendees watched the service on monitors in overflow rooms, CNN reports. Mr Warmbier's brother and sister, along with some friends, spoke during the service. Bagpipes played as mourners, wearing blue and white ribbons - the school's colours - to honour the former student, left the school. Thousands of people from his small hometown of Wyoming, Ohio, packed into Otto Warmbier's old high school for his funeral. For most, his casket was the first they had seen of Otto since he went to North Korea - awful confirmation of the shocking, surreal set of circumstances that had played out since early last year. Among several politicians in attendance, including officials from the state and defence departments was the Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who had been involved in the quest to bring him home. Mr Portman reflected a sense that while today was a time to talk about Mr Warmbier's life, as a young man with huge potential, the issue of responsibility had to be addressed. After the funeral, mourners stood to watch the cortege pass and disappear through the streets with blue and white ribbons tied to all the trees in his honour. As they reflect, there are many not just here but across the country, asking how North Korea will now pay for what many see as the murder of an American citizen. Otto Warmbier was returned by North Korea to the US last week, more than a year after he had been sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. He was in a coma and died a few days later. His parents say that though he never spoke or opened his eyes, "the countenance of his face changed - he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that". US doctors say he suffered a "severe neurological injury", the most likely cause of which was a cardiopulmonary arrest that had cut the blood supply to the brain. A post-mortem examination was not carried out at the request of the family. Otto Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was travelling with a tour group when he was arrested at Pyongyang airport in January 2016. He was accused of stealing a propaganda sign from a hotel and, two months later, was sentenced during a short trial. His family had no news of him until 13 June, when Pyongyang said he had been in a coma since his trial after contracting botulism and receiving a sleeping pill. US doctors say there is no evidence he suffered from botulism, and the Warmbier family believe he died as a result of "awful torturous mistreatment".	More than 2,500 family, friends and well-wishers gathered for the funeral of Otto Warmbier, the US student who died after falling into a coma while in prison in North Korea.
Fabian Picardo, the territory's chief minister, told the BBC he was speaking to Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, about various options. One possibility under discussion is for Gibraltar and Scotland, which both voted to remain in the EU, to maintain the UK's membership of the bloc. Ms Sturgeon confirmed to the BBC that talks are under way with Gibraltar. Northern Ireland could also potentially be included in the discussions. "I can imagine a situation where some parts of what is today the member state United Kingdom are stripped out and others remain," Mr Picardo told Newsnight. "That means that we don't have to apply again for access, we simply remain with the access we have today, and those parts that leave are then given a different sort of access, which is negotiated but not necessarily under Article 50," he said, referring to a provision in the Lisbon Treaty that sets out how a member state can voluntarily leave the Union. There is a precedent for such a proposal. Denmark joined what was then the EEC in 1973, the same year as the UK and Ireland. Greenland gained autonomy from Denmark in 1979 and seceded from the EU in 1985, following a referendum three years earlier. Nicola Sturgeon has previously said that a second referendum on independence for Scotland is "highly likely", following last Thursday's Leave victory. More than 95% of Gibraltarians voted for Remain on Thursday. The vast majority also want to remain in the UK. The territory overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to share sovereignty with Spain in a referendum in 2002. Mr Picardo insisted Gibraltar's status as a British Overseas Territory should not mean giving up its membership of the EU. "The position of the people of Gibraltar is that we've expressed, perhaps even more clearly than the Scots, what our view is going forward, what should happen - that we should continue to have access to the single market to the European Union. My obligation is to protect and promote the interests of Gibraltar and to find such partners who may be willing to do the same thing within the United Kingdom." Following the referendum last week, Spain again raised the issue of joint sovereignty of Gibraltar. "The Spanish flag on the Rock is much closer than before," Spain's acting Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said on Friday. But speaking in his first broadcast interview since the referendum on Thursday, Fabian Picardo said any claims by Spain to the territory would be dismissed out of hand. "Anybody who thinks that this is a time to propose joint sovereignty or that they're going to get any millimetre of advantage in respect of the sovereignty of Gibraltar is completely wrong. They shouldn't waste their breath, they shouldn't waste their time, they shouldn't waste the time of the European people as we try to navigate this issue that has been presented to us on Friday morning." Gabriel Gatehouse is in Gibraltar for BBC Newsnight. Watch his report on the programme at 22:30 BST on BBC Two.	Gibraltar is in talks with Scotland about a plan to keep parts of the UK in the EU, BBC Newsnight has learned.
Peterborough restaurant owner Mohammed Khubaib, 43, was convicted of rape and grooming offences last month. During his trial at the Old Bailey, the jury was told he forced a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him after getting her drunk. He had a "persistent and almost predatory interest" in girls, the court heard. Det Supt Gary Ridgway from Cambridgeshire Police said the sentence showed "just how serious this type of offence is". "This represents justice for young people who had the courage to stand up in court and relive some very difficult experiences," he said. Khubaib was the tenth person to be convicted under Operation Erle, which focussed on allegations of sex abuse by other groups of men and boys against young girls. Four previous cases led to nine male defendants being jailed for 59 offences against 15 girls from Peterborough and elsewhere in the East Midlands. "We are pleased with this sentence today as it represents justice for the girls and young women who suffered at the hands of this vicious criminal," said Wendi Ogle-Welbourn, from Peterborough City Council. She praised the "bravery" of the victims who had given evidence during the course of the trial. "Their courage in reliving some absolutely horrendous experiences at the hands of this criminal has enabled us to get the result we did today and means that other girls and young women are safer in our city," she said. Cambridgeshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Sir Graham Bright described Khubaib's actions as "crime of the worst kind".	A businessman who plied teenage girls with vodka before sexually abusing them has been sentenced to 13 years.
The University of Essex study of 712 Italian-American mafia members in the 1960s showed their income had risen by 7.5-8.5% per extra year of education. Those involved in complex crimes such as charging exorbitant rates for loans or extortion saw three times the boost of those who committed violent crimes. But, on average, the 712 left education a year earlier than other white men of a similar age in their neighbourhoods. "Criminal careers are known to start very early and are likely to be interwoven with schooling choices," the study says. Lead researcher Prof Giovanni Mastrobuoni said education tended to have a protective effect against getting involved with crime, but he added: "It is also true that if you decide to be a criminal it's better to be a better-educated one." The study says: "Private returns to education exist not only in legitimate but also in the illegitimate activities that imply a sufficient degree of complexity," "Mobster returns (in terms of income) to a year of schooling are around 7.5 to 8.5%, compared to 9-10% for the neighbour sample. "Moreover, for mobsters who, according to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics records, were involved in white-collar crimes that require running an illegal business (ie racketeering, loan sharking, bootlegging et cetera) we found returns to education that are about three times as large as for those who are involved in violent crimes (ie robberies, murders et cetera)."	Mafia criminals who are better educated tend to earn more, research suggests.
Remus Hamza, 41, of Riverside, Cardiff, was jailed for 12 years in February 2016 for raping the 20-year-old and was also given four years on extended licence. He took his case to the Court of Appeal in London, arguing this was too severe. But judges said his appeal was "totally without merit" and gave him an extra 28 days in prison for wasting court time. Hamza claimed he had consensual sex with his victim, but was found guilty after a trial. He had also previously exposed himself to three young women in the same area. The woman was walking home along Museum Avenue in the early hours of 20 September 2015 after losing her friends while on a night out. Hamza grabbed her and raped her in nearby bushes. He fled after a passer-by spotted him and called the police. Judge Sarah Munro QC said the victim suffered serious psychological harm as a result of the attack. Hamza's lawyers argued the crown court judge made the wrong assessment of how serious his crime was and did not take enough account of the fact he would have to serve two thirds of his jail term before his release can be considered. Dismissing his appeal, Judge Munro said it was "not arguable" the sentence was excessive. She added: "The provisions relating to early release and licence should be left out of the picture when determining sentence. There is no merit whatsoever in this appeal."	A rapist who attacked a student as she walked home during freshers' week has been given an extended sentence.
Laura Whittle, third at the British trials, joins compatriots Steph Twell and Eilish McColgan in the 5,000m. Hammer throwers Mark Dry and Chris Bennett have also been granted selectors' picks for places in Rio. It is the highest Scottish representation in track and field since the 1908 London Games, with GB sending an 80-strong team to Brazil. Twell and McColgan were among eight athletes from Scotland who booked their places at the trials in Birmingham last month, with three marathon runners selected in April. Just five Scottish runners made it to London 2012. Team GB will be looking to improve on a haul of six medals from four years ago. Scots in the GB athletics team for Rio 2016: Callum Hawkins, Tsegai Tewelde, Derek Hawkins - marathon Beth Potter - 10,000m Andrew Butchart - 5,000m Eilidh Doyle - 400m Hurdles, 4x400m Relay Lennie Waite - 3,000m Steeplechase Laura Muir - 1500m Chris O'Hare - 1500m Lynsey Sharp - 800m Steph Twell, Eilish McColgan, Laura Whittle - 5,000m Chris Bennett, Mark Dry - hammer	Three more Scots have been added to the Great Britain Olympic athletics team, taking the total up to 15.
Writing in The Observer he said he reveres "the sanctity of life but not at any cost". He also suggested that prolonging the life of Nelson Mandela had been an "affront" to his dignity. His comments follow a U-turn by former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey, who also said he would support assisted dying for the terminally ill. The Church of England (CofE) has called for an inquiry into the issue. In his column the 82-year-old retired Anglican Archbishop of South Africa said: "I think when you need machines to help you breathe, then you have to ask questions about the quality of life being experienced and about the way money is being spent." He also described as "disgraceful" how former South African leader Nelson Mandela was kept alive with intensive hospitalisation in the final stages of his life and was photographed with various visiting politicians. He said: "You could see Madiba [Nelson Mandela] was not fully there. He did not speak. He was not connecting. My friend was no longer himself. It was an affront to Madiba's dignity. "Yes, I think a lot of people would be upset if I said I wanted assisted dying. I would say I wouldn't mind actually." He said: "I have been fortunate to spend my life working for dignity for the living. Now I wish to apply my mind to the issue of dignity for the dying. I revere the sanctity of life - but not at any cost." His comments follow those of Lord Carey, who wrote in the Daily Mail that he had dropped his opposition to the Assisted Dying Bill - due for debate in the House of Lords on Friday - "in the face of the reality of needless suffering". "The fact is that I have changed my mind. The old philosophical certainties have collapsed in the face of the reality of needless suffering," he wrote. The 1961 Suicide Act makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt in England and Wales. Anyone doing so could face up to 14 years in prison. The law is almost identical in Northern Ireland. There is no specific law on assisted suicide in Scotland, creating some uncertainty, although in theory someone could be prosecuted under homicide legislation. There have already been several attempts to legalise assisted dying, but these have been rejected. The Commission on Assisted Dying, established and funded by campaigners who have been calling for a change in the law, concluded in 2012 that there was a "strong case" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill in England and Wales. But the medical profession and disability rights groups, among others, argue that the law should not be changed because it is there to protect the vulnerable in society. In other countries, such as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, legislation has been introduced to allow assisted dying. France is considering a possible introduction of similar legislation, although there is opposition from its medical ethics council. Campaign group Dignity in Dying predicts that a lot more countries will follow suit. However, the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, regards the Assisted Dying Bill as "mistaken and dangerous" and the Church of England (CofE) wants to see an inquiry into the issue. The Church said a Royal Commission would include expert opinion and could carefully assess the various arguments. It believes the current bill should be withdrawn to allow that inquiry to take place - a call rejected by Lord Falconer, the Labour peer who tabled it. Some 110 peers are already listed to speak in the House of Lords when the bill is debated on Friday. Desmond Tutu has pointed out that the debate will take place on Mandela Day, which would have been the former South African president's 96th birthday.	Desmond Tutu has said he would support assisted dying for the terminally ill.
The 23-year-old has played nine league games for the Spireites this season, all as a substitute, but started two cup matches. The 6ft 4ins former Ivory Coast Under-20 international has made 98 appearances in total for Chesterfield since joining them in January 2013. Gnanduillet previously had loan spells at Tranmere and Oxford.	Stevenage have signed striker Armand Gnanduillet from League One side Chesterfield on a one-month loan.
But Roma forward Mohamed Salah, who has been out with an ankle injury, is among the 27 names on the preliminary list. Arsenal's Mohamed Elneny is another of 11 foreign-based players in the squad. Coach Hector Cuper also handed surprise call-ups for Zamalek midfielder Mohamed Ibrahim, Al Masry striker Ahmed Gomaa and Ismaily goalkeeper Mohamed Awad. Only four players - Essam El-Hadary, Ahmed Elmohamady, Mohamed Abdel-Shafy and Ahmed Fathi - have played at a Nations Cup before. The Pharaohs will start preparations on 1 January and play a friendly match with Tunisia on 8 January in Cairo International Stadium. Cuper must cut four players to get his final 23-man squad for the tournament in Gabon, which will be played between 14 January and 5 February. Egypt are in Group D alongside Ghana, Mali and Uganda. Their opening match is against Mali on 17 January. Egypt squad: Goalkeepers: Essam El Hadary (Wadi Degla), Ahmed El Shenway (Zamalek), Sherif Ekramy (Al Ahly) , Mohamed Awad (Al Ismaily). Defenders: Ahmed Elmohamady (Hull City) , Mohamed Abdel-Shafy (Al Ahly Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), Ahmed Fathi (Al Ahly),Karim Hafez (Nice, France) , Hamada Tolba (Al Masry) , Ahmed Hegazy (Al Ahly) , Saad Samir (Al Ahly) , Ahmed Dweidar (Zamalek), Omar Gaber (FC Basel, Switzerland) , Ali Gabr (Zamalek).

Forwards: Ahmed Gomaa (Al Masry) , Mahmoud Abdel-Moneim 'Kahraba' (Ittihad Jeddeh) , Mohamed Salah (AS Roma, Italy) ,  Ahmed Hassan 'Koka' (Braga, Portugal) , Marwan Mohsen (Al Ahly).	Zamalek striker Basem Morsi has been excluded from Egypt's squad for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations after falling out with the coaching staff.
It is the first time an unsigned artist has won the honour - which has previously gone to Adele and Sam Smith. "I can't believe this is happening," said the 23-year-old, from south London. "It's all just so ridiculous!" Four of the top five Sound of 2017 acts are black British women, reflecting a rise of female talent in grime and R&B. Ray said she wanted her music to "empower women to live life as they want". "There are so many societal pressures on women, on how we should behave, and they're all based on male privilege." The Sound of 2017 list was chosen by a panel of 170 DJs, critics and festival bookers. Among them was Jamal Edwards, whose SB:TV YouTube channel has helped launch the careers of Dizzee Rascal, Stormzy and Ed Sheeran. He said he was "blown away" when he saw Ray BLK perform at one of his club nights last year. "She is the whole package," he said. "I know she's going to have an amazing year." "Some artists have that magic about them," said Radio 1's Huw Stephens. "She has a real, raw talent that cuts through so strongly. She is the real deal." Born in Nigeria and raised in London, Ray released her first recordings while studying for an English degree. She worked in an advertising agency to sustain her career in its early days. Combining her love of hip-hop and R&B, she delivers streetwise, literate lyrics with a velvety soul voice. Her standout track, My Hood, is a bittersweet love letter to her home town, Catford. "The south east is one of the roughest places in London but it rears the strongest people, and that's what makes us special," she said. The singer has avoided signing a record deal in order to retain the rights to her music, which she releases on her own label. Like an increasing number of artists, from Paul McCartney to the Pet Shop Boys, she works with a company called Kobalt Music Services - who provide "back-room" support like publishing and distribution, without tying musicians to restrictive contracts. "I feel as though I need to have my autonomy for now," Ray told the BBC. "There've been so many artists in 2016 that came out, who did so independently and experienced a lot of success. I think there's a new wave of people doing that. The industry is changing." The winning soul singer, whose real name is Rita Ekwere, beat blues singer Rag N Bone Man to top the Sound of 2017 list, while third place went to pop star-in-waiting Raye. Ray said: "I'm particularly proud to be a part of this year's list as it's full of so much talent, some of whom are independent artists like myself which I really hope inspires the next generation." The Sound of... list launched in 2003 and has a track record in championing new and innovative acts, including 50 Cent, Haim, Frank Ocean, Ellie Goulding and Florence + The Machine. According to the rules, acts on the longlist should not be well known - so talent show contestants and members of famous bands launching a solo career are excluded. Artists must not have had a UK top 20 single or album before 30 October 2016 - although guest vocalists remain eligible. Last year's victor was Jack Garratt, whose debut album Phase entered the charts at number three. He praised the "very diverse" range of acts on 2017 longlist, which also included agitprop rock band Cabbage and folk-pop ingenue Maggie Rogers. "This list shows it is possible to have a great ear for melody and not just write the same four chords in different keys. "2017 is going to be such an incredible year for art, especially given how terrible 2016 was for politics. "We've all got a lot to write about and I think we're going to write some incredible stuff."

A stretch of the 100ft (30m)-high cliff  in East Cliff, close to the memorial for Red Arrows pilot Jon Egging, fell away on Sunday morning, taking fencing and benches with it. No-one was injured but the area has been cordoned off by the council amid concerns of further movement. The seafront promenade remains open. The East Cliff Lift, an Edwardian funicular railway built in 1908 and operated by Bournemouth Borough Council, was partially submerged by debris, while a public toilet block at the foot of the cliffs was destroyed. Cracks started appearing on the promenade on Saturday, leading the council to close off the areas at the top and bottom of the cliff. Councillor Lawrence Williams said barriers were expected to be in place "for the foreseeable future". "Although this is a significant landslip, it is only one spot along Bournemouth's seven miles of beaches and we do not have any concerns about other areas," he added. Chris Saunders, head of operations at the council, said: "If there is more rainfall over the next couple of the days then there is likely to be more movement although we expect it to be minor." He said the council was waiting for experts to visit the site and assess the damage. A sculpture at the top of the cliff - a memorial to Flt Lt Jon Egging who died when his Hawk T1 aircraft crashed at the 2011 Bournemouth Air Festival - has not been damaged, a spokeswoman for the Jon Egging Trust said. East Overcliff Drive at the top of the cliff remains open, as does the Bournemouth Carlton hotel. The hotel has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.	A section of cliff in Bournemouth remains closed after a landslip damaged a cliff railway lift and crushed a toilet block.

But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them. Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers. The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology. Surveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant. In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition. The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around. Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will "help the public understand a little more about autism". The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism. The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube. Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia. A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition. Virtual meatballs Virtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections. In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive. Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, "not a typical Ikea customer" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction. "In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action," she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London. "And what they wanted was meatball," she said. Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants. When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: "I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it." "This is really talking to customers," said Ms Franov. Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look. Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias. Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital. Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour. Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately "democratise medicine". Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders. In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation. In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars. The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK. Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they "were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me". Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language. Users can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall. Mr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning. "We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there," he said. It is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films. "It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool," he said. At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning. "One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required," he said. Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.	Think of virtual reality and you will probably conjure up images of fantastical landscapes in a game or film set.

The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to "all the victims of the conflict", and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's "resolute efforts" to end the conflict. "The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process," Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency Mr Santos said on Twitter: "This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace." The peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: "What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement." It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: "I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible." Earlier, he had written: "The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets." This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as "encouragement" to the rebels. "Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. "The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.'' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

He spent last season in charge of the Under-20 development squad, but will not return for the start of pre-season training. Rangers manager Mark Warburton wants to alter the coaching personnel, leaving Durrant without a position at Ibrox. He spent 14 years as a player at Rangers, before returning as a coach in 2005. Durrant held several positions in the youth set-up, then stepped up to work with the first team during Walter Smith's second spell as manager in 2007. He was first-team coach when Ally McCoist succeeded Smith in 2011, then returned to working with the youths again after McCoist resigned during season 2014-15.	Ian Durrant is to end his long association with Rangers as part of a coaching reshuffle.
Phase one of the project will take 10 weeks to complete and will see demolition of the rear function room of the Ship and Anchor pub. An old library building will also be knocked down and a new car park built. Pembrokeshire council also wants to create a one-way system, footways and a public transport hub, with work starting later this year. The master plan includes a new link road, retail units and the demolition of buildings, including the derelict Fishguard Junior School, on 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres) of land. Councillors hope it could encourage further investment in the town.	Work has begun on plans to alleviate traffic congestion and regenerate Fishguard town centre in Pembrokeshire.
Restrictions are in place between 11:00 and 18:00 on two sections of Fishergate and were introduced on a trial basis on 31 October 2016 to reduce congestion. Misuse of the lane has seen over 23,000 drivers receive £60 penalty notices. A Lancashire County Council spokesman said almost 16,000 had already paid their fines and the restrictions would continue until a review in April. Roger Lawson, from the Association of British Drivers, said bus lanes were "discriminatory" and without any actual benefits. Councillor John Fillis said the changes, which are in place from Mount Street to Corporation Street and at the Butler Street junction, had had a "big effect" in reducing traffic levels over the festive period. He said there was a "growing consensus that the measures worked" and as a result, he had "decided that the bus lane should stay at least until we are able to assess how the changes work at different times of year". "We definitely don't want to issue any £60 penalty charge notices, but it is an important way for us to enforce these changes," he added. "The aim is to help to reduce traffic build-up that has affected parts of the city centre at the busiest times." Mr Lawson said bus lanes "don't encourage people to get on the bus". "These arguments [about reducing congestion] are specious and used to attack the use of private vehicles," he added.	More than £1.3m in fines were issued in the two months after a new bus lane was introduced in Preston city centre.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called it a "jihadist attack". It is believed an Islamist cell of at least eight militants was involved. In June 2015, Spain raised its terror alert level to four - one short of the maximum, level five. And since June 2016, Spanish security sources say, police have detained 164 suspected jihadists. The use of a van zig-zagging at high speed through a pedestrian zone recalls the jihadist attacks in London, Berlin and Nice. In December, Spain's interior ministry recommended installing barriers to stop any vehicle being driven into Las Ramblas, but the city did not do so, the ABC daily reports. The Barcelona attack was claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS), though nothing confirms a direct IS link to it yet. Five suspected jihadists were shot dead by police on Thursday night in Cambrils, a town 120km (75 miles) south of Barcelona. Suspects killed in second Spain attack Spain attacks - latest updates Spain attacks: What we know so far In pictures: Barcelona van attack In recent years Spain has intensified its security co-operation with nearby Morocco. There is believed to be a Moroccan connection in the Barcelona case. The van driver is still on the run, but police have arrested four suspects - three Moroccans and a Spaniard from the North African enclave of Melilla. One of the Moroccans was named as 28-year-old Driss Oukabir. The hunt is on for his brother Moussa, thought to have rented the van using Driss's name. Barcelona has just seen Spain's worst attack since the Madrid train bombings of March 2004, in which 191 people died and more than 1,800 were injured. Islamist militants detonated 10 bombs on four commuter trains in the capital, in what remains Europe's bloodiest terror attack this century. Spain has long been a potential target because hundreds of its soldiers are in the international coalition against IS. They are training Iraqi security forces but do not have a combat role. In recent years Spain has seen a home-grown problem of Islamist radicalisation, said political violence expert Javier Argomaniz of St Andrews University. Since 2013 about half of the suspects arrested have been Spanish-born, mostly very young, from poor, marginalised immigrant families, he told the BBC. "There is radicalisation both online and through peer groups, but the online element is very strong," he said. The violent Basque independence campaign waged by Eta for decades led Spain to pour resources into anti-terrorism units. The lack of major terror attacks in Spain since 2004 may be evidence of their professionalism. What is Eta? The last terror attack in Barcelona was the murder of a policeman by Eta militants in 2000. Facing up to the Eta threat saw Spanish anti-terror expertise shared with the French police, who played a key role in sapping the group's capability. Eta is now disarming. The last Eta attack on Spanish soil was in Majorca in 2009, when a car bomb killed two Civil Guard officers. Islamist radicalisation has been concentrated in four areas of Spain in recent years, the Spanish daily El Pais reports. Barcelona - with a large Muslim community - is the main area where it has happened. The others are: Melilla, Ceuta (Spain's other North African enclave), and Madrid and its suburbs. As part of its anti-terror measures, Spain brought in new laws against funding of terrorism, self-radicalisation through social media and travel abroad to train or fight with a jihadist group. All those crimes carry prison sentences. Most of the 178 Spanish citizens who have gone to fight for IS or other jihadist groups have been from Ceuta or Melilla. About 10 times more jihadists have gone to the Middle East from France, it is believed.	Spain was already on high alert for a possible attack when a van smashed into the crowd on Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 people.
Noah Yabbacome, 24, was arrested after police raided the St Nicholas Vicarage in Lincoln where his father David was the parish vicar. Police found over 800 indecent images of children together with "extreme" photographs depicting bestiality. Officers acted in February 2013 after learning of Yabbacome's activities. Lincoln Crown Court heard that police found evidence from chat log entries which showed that he made contact with someone he thought was a 15-year-old girl and encouraged her to have sex with her pet dog. Officers were unable to trace the person in question, and therefore were unable to verify if Yabbacome had indeed been chatting to a girl. While on bail he downloaded further illegal images on a borrowed device but was reported when the owner was given it back. Yabbacome, who now lives in Vicarage Close, Collingham, Nottinghamshire, admitted two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and a string of offences relating to indecent images of children and extreme images. Judge John Pini QC told him: "The public view this sort of offending with horror and justifiably so. "These images involve actual physical contact with real girls which resulted in serious sexual abuse of very young children causing incalculable harm." Det Sgt Vicky Midgley, of the police internet child abuse team, said: "Some of the detail officers have had to consider as part of the investigation is amongst the most hideously graphic I have seen." Yabbacome, described as a "depraved individual", was also given a 10-year sexual harm prevention order, designed to control his behaviour when he is released.	A vicar's son who asked a teenage girl to perform a sex act with a dog while online at his father's vicarage has been jailed for a year.
Conservative critics had tabled a proposal to let heterosexual couples enter into civil partnerships, if gay couples were allowed to get married. This was defeated by 375 votes to 70 after a five-hour Commons debate. Instead, MPs backed a Labour plan to consult on changing civil partnerships - a move criticised by some Tory MPs. Speaking in the House of Commons, Culture Secretary Maria Miller thanked other parties for their "unwavering support" for the principles of the same-sex Marriage Bill and said a review of civil partnerships could take place "very swiftly". Labour said the review could potentially take place within the next few months - enabling its findings to be reflected in the final legislation - but one Conservative MP described the sequence of events as a "grubby deal". By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor MPs gave their support in principle to gay marriage in February but are now discussing proposed amendments on Monday and Tuesday amid calls from some Conservatives for the government to focus on other priorities. The bill is being debated over two days, with its third reading - the final hurdle in the Commons - on Tuesday. If approved, it will go to the House of Lords on Wednesday, where it is expected to face further opposition. David Cameron has said equal marriage would help build a stronger and fairer society but nearly half of all Tories voted against it in February and many party activists remain deeply opposed to it in principle. The bill's fresh scrutiny by MPs comes amid other divisions within the Conservative Party on Europe and attitudes towards the party's grassroots. MPs get a free vote on the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill because it is considered an issue of conscience and many Conservative MPs spoke out against the principle of gay marriage. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the plans were "divisive" and suggested there were are plenty of people "in the aggressive homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something even further". A group of Tory MPs, led by former Conservative minister Tim Loughton, attempted to amend the bill, with a plan to extend civil partnerships - which came into force in 2005 - to heterosexual couples. Mr Loughton rejected claims the move was a "wrecking" measure, arguing that the extension of civil partnerships to co-habiting heterosexuals would address a "glaring inequality" in the current proposals as well as encouraging family stability. "If this amendment is passed, it will remove some of the anomalies and flaws in this bill and make the bill more palatable." He warned about any review on civil partnerships being "kicked into the long grass", adding that Parliament "was in danger of being party to a last minute stitch-up between the frontbenches". Ministers initially agreed that the status of civil partnerships should be reconsidered by 2019, with the scope to do it sooner if approved by Parliament. Ms Miller told MPs there were "fundamental policy" issues that needed to be considered with "financial implications", such as pension entitlements for heterosexual civil partners, widows and widowers. But while it would not be "responsible" to legislate at the moment, she said she respected the strong views on the matter in Parliament and would back calls for an immediate review. It was initially suggested Labour's equalities team might support Mr Loughton's amendment but it later put forward its own compromise proposal for an immediate consultation. "We are certainly anxious to do all we can to ensure that same-sex marriages arrives as swiftly as possible on the statute book," shadow equalities minister Kate Green said. "We would not want to see anything put that ambition in jeopardy." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was his party's position to extend civil partnerships to everybody, irrespective of their sexuality but the current bill could not be derailed. Without holding a formal vote, MPs approved plans to hold an immediate review after the leadership of all three parties backed it. While failing in their attempts to amend the legislation in any form, Conservative MPs voiced their concerns in large numbers on a range of issues. A proposal which would have allowed civil registrars to opt out of presiding over gay marriages on grounds of conscience was backed by 150 MPs - including Cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson - although 340 voted against. In a subsequent vote, 148 MPs supported an amendment to protect the religious beliefs of a person who believes that marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman but 349 MPs voted against. Stonewall, which campaigns for equality for gay, lesbian and bisexual people, said it would be a "terrible pity" if the legislation got "bogged down" and urged MPs from all parties not to "play politics" with it. Under the bill, the Church of England and the Church in Wales would be banned from offering same-sex marriages because of their strongly stated opposition, unless they changed canon law. Other religious organisations would be able to "opt in" to holding ceremonies. There are currently no plans for similar legislation in Northern Ireland, but there are already plans for a bill to allow same-sex marriage in Scotland. The UK debate comes the week after France became the ninth European country, and 14th in the world, legalise gay marriage. Earlier this month Rhode Island became the 10th US state to allow same-sex marriages.	Plans to legalise gay marriage in England and Wales are to proceed unimpeded in Parliament after ministers reached agreement with Labour.

Former MEP turned AM Eluned Morgan spoke a year on from the referendum when Wales voted to leave the EU. Hard and soft Brexit relates to the type of relationship with the EU single market after the UK leaves the bloc. UKIP MEP Nathan Gill warned against a "con" of a Brexit, saying there were only two options - to leave or to stay. Meanwhile Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said his family faced "abuse" after he decided to campaign for Leave. On June 23 2016, 854,572 people in Wales - 52.5% of those who took part in the referendum - voted for Brexit, compared with 772,347 (47.5%) who said the UK should stay. The figures were in line with the UK result and came despite First Minister Carwyn Jones and the then Prime Minister David Cameron campaigning for a Remain vote. Asked how parties that campaigned for Remain should learn from the referendum, Ms Morgan said: "We should probably stop talking about the EU in terms that people don't understand. "Not many people I know understand hard and soft Brexit, and those are the experts. "If we really want to connect with the people we have to start talking about a jobs Brexit, or a Brexit that means you can still go out to a cafe and be served because actually we [could] lose so many people." Soft Brexit is sometimes used to refer to the UK maintaining some kind of relationship with the single market in return for concessions on freedom of movement, while hard or clean Brexit suggests leaving the single market entirely. There is no agreed definition of either. But Mr Gill, former UKIP Wales leader, told BBC Wales: "There's only one type of Brexit - you leave or you stay." He says Britain has to leave the single market and the customs union "otherwise we haven't left - it has to be that way". "We have to give the public some credit. They understood these things," Mr Gill said. He suggested that anything else would be a "con". Andrew RT Davies- another leading Brexit campaigner - told BBC Wales last year he suffered "brutal" treatment from senior Tory party figures after he announced his preference for leaving the EU. In an interview he said said his family "received quite a bit of abuse around the decision that I took".	A prominent Welsh Labour EU supporter has said the public largely do not understand what is meant by the terms "soft" or "hard" Brexit.
An emoji of the Chilean flag is widely available while one of the Texas flag is not yet. The Chilean flag with its white star on a blue background resembles that of the Lone Star state. Tom Oliverson said the resolution was meant to be mainly educational. The resolution calls on lawmakers "to reject the notion that the Chilean flag, although it is a nice flag, can in any way compare to or be substituted for the official state flag of Texas and urge all Texans not to use the Republic of Chile flag emoji in digital forums when referring to the Lone Star Flag of the great State of Texas". Some Texans have developed a habit of using the Chilean flag in text messages and on social media as a sign of national pride. None of the US states currently have their own emoji flag. Mr Oliverson said that the idea was to raise awareness about the mix-up in a light-hearted manner. "Even if the legislature decides not to hear it, we have achieved our objective," he said. The resolution would be non-binding and cannot pass into law. There will be no penalties for using the wrong flag emoji. "The Chilean flag is a fine design. Maybe it's the second best flag, who knows, we're not getting into a contest here. The important thing, though, is that it's not the Texas flag," joked writer Dan Solomon in Texas Monthly magazine. "In these divided times, we anticipate that this bit of legislative silliness will be a refreshing breath of bipartisanship," he concluded. The wording of the bill also emphasises the significance behind the flags' seemingly small differences. "The colours of the Chilean flag depict sky, snow, and blood spilled while fighting for freedom, but the blue, white, and red of the Lone Star Flag stand for the Texan values of loyalty, purity, and bravery," it says. Chile and its national symbols have been the subject of mix-ups before. At the 2016 Copa America football tournament, the organisers played Chile's national anthem instead of that of Uruguay as Uruguayan players looked on confused. The following day, the Chilean national anthem was drowned out by music by the rapper Pitbull before Chile's match against Argentina.	A member of Texas' House of Representatives has filed a resolution to urge Texans to stop using an emoji representing the Chilean flag when they really mean to use the Texan flag.
The move is part of a major schools modernisation project in the town. Dumfries and Galloway Council has launched an online survey to assess what issues need to be addressed. A public consultation is also taking place at the Oasis Youth Centre on Tuesday which will show some suggested routes around a new educational hub being constructed known as The Bridge.	A bid to encourage walking and cycling around Dumfries is seeking public feedback on current provision.
Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would "seriously undermine" Britain's "deterrent". And he said he would be worried if such a view "translated into power". Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to "take action" against Sir Nicholas over his comments. In a statement, the Labour leader said: "It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute. "It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times. "By publicly taking sides in current political arguments, Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle. Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld." Mr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the "nuclear button" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident. Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to "promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world". Asked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: "It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were." He added: "The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use. "When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter. "If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, "the deterrent is then completely undermined," he added. "Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation, 'I understand how this thing works'." Attending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been "unhelpful". "I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions," he told Channel 4 News. "If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate." Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an "open-minded" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident. She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary. But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: "I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said." She defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue. "I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms," she said. She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet. "I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works. "I think I would find it difficult [to continue in the shadow cabinet] but we are not there yet. We have got a big process to go through," she said.	Jeremy Corbyn has accused the chief of the defence staff of political bias after he criticised the Labour leader's anti-nuclear stance.
The "low three-figure" sum of money was taken from three purses which had been left unattended at the Aberdeen Sea Cadets base at Pocra Quay. Insp Carron McKellar said: "This is a disgraceful incident which has left the victims shocked and upset." Anyone with information on the theft is urged to contact Police Scotland. Insp McKellar added: "It is understood that the suspect entered the building while visitors were in another part of the building and took the money. Nothing else has been taken."	The theft of money from purses at a Remembrance Sunday event at Aberdeen harbour has been branded "disgraceful" by police.
The patrols at Camber Sands in East Sussex will be funded with Â£51,000 allocated by Rother District Council as part of its annual budget. Councillor Sally-Ann Hart said the council needed to act after the "significant and unprecedented" deaths. Families of the men who drowned said a lifeguard service could have saved their lives. Five men died during a day-trip to the beach last August.  A month earlier, two others also lost their lives. The council said the beach attracted more than one million people each year. It said lifeguards would be present from the late May bank holiday until the end of the summer holidays "to offer reassurance" to visitors. Speaking after a council meeting on Monday night, Mrs Hart, the cabinet member for tourism, said: "Our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives. "The incidents were significant and unprecedented and we need to react to the changing circumstances. "We not only need to protect the visiting public, but also the economy and livelihoods of our coastal tourism businesses." However, she stressed the importance of "people from all communities across Britain being better informed" on beach and water safety before they visit. She said: "[The beach] can never be completely risk-free but we are committed to investing in our beach patrol, the lifeguard service and working with other agencies to ensure visitors to the beach are aware of the dangers of the sea." Full inquests into the deaths are awaited. The council said it would act on any recommendations the coroner might make. Five men from south-east London died on 24 August: Two others lost their lives in July:	Lifeguards will patrol a popular beach on the South Coast this summer after seven men drowned last year.
Inspectors criticised teaching and leadership at the Phoenix Academy and Lakeside Academy following visits in February, rating both schools inadequate in all areas. Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as "requiring improvement", while Lakeside was rated "good" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was "inadequate", while "weak teaching" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often "disengaged and disruptive". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a "culture of low expectations", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were "beginning to have an impact". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having "over generous" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were "not making the progress they should" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were "beginning to have a positive impact".	All four schools run by a Telford academy trust have been put in special measures within a week.
He held off a late charge by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in a nail-biting climax and leads his team-mate by eight points after Hamilton took third. Mercedes' decision to switch Hamilton to a three-stop strategy got him back ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. When Ricciardo followed suit, he closed rapidly on Rosberg, who just held on. Australian Ricciardo rejoined just under 30 seconds adrift, with 16 laps remaining, and initially sliced into Rosberg's advantage at nearly three seconds a lap. But as the laps ticked by the advantage of Ricciardo's fresh tyres began to fade and the edge was taken off his charge. Rosberg had just enough pace, despite managing fading brakes, to keep the Red Bull at bay, crossing the line just 0.488 seconds ahead for a win that could prove crucial in the destiny of the world title. Listen as Rosberg holds off Ricciardo to win Singapore GP Hamilton had an out-of-sorts weekend, qualifying only third, 0.7 seconds slower than Rosberg, lacking grip after failing to set up his car properly because of track time lost to a hydraulic failure in Friday practice. He drove a steady race, unable to do anything about Rosberg and Ricciardo ahead of him, and intermittently pleading with his engineers to come up with a strategy that could gain him places. Both Mercedes drivers were struggling with overheating brakes and Hamilton struggled so much that he was caught by Raikkonen in the second stint, and actually lost third place following a mistake at Turn Seven just after half distance. Listen as Raikkonen passes Hamilton for third Raikkonen made his second stop at the end of the lap, Hamilton a lap later, and the world champion rejoined still in fourth place. At this point, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's strategy and unleashed him from managing his tyres and told him to close on Raikkonen. Hamilton's final pit stop on lap 45 triggered his rivals to follow suit, with Raikkonen pitting on the following lap and Ricciardo the lap after that. The move worked for Mercedes - it leapfrogged Hamilton back ahead of Raikkonen and despite being on super-soft tyres rather than the ultra-softs chosen by Ferrari, Hamilton was comfortably able to hold on to the final podium place. Behind the top four, McLaren's Fernando Alonso ran fifth from the start of the race after a quick getaway. It took him down the outside as Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz collided, and he passed Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat into the first corner. Alonso held on to the place through the subsequent safety car period and the first and second stops, fending off heavy pressure from Sainz's team-mate Daniil Kvyat and Verstappen. Around mid-distance, Alonso got some breathing space thanks to an intense battle between Kvyat and Verstappen. Listen to Hulkenberg's crash at the start The fight had added needle because of the Russian's demotion in Verstappen's favour after four races this season and after Kvyat had squeezed Verstappen close to the wall on a couple of occasions to keep him behind, the Dutchman complained over team radio. In the end, Red Bull pitted Verstappen to give him some clear air to exploit his pace - a decision that ultimately won him sixth place. But as the race progressed and strategies diverged, Alonso was passed by Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, recovering strongly from a start at the back of the grid following a suspension failure in qualifying, and found himself defending from Verstappen, who was on fresher tyres, in the closing laps. The extra grip from the rubber and the superiority of the Red Bull car meant Verstappen could pull off an aggressive dive down the inside of Turn Seven with a handful of laps to go. Alonso had to be satisfied with seventh, behind Vettel and Verstappen, a strong performance at the end of a difficult weekend for McLaren. Jenson Button retired at two-thirds distance after an early pit stop to replace a damaged front wing and spending much of his time struggling with poor grip at the back of the field.

Media playback is not supported on this device Kubica suffered a partially severed right hand in a rally accident on the eve of the 2011 season and has not recovered enough movement to return. "I miss racing in F1, yes," he said in an exclusive BBC Sport interview before this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. "When you do everything you can to be an F1 driver and suddenly it stops, it's not painful but it's definitely not something you were looking for." Media playback is not supported on this device The Polish driver is competing this year in the European Rally Championship for Citroen and is doing work for the Mercedes F1 team in their simulator as he continues his recovery. He says he is still some way from being able to compete in F1 because of the restricted movement of his arm and fingers. "I have suffered big injuries in the rally crash," the 28-year-old said, "but I am still lucky I am able to drive on a high level, although not any more in F1. "Driving F1 would not be such a big problem, the problem would be to drive a complete race in all circuits but unfortunately that is not possible for now. "The problem in F1 is the space. Maybe one day if the FIA say the car has to be 10-15 cm wider, I can drive - but it is not that rally is second choice. "What is important for me is I am seeing progress. Even if in normal life I struggle with using the hand, [but] driving I see the progress, in the rally car, in the simulator. "The question is how far I will go and how long it will take but to be honest it really doesn't matter if it will take one month, one year or 10 years, maybe one day I will have chance to drive F1 again." Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for BMW Sauber and finished eighth in the world championship in his maiden season with Renault in 2010, was considered one of the very best drivers in the sport at the time of his crash. He admitted the past two years had been difficult for him to handle. But asked whether he was still in love with motorsport, he said: "I think more. I was always thinking I was very lucky to be in F1. "I spent a hard time after the accident for many months - I would say maybe even for nearly two years - not just because of the surgeries, the recovery and the pain but afterwards because when you recover you lie down in the hospital, you start missing it and then you realise how much maybe not love but affection you have for the sport." He added: "I paid quite a big price for a mistake but I could have paid a much higher price, that's for sure. "It is unfortunately part of this sport that you have to accept. If you are driving you are not thinking about this. If you don't accept, you don't do it." Kubica made it clear he still prioritised success in F1 over rallying but said he would not try to rush his recovery. He said: "What I learned is that because of my situation I cannot look too much forward. I have to look week after week, day after day and move forward, that's the most important."

After a sterile first 60 minutes, Stephane Sessegnon fired the Baggies into the lead with a powerful shot. Stoke created little in the second half but substitute Jonathan Walters headed them level from a superb Joselu cross. Almost immediately, the visitors' Geoff Cameron was sent off for striking Claudio Yacob before Evans tapped home after a goalmouth scramble. Relive how West Brom beat Stoke here Stoke had two men sent off within the first 30 minutes in the reverse fixture in August and needless indiscipline proved costly again at The Hawthorns. The red card for Cameron, in reaction to a Yacob challenge, came much later in the game - the 82nd minute - but it followed within 60 seconds of substitute Walters heading an undeserved equaliser. From being in a position where they could have stolen an unlikely three points, Mark Hughes' men were forced back on to the back foot. The Baggies piled on the pressure, won a 93rd-minute corner and, after the ball pin-balled around the six-yard box, centre-half Evans tapped home his first goal for the club as Stoke appealed for offside in vain. Media playback is not supported on this device Former Stoke boss Tony Pulis has now lost only once in 11 matches when managing in this fixture after West Brom won their second game in a row to move further away from the relegation zone. The home team totally dominated the second half, having 11 shots to Stoke's three, and striker Rickie Lambert blew a great opportunity to put them 2-0 up when he miscontrolled after being put clean through. Walters punished them almost immediately, but Evans, who along with captain Darren Fletcher performed superbly throughout, was in the right place as Stoke became the final team this season to concede in the Premier League from a corner. Fletcher, who covered a match-high 11.03km, was key to the opening goal, winning possession and surging forward before finding James Morrison, who set up Sessegnon for his first league strike in over a year. Pulis' men kept 17 league clean sheets in 2015 and, although they could not do so in their first match of 2016, they looked secure at the back for virtually the whole game and climb to 12th, just three points behind Stoke. Stoke named an unchanged team for the third match in succession after wins over Manchester United and Everton but, having scored four at Goodison on Monday, offered little threat at The Hawthorns. Bojan, Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri linked up brilliantly at Everton but Evans and Gareth McAuley virtually nullified them, with the Swiss managing one tame shot in the second half. Walters' goal came from nowhere, created by a rare moment of quality from fellow substitute Joselu, but they are still only four points from fifth-placed Manchester United in 10th and in a good position to climb the table in the second half of the season. Media playback is not supported on this device Stoke boss Mark Hughes: "I don't think it was a high-quality game - we didn't play particularly well and I didn't think West Brom played particularly well. "Geoff got caught late by the lad Yacob, he's just reacted to it and pushed the guy. We're not too happy with the reaction of the West Brom player. I think he went down really easily with the intention of maybe getting Geoff sent off, which he succeeded in doing. "We'll look again tomorrow and we'll decide whether or not we appeal. At the moment, having seen it, that is probably what we will do." West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "Stoke have been flying and are a real high-quality team and we are very pleased to win. "The equaliser would have given them momentum but the lad being sent off means it goes back our way."

The Romanian diners, who had paid a deposit of â‚¬900 ($950; Â£770), left the El Carmen restaurant in Bembibre as dessert was due to be served, Antonio Rodriguez said. "It happened in the space of a minute," he said. "It was something they had planned and they left in a stampede." The diners owe â‚¬2,000 more, he said. Mr Rodriguez gave police the details on the reservation but said he held out little hope of being repaid. Police told El Pais newspaper they had not yet been able to contact any of the diners. The diners had consumed starters, a main course and 30 bottles of various alcoholic drinks, he said, adding that it was the first time in 35 years of working in the restaurant trade that he had seen seen anything comparable.	Some 120 diners celebrating a baptism at a restaurant in a north-western Spanish town all fled the restaurant at once without paying, the owner said.

Kevin Patrick Dawes, 33, was abducted in 2012 as he entered Syria. US officials told the Washington Post that the Syrian government never acknowledged detaining Mr Dawes, but they believe the government or an affiliated group was holding him. The State Department said Mr Dawes was turned over to Russian authorities. The Russia government has been backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad amid a civil war, which is now in its sixth year. The Czech government, which represents US diplomatic interests in Syria, helped secure his release. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the US is working with the Czech officials to free Austin Tice and other missing or detained Americans in Syria. Mr Tice, a journalist, disappeared in August 2012 while working in Syria. He appeared blindfolded in a video a month after his abduction but has not been heard from since.	A US freelance photographer who has been held in Syria for almost four years has been released, the State Department said.
"We save people here every day," said the 46-year-old policeman - managing to sound both proud and chiding and the same time. Mr Hassan has now spent three years assigned to the lifeguard unit that patrols the beach. At high tide on a recent Friday afternoon, thousands of mostly young Somalis were playing in the surf - a scene of cheerful relaxation that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago in a city notorious for its decades of anarchy, famine and violence. "This place is bangin'! Beautiful!" said an exuberant 21-year-old named Hassan Mohammed. Like many others at the shore, he was from the diaspora and spoke English in a broad London accent. "Never been here before. Very nice country. I'm born and raised in Europe. I thought it would be like seeing the end of the world. But it's improved very much," he said. Several restaurants have opened up at Lido beach, their shaded tables packed with Mogadishu's wealthier elites. "Octopus, sea turtle, lobster, shrimp - it's all over this place! Somalia is the most rich in seafood," said Lule Dhan, an Ethiopian who is executive chef at the Benadir Beach Restaurant. "This fabulous city... is not what the media portrays," he declared. "Absolutely, I'm here to stay," said the restaurant's slightly less effusive co-owner, Abdi Resak Jamcale, who has returned to Somalia after two decades in California. "I'm not making a profit but I'm breaking even. We need new laws to have more foreign investment here. For years people here never knew what's wrong and what's right - whoever has the gun [was in control]. But we're getting there, slowly," he said. Read Andrew's other reports from Somalia: 'Why I left al-Shabab' Getting round remittance bans In a country famous for its entrepreneurial culture, Lido beach's popularity has attracted a range of new business ventures - the most visible being the stalls renting out bright red life jackets to the many less confident swimmers. "When the security improves, everything gets better. Before there was no work at the seaside, but now we're very proud to have this business," said Mariam Hassan Ali, 45, sitting beside an inflated inner tube that she also rents by the hour. But if Lido beach is a clear indication of the growing sense of optimism in Mogadishu, this is not a city in which one can, or should, drop one's guard for long. Later in the afternoon, the local district police chief arrived and demanded that we leave the beach immediately, hinting darkly that our film crew might be working on behalf of al-Shabab. To reinforce his point, he was brandishing a grenade with some enthusiasm. Further down the beach, Hassan Mohammed - the young visitor from London - also began sounding slightly less emphatic about the city's charms when I asked him if he had any concerns about security, and al-Shabab. "No. No. You talk about that and they'll come to you! You don't talk about that - not even a little bit. I'm scared of that. This country's un-trustable, the people are un-trustable. They're just like you but then they've got this different mentality. "There's only certain people that you can trust but that's cos they're your family. Do you know what they say here [about al-Shabab]? Arsenal or Chelsea! They don't even call them by their name. They say Arsenal or Chelsea. And if you hear that, run! Run! Don't even turn around. Just run!" he said.	Abdullah Mohammed Hassan climbed down from his perch, and strolled purposefully into the sea to rescue yet another bather who appeared to be struggling against big waves and a rocky, barbed-wire-infested shoreline at Lido beach, on the northern edge of the Somali capital, Mogadishu.
The bank said profits before tax not including those settlements dropped 10% to £1.43bn for the July-to-September period. The result comes a day after the bank confirmed Jes Staley would be joining as its new chief executive. Barclays said it had seen slow progress with its so-called non-core businesses, which it is selling. Losses for the package of businesses, which includes some investment bank assets and parts of the European retail banking operation, more than doubled to £337m. Barclays provided £270m to settle claims in the US over mortgage bonds and £290m to compensate clients over bad foreign exchange rates. For the businesses the bank plans to keep, including its UK High Street bank and Barclaycard, profit rose 1% to £1.76bn. Including the £560m hit, and other costs and gains the bank considers to be one-offs, third-quarter profit before tax fell to £861m from £1.22bn a year ago. Revenues dipped to £6.1bn from £6.4bn for the June-to-September period. On Wednesday, Barclays announced that Mr Staley will be joining the bank as its new chief in December. Mr Staley currently works for US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management, and previously has worked for JP Morgan. Barclays' previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was fired in July after falling out with board members. Mr Staley will be paid £1.2m in salary, £396,000 in pension contributions and as much as £5.5m a year in bonuses, which will mostly be paid in shares. He will also receive £1.15m in shares per year that he will have to keep for five years before cashing in. That is a total of £8.2m for the year, if he is awarded the maximum bonus. He will also receive shares in Barclays worth about £1.93m to replace shares in JPMorgan he will lose for leaving his former employer. In a letter to staff on Wednesday, Mr Staley indicated he would focus on areas of investment banking that did not require as much capital - the buffer of reserves it keeps to protect it from unexpected losses. Analysts said this could include such areas as merger advice and trading in stocks.	Barclays has reported a fall in third-quarter profits and set aside £560m for more customer refunds and litigation.
Fr John Sullivan  (1861 - 1933) was one of 39 to be named in a decree signed by Pope Francis to be beatified - officially recognised as 'Blessed'. He was declared a 'Servant of God' in 1960 and in 2014 he was made a 'Venerable' by Pope Francis. In certain circumstances beatification can later lead to sainthood. Fr Sullivan was brought up by a wealthy protestant family and was a later teacher at Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare. Since the 1940s Fr Sullivan's supporters have been campaigning for him to be made a saint. The attribution of a miracle is given to those who have died for the faith, while receiving a sainthood requires a miracle. Those named on the decree include Albanian Bishop, Vincens Prenushi, who died in prison in 1949 after being tortured for demanding the formation of a breakaway Albanian church under the country's former communist regime. Albania was declared as the world's first atheist state in 1967. Pope Francis also recognised a further 37 Albanian clerics and aspiring clerics, who were killed between 1945 and 1974, as martyrs. During a visit to Albania in 2014, Pope Francis paid tribute to all those who died.	Pope Francis has approved the beatification of a Jesuit priest from Dublin for his work with the sick and dying in the early 20th century.
The committee is intending to investigate the £1bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan portfolio. Its chairman Daithí McKay said they had written to Michael Noonan asking him to ensure Nama appeared at the inquiry. However, they said Mr Noonan has so far not responded. Mr McKay said: "Nama have a responsibility to come before the committee to answer questions and it is disappointing that Michael Noonan has so far not responded. "Officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) will attend the committee inquiry tomorrow [Thursday] and I look forward to their contribution. "The finance committee and the wider public are entitled to access the truth about the sale of the Nama assets." The committee postponed its first hearing of the inquiry last week, but is due to meet again on Thursday. Mr McKay had said they wanted to ensure they did not prejudice a police investigation or any potential criminal trial. The National Crime Agency is leading the criminal inquiry into the Nama loan sale controversy and is concerned its investigation could be undermined. The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) is the Republic of Ireland's "bad bank", set up to deal with toxic loans during the Irish banking crisis. Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle, was sold to the US investment fund Cerberus for more than £1bn last year. An Irish politician, Mick Wallace, has alleged that a payment of £7m was due to be made to a Northern Ireland politician in the wake of the deal. Mr Wallace told the Irish parliament the money had been moved for that purpose to an Isle of Man bank account controlled by the Belfast solicitor Ian Coulter. Mr Coulter is the former managing partner of Tughans solicitors in Belfast and worked on behalf of the buyers in the Nama deal. He said he had directed that money be transferred to the Isle of Man account for "a complex, commercially and legally-sensitive" reason. He said that no politician, nor any relative of any politician, was ever to receive any money. The money moved to the Isle of Man was later retrieved, though Mr Coulter and and his former partners at Tughans remain at odds on the circumstances of that transaction. BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme has established the Isle of Man account was intended to facilitate payments to non-lawyers or deal fixers. All those involved in the deal deny any wrongdoing.	Stormont's finance committee has said it is "disappointed" that the Irish finance minister has not replied to its request for Nama officials to appear before its inquiry.
Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days. "I feel that I am more tired than I was before," she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter. "During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy." Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment, the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Sweden involving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. Their final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments. During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (Â£1.1m; $1.3m). "Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive," says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care. But he argues the experiment still proved "successful from many points of view" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture. "It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating," he says. "In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that." Yet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month. There's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea. "I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world," argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company. He is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after "reading about the trend on Facebook" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees. "I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful," says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company. "It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up." On the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns. "I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home. "It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear," he suggests. "This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home." Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses. "A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver," he says. "Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers." "So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours. "First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups. "It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well." Listen to Maddy Savage's report on Sweden's experiment with six-hour days on The World Tonight.	Sweden has been experimenting with six-hour days, with workers getting the chance to work fewer hours on full pay, but now the most high-profile two-year trial has ended - has it all been too good to be true?
Bolivians were asked to vote on a change to the country's constitution. Presently, the president and vice-president are limited to two consecutive five-year terms. Mr Morales, who has been in power since 2006, and his supporters wanted him to be able to run for another term. With almost all the votes counted, the "No" camp had a narrow but irreversible lead over those favouring another term for Mr Morales. This means the constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive five-year terms remains in place. Despite the constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive terms, President Evo Morales was allowed to run for a third term in 2014. The constitutional court argued that the ban did not apply to Mr Morales' initial term because it had taken place before the new constitution came into effect. Mr Morales will now not be able to stand in presidential elections in 2019. But he is expected to continue serving out the remainder of his term, which ends in 2020. When provisional results suggested a win for the "No" campaign, Mr Morales said that "the fight will continue" and his administration would follow through with its plans. Critics within his party hope he will start training up a potential successor, while opposition politicians see it as a chance to challenge the governing parties. Mr Morales said he had "lost a battle, but not the war". There were celebrations in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, an opposition stronghold. Many opposition politicians and some within Mr Morales's party said the outcome was a victory for democracy. Former President Carlos Mesa said it showed that "no one is indispensable". Samuel Doria Medina, who lost three times to Mr Morales in presidential elections said that Bolivia had won. "They [the government] called this referendum and the people told them 'no'," he tweeted. Mr Morales won the presidential election with 61% of the vote last year. There is still widespread support for Mr Morales and his economic programme but many felt a change to the constitution was a step too far. Some within the ranks of his own party also felt it was time for new, younger politicians to be given a chance to run. The president's approval ratings were also hurt by recent allegations that he used his influence to favour a Chinese construction firm which employs his former girlfriend. Mr Morales rejected the allegations and said he had nothing to hide. He ordered an investigation into how the contracts were awarded.	Bolivians voted in a referendum on 21 February to decide whether to allow President Evo Morales to seek another term in office.
Grimsby pressed to break the deadlock when Pat Hoban struck from range and Andy Monkhouse headed wide. Darren Carter came close for the hosts but hit the side netting after rounding the Grimsby backline. Disley headed home to seal three points with 19 minutes left when he converted Monkhouse's cross from the left wing. Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: Media playback is not supported on this device "Obviously we're disappointed and I didn't think we tested their keeper enough, Stevie Arnold made three or four good saves, but the game should have been 0-0. "I didn't think in the final third we were that great, but all credit to Grimsby they've done a good job on us and won the game 1-0. "It's three points - we're not going to lose the title by losing today and we're not going to not get in the play-offs, so it's three points, that's all it is." Grimsby manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside: "Second half we had to withstand some pressure without James McKeown really being called upon to make any real saves of note, but you know you're going to have to defend a lot of set plays into the box. "You wondered with their record if they were going to get that late goal but thankfully we kept that clean sheet and sent a lot of fans home very happy. "Automatic promotion is still a big ask. Its two teams we've got to catch and they don't have to play each other."	Craig Disley scored the only goal as Forest Green Rovers were denied the chance to go top of the National League with defeat by Grimsby Town.

An Environment Agency severe flood warning - meaning danger to life - was removed from the A361 between East Lyng and Burrowbridge on 10 March. Residents in the area saw their homes cut off and experienced long diversions as a result of the closure. The road has been inspected by council highways officers and reopened at 17:00 GMT. There is still some water on a short stretch of the road and Somerset County Council said temporary traffic lights will be installed to protect the carriageway and allow motorists to pass safely. Councillor Harvey Siggs, responsible for Highways, said: "I'm delighted the A361 is to reopen at long last. "Our highways teams have been working hard all week to clear the road and make sure it is safe, and I would like to publicly thank them for their efforts to get this key route open before the weekend." A further inspection will take place early next week and the temporary traffic lights will be removed as soon as the remaining water has receded and the road judged to be safe, the council said. Mr Siggs added: "Although the road is clear, the rhynes at the side of the road remain full of water so I would urge motorists to take extra care when driving, particularly in the foggy conditions we have seen over the last few days." The clear-up of the A361 started on Monday with the removal of fallen trees and the cutting back of damaged vegetation. Around 30 tonnes of used sandbags were removed before a sweeping and cleaning operation covered the 1.5 mile section of carriageway. The council said that the road closure on the A372 Langport Road will remain in place next week for the removal of flood pumps. With improving weather conditions the large temporary pumps at Beer Wall, near Aller, are no longer needed, it added. The Environment Agency expects to begin removing the pumps on Monday and work is likely to take up to four days. The road will remain closed after the pumps have been removed so the council can assess flood damage and carry out emergency repair works.	A road on the Somerset Levels which closed in December when it was engulfed by flood water has finally reopened.
Since being drafted in 2003, he has won two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers and was awarded the 2010 defensive player of the year. Last year he missed four of the last seven games of the season because of a knee injury. He says that ending his professional career will give him a chance to "enjoy" his family. The Pittsburgh Steelers, the only team he has ever played professionally for, had asked him to retire earlier this year but he said he only agreed to the idea this week. "What it came down to was definitely family," he told Scout.com, revealing that he did not want to play elsewhere in the US. "What am I going to do now? I think the best I can do is make up for lost time, and that's with my family." Polamalu has two sons, aged seven and five, with his wife Theodora. "Thank God football has provided me the ability to be able to sit back and see what the options are. But I'll definitely be the best father I can possibly be." Born in the US, Polamalu is of Samoan descent. He is known for his iconic hairstyle, which he used to advertise shampoo. Speaking in 2010, he revealed that he had not cut his mass of hair for about a decade. Polamalu is part of the Greek Orthodox faith and he said that some of the numbers surrounding his retirement also appealed to him. "Thirty-three is obviously significant because of Christ being 33; and 12 years, 12 apostles," he said. "I'm not superstitious by any means but I always thought that if I played 12 years and retire from football at 33 and give my life and give my body and give my blood to this game, I think that would be a pretty significant landmark in my life."

Alexis Sanchez took advantage of Gary Cahill's error to race clear and lift a composed finish over Thibaut Courtois after 11 minutes, and Theo Walcott completed a brilliant move to steer in Hector Bellerin's pass three minutes later. Mesut Ozil then left N'Golo Kante trailing to expose Chelsea on the counter-attack and steer home Arsenal's third five minutes before the break, after an exchange with Sanchez. It was little more than damage limitation for Chelsea after that as they fell to their second league loss in a row as rampant Arsenal moved third in the table. Arsenal, for all Chelsea's obvious frailties, were simply untouchable from back to front in a magnificent first 45 minutes that revived memories of their finest days. The Gunners showed pace, skill, pressed Chelsea into submission and probed weaknesses ruthlessly in the manner of a team at the top of its game. Arsenal's fans, so often frustrated and having already expressed their discontent at home this season, left Emirates Stadium with a spring in their step and sharing the optimism expressed by manager Arsene Wenger. He wrote in his programme notes: "We feel as though we are on the way up." This was a performance that spoke eloquently on behalf of Wenger's theory - with the proviso Gunners fans have heard this talk before only to be disappointed. This, however, was a magnificent exhibition of power, pace and end product, from the skills of Sanchez and Ozil in attack to the lightning speed and tackling of Bellerin at the back. It was as complete an Arsenal performance as they have delivered for some time. Now can they build on the platform laid by this brilliant 90 minutes? Chelsea looked an old and jaded side when faced with Liverpool's intense, aggressive approach at Stamford Bridge last week, their first loss under Antonio Conte. This was, arguably, an even more harrowing experience and a stark illustration of the job the Italian must do to revive Chelsea. Conte will know the pressures that come with managing under demanding owner Roman Abramovich, but the man who impressed so much in charge of Juventus and Italy must be given time to address so many problems. Chelsea still rely so heavily on 35-year-old captain John Terry, out injured here, while elements of the side that looked so strong winning the title the season before last are crumbling. Branislav Ivanovic had a miserable game but it was even worse for England defender Cahill, who was responsible for Sanchez's opener and also involved in an arm-waving spat with Courtois after a breakdown in communication in the second half Kante does not have the energy and support he had in midfield at Leicester City, with Nemanja Matic laboured and Cesc Fabregas off the pace and substituted. The hero of last season's title win was left trailing in Ozil's wake for Arsenal's third. Eden Hazard has regressed again while Diego Costa's only serious contribution was to conduct another war against the world. In other words, Conte has a large job on his hands. When Sanchez and Ozil are in this mood, Arsenal are a threat to anyone. The pair are world class when at the peak of their powers - and they certainly were here. Sanchez hurried Cahill into a panic before a gloriously composed chip for Arsenal's first, and he and Ozil combined to leave Chelsea's defence embarrassed as the latter scored the third. Arsenal were outstanding in all areas - but Sanchez and Ozil provided the final flourishes with the sort of class that makes them central figures in all Wenger is trying to achieve this season. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said: "It was an outstanding team performance. We played with spirit and collective pace and movement, always in a positive and committed team way. Media playback is not supported on this device "Our defenders have done extremely well. You cannot say one player was not at the right level from Petr Cech to Alexis Sanchez. "We wanted to start strong in a high pace and committed way. We started wobbly in the first 20 minutes against Southampton. We wanted to be consistent in our pressure no matter the score. We did it very well in the first half. It was in and out in the second, which was understandable. "Ideally you want the perfect game and you never get it. We got nearly the perfect first half and that is not bad. Football doesn't care for history and the anniversaries, just the result on the day. Today we had a good performance." Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said: "I think that we didn't have the right attitude from the first minute. "After today we are thinking we must work a lot because we are a great team only on paper. It is always a team problem rather than individuals, When nothing works it is very hard for a player to play well. Media playback is not supported on this device "I don't want to talk about the mistake [from Gary Cahill]. It is not right for the player. We win and lose as a team. If someone thinks this team is ready to fight, I think we must wait to improve a lot to come back a great team on the pitch, not just on paper. "We have not got the balance and now is the moment to consider everything. It is incredible to concede three goals. We must have last season present in our mind to not repeat the mistakes. We must reflect a lot to find very soon the right way." Arsenal are involved in Champions League action on Wednesday with a home tie against Swiss side Basel (19:45 BST).

Bailly is due to have a medical this week and terms are thought to have been agreed with the 22-year-old, who will cost the Red Devils about £30m. He has played 40 times in La Liga, the first five of which were for Espanyol. Bailly joined Villarreal for £4.4m in January 2015 and played in every game as Ivory Coast won the Africa Cup of Nations just weeks later. It had been thought Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be Mourinho's first signing since the Portuguese succeeded Louis van Gaal as United manager. The Sweden striker, 34, is a free agent after leaving Paris St-Germain and hinted at the weekend he would make an announcement about his future on Tuesday. But he has refused to elaborate, saying: "There is no confirmation. Keep wondering. I am enjoying the stories." Bailly's reputation has soared this season, which saw him play a key role as Villarreal sealed Champions League qualification, and it's no surprise to see him make a big-money move this summer. His prime asset is his extremely impressive physical presence, with his powerful aerial ability complimenting his pace and strength in the tackle. The brave and determined 22-year-old has less than 50 league games under his belt, though, so United fans should perhaps not expect him to immediately become an automatic starter. He can sometimes concede possession in dangerous areas by making bad decisions, and he doesn't always show composure under pressure, but Bailly possesses all the physical tools and the rest should come with more experience.

Gurpal Shehri, 28, who worked for Cambridgeshire Police, passed on information to the man who he had met at the Fitness Station gym in Dogsthorpe, Peterborough. He was found guilty of misconduct in a public office at an earlier hearing. Sentencing him, Judge John Plumstead said he had been a "spy in the camp". The judge at St Albans Crown Court said: "This was treacherous behaviour towards the organisation you belonged to. "The public is entitled to regard police officers and PCSOs as straight - those found not to be have to pay a high price." Prosecutor Richard Barrington earlier told the jury of four men and eight women how Shehri jotted down notes from the Cambridgeshire police Camnet system. "He gathered information in relation to a violent drug dealer and he passed on information that would no doubt have been valuable to him," said Mr Barrington. "Providing police intelligence to a known drug dealer is a departure from the proper standards expected of a police officer." Shehri, a married father of three, of Glinton Road, Milking Nook, Peterborough, denied misconduct in a public office between 1 April and 9 July 2013. He told the court: "I genuinely didn't think I was doing anything wrong." The jury found him guilty on a majority of 11 to one. After the verdict was delivered, the prosecutor said Shehri had also pleaded guilty to fraud. He had failed to declare a police caution when he applied to become a PCSO.	A police community support officer who leaked confidential intelligence to a drug dealer has been jailed for five years.
Enforcement company Kingdom Services hands out on the spot fines. Ashford Borough Council removed all its Kingdom officers from patrolling the streets, after one was filmed revealing he raked in a bonus of almost £1,000. They will be out of action while undergoing extra training. A spokeswoman for the council said: "In light of the recent Panorama programme we have decided to take this opportunity to give our wardens some important additional staff training exercises so they can continue operating fairly and effectively. "We haven't suspended them but they are not patrolling currently. They should be back soon, after the training has been undertaken." Littering is a crime, but by paying the fine you can avoid a criminal record. Another Kent-based Kingdom trainer was caught on camera saying they pretend to call the police to pressure people to pay up. The BBC1 programme, aired on Monday, revealed people across the country were wrongly fined for tipping coffee down a drain and putting their recycling out on the wrong day. On Tuesday Maidstone Borough Council also removed its own Kingdom officers while a review was carried out. They were back patrolling on Wednesday. It is not the first time councils in Kent have had problems with Kingdom. Maidstone suspended its officers last year for a two-week review after a woman was incorrectly fined for littering while feeding some ducks. Gravesham Borough Council severed ties with Kingdom last year and now operates its litter enforcement "in-house". A spokesman for Kingdom said: "Our service operates under some of the tightest legal guidelines which set the fixed penalty notice level and affords anybody the right to appeal to the council or/and challenge with the courts if they choose."	Privately contracted so-called "litter police" have been removed from service by a council after an undercover Panorama report found they were getting bonuses for issuing fines.
Philae, the first spacecraft to land on a comet, was dropped on to the surface of Comet 67P by its mothership, Rosetta, last November. It worked for 60 hours before its solar-powered battery ran flat. The comet has since moved nearer to the Sun and Philae has enough power to work again, says the BBC's science correspondent Jonathan Amos. An account linked to the probe tweeted the message, "Hello Earth! Can you hear me?" On its blog, Esa said Philae had contacted Earth, via Rosetta, for 85 seconds on Saturday in the first contact since going into hibernation in November. "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35C and has 24 watts available," said Philae project manager, Dr Stephan Ulamec. Scientists say they now waiting for the next contact. Esa's senior scientific advisor, Prof Mark McCaughrean, told the BBC: "It's been a long seven months, and to be quite honest we weren't sure it would happen - there are a lot of very happy people around Europe at the moment." Philae was carrying large amounts of data that scientists hoped to download once it made contact again, he said. "I think we're optimistic now that it's awake that we'll have several months of scientific data to pore over," he added. This is one of the most astonishing moments in space exploration and the grins on the faces of the scientists and engineers are totally justified, says BBC science editor David Shukman. For the first time, we will have a hitchhiker riding on a comet and describing what happens to a comet as it heats up on its journey through space, he adds. Philae is designed to analyse the ice and rocky fragments that make up the comet. Prof Monica Grady from the Open University told the BBC that scientists now hoped to be able to carry out experiments to see whether comets were the source of life on Earth. Comets contained a lot of water and carbon, and "these are the same sorts of molecules responsible for getting life going," she said. "What we're trying to find out is whether the building blocks of life, in terms of water and carbon-bearing molecules, were actually delivered to Earth from comets." When Philae first sent back images of its landing location, researchers could see it was in a dark ditch. The Sun was obscured by a high wall, limiting the amount of light that could reach the robot's solar panels. Scientists knew they only had a limited amount of time - about 60 hours - to gather data before the robot's battery ran flat. But the calculations also indicated that Philae's mission might not be over for good when the juice did eventually run dry. The comet is currently moving in towards the Sun, and the intensity of light falling on Philae, engineers suggested, could be sufficient in time to re-boot the machine. And so it has proved. Scientists must now hope they can get enough power into Philae to carry out a full range of experiments. One ambition not fulfilled before the robot went to sleep was to try to drill into the comet, to examine its chemical make-up. One attempt was made last year, and it failed. A second attempt will now become a priority. Return of the plucky robot Philae's extraordinary opportunity Rosetta: The whole story The Rosetta probe took 10 years to reach 67P, and the lander - about the size of a washing-machine - bounced at least a kilometre when it touched down. Before it lost power, Philae sent back images of its surroundings that showed it was in a dark location with high walls blocking sunlight from reaching its solar panels. Its exact location on the duck-shaped comet has since been a mystery. Esa had a good idea of where it was likely to be, down to a few tens of metres, but could not get Rosetta close enough to the comet to acquire conclusive pictures. Continued radio contact should now allow precise coordinates to be determined, correspondents say. Comet 67P is currently 205 million km (127 million miles) from the Sun, and getting closer. It is due in August to get as close as 186 million km, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System. As it nears the sun, the comet will warm and its ices will melt. This process will throw out a huge shroud of gas and dust, and if Philae can continue to keep working it will provide scientists with an extraordinary view of what is happening right at the surface of 67P.	The European Space Agency (Esa) says its comet lander, Philae, has woken up and contacted Earth.
The 30 gigabyte dump of stolen data appears to include nearly 200,000 emails belonging to Noel Biderman. Some experts have decided not to view the contents, but certain details are being distributed via Twitter. There has also been more fallout from the release of an earlier batch of data including Ashley Madison user emails. TrustedSec, a US security firm, has published a blog in which it verifies the basic details of the email data, released last week. The company says the files amount to 30 gigabytes' worth and regard 6,800 unique senders and 3,600 unique recipients. The veracity of the most recent data dump has also been confirmed by Norwegian security researcher Per Thorsheim, who was able to decompress the files. "I saw one email or two emails and I could verify the sender, the recipient, the domains and everything so it has to be an email from the CEO's mailbox," he told the BBC. "There's no doubt about that." However, Mr Thorsheim says that beyond verifying that the dump is real, he is not interested in reading the contents of the emails. Speaking to the BBC, the security firm hired by Ashley Madison to investigate the hack said it appeared to have been carried out through unusual means. "I can say that unlike many similar attacks, where a remote attacker has been able to use a security vulnerability such as an SQL [programming language] injection in order to dump data directly, that was not the case here," said Joel Eriksson, a security expert at Cycura. The Motherboard news site has published excerpts of several of the emails, which appear to contain discussions around Ashley Madison's security policy. "This hack affects potentially millions of people," journalist Joseph Cox told the BBC. "The massive email dump, which appears to be legitimate, gives some insight into what those who were in charge of the site really thought about security." One screenshot of the emails published by Motherboard reveals one employee's suggestion that news of a different social networking site being hacked could be "used as a PR spin". Meanwhile, users who have been linked to Ashley Madison by email addresses found in an earlier release of data have been the subject of uninvited scrutiny. Troy Hunt, who has been blogging about the implications of the hack, has described the case of church leader (who he chose not to identify) who had contacted a member of their own congregation, whose email address was linked to an Ashley Madison account. Hunt says that he has also received a "huge number of enquiries" from worried individuals who are concerned that they may be associated with Ashley Madison, whether or not they have actually created an account on the website themselves. "People are desperate to get the data," he told the BBC. "They're resorting to things that could get them into hot water, like trying to download the data themselves. "I don't think it's right for the individuals in the Ashley Madison database to have their personal lives put on display," he added. "Very often these people are entirely innocent." Mr Hunt and others have warned that users may be the subject of blackmail and extortion attempts. Indeed, security blogger Brian Krebs reported last week that spam emails demanding Bitcoin payments were targeting email addresses found in the Ashley Madison data. Although the implications of the data's release are still to be determined, some commentators are already pointing out that they could be far-reaching. Two law firms have launched a class action lawsuit against Ashley Madison in recent days, and it is possible that the plaintiffs would seek to use information from the chief executive's leaked emails to help build a case, according to Mark Watts, head of data protection at London law firm Bristows. "If the emails sent to/from the CEO are relevant to the case (ie to the class action) then I suspect that the lawyers involved would seek to rely upon them if they are helpful to the case," he told the BBC. Watts explained that even though the emails have been obtained illegally, any relevant correspondence to the case would probably have been discovered later anyway as part of the legal process. "Essentially, the claimants' lawyers would just be getting them early," he said.	A swathe of emails from the inbox of Ashley Madison's chief executive is now being scoured by a variety of security experts and journalists.
According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote. Erin Fyfe McWilliam, 16 said: "I'm glad the government thought we were able to make decisions for our country." She thinks it's put young people in the spotlight: "Usually the older generation see us as being the 'tallywags' who don't care about politics at all. "But I do think this referendum has taught the younger generation a lot about politics." A survey, commissioned by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, said 71% of 16 to 17-year-olds voted for Scotland to be independent and 29% voted against. So even if the age-group contributed their political views, it didn't appear to influence the outcome. Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom after the "No" campaign won. The Scottish referendum was a one-off for 16 and 17-year-olds, after the Scottish Parliament passed legislation allowing it to happen. But for years youth campaign groups have been trying to get the UK voting age lowered, arguing you can get married at 16 and pay your taxes, so why not vote? Gaelan Miller 17, who voted in the referendum, agreed that he didn't have that much life experience but said that shouldn't matter. "Sometimes I think young folk like me can be influenced by your parents and we don't have mortgages," he said. "But that's not to say we can't look at statistics at what's happened before with mortgages and ask your parents questions." The Lib Dems are all for 16 and 17-year-olds voting and promised it in their 2010 manifesto. Labour leader, Ed Miliband, also backs lowering the age. UKIP are against it, the Green Party is for and the Scottish National Party (SNP) is in favour as well. David Cameron and the Tories oppose it, so until all the parties agree to debate the issue it's unlikely to happen. Senior Lib Dem minister and Scottish MP, Danny Alexander, told Newsbeat he believes young people "bring a freshness to the debate and ask important questions". He said: "I've always believed that 16 to 17-year-olds should have the vote. "Some of the best debates and discussion I have had about the Scottish referendum have been with young people in schools and Newsbeat's Big Debate." But when asked about lowering the voting age before the next General election in May 2015, he was less optimistic. "Not every party wants that so that we will have to look at that. We need to build a consensus across all parties for that happen. So we could have debate the constitutional changes in the UK," the chief of the Treasury said. "All parties have to agree to do that. But I think the time has come for reform." 17-year-old Erin added: "It's a bit disappointing being given this opportunity, then being told a few months down the line you have to wait a few years. I think it should be changed so that 16 and 17 year olds can vote." In the last general election in 2010, fewer than half of all 18 to 24-year-olds voted, which was much lower than the national average.

Media playback is not supported on this device And this isn't a sentence from the early 1980s. At Swansea there's a new Toshack in town these days. Cameron, son of former boss John, helps coach an under-23 side having an impressive season. On Tuesday night they played in the quarter finals of the Checkatrade Trophy but were beaten on penalties by Coventry City. The Checkatrade Trophy is tournament much-maligned this season, but Swansea's youngsters beat three league sides to get so far and were the only Premier League academy side to reach the quarter finals. But there are still three sides they could win this season and Cameron hopes it's just the start of another successful Toshack career. "The next step for me would be to work in a first team environment," he told BBC Wales Sport. "Hopefully that's not too far away." Few can claim to have had the same success at home and abroad as John Toshack. His managerial CV includes Swansea, Wales, Real Madrid and even a league title in Morocco last year. Toshack Jr worked alongside his father when he coached in Macedonia five years ago, but now he's ready to make his own reputation. "It can be a help and a hindrance (being John Toshack's son)," he admits. "Obviously I'm very proud of what my father has achieved over the years. He's one of the most successful British managers ever. "It's great for me to have that experience on the end of a phone. I speak to him regularly and he watches the progress of our team. "But I'm not looking to emulate or be somebody else. I'm Cameron Toshack and I'm my own man." Aside from the name, there aren't too many similarities. Toshack Senior was a disciplinarian who didn't suffer fools. In his own words, his son is much more analytical. "He's a learned type - a little bit too much for me," he jokes. "All this analysis that goes into the game is now is a bit beyond me. But he's very, very conscientious and always looking to learn. "Hopefully the Swans will get the benefit of it." Of course transferring success with a youth team to success as a head coach is easier said than done. But Cameron Toshack only has to look at Swansea's new head coach for inspiration. Paul Clement started his career as a coach in Chelsea's academy, before his promotion to assistant manager under Carlo Ancelotti. Toshack is working towards his Pro Licence and is the first person at Swansea to complete the Premier League's Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme. He feels he's almost ready to make the step up. "Without getting ahead of myself, I'd like to eventually be in and around the first team here - and if it's not here maybe at another club somewhere in Europe," he says. "I'd like to follow in my father's footsteps in that respect. I'm not averse to moving to other countries to learn my trade and be a success."	Toshack's Swansea side have won 16 out of their last 19 and are top of their division with a chance in the cup.
The move apparently follows a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry. On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction. The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had "ironclad information" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and "pushed hard" for its passage. A US state department spokesman said the accusation was "just not true", but he hoped the resolution would "serve as a wake-up call" for Israel. More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements "has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace". Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state. Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister. The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot. But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed. Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech. "It's in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel," he said. "We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families... and if there is a big storm and Kerry's speech today, we are looking to avoid this conflict." Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on Wednesday for ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and address what a senior state department official described as "misleading critiques" of the Obama administration by the Israeli government. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has said the resolution "paves the way" for the upcoming conference on Middle East peace in France on 15 January. "We hope this conference comes up with a mechanism and timetable to end the occupation," he told a meeting of his Fatah party on Monday.	An Israeli committee has postponed a vote to authorise construction of almost 500 new homes in Jewish settlements in occupied East Jerusalem.
Winger Young won the last of his 30 caps against Ukraine in September 2013. But his form under Van Gaal has led to suggestions England coach Roy Hodgson might end that exile when he names his squad on 19 March for the games against Lithuania and Italy. "The manager has been fantastic," said Young. "He gives you the confidence to play and confidence helps massively." He added:  "I can only repay him with my performances on the pitch. That is what I have shown this season." Young has been used as a full-back and at wing-back this season. Van Gaal picked the 29-year-old former Watford and Aston Villa player in a more orthodox wide position in the 3-0 win over Tottenham. Hodgson was at Old Trafford to watch one of United's best performances of the season - and a player who was an ever present at Euro 2012. "Fingers crossed I can get myself back into the England team," said Young, speaking at a bwin event. "I have always said I want to represent my country. It is an honour to play for England and hopefully I have done enough to get myself back into the squad. "But I am concentrating on events at my club and we will just have to wait and see."	Ashley Young says Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has helped revive his hopes of an England recall.
The 35-year-old will have security clearance and access to classified information, but no official title or salary when she works in the West Wing. She will serve as her father's "eyes and ears" while providing broad-ranging advice, her attorney told Politico. Ms Trump, who owns a fashion brand, will join husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president. The US first daughter said in a statement: "While there is no modern precedent for an adult child of the president, I will voluntarily follow all of the ethics rules placed on government employees. "I will continue to offer my father my candid advice and counsel, as I have for my entire life." After Mr Kushner's White House appointment was announced, Ms Trump said she would focus on settling her family in Washington rather than work for the administration. Her step-mother, First Lady Melania Trump, has so far chosen to stay in New York with Mr Trump's youngest son. Ms Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told AP news agency: "Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not." But some have criticised the decision to give her a White House position, even though she will have no actual job title. Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: "I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee. "But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues." The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions. But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's "special hiring authority". Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive. Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times. However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling. Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter. Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an "unfair advantage" in the marketplace. She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration. Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ms Trump is due to release a book - Women Who Work - in May, with the proceeds going to charity, Ms Gorelick said.	President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump is to have an office in the White House, her lawyer says.
The shutdown - the first for 17 years - has left more than 700,000 employees on unpaid leave since 1 October and closed national parks, tourist sites, government websites, office buildings, and more. The nation's 1.4 million active-duty uniformed military personnel remain on duty. However, about half of the defence department's 800,000 civilian employees stopped work at the beginning of the shutdown - with the exception of those engaged in activities that "provide for the national security". But on 5 October, the department said it would recall nearly all of these workers. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the decision was based on an interpretation of the Pay Our Military Act, which was passed by Congress shortly before the shutdown. It permits employees "whose responsibilities contribute to the morale, well-being, capabilities and readiness of service members" to be exempted from the shutdown. "I expect us to be able to significantly reduce - but not eliminate - civilian furloughs under this process," Mr Hagel said. (only if shutdown continues) The Department of Energy has said it can continue to operate for a short time without sending workers home. However, if the shutdown continues, plans are in place. According to the plans, some facilities will have to close, with only 1,113 out of 13,814 staff required to work. Exemptions include staff overseeing the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal and operating dams and power lines across the country. The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons and naval reactor programmes, will have 343 employees on duty to "perform functions related to the safety of human life and the protection of property". More than 400 employees will stay on to work at the Southwestern Power Administration and the Western Area Power Administration, which are in charge of overseeing hydroelectric power and power lines in the south and western US. Some staff in other areas will remain at work to oversee "the protection of human life and property." Most of the department's staff have been sent home. However, staff at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration continue to report for duty to ensure weather, shipping and other reports are still provided for public safety. Some of the workers at the Bureau of Industry and Security, which reviews exports, also remain on duty. Transport roles run by the department, ranging from air traffic control to airport and hazardous materials inspections, continue and 36,987 out of 55,468 personnel remain at work. Staff involved in overseeing commercial space launches also continue operations. Suspended activities will include facility security inspections, routine personnel security background investigations and the employee drug testing program. The National Zoo and 19 museums and galleries, including the Natural History Museum, the Portrait Gallery and the Air and Space Museum, are closed. Of the 4,202 employees, 688 are being retained to "protect life and property" - security guards, maintenance staff and people to care for and feed the animals at the National Zoo. The Smithsonian Institution says: "During a shutdown, the Institution cannot legally accept voluntary services from federal employees to continue their regular duties." National parks - from Yosemite to Alcatraz and the Statue of Liberty - have been shut down with 3,266 essential staff out of 24,645 remaining on duty. These will include some fire management, law enforcement and emergency responders. However, some states have asked the Obama administration to allow them to foot the bill for reopening their parks. Governors say closures have impacted on local communities and businesses that rely on tourism to survive. About 86% of the Department of Homeland Security's 240,000 employees are expected to be exempt from the shutdown, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry. Most members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are also exempt. US Citizenship and Immigration Services employees will continue to process green card applications. Of 114,486 Department of Justice employees, an estimated 96,744 are exempt from the shutdown. All Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and support personnel in the field are exempt as their operations are focused on national security and investigations involving protection of life and property. Drug Enforcement Administration agents working on active counternarcotics investigations, agents in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and US attorneys are also still at work. Staff at federal prisons are also working. The department has sent home more than half its workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue "minimal support to protect the health and well-being of US citizens".  However, fewer staff will mean reduced capacity to respond to outbreaks and the agency will be unable to support its annual flu program. Nearly a dozen experts on foodborne illnesses were called back to work in recent days, partly to help with a salmonella outbreak. About 212 of the department's 4,225 employees - both full and part-time - were expected to work for the first week of shutdown. Initial plans stated an additional 30 staff would be called in if the shutdown lasted more than seven days. Some $22bn of funding to schools, due on the 1 October, was to be distributed. Among other things, this pays to help educate poor and disabled children. Administrator Gina McCarthy said her department would effectively shut down with only a core group of individuals available in case of a "significant emergency". The self-funded  US Postal Service remains open and is delivering as usual. The agency receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations and relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running.	The US government remains in partial shutdown after negotiations between Republicans and Democrats failed to find a solution to an ongoing dispute over the federal budget.
His sister was married to Mohammad Sidique Khan - the oldest of the four suicide bombers who attacked London on 7 July 2005, killing 52 people. Now he has decided to speak publicly for the first time, because he wants to help in efforts to prevent radicalisation. Mr Patel says the actions of his brother-in-law, who killed himself and six others when he detonated a bomb on a Circle Line underground train near Edgware Road, were "disgusting". Mr Patel struggles to find adjectives about him that are not expletives, adding: "He's a coward. How is his daughter supposed to live the rest of her life now? Terrorism hurts everybody." He says that at first he did not register the attacks and only properly understood what had happened on 12 July. "My mother, brother, sister and niece, came to my house. Scotland Yard and MI5 with them. My brother said to me 'that thing in London, they're telling us it was Sidique,'" he recalls. "I actually asked him, 'What thing has happened in London?' I had to go research it. "I nearly fainted. I can remember my mother the next two or three days fainting multiple times." Profile: Mohammad Sidique Khan 7/7 attacks: What happened that day? 7/7 attacks: The victims His first reaction was denial. "You cannot believe this person that you knew is capable of that, simply because there were no signs, there were no indicators. "I'm thinking 'maybe he's just one of the victims', because it was an ongoing investigation." That period of denial came to an end when Mohammad Sidique Khan's "martyrdom video" was released. In it he claimed to be acting in response to western involvement in Muslim countries. Mr Patel is categorical that there were no signs he could have spotted in Khan to predict what he would go on to do. He says Khan, who worked as a learning mentor for children before the attacks, would discuss events such as the Iraq War as part of normal conversation but never showed signs of being capable of violence. But he does say that Khan looked down on the Muslim community in Dewsbury, where they were all living, and would refuse to visit local mosques because he disagreed with their non-political stance. "His attitude was 'my prayers won't be accepted in these mosques'. "The term he would use is that, 'You guys are hippy Muslims - you're like the Quakers, like the Salvation Army. All happy clappy Muslims, that's what you Sufis are.'" Mr Patel has met two 7/7 survivors and has often considered paying his respects to victims at one of the annual commemorations but worries it would offend grieving relatives. He says his family have also have been affected, with his children being bullied by other Muslim children. "We were not the perpetrators, but we were ostracised from the community - that is proof that the community views terrorism with disgust - and they view the families of terrorists with disgust." But Patel is clear that he is not trying to detract from the suffering of those who lost loved ones in the attacks. "Their (suffering) is much worse. If people don't sympathise with me, ok, I don't blame them. I blame him [Mohammad Sidique Khan]." Mr Patel believes there can at times be an unhelpful focus on foreign policy when discussing radicalisation. He says Khan's claims that his actions were a response to foreign policy were a "pathetic excuse". "We all have grievances," he says. He is similarly forthright in rejecting the idea that Muslim communities are mistreated in Britain and that is pushing them towards radicalisation. "After 7/7 there's been very little blowback. There have been isolated incidents. It makes you put your faith back into humanity. "Whenever somebody like the EDL or Britain First come around, the first people to actually oppose them, along with us, will be their fellow countrymen." For Mr Patel - radicalisation is an issue for all of British society - not just the Muslim community. Nevertheless, he believes mosques could do more. He says there need to be more English-speaking imams and more co-ordination with youth workers who have "life experience". "ISIS (so-called Islamic State) have to be discussed. "Otherwise, because we're not addressing these issues in the mosque, they will go online and they will end up in a bad place. We're not to blame, but we're part of the problem because we're not doing what we can do ourselves." Mr Patel says he is broadly supportive of government counter-radicalisation programme, Prevent. He also hopes to be able to forge links with others working in de-radicalisation to be able to help prevent another atrocity happening here. Asked if he is worried there could be another attack on British streets, he replies: "Yes, that's why I feel I have to speak out."	For more than a decade Ahmed Patel has lived with the legacy of the 7/7 attacks.
Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks "resilience". South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) runs the phone line and has said calls have increased by 16% in the last year. It claimed staff shortages contributed to problems in answering calls. In a risk assessment report published by OCCG, it said: "Patient safety in the 111 service will be compromised due to performance issues caused by a lack of resilience to peaks in demand." OCCG has ranked the phone line as a "red risk", the highest category for risks to patient safety. It comes after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph in June recorded a worker at SCAS's 111 call centre in Bicester, Oxfordshire, saying all staff had "killed someone indirectly". After the report prompted an investigation in January, the Care Quality Commission said the service was "safe and effective". The ambulance trust said that a 16% increase in call volume meant phone handlers could not answer calls "as quickly as we would like". In January alone, the service received 173,563 calls on both their 999 and 111 phone lines. SCAS has also said that a recruitment shortfall has contributed to issues in responding to calls. A spokesperson added: "We are working hard to improve our response to the patients who require our assistance. "We are continuing to recruit staff to the NHS 111 service across our area." SCAS provides ambulance services for Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire.	The safety of patients using the 111 service in Oxfordshire could be "compromised", according to the county's leading health body.

Tuition fees for 2017 are listed on Durham, Kent and Royal Holloway websites as £9,250. MPs will vote in the autumn on whether to allow an increase in tuition fees. The government will support an increase if universities can show they have high quality teaching. Announcing a higher level of fees of £9,250 was attacked as "disgraceful arrogance from some universities" by the Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh. The proposal to raise fees is "not a done deal", says Mr Pugh. Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: 'Those universities foolish enough to advertise higher fees will be doing nothing to quell concerns from students and parents that they are simply after as much cash as they can get." The higher level fees now being advertised are for undergraduate courses starting in autumn 2017. Students will start applying for these courses after the summer holidays. There are references on university websites to fees being "subject to government confirmation" and "inflationary changes", but this comes before MPs have voted on legislation which will link fee increases to standards of teaching. There will also be a separate vote by MPs in the autumn on whether to permit an increase in tuition fees above £9,000. Under the government's proposals, if universities meet a threshold of good-quality teaching, they will be able to increase fees with inflation, which for 2017 is calculated as allowing an extra £250. At this rate, tuition fees could be over £10,000 within the next four years. The plans in the Higher Education and Research Bill are before Parliament and in a debate on Tuesday, Labour's Gordon Marsden warned this inflation link meant there was no guarantee on how high fees could rise. The process that will be created to measure teaching quality in universities is called the "teaching excellence framework". This framework does not yet exist, but for its first year the government has said that almost all universities will be assessed as having reached a quality threshold, allowing them to push their fees above the £9,000 upper limit. It means that almost all universities will be able to charge £9,250 for their autumn 2017 intake, making it in effect the new upper limit. Labour's shadow education minister Gordon Marsden said it was a "back-door attempt to raise fees, without a proper and open debate in Parliament, by linking it to a teaching excellence framework which hasn't yet been defined". But the Liberal Democrats' Mr Pugh said "The real question is whether government is giving these institutions the green light to advertise higher fees. "They've not even shown their plans for linking fee rises to Parliament. So why are they giving universities the impression that they will pass their teaching quality assessment?" The University of Kent said the fee increase represented inflation of 2.8%, which could be applied "where higher education providers achieve a rating of 'meets expectations' under the teaching excellence framework". A statement said it had published the higher fee "to ensure that both potential students and existing students are provided with as much notice as possible" and to comply with consumer protection guidelines. Durham University issued a statement saying it was setting fees in line with what the government was going to allow and said "we are required to provide comprehensive and transparent information to applicants". Responding to MPs' concerns about tuition fee increases, Education Secretary Justine Greening told the House of Commons on Tuesday: "This will rightly continue to require the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as before and the Bill will allow the maximum fee cap to keep pace with inflation." The government argues that without an inflationary increase, the value of tuition fees, providing £11.6bn to universities, will be eroded. Other universities are still advertising fees at £9,000, but with a warning about a possible increase. Manchester Metropolitan University advertises fees of £9,000 for 2017, but with a note that says "these fees are regulated by the UK government, and so may increase each year in line with government policy". The University of Newcastle quotes a £9,000 fee but says it might increase with inflation for those entering in 2017. Other universities, such as University College London, have so far not published fees for 2017 on their websites. The increase in fees in England to £9,000 per year was introduced in 2012 by the coalition government and prompted angry protests from students. In Scottish universities, students from Scotland do not have to pay tuition fees. Northern Irish students at Northern Irish universities have fees of up to £3,925 and Welsh students have fees of £3,810. Sorana Vieru, vice president of the National Union of Students, warned of higher levels of debt for students. "A further fee rise will have a damaging impact on students and it is frustrating to learn universities were lobbying the minister for the fee rise before the reforms were published." A government spokeswoman said: "The teaching excellence framework will allow universities to maintain fees in line with inflation only if they meet a quality bar, as set out in the recent higher education White Paper."	Universities in England are already announcing a tuition fee increase above the £9,000 limit before Parliament has even finished debating plans which would pave the way to raise fees.
Local MP Ian Lucas said people were concerned about the impact it could have if the prison on Wrexham Industrial Estate assumes a local name. In a letter, prisons minister Jeremy Wright says local names are "generally avoided as most local people object". He said it was likely people would be invited to propose names for the Â£212m prison which is due to open in 2017. Work is expected to start in August, creating up to 1,000 jobs, to build the prison which will house 2,100 inmates, making it the largest prison in the UK. The overall project spend is lower than the original Â£250m estimate and the construction will involve local business and enterprises, with 100 apprenticeships created.	Wrexham's new super-prison is unlikely to be named after the county borough, says the prison minister.
The body of Peter Wrighton, 83, was found three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk on 5 August. He had been repeatedly stabbed. Norfolk Police said they wanted to trace three men seen around the woodland close to the time he died. The force said a man in his 50s seen changing into a t-shirt has been found. Police say they still want to speak to two other men; one aged 25 to 30, with tanned skin, wearing a grey or blue t-shirt, grey gym shorts and heavy-duty flip flops; the other aged 30 to 50, wearing dark clothing and seen walking without a dog to the north of the heath. Det Supt Andy Smith added: "We have already heard from more than 220 people but we will be exploring all avenues in our enquiries and we are still keen to hear from more. "We also want to hear from delivery drivers who might have travelled through or have been in the area on Saturday and who could have important dash cam footage for us to review. In addition, anyone else with images or footages of the area should contact us." There have been no arrests and no weapon has been found. Mr Wrighton was pictured on CCTV using the post office in Kenninghall at 10:10 BST, about 35 minutes before his body was found near to Fiveways Junction. "His car, a red Skoda Fabia, was parked close to The Street, the road close to the heath land where he was walking his dogs Dylan and Gemma," Det Supt Smith said. The force said it has more than 100 officers and staff working on the "significant murder investigation".	One of three "vital" potential witnesses to the murder of an elderly dog walker in woodland has been traced, police have said.
Phil Smith, chief executive of IT company Cisco, likened the situation to not having access to water or a road and said businesses would not be able to survive without it. He said a fast internet connection was vital to a country like Wales with a "complex landscape". The Welsh government insisted Wales was leading the way with broadband. Ministers and BT are currently delivering the scheme Superfast Cymru, which will give people access to fibre broadband. Earlier this year a Superfast Cymru spokesman said more than 80% of properties in Wales had access to the superfast broadband. But, speaking to BBC Wales at technology conference Digital 2016 in Newport, Mr Smith said: "I'm very surprised that broadband hasn't got to the level of penetration it should. "To be honest it's like saying you don't have a road now, or you don't have water. "Companies, countries and individuals can't survive without broadband, it's not some optional nice thing to have, this is the way business is done. "A country like Wales, it's got a wide population and complex landscape, it needs people to be on video, to engage anywhere in the world at any time. "I think it's really important that the government and industry push hard to get broadband to the highest level everywhere." A Welsh Government spokesman said an Ofcom report in August showed Wales was leading the way among the UK's devolved nations with the availability of superfast broadband. "The Superfast Cymru programme has already made superfast broadband speeds in excess of 24Mbps available to more than 581,000 Welsh homes and businesses, including in some very rural areas, and more premises will have access as the rollout continues," he added. "We are committed to making Wales a truly digital nation and continue to support businesses to take advantage of broadband technology which will help them to grow, to boost Wales' economic prosperity and create jobs."	A high profile figure in the world of technology has criticised poor broadband in parts of Wales.
The 21-year-old has made 35 appearances for the north London club since making his senior debut in 2012. Tompkins was part of the England Saxons squad which secured a series win in South Africa earlier this summer. "Nick has a very bright future in the game," said Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall.	Saracens centre Nick Tompkins has signed a new three-year contract with the Premiership and European Champions Cup winners.
Emily Thornberry said Labour would not "frustrate Brexit" even if it failed to amend the bill. Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote. The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading. Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was "hopelessly divided" on the issue. She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said: "We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union." Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a "meaningful vote" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as "red lines". Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was "illogical" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. "There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now," she said. "We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work." One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: "We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created hereâ€¦ it's about being part of a team. "I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go." But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had "already taken the flak on it". Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced "in the coming few days". Asked if he should be lenient, he added: "I'm a very lenient person." Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled "will have to step down".	The shadow foreign secretary has suggested Labour will continue to support legislation paving the way for Brexit as it passes through Parliament.

Elections are being held in 27 English county councils and seven unitary authorities, last contested in 2009, as well as in Anglesey in Wales. Labour are defending the South Shields seat in a contest caused by the resignation of David Miliband in March. Mayoral contests are also being held in Doncaster and North Tyneside. Polls for all the contests opened at 07:00 BST, and close at 22:00 BST. Blue sky and sunshine are covering much of England, as millions of voters choose who will represent them on their local council. More than 2,300 seats are up for grabs in county councils and unitary authorities across the length and breadth of England, including Derbyshire, Lancashire, Somerset, Essex, Surrey, Leicestershire, Kent, Durham, Bristol and Cornwall. The Conservatives and Labour are putting up candidates in most seats, with 2,263 and 2,168 candidates respectively. The Lib Dems have 1,763 candidates. UKIP is fielding 1,745 candidates, three times as many as it did the last time these seats were fought in 2009, and the Greens have 893 candidates. Other parties standing include the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, which is fighting 120 seats, the BNP, with 99 candidates and the English Democrats, with 38 candidates. There are around 900 independent candidates. No elections are taking place in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The majority of council results are expected on Friday between 11:00 BST and 18:30 BST, although six councils - Lincolnshire, Dorset, Somerset, Essex, Gloucestershire and Hampshire - will declare their results in the early hours of Friday morning. The result for the South Shields by-election is also expected early on Friday morning.	Voters across England are going to the polls for council elections and a parliamentary by-election in South Shields.
It is understood the new offer was a basic £35.5m, which would have risen to nearer £40m when various extras were added. The Reds value the 20-year-old, who has also been linked with Arsenal and Real Madrid, at £50m. Last week, Liverpool turned down a bid of £25m, plus add-ons, from Premier League rivals City. Sterling joined Liverpool from QPR in 2010 and is under contract until 2017, but has rejected the offer of a new £100,000-a-week deal. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said last month he expected Sterling to stay at Anfield for the remainder of his current deal. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

The memorial, with the names of 27 local people, has been unveiled at the Unite building in Islington. The city's office block has been called Jack Jones in honour of the ardent trade unionist from Garston who was badly injured in the conflict. Unite's regional secretary Paul Finegan said: "We feel very privileged." There were approximately 180 men and women who left the safety of Merseyside to defend the Spanish government against the might of General Francisco Franco's nationalist rebels between 1936 and 1939. Jack Jones survived the war and became the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union. He was heavily involved with the unions until he died aged 96 in April last year. Local historian, Danny Payne, said that although there were 27 names on the plaque, after further research it is believed that 30 people from Merseyside died fighting. They had to travel there in secret, after the UK government declared it illegal to fight in Spain as it tried to appease Hitler's huge fascist force in the lead up to the Second World War. In total, 2,500 from across the British Isles fought in the Spanish Civil War and 500 did not survive. Mr Finegan said: "The plaque used to be on the wall of the unemployed and trade union centre in Hardman Street, but since it closed years ago, it has been sent from place to place across the city. "Now it's good that it has a permanent home here, it all seems to fit together well - a newly refurbished building called Jack Jones and a memorial dedicated to those who lost their lives in the same war he fought." The civil war ended after WWII had started. More than 300,000 people died and the Republicans were persecuted by the victorious nationalist parties. Mr Payne added: "It was an horrific war, Franco's uprising was supported by the Hitler and Mussolini regimes so he was furnished with arms. "The Republic was short of weapons and medical supplies and it was basically strangled by the might of Franco."	A plaque with the names of those from Merseyside who lost their lives fighting in the Spanish Civil War has found a permanent home in Liverpool.
Richard Walsh, 43, was accused of attacking the two schoolboys, aged 12 and 13, in Havant, last month. He had been in custody at Belmarsh Prison in south-east London. Prison staff found Mr Walsh unresponsive in his cell on Sunday morning and, despite efforts to revive him, he was pronounced dead. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "HMP Belmarsh prisoner Richard Walsh was found unresponsive in his cell on Sunday 19 July. Staff attempted CPR but paramedics pronounced him dead at 11.07am. "As with all deaths in custody there will be an investigation by the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman." Mr Walsh, who was also charged with assault and robbery in relating to the taking of a bicycle, had been due to appear at Portsmouth Crown Court on Monday.	A man who was facing trial for the attempted murder of two boys who were stabbed in a street in Hampshire has been found dead in his prison cell.
The ex-Pontypridd MP blamed Labour's lack of "radical thinking" for its election defeat. Mr Howells said the party must have a "radical analysis" of society if it is to increase its numbers in parliament. But he said Labour had "held the line in Wales as well as anybody did in Britain" and praised the first minister for doing "something right". He told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: "It's probably at least as bad as under Michael Foot's leadership when we were in real dire straits. "If the Labour party doesn't come up with fresh thinking, with some radical analysis of what's going on in society and what people need out of society, it could well dwindle to a very small number of MPs." Labour won 232 seats in the general election, down from 258 in 2010. In Wales, the party won 25 out of 40 seats, but had expected to improve on the 26 seats it won in 2010. Of those seats, it lost Gower to the Conservatives by 27 votes, a constituency Labour had held for more than 100 years. Mr Howells acknowledged Labour's biggest successes were in the city and coal field regeneration areas. "If we ever want to be back in government again, we need to win southern England," he said. He also attacked Ed Miliband for promoting "unmitigated gloom" which he described as "dull, it's boring, it does not inspire anyone". And he said there was little enthusiasm for the party's new prospective leaders as they were "branded with the Miliband brand". Labour's next leader, he said, would need to be "much more radical" and "jump a generation of leaders and ideas". But Mr Howells was more optimistic about the future of Labour in Wales. He said: "I think Carwyn Jones is a much sharper leader. "They've proved that they can run a government in Wales and people trust them, that's why they voted for them." Responding to his comments, Labour peer Baroness Eluned Morgan admitted the party needed a "thorough rethink", but denied claims it was experiencing its worse crisis in living memory. She said the party needed to readdress the way it approached politics and the way it makes contact with society if it was to move forward successfully.	Former Labour minister Kim Howells has said the party is in the "deepest crisis" he can remember.
Exports of the fish jumped more than 53% by value to £408m, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said. UK food and drink exports rose 8.5% to £10.2bn, helped by the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote. But the FDF warned that without a favourable Brexit trade deal, British exports could become less competitive. Whisky remained the top export, while salmon was second, and beer rose to third, overtaking chocolate. But while the volume of salmon exports rose by 24%, whisky exports actually fell 1% by volume, and beer exports fell 2.2%. The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the UK voted to leave the EU in June last year, giving a boost to UK exports, as they have become relatively cheaper. However, the weaker pound has also pushed up costs for British businesses that bring in food and raw materials from abroad, the FDF said. It said the UK's food and drink trade deficit - the difference between how much the UK imports and exports - widened 16% to £12.4bn over the period. British salmon is becoming more popular globally, according to Andy Bing, sales director of Loch Duart Salmon in North West Scotland. "This half we've sold more than we ever have," he said, adding that the firm's main export markets were France, the US, Italy, and Switzerland. UK salmon exports have grown after Chilean producers suffered problems in 2015 with algal blooms that killed a large amount of their fish, he said. Looking ahead, the firm is optimistic about the eventual post-Brexit trade deals that can be struck with EU countries. "Europe needs lovely Scottish salmon just as we need lovely French wine and wonderful German cars," he said. However, he added that Loch Duart was "finding it difficult to plan without better guidance" from the government about Brexit. The two biggest importers of UK food and drink are Ireland and France. If there is no deal and World Trade Organization (WTO) tariffs with the EU are brought in, "food and drink would face significantly higher tariffs than most other products," an FDF spokesman said. For example, some fruit and vegetables would face tariffs of 157%, and for some drinks products, importers would have to pay 152% tariffs. Goods "could face lengthy delays at border for checks and inspections that would add delays and cost to products, particularly those with short shelf lives," the spokesman added. However, the free market think tank, the Institute for Economic Affairs, said it would not be a "disaster" if the UK failed to strike a deal with the EU. Jamie Whyte, IEA research director, said: "In fact, we could unilaterally eliminate all import tariffs, which would give us most of the benefits of trade and export to the EU under the umbrella of the WTO rules." A UK government spokesman said it wanted to reach a deal with the EU "allowing for the most frictionless trade including in food and drink as possible". Source HM Customs and Excise In the first half of the year, UK food and drink exports rose faster to EU countries, up 9%, than to countries outside the EU, with growth of 7.6%. But the market which saw the most growth in the first half was South Korea, up 77%, in the main due to beer exports. Food Minister George Eustice said: "We have ambitious plans to produce and export more of our fabulous foods around the world and more businesses are trying exporting for the first time. "Last week we announced further market access to China for pork producers and UK beef will soon be heading to the Philippines. We will continue to work with industry to open new opportunities."	Sales of British salmon helped the UK to export a record value of food and drink in the first half of the year, according to industry figures.
Felix Alexander, from Worcester, was 17 when he was hit by a train on 27 April last year. His mother Lucy Alexander has set up The Felix Project, launched at Pershore High School on Monday. The programme aims to help teachers spot the signs of a child being victimised and to train pupils to give peer support. See more stories from across Herefordshire and Worcestershire here It is being run by the children's charity Place2Be. Ms Alexander said: "I carry huge guilt that I did not say more when he was still alive and I feel compelled to give him a voice now." Advice she gave out to the Pershore pupils included some words on banter, saying it is only funny if people are secure in their friendships. Pershore High head teacher Clive Corbett backed the scheme, which Ms Alexander hopes will become embedded in the school curriculum. "We will train pupils to be what we call a peer mentor, and also staff from this school and other schools to make sure we are providing training for them," he said. "However well we feel we might do, we clearly can do things better." Speaking after the event, a couple of the pupils said Ms Alexander was "inspirational". She previously said her son was subjected to "cruel and overwhelming" taunts on social media, which eventually became unbearable. An inquest heard he made friends at Pershore High School, where the staff described him as bright and kind, after facing difficulties at his previous school.	The mother of a teenager who took his own life because of online bullying has set up a programme to tackle the issue.
Ethiopia's world champion Mare Dibaba took the bronze medal as her compatriot and race favourite Tigist Tufa pulled out before the halfway mark. London Marathon winner Sumgong, 31, finished in two hours 24 minutes four seconds to end a run of three straight silvers in the event for Kenya. GB's Alyson Dixon and Sonia Samuels finished 28th and 30th respectively. Sumgong, who fell on her way to victory in London this year, and Kirwa pulled away from Dibaba in the final 2km in humid conditions in Rio. Find out how to get into running with our special guide Kenya-born Kirwa, who secured Bahrain's first ever Olympic silver and second medal of all time, failed to stay with Sumgong and both women looked physically exhausted after they crossed the line. "I was never worried that I'd lose this," said Sumgong. "At 40km I knew the gold was mine. At 35km I noticed that my other two team-mates had dropped off and that gave me the motivation to carry on. "At 40km I saw there were three of us but I knew whatever happened I couldn't lose the gold and then I knew I was on the way to history." Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe "The conditions will have taken their toll. The way Sumgong stumbled over the line shows that. "It was a race of attrition and about who could hold and leave enough. Sumgong dominated that race mentally as well as physically."

After the mansion's contents were removed and charred timbers were carefully lifted out by crane, an archaeological salvage operation got under way which will continue until the spring. Some of the first photographs of the ornate carvings saved by archaeological experts are shown here:	Since a devastating fire hit 18th Century Clandon Park in Surrey, reducing it to a shell, more than 400 objects have been salvaged from the burnt-out remains - but work continues on the fabric of the building itself.
Media playback is not supported on this device "Great to be here," he offered in a slightly less Americanised accent than I expected. "Raining as always." "I can't wait to play this week," he enthused to the assembled journalists. "I've been looking forward to this for a long time, probably four or five years to be honest." So have we Russell. It's exciting, even for battle weary Scottish journalists, to see someone performing at the top of their game on a world stage with the potential to go further. That's not beyond Knox and the next two weeks provide the perfect platform for him to deliver further on his potential and achieve many of his dreams. Victory at the this week's Scottish Open in his home town of Inverness would certainly be one. That would push him right up the list for Ryder Cup qualification. Then there's the matter of next week's Open at Troon. Currently 27th in the world rankings, 131 places above the nearest Scot, Richie Ramsay, Knox is Scotland's best hope to at least fight for these trophies. He is a contender in most tournaments these days, primarily on the PGA Tour, and for a place in Darren Clarke's Ryder Cup team. As his star rises, Knox remains adamant that playing in front of an expectant home crowd over the next two weeks won't be a hindrance, despite heightened expectation. His demeanour backs that up. He seems philosophical - what will be, will be. "It adds a little bit of pressure," he said. "We're used to it, every week you've got pressure. I put a lot of pressure on myself every time I play so I don't really feel added pressure. "I've been wanting to do this my whole life. I've been wanting to play on the PGA tour, European Tour, all the majors and hey, it's starting to happen. "I've been wanting to win tournaments, be in the top 20, 10 in the world, see how high I can get. "This is what I've been dreaming my whole life. I'm not sure if you're ever really ready for it but you've just got to do your best and go for it." There's a wider goal for Knox than doing well in his home country, or even achieving a dream Ryder Cup place. Getting into the top 20 or 30 players in the world is tremendously hard. Staying there is just as difficult, if not more challenging, and plenty of players have been there and fallen away. "Of course the goal is to stay inside the top 50 but you have to play well to do that," said Knox. "It's so hard to stay there. To be honest I don't know how I'm going to do. I could quite easily move forward or quite easily move back. "That's the hard thing about golf. It's such a hard game. One week you feel like you can hit any shot, then up comes a week like last week when you're like 'Am I even good enough to play golf?' I feel like I can keep improving." Luke Donald addressed us shortly before Knox's arrival. He won this tournament at Castle Stuart in a rain-shortened Scottish Open in 2011, when he was the top-ranked golfer on the planet. He is now 83rd in the world and struggles to get anywhere near the form he showed so consistently. "Luke is a great player, and he's just one example of someone who has been at the top and slipped down," said Knox. "He's still a great player. "It's so hard to stay there and this is really my first go at trying to stay there and trying to move up." Such awareness can only be a positive for Knox and perhaps helps to keep his head on the ground despite his success. "The whole journey's been crazy the last couple of years. I just hope I never wake up and it keeps going." Victory here at home could be the launchpad for his life to get even crazier.	Russell Knox has every right to beam from ear to ear, as he did for the majority of his 15-minute media gathering, after flying in from his base in the United States to a sodden Castle Stuart.
The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids. It can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is set to say. Health officials said the review was expected to recommend the LCP should be phased out within six to 12 months. The system was developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the city's Marie Curie hospice in the 1990s to provide a model of best practice in the care of dying patients. It can mean an end to invasive tests, treatment or feeding through tubes that is deemed to cause unnecessary suffering at the end of life - but it should be discussed with the patient, family or carer where possible. The pathway was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute. It was intended to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients - whether they were in hospital, at home, in a care home or in a hospice. Previously, there were concerns that care had been patchy, with some hospitals failing to meet acceptable standards, and accusations that people were subjected to invasive treatment and testing that offered no chance of preventing death, but merely prolonged their suffering. Under the LCP, patients are regularly reviewed to ascertain whether medication should be stopped - and whether fluids should be withdrawn once they have ceased to be able to eat and drink. However, families have complained relatives were put on the pathway without their consent, and that death has been hastened in people who were not dying imminently. Critics say that it is impossible for doctors to predict when death is imminent, so the decision to put a patient on the pathway is at worst self-fulfilling. There have also been suggestions that the pathway has been used to help hospitals save money. NHS Trusts do receive payouts for hitting targets related to its use - but the suggestion that the pathway has been used for cynical reasons has been vigorously denied by the Department of Health. The Department of Health (DoH) in England set up an independent review amid fears the LCP was being used to hasten death, to clear beds and save money, and that patients or their families were not being consulted. The review, led by crossbench peer Baroness Julia Neuberger, applies only to England. The LCP is also used in Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in Wales, which has its own framework for end-of-life care and support. A Scottish Government spokeswoman told the BBC it welcomed the Neuberger review. "Recommendations set out in the report will be considered by the Living and Dying Well National Advisory Group, so that any learning for Scotland can be taken forward with stakeholders," the spokeswoman said. The review for England was asked to focus on the use of the LCP model rather than re-evaluating its basic merits. But the DoH said the review team, which heard evidence from patients, families and health professionals, encountered "numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care". The review was likely to conclude the LCP needed to be replaced, it said in a statement. "The independent review into end of life care system the Liverpool Care Pathway, commissioned last year by Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb and backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is likely to recommend that the LCP is phased out over the next six to 12 months," the DoH said. The statement gave no indication of what might replace the LCP. But Mr Lamb said: "We need a new system of better end-of-life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families." He ordered the review in November last year amid intense media scrutiny of the LCP following criticism from patients' families. At the time, he said he was concerned about the "unacceptable" cases that had come to light. British Medical Association president elect Baroness Finlay said the LCP was originally brought in because patients were "dying badly, in hospitals in particular". They were being "walked past, ignored and neglected", she said, and the LCP was an attempt to "roll out the best of hospice care into other areas". "By and large that worked well but the problem has been that it hasn't always been used properly," she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. She said that if the LCP was phased out it was vital something better replaced it. "Something which is very clear, very simple and which drives up professional behaviour," Baroness Finlay added. Dr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians - which has been reviewing the LCP every year since it was introduced in 2004 - said the system was "very helpful". "But if the execution of it in all instances has not been right then we need to review that," she added. "All doctors dealing with patients who may unfortunately die need to be trained in end-of-life care. We need to know what the standards are, we need to be able to apply them, our junior doctors and trainees need to be fully trained in it. And we also need time - time to be able to discuss these very difficult issues." Jason Suckley, director of policy and campaigns at Sue Ryder, said the healthcare charity's research had shown the timing and quality of conversations health professionals had with terminally-ill patients amounted to a "lottery". He said workers' communication skills needed to be improved and urged Health Education England, which provides training and support for healthcare professionals, to include end-of-life training in its workforce mandate. "When it comes to dying we cannot afford to get it wrong and health professionals need to be supported to communicate with people effectively at a very traumatic and emotionally difficult time," he said. The review's findings are due to be published in full on Monday.	The Liverpool Care Pathway, developed to support patients as they near death, should be phased out in England, an independent review is expected to say.
