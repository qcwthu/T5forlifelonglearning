Following the acquisition of Cyprus defender Jason Demetriou, Etheridge, 25, fills the gap left by Richard O'Donnell's move to Wigan Athletic. The ex-Chelsea trainee, who has made just 20 Football League appearances, was released by Charlton in May. "We had a number of good options but Neil stood out," said boss Dean Smith. "He ticks all the boxes in age, room for development and experience at this level and above," said Smith. He's an extremely driven young man who wants to be successful. These are the characteristics we're looking for. "Neil will compete with Craig MacGillivray for a first-team place. They will both push each other on, exactly the kind of competition that we want." Etheridge, who began his professional career at Fulham, added: "The faith that the gaffer and Neil Cutler (Walsall goalkeeping coach) have shown in me means a lot. Now is the time to get my head down and work hard. "I have gained plenty of international experience in front of big crowds, but I've not played as many league games as I'd have liked. I intend to rectify that here." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	League One side Walsall have made their second international signing in 24 hours by bringing in Philippines keeper Neil Etheridge on a two-year deal.
Hilary McClintock was elected as mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Monday. The SDLP's Jim McKeever is the new deputy mayor. In 2012, the DUP mayor of Londonderry Maurice Devenney refused to hand his chains to Sinn Féin's Kevin Campbell. Mayor McClintock said it was "significant" but things had moved on. "Its part of the process towards normality, the same thing happened in Belfast council a few days ago," she said. "It was something that we discussed locally and it wasn't really a big deal so we're quite happy to accept it (mayoral chains) from the outgoing mayor." The Drumahoe based councillor said that during her term she wants more investment because people in the north west feel like "second class citizens". "I don't want us to be second class I want us to punch a bit higher and I will hopefully lead on that," she said. "I don't think it's even a party thing. I think west of the Bann we sometimes do feel neglected. "There's a lot more that can be done for the city, in terms of unemployment we have absolutely woeful figures. "We do need to bring more jobs and more infrastructure," she added. Family, friends and councillors from different parties clapped and cheered as former mayor Elisha McCallion placed the mayoral chain around Mrs McClintock's neck. The former mayor told BBC Radio Foyle she was delighted to be able to do so. "I'm delighted everything went well for the new mayor and I want to wish her all the best for the future, and the deputy mayor as well," Mrs McCallion said. "Its a very symbolic day because that was actually the very first time a DUP mayor has accepted a chain from a Sinn Féin ex-mayor. "It just goes to show you where we are as a society here in this city so I was delighted to do that honour," she said. Mrs McClintock, who is married with two daughters, has previously worked as a civil servant and a classroom assistant.	For the first time in Londonderry an outgoing Sinn Féin mayor has placed the chains of office around the neck of a DUP successor.
Speed cameras in Perth reportedly captured the yellow Carrera 911 travelling at 122km (76 miles) an hour in a 70km zone last Sunday. The man was charged under Western Australia's anti-hooning laws, which are named after "hoons" a term to describe a dangerous, speeding driver. The luxury car has been seized for 28 days, Forrestfield Police tweeted.	An Australian man, 88, has had his Porsche impounded after being charged with reckless driving, police say.
Four hundred devices have been purchased, at a cost of Â£1.5m. Body Worn Video Technology, as it's known, is already in place in Derry City and Strabane District. The cameras are clipped on to the top half of an officer's uniform and can provide eight hours of continuous recording. Officers have been trained to tell people when they are being recorded. Supporters of the scheme say the cameras will improve the quality of evidence that police officers can gather. They will be particularly useful in assisting prosecutions in cases of domestic abuse, for example. The roll-out follows on from a pilot scheme in Foyle in 2014-15. Body cameras are routine in other parts of the UK and were first introduced about a decade ago. Studies have found that they dramatically reduced complaints against officers by members of the public, by up to 93% in one case. PSNI Chief Supt Chris Noble said: "Video evidence puts the victims of crime first. "The pilot of this technology in Foyle district evidenced how Body Worn Video has the potential to improve the quality of evidence provided by police officers. It also increases the number of offenders brought to justice. "The introduction of this new technology is the latest example of our commitment to these principles as we continue to work together with the community to keep people safe."	Police officers in Belfast will wear body cameras while on duty from Wednesday.
Marcus Evans is among nine people investigated over ticket scalping, conspiracy and ambush marketing. Mr Evans, who runs his own sports hospitality company, denied any wrongdoing and said the allegations are "totally without foundation". The exact full charges against Mr Evans have yet to be confirmed to the BBC. Follow updates and reaction to this story Brazilian prosecutor Marcos Kac told Associated Press he had decided to charge Mr Evans, along with Olympic Council of Ireland President Patrick Hickey and seven others, after reviewing the police investigation. Police investigator Aloysio Falcao said authorities also wanted to speak to IOC President Thomas Bach about email exchanges between him and Mr Hickey. Mr Bach will not be attending the opening of the Paralympic Games later. The authorities have no evidence that Mr Bach knew about the alleged ticket scam, the investigator said. A spokesman for Mr Evans, who runs the Marcus Evans Group and THG Sports, confirmed he was aware of the charges but referred to previous statements which said the companies had "acted at all times lawfully and any suggestion to the contrary is just not true". Ticket scalping, or ticket touting, involves the resale of tickets for admission to events at a higher price, while ambush marketing involves a company trying to associate its products with an event that already has official sponsors. Mr Hickey, 71, has formally stood aside as president of the Olympic Council of Ireland and European Olympic Committees' president during the investigation. Kevin Mallon, who has also had charges passed against him, is the Dublin-based director of Mr Evans' hospitality company THG Sports. Police allege Mr Hickey plotted with businessmen to transfer tickets illegally from a sports company called Pro 10 to THG Sports, which was a non-authorized vendor and allegedly sold them for very high fees. Both men deny any wrongdoing.	The owner of Ipswich Town Football Club has been charged in connection with a ticket-touting case in August's Olympic Games in Brazil.
Daw'r newid arfaethedig wedi i berchnogion clybiau a thafarndai ar Stryd Womanby yng Nghaerdydd alw ar gyngor y ddinas i newid statws y stryd yn un "diwylliannol", er mwyn gwarchod sîn gerddoriaeth y brifddinas. Roedd ymgyrchwyr yn pryderu nad oedd rheolau mewn grym i amddiffyn y clybiau a'r tafarndai, yn dilyn nifer o ddatblygiadau adeiladu yn yr ardal. Dywedodd Lesley Griffiths ddydd Gwener ei bod am gyfeirio at yr egwyddor o 'Asiant dros Newid' o fewn y polisi cynllunio cenedlaethol. O dan yr egwyddor yma, os caiff datblygiadau newydd fel fflatiau neu westai eu hadeiladu yn agos at leoliad cerddoriaeth fyw, cyfrifoldeb y datblygwr fydd rheoli effaith y newid a rheoli'r sŵn. Fe wnaeth Lesley Griffiths gadarnhau hefyd y bydd Polisi Cynllunio Cymru yn cael ei ddiweddaru i ddynodi "ardaloedd o bwysigrwydd diwylliannol" ym maes cerddoriaeth o fewn Cynlluniau Datblygu Lleol. Yn ystod yr ymweliad â Stryd Womanby dywedodd: "Mae lleoliadau cerddoriaeth fyw yn cyfrannu'n fawr at ddiwylliant Cymru a'n heconomi liw nos. "Dwi'n ymwybodol o'r ymdrechion i ddiogelu'r lleoliadau hyn at y dyfodol, gan gynnwys ymgyrch "Achub Stryd Womanby" yng Nghaerdydd, a hoffwn dalu teyrnged i waith caled ac ymrwymiad pawb fu'n rhan o hyn. "Er bod bywiogrwydd ardaloedd fel Stryd Womanby yn dibynnu ar nifer o wahanol garfanau, gan gynnwys awdurdodau lleol, y lleoliadau eu hunain a'u cwsmeriaid, rwyf wedi clywed y galwadau i ddiweddaru ein polisi cynllunio cenedlaethol er mwyn diogelu lleoliadau cerddoriaeth fyw. "Dwi'n falch iawn, felly, o gadarnhau fy mod wedi gofyn i'm swyddogion ddechrau diwygio Polisi Cynllunio Cymru cyn gynted â phosib." Wrth ymateb i'r newyddion, dywedodd Guto Brychan, Prif Weithredwr Clwb Ifor Bach ar Stryd Womanby, ac un fu'n ymgyrchu i ddiogelu cerddoriaeth fyw ar y stryd: "Ers i ni ddechrau'r ymgyrch rhyw ddau fis yn ôl, dau brif amcan oedd ganddo ni. "Un oedd dod a'r egwyddor 'Asiant dros Newid' i mewn i'r canllawiau cynllunio cenedlaethol a'r llall oedd i newid designation y stryd i fod yn un diwyllianol a bod hwnna'n rhywbeth oedd yn cael ei fabwysiadu o fewn polisiau lleol y cyngor. "Dyma'r ddau beth sy'n cael ei gyfeirio ato yn y datganiad yma felly mae hyn yn arwyddocaol iawn."	Mae Lesley Griffiths, Ysgrifennydd y Cabinet dros yr Amgylchedd a Materion Gwledig, wedi cyhoeddi ei bod yn bwriadu diwygio'r polisi cynllunio mewn ymgais i gefnogi lleoliadau cerddoriaeth fyw.
Lukasz Robert Pawlowski of Pembroke Dock, appeared for sentence at the Pembrokeshire court on Wednesday after pleading guilty to sexual assault. He was airlifted to Swansea's Morriston Hospital and is said to be recovering. Dyfed-Powys Police confirmed they have arrested a 33-year-old man on suspicion of possession of an article with a blade or point. It is understood he lost consciousness and bled heavily after cutting himself. The court was closed after the incident but reopened on Thursday.	A sex attacker who cut his own throat in the dock at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court has been arrested.
There were also golds for James Crisp, who won his fifth European title in the S9 100m backstroke, while Ollie Hynd led home a GB one-two in the S8 400m freestyle with Josef Craig taking silver. Hannah Russell (S12 50m freestyle) and Stephanie Millward (S9 100m backstroke) added silvers to the GB medal haul. Rodgers beat her previous best of 36.01 seconds, set in 2012, with an impressive 35.90 to triumph by 2.82secs and take her third consecutive title. The 32-year-old, who missed out on a medal in the event at London 2012, is benefiting from a new butterfly technique where she uses just one arm and although most of her main rivals are from outside Europe, she was pleased with her time. "I've been working quite hard on that one," she said. "Last week was a bit of a mixed bag for me at trials so it's really nice to come out and get a good time. "It's great to see the hard work paying off. If PBs and records happen all the time then you take it for granted but it's such an amazing feeling." Sheffield's Crisp, 33, who won his first European title back in 1999, used all his experience over the second 50m to finish 0.8secs ahead of Poland's Patryk Biskup with team-mate Lewis White finishing fourth at his first major championships. "I kind of see the last 19 years as a bit of a warm-up to this year," he said. "This is the year that counts and it's good to know I am there or thereabouts and fighting for the medals still. "I have to change my training a little bit now I am in my thirties but I feel strong and fit." S8 400m silver medallist Craig was competing just a day after being disqualified from the S8 100m freestyle final because his tattoo breached advertising regulations. He returned to the pool on Monday with the design covered up.	Susie Rodgers improved her own S7 50m butterfly European record to win one of three golds for Great Britain on day two of the IPC Swimming Open European Championships in Madeira.
The Bluebirds could receive up to £5m for the Scotland goalkeeper. But Giles says the 31-year-old is worth at least £8m, underlining Cardiff's malaise in the Championship. "They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere," said Giles. Marshall agreed personal terms with Hull after being omitted from Saturday's Championship defeat by Reading. The 31-year-old has made more than 280 appearances for Cardiff since arriving from Norwich City for free in 2009. Cardiff are 17th in the 24-strong division with one win, two draws and two defeats. Marshall is widely regarded as their star player and Giles, who had two playing stints with the club lasting a combined total of six years, is unhappy at the player leaving. "I think it's a joke. Personally I think David Marshall is worth £8m, probably more than that to any club," said Giles before Marshall's move was finalised. "Football today, I hate it, all these stats - they keep going on with stats, but if you look at Marshall's stats, they would without a doubt be better than anyone in the Championship and be a lot better than goalkeepers in the Premier League and they've let him go. "Probably if Hull win the Premier League they'll get £5m." "They are going to get £3.5m and they're selling him on the cheap. And that tells me where the club is going: nowhere." Giles agrees that Cardiff City need a proven goalscorer, but does not believe one will be signed. "Without a doubt Cardiff need a striker and talking to fans, they're looking for someone to score 15-20 goals a season," he told Radio Wales Sport. "Well that's not going to happen this year and unfortunately we're looking at a season where if they finish half way, they've done well. "Is that going to bring your fans back? You'll always get your diehards going, but is that going to get enthusiastic people coming down to Cardiff City Stadium? "It's a poor Cardiff City when they're watching second-rate football."	The sale by Cardiff City of captain David Marshall to Hull City has been described as "a joke" by former midfielder David Giles.
Flight AF953 was travelling from Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea, to Douala, Cameroon's largest city and commercial capital, when it hit bad weather on 2 May. While avoiding storm clouds, the plane came close to hitting the 4,040-metre (13,254 feet) Mount Cameroon. French accident investigators BEA have now opened an investigation. The Boeing 777 aircraft had 37 people on board as it made the short journey to Douala, which is around 100km (62 miles) from Malabo. It was due to arrive in Cameroon to pick up more passengers before continuing to Paris. After diverting north to avoid storm clouds shortly after 21:00 local time, the plane's new route to Douala took it directly towards the mountain. An initial incident report published by BEA said an automated warning, saying "Pull up", was activated. The plane then ascended quickly from 9,000ft (2,743m) to 13,000ft (3,962m) to avoid a collision. BEA did not say how close the plane came to Mount Cameroon. The flight landed 44 minutes after leaving Malabo, and no-one was injured. Air France said they were conducting an internal investigation into the incident.	An Air France aeroplane narrowly missed central Africa's highest mountain in early May, French investigators say.
Davina Ayrton, 34, admitted being sentenced for having the images in 2014, but denies committing rape in a garage in Portsmouth in 2004. The girl, aged 15 at the time, met Ms Ayrton, then called David, on the day of the attack, the jury was told. Portsmouth Crown Court also heard the girl had run away from home. Ms Ayrton, who has a son, admitted being previously sentenced at Bournemouth Crown Court in January last year. When Ann-Marie Talbot, representing Ms Ayrton, asked her why she entered guilty pleas, she replied: "Because I was guilty of them." Ms Ayrton admitted being in the garage in the autumn of 2004 and drinking four cans of Foster's beer but denied drinking vodka because, she said: "I was on benefits at the time and didn't have enough money". The attack is alleged to have taken place while two other people were asleep nearby. The teenager, who cannot be identified, said she had "only drunk a can and a half of Foster's" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that Ms Ayrton has learning difficulties and told a worker at the care home where she lives in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the incident in 2014. But she denied confessing to the care worker that she was a paedophile, or saying: "I have always known there was something wrong with me and I need help." Ms Talbot asked the defendant about her sexuality, and whether she had "made any physical changes or enhancements" to her body or was taking any medication. The defendant replied "No, I have not" and said she changed her name in 2012. Ms Ayrton denies one charge of rape between October and November 2004. The trial continues.	A transgender woman accused of raping a girl when still living as a man, has a conviction of possessing indecent images of children, a court has heard.
The Railway Policing (Scotland) Bill is the first step towards the national force taking on the responsibilities of British Transport Police in Scotland. Members of the justice committee have endorsed the bill, although they were split on the final recommendation. The Conservatives and Labour both argued against the merger, citing concerns raised by BTP and unions. MSPs agreed to the general principles of the legislation by 66 votes to 44, with the Greens and Lib Dems backing the SNP - although the Lib Dems incidated they would seek to make amendments at committee stage. The Scottish government has long wanted to integrate railway policing services into the single national force, and tabled a bill to that end in December 2016. The Railway Policing (Scotland) Bill would confer extra powers on the Scottish Police Authority and the Police Service of Scotland, but further legislation would be needed at Holyrood and Westminster to transfer staff, properties and cross-border policing functions. A report from the justice committee backed the general principles of the bill, but members were split after hearing the majority of respondents to their inquiries oppose the plans. Witnesses including BTP chief constable Paul Crowther have warned that a merger could prove a "real challenge", saying it could cause a "significant outflow of expertise", but Police Scotland have said a merger would be "complicated but not insurmountable". Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said he was "very pleased" with the progress of the bill, adding that the government had "listened closely" to concerns. He said: "Integrating the BTP in Scotland into Police Scotland will further enhance the safety of passengers and railway staff and our plans will provide railway policing which is more accountable to the people of Scotland. "The bill will also provide more joined up service across our key infrastructure and with local community policing." The Conservatives and Scottish Labour have opposed the merger, and voted against backing it in the justice committee and the chamber. However, Lib Dem and Green MSPs on the committee supported the bill and in the chamber, despite some voicing concerns. Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Douglas Ross spoke out against the merger, describing it as an "utterly needless move, inspired by nationalism rather than national security". And his Tory colleague Oliver Mundell added: "This is just another ill-thought out power grab, driven not by logic but by an ideological and constitutional obsession with control. It's change for change's sake." Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said the government seemed "determined to railroad its bill through parliament", and called on them to halt the plans. She said: "We have heard numerous concerns from BTP, staff, unions and railway providers that haven't been fully addressed by the SNP. There are clear operational and serious financial questions that remain unanswered by the government. "We already have in Scotland a transport policing system that works and serves us well, but this Bill risks that. With concerns over the financial memorandum attached to this bill, this could prove to be a costly way to fix a problem that isn't broken." Scottish Green MSP John Finnie, who backed the plans in the justice committee, acknowledged concerns but said there would be an entirely co-ordinated system if the proposals went ahead. Lib Dem member Liam McArthur said the merger was the "biggest risk" among options put forward, but said the bill should be allowed to progress to the next stage to allow ministers to address concerns. Earlier, Mike Hogg of the RMT union said the merger made "no logical or financial sense". He told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We think there is a real danger of losing that expertise. We fear that the British Transport Police will be swallowed up." During the stage one debate, Mr Yousaf said there had been "constructive" talks with unions over the plans.	MSPs are to debate legislation aimed at integrating railway policing into Police Scotland for the first time.
Mani Kurian, 50, of Eridge Road, Eastbourne, was convicted unanimously by a jury at Lewes Crown Court. He was also found guilty of five sexual assaults and one assault by beating. A 21-year-old woman was raped as she walked on the upper promenade towards the pier in the East Sussex town at about 02:00 BST on 19 October 2014. Court officials said Kurian would be sentenced on 26 February.	A man has been found guilty of raping a woman near Eastbourne Pier.
The scheme would be similar to 'Sarah's Law' - the law introduced in England, Scotland and Wales in 2011.. It allows a parent or guardian to ask police if a person who has contact with children is a child sex offender. Hundreds of paedophiles have been identified in Great Britain since the introduction of the scheme. Two DUP assembly members, Paul Frew and Lord Morrow, have tabled an amendment to the Justice Bill due to be discussed in the assembly on Tuesday. The amendment says that guidance for statutory agencies managing the risks of offenders must "contain arrangements for the consideration of disclosure, to any particular member of the public, of information in the possession of the agencies about the relevant previous convictions of any specified sexual or violent offender, where it is necessary to protect a particular child or children from serious harm caused by the offender." The amendment also states that members of the public provided with information may be prevented from disclosing it to any other person. Sarah's Law was named after eight-year-old Sarah Payne, who was murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in July 2000.	The DUP is proposing the introduction of a paedophile disclosure scheme in Northern Ireland.
Ashleigh Harris was 14 when she broke her back after falling from Polly Perks, owned by Rachel Miller. She now has no function in her legs. She was riding Polly in a field in Mathern, near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, when she was injured in 2012. Miss Harris, 18, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, is suing Mrs Miller at London's High Court. She claims Polly "misbehaved" and broke into a canter of her own accord, throwing her off in the process. But Mrs Miller says the horse was blameless and Miss Harris fell after losing her balance as she descended a "short and gentle slope". The court heard Ashleigh had been taken to a field on 22 September 2012 by Mrs Miller, the mother of her then boyfriend, Keiran Miller. Miss Harris described Polly as "fidgety" and said the thoroughbred mare had been nipping at her and others. She added: "She then went to canter and I held her up because I didn't ask her to. She was throwing her head around and bucked, then I came out of the saddle and went over the horse's head." Her barrister, David Westcott QC, said she should never have been allowed into Polly's saddle as she had only ever ridden ponies. He also said the mare was "bred for racing" and had not been well schooled. Mrs Miller said the teenager fell as she was riding Polly at a walking pace down a hill in the field. She also said she spoke to Miss Harris's mother before letting her ride Polly and believed Ashleigh was a more experienced rider. Winston Hunter QC, for Mrs Miller, said: "Ashleigh gave Keiran an impression that she was indeed a competent rider. "There's no evidence Mrs Miller was aware that she had only ridden ponies." Judge Graham Wood QC will give his ruling on the claim at a later date.	A teenager who was paralysed after falling off a horse is suing her ex-boyfriend's mother for £3m.
This is an attempt to set up what will be called the TFTA (Tripartite Free Trade Area). It will be signed between the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the South African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC). Now there's been great fanfare in the press about this, mainly pushed by the politicians who are made to look good by this kind of thing. But the headlines of "Common Market for Africa" or "EU-style bloc emerges in Africa" are misleading. If the TFTA functions properly, it will be a free trade area, not a common market and certainly nothing approaching what the EU is. The trouble is not all the players involved function properly themselves. COMESA still has certain tariffs within it, while inside the EAC (arguably the most integrated of the blocs) there are still issues between Kenya and Tanzania on things like share ownership. And South Africa tends to dominate SADC. But that's not to say that this tripartite agreement is a waste of time. Free trade from Cape to Cairo has been a goal since colonial times (Cecil Rhodes talked about it) and this agreement is a baby step towards that. In theory, it'll boost intra-African trade, but that depends more on the capacity of African countries to make what each other want at competitive prices, rather than a simple lowering or scrapping of tariffs between the 26 members. The devil will be in the details of this agreement. There have been concerns over protectionist measures for local industries and a method of settling trade disputes. But it may boost intra-Africa trade. At the moment, trade between African countries amounts to just 13% of total African trade. Some academics have said that this tripartite agreement could boost it by 30% over the next few years. But there will be challenges on the ground. For a start, customs officials and getting across borders is notoriously cumbersome in Africa. Also, manufacturing on a local level needs to be boosted. The UN said three years ago that the best way to boost African trade was to concentrate on developing local capacity, rather than just lowering tariffs. That way, Africans would have things to sell to each other at prices that are more competitive than outsiders. If that happens within a new free trade area, that's what would boost intra-African trade. Also there are various disputes between the members of this agreement, from gripes to outright hostility. So, while there's a good deal of political will behind the TFTA, how it works on the ground will be the proof of the pudding. And that won't be apparent for months or years to come. Pardon my cynicism, but the three blocs involved in this are by no means functioning perfectly. With all the hype surrounding this TFTA, you'd think it was the panacea to all of Africa's economic and trade problems. It's not. But it is a tiny step in the right direction.	Some of you will have seen the news that a three-bloc trade deal is being signed between 26 African states in Egypt today.
