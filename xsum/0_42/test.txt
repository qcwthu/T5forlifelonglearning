The figures for England from the regulator, NHS Improvement, cover the 2015-16 year, which finished in March. By December - the three-quarter mark - hospital, ambulance and mental health trusts were already £2.2bn in the red, with the figure expected to have risen. Overspending on agency staff has been highlighted as a major problem, as well as rising demand for services. Experts are warning the pressure the overspend puts hospitals under has an impact on care. Analysis: Is enough being spent by the NHS? Analysis: Mind the NHS financial black hole Financial problems 'endemic in the NHS' The figures account for about two-thirds of the entire £116bn health budget - they do not cover GPs, training budgets, public health budgets held by councils or any unspent money held by local health managers. That means the Department of Health could still balance the books when the overall accounts are released later in the summer. But the expected overspend still has the potential to impact on services. This year the NHS is getting £3.8bn extra as part of the spending review settlement. Some £1.8bn has already been set aside for hospitals to cover their deficits, but anything in excess of that will mean they will be under more pressure to make savings as the year goes on. A hospital trust financial director, who wishes to remain anonymous, suggested the Department of Health was "cooking up accounting alchemy" by "turning hospitals' very large aggregated deficits into a much lower figure to ensure the NHS meets the spending limit set by HM Treasury". He told the BBC that examples included shifting the recording of investment spending into day-to-day running costs. He said: "The so-called capital to revenue transfer may well be a legitimate accounting adjustment at the margins of the NHS accounts. "But I have grave concerns that it is being used on a scale of hundreds of millions of pounds in more than 80 trusts. The cash is being washed through hospitals' accounts as 'income' merely to improve the bottom line." A Department of Health spokesman said: "We are committed to the NHS and are investing £10bn in its own plan for the future - but it is vital that money is accounted for consistently. "The transfer from capital to revenue makes no difference to the overall departmental picture given Parliament has voted to approve it - to say otherwise is misleading." He also pointed out that the final accounts will be reviewed by the National Audit Office.‎ "We recognise parts of the NHS are under pressure as demand rises due to our ageing population, but we are providing intensive support to improve performance, boost efficiency and reduce the use of expensive agency staff." Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said concerns over accounting practices were a symptom of unprecedented demand on the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "There's no doubt that the pressure this year is much greater than it has ever been, and that therefore each individual finance director and each individual board is having to make a decision about what they believe is appropriate." But he added that the practices were "a perfectly ordinary thing to do". David Bennett, a former chief executive of Monitor, the regulator of the NHS in England which is now part of NHS Improvement, said the Department of Health had to find a way of funding the deficit. "For certain, they will be scrambling around trying to find every little budget elsewhere that has underspent to try and make sure the numbers all add up". Hospitals and other health services are not like businesses. They're not going to just go bust, as the government can always step in. But the financial problems do matter. The deficits being racked up are massive. You probably have to go back to a very different era - the early 1950s - to find a similar scale of overspending, and that led to charges being brought in for spectacles, dentistry and prescriptions. This time the impact is likely to be felt in terms of what doesn't happen. The Department of Health has made it clear the overspends will not be simply written off. Instead, hospitals (most of the overspends are concentrated among them) will have to use the extra money they have got this year to pay off their debts. If that happens on a large scale, it puts the NHS on a back foot. Recruitment freezes are introduced, building projects are stopped or delayed and services are scaled back. These measures are already being taken, but more of them will just make it more difficult for the NHS to meet its waiting time targets and provide high-quality care. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said the mood in the NHS "could not be bleaker". "The level of deficits in terms of scale and how many hospitals are in deficit is unprecedented. It puts organisations under stress, which makes them fragile and risky. "There is pressure on recruitment, pressure on management and that has an impact on services. We are already seeing waiting time targets being breached." She also said capital budgets - money which has been set aside for building projects and maintenance - were being raided. When the three-quarter year figures were released, just seven of the 138 hospital trusts were in surplus. Last year NHS trusts finished over £800m in the red - with the health service as a whole balancing the books only after a cash injection from the Treasury and by raiding the capital budget. The rest of the UK does not release equivalent figures as hospitals are not run as autonomous organisations as they are in England. It means the accounts cover a wider range of services and therefore may take into account surpluses in other areas of the health service. Figures in Scotland have yet to be published. Meanwhile, ministers in Wales have predicted the NHS will break even. No data is available for Northern Ireland.	An unprecedented overspend by hospitals and other NHS trusts is expected to be announced later by health bosses.
The US tech giant sold 74.8 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter, compared with 74.5 million a year ago. Apple said revenue for the next quarter would be between $50bn (Â£34bn; â‚¬46bn) and $53bn, below the $58bn it reported for the same period a year ago. This would mark Apple's first fall in revenues since it launched the iPhone. Despite first-quarter iPhone sales being below the 75 million expected by analysts, it was still a record quarter for the company. Apple revenue in the three months to 26 December was $75.9bn and net profit was $18.4bn, both of which are the highest ever recorded by the company. Sales of iPhones accounted for 68% of the company's revenue in the period. Any other company announcing record profits and revenues might expect a warm welcome from investors. But now that Apple has scaled so many peaks the worry is that the only way is down - and there's evidence in these figures to back up those concerns. Sales of the iPhone, surely the single most profitable product any company has produced, were basically flat. What's more,  the revenue outlook for the next three months indicates we can expect the first fall in sales since the iPhone's 2007 launch. Then there's China - still growing but far more slowly. The iPhone is still an object of desire there, but at a time when Apple says it's seeing softness in the economy, the attractions of cheaper rivals from local firms like Xiaomi may grow. Of course, the worries about "peak iPhone" have surfaced before and evaporated with the hugely successful iPhone 6. Last year's upgrade to the 6S was a minor one, and we can expect something more radical in September. But the pressure is now mounting on Apple to deliver another blockbuster product to keep the profit engine running. The Apple watch will not fill that role - we've still not even heard any sales figures for the product. Perhaps the 1,000 engineers rumoured to be working on an Apple Car will come up with the exciting innovation which Apple's fans and investors await with growing impatience. Is the mighty iPhone in decline? Apple boss Tim Cook credited "all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV" for the performance. But the firm's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company was operating in "a very difficult macroeconomic environment". He added that "iPhone units will decline in the quarter" and that the company was not projecting beyond those three months. Mr Maestri partly blamed the strong US dollar for Apple's flat sales, estimating it had knocked $5bn off the company's revenues. Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - rose 14%, but that was much slower than the 70% increase a year ago. Mr Maestri said the softness in China was "something that we have not seen before", Reuters reported. China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined. The profitability of Apple's business improved, with gross margin - or how much the company makes per product - increasing to 40.1%. Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple was "generating industry defying margins" and had cash of almost $216bn. Speaking to analysts, Mr Cook said the company had "the mother of all balance sheets" and that its financial position had never been stronger. Apple's shares were down 2.7% in after hours trading at $97.28. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Capital Markets who owns shares in Apple, said given the "white knuckles fears" ahead of the results, he would "characterise the overall headline performance as better than feared".	Apple has reported the slowest growth in iPhone sales since the product's 2007 launch and warned sales will fall for the first time later this year.
"I wasn't 100% sober," she said at an event with fellow Justice Antonin Scalia. She said she "couldn't resist the fine wine" at the dinner which traditionally brings together some of the court's justices before the speech. At 81, Justice Ginsburg is the oldest serving judge on the Supreme Court. She was asked about the incident by the moderator at an event at George Washington University on Thursday evening. Justice Ginsburg was repeatedly pictured slumbering in her chair as President Barack Obama addressed the joint session of Congress in the House of Representatives on 20 January. "The audience for the most part is awake, but they're bobbing up and down all the time. And we sit there as stone-faced, sober judges. But we're not. "At least I wasn't 100% sober when we went to the State of the Union," she said, provoking audience laughter. Justice Ginsburg said she had vowed to stick to sparkling water after dozing at the speech in past years, but was unable to resist the lure of a "very fine California wine" brought by Justice Anthony Kennedy. "In the end, the dinner was so delicious it needed wine," she said. "Well, that's the first intelligent thing you've done," quipped Justice Scalia. Former Justice David Souter used to give her a pinch when he spotted the warning signs in years gone by, Justice Ginsburg said, but the judges beside her this time were "more timid".	US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has admitted there is a reason she was seen nodding off at the president's State of the Union address.
The study in Scientific Reports suggests every hour spent using a touchscreen each day was linked to 15 minutes less sleep. However, those playing with touchscreens do develop their fine motor skills more quickly. Experts said the study was "timely" but parents should not lose sleep over it. There has been an explosion in touchscreens in the home, but understanding their impact on early childhood development has been lacking. The study by Birkbeck, University of London, questioned 715 parents of children under three years old. It asked how often their child played with a smartphone or tablet and about the child's sleep patterns. It showed that 75% of the toddlers used a touchscreen on a daily basis, with 51% of those between six and 11 months using one, and 92% of those between 25 and 36 months doing so as well. But children who did play with touchscreens slept less at night and more in the day. Overall they had around 15 minutes less sleep for every hour of touchscreen use. Dr Tim Smith, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: "It isn't a massive amount when you're sleeping 10-12 hours a day in total, but every minute matters in young development because of the benefits of sleep." The study is not definitive, but Dr Smith says it "seems to indicate touchscreens have some association with possible sleep problems". However, his research has also shown toddlers who actively use touchscreens (swiping rather than watching) accelerate their development of motor skills. So should children be given touchscreens to play with? Dr Smith says: "It's very tricky right now, the science is very immature, we are really lagging behind the technology and it's too early to make clear proclamations." He says the best bet is to follow similar rules for the amount of time spent in front of the TV. That means putting a limit on the total time spent on devices, ensuring children still do physical things, ensuring that content is age-appropriate, and avoiding the screens in the hour before bedtime. Dr Anna Joyce, a cognitive developmental researcher at Coventry University, said: "As the first study to investigate associations between sleep and touchscreen use in infancy, this is a timely piece of research. "In light of these findings and what we know from previous research it may be worth parents limiting touchscreen, other media use and blue light in the hours before bedtime. "Until we know more about how touchscreens affect sleep, they shouldn't be banned completely," she added. Prof Kevin McConway, from The Open University, said: "I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over these results, if I still had young children. "The children in this study used a touchscreen for about 25 minutes a day, a child who used a touchscreen for this average length of time would sleep for about 6 minutes less." Follow James on Twitter.	Toddlers who spend time playing on smartphones and tablets seem to get slightly less sleep than those who do not, say researchers.
However, the report concluded there had been "no overarching state conspiracy". Sir Desmond de Silva's review confirmed that agents of the state were involved in the 1989 killing and that it should have been prevented. Mr Finucane's widow, Geraldine, has dismissed the report as a "sham" and a "whitewash". Mr Finucane was shot dead by loyalists in front of his wife and children at his north Belfast home. The review, published on Wednesday, found RUC officers proposed Mr Finucane, 39, be killed, said they passed information to his killers and failed to stop the attack and then obstructed the murder investigation. It also found that an Army intelligence unit, the FRU, "bears a degree" of responsibility because one of their agents, Brian Nelson, was involved in selecting targets. The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Matt Baggott, said the police fully accepted the findings of the report. He offered a "complete, absolute and unconditional" apology to the Finucane family, saying they had been "abjectly failed". He said that in the coming days the PSNI would discuss the report with the Police Ombudsman and the Public Prosecution Service. Pat Finucane review reaction "Pat Finucane's murder should never have happened and it is a catalogue of failing which now needs to be assessed to see whether there are people who can be held accountable," he said. Mrs Finucane said the government had "engineered a suppression of the truth" behind her husband's murder. His family have led a high-profile campaign for a full public inquiry into the murder but Mr Cameron has ruled that out. Mrs Finucane said: "At every turn, it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state, its cabinet and ministers, to the Army, the intelligence services, to itself. "At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed, and defunct agencies found wanting.  Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused. "The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others." The Finucanes did not co-operate with the review and the solicitor's widow said the de Silva report did not tell her much more than she previously knew about the case. Her son, Michael, claimed the government had refused their demand for a full inquiry because it did not want people to be questioned in public. • There were extensive "leaks" of security force information to the UDA and other loyalist paramilitary groups. • There was a failure by the authorities to act on threat intelligence. • Employees of the State and State agents played "key roles" in the murder. • There was a failure to investigate and arrest key members of the West Belfast UDA over a long period of time. • There was a wider "relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice" after the murder had taken place. Sir Desmond found that "senior Army officers deliberately lied to criminal investigators" and that RUC Special Branch "were responsible for seriously obstructing the investigation". The report concluded that Nelson did not provide his handlers with details of the plot against Mr Finucane. It found that MI5 received intelligence two months before the killing that Mr Finucane was under threat but that no steps were taken to protect him. It also found that MI5 helped spread propaganda against Mr Finucane in the years before he was killed. Sir Desmond found that "in 1985 the security service assessed that 85% of the UDA's 'intelligence' originated from sources within the security forces". And he was "satisfied that this proportion would have remained largely unchanged" by the time of Mr Finucane's murder." Sir Desmond de Silva QC carried out the review at the government's request. The Finucanes want a public inquiry as they feared the full truth would not emerge. In his report Sir Desmond said: "A series of positive actions by employees of the state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice. "My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucane's case has left me in no doubt that agents of the state were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder. "However, despite the different strands of involvement by elements of the state, I am satisfied that they were not linked to an over-arching state conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane." Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was strongly critical of the RUC and Army for their conduct in relation to the killing. He said Sir Desmond concluded that there was "no political conspiracy" over the murder but that "ministers were misled". Mr Cameron added that the report found "no evidence whatsoever that any government minister had fore-knowledge of Mr Finucane's murder". He said that on behalf of the government and the whole country he wanted to say to the Finucane family that he was "deeply sorry". Last year, Mr Cameron acknowledged there was state collusion in Mr Finucane's murder and apologised to his family. In the report, Sir Desmond found that an account one of the murderers, Ken Barrett, gave to the BBC Panorama programme about receiving intelligence from the RUC was "essentially accurate". However, he added that some specific allegations made by Barrett against individual officers were not reliable. Former Ulster Unionist MP Lord Maginnis of Drumglass said the apology was "ridiculous". "The reality is that the Finucane family were an IRA family and I can illustrate that by saying that, when I gave that allegation publicly and was being sued for libel, the family retracted and paid my legal expenses," he told the House of Lords. "So let's not fool ourselves about the godfather Finucane, who was killed."	The level of state collusion uncovered by a report into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane is "shocking", Prime Minister David Cameron has said.
Landlord Mr Jones, 46, died at The Blossoms public house in Holyhead on Friday afternoon. Following a stand-off with police on the roof of a neighbouring pub, a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody A family tribute read: "A partner, soul mate, father, brother, uncle and our best friend. We love you." A post mortem examination was carried out on Saturday but North Wales Police say they are not releasing Mr Jones's cause of death yet. Officers have made a specific appeal to speak to people who were on board the number four Arriva Bus which left Bangor bus station at 14:00 GMT on Friday and arrived at Summerhill in Holyhead at about 16:00. Det Chf Insp Iestyn Davies said: "It is understood that the bus was caught in traffic around the Black Bridge area of Holyhead as events at the Blossoms public house were unfolding."	The man whose death at an Anglesey pub sparked a murder investigation has been named as David Jones.
The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers' survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: "Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. "This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. "The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. "On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. "Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. "Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes."	Manufacturers have reported positive business trends, in the latest survey from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce.
Reports on Friday had indicated that search teams found survivors six days after the aircraft crashed. But the country's minister for communication later said the message had been put out before it was confirmed. Thirteen people, including civilians, were on board the Mi-17V-5 helicopter. One of them was a four-year-old child. Venezuela's defence minister tweeted a picture of soldiers around a map on Saturday, adding that the search continued with "optimism and faith" despite adverse conditions. The weather in southern Venezuela, where the helicopter crashed, is currently cloudy and stormy with heavy rain.	Officials in Venezuela say the search for a missing military helicopter is continuing in the country's Amazon region.
Steve Williams, of Flat Iron Heritage, contacted his local MP, Lindsay Hoyle, after families were blocked from visiting the Chorley Pals Memorial Site at Serre-les-Puisieux. He claims they were obstructed by a farmer who owns land near the cemetery. The BBC tried to contact Jean Louis Legrand but could not get a reply. To reach the Pals' Battalions memorial at the Sheffield Memorial Park, which is owned by Sheffield City Council, visitors must use an unmade public right of way that crosses land owned Mr Legrand. The path is owned by the town of Serre whilst the park itself is looked after and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC). The commission's Director General Victoria Wallace said: "We are very concerned about the situation at Serre, and urge any visitors encountering hostility or harassment to report it to the local authorities. "We are working with the French government and local authorities to find long-term solutions, but meanwhile we urge caution when visiting, and we ask visitors not to inflame the situation by ignoring the parking restrictions." The dispute has forced Flat Iron Heritage to cancel visits. Mr Williams, who has been making an annual trip to the area since 2002, said the situation was getting worse. He said it has caused a "great deal of distress" to those travelling to visit the graves of loved ones. Labour MP for Chorley Mr Hoyle has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson asking his department to investigate. Sheffield Memorial Park	Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has been asked to investigate claims that soldiers' relatives have been stopped from visiting their graves in France.
Hitachi is to buy Horizon Nuclear Power, which was intending to build reactors on existing sites at Wylfa, Anglesey, and Oldbury, near Bristol. Hitachi is buying Horizon from Germany's E.On and RWE, which are withdrawing from the UK nuclear market. Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a major step for the UK. "This is a decades-long, multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the UK, that will contribute vital new infrastructure to power our economy. "It will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational, as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the UK's nuclear supply chain. I warmly welcome Hitachi as a major new player in the UK energy sector," he said. By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News Hitachi's acquisition of Horizon Nuclear Power marks the start of a journey. The Japanese company says it wants to invest billions of pounds and create thousands of jobs in the UK, as it helps combat predicted energy shortages in the years ahead. But no firm investment commitment will be forthcoming until the government comes up with a minimum price for nuclear power. And if that price turns out to be too low, there is no guarantee that Hitachi will go ahead with its plans. Nuclear deal still faces hurdles UK engineering companies Babcock International and Rolls-Royce have signed preliminary contracts to join the Hitachi deal, which the Japanese company said should be completed by the end of November. There will then be regulatory issues to clear, but once Hitachi's reactor design is approved by the necessary authorities the company intends to build 6 gigawatts of nuclear capacity, with the first plant generating power in the first half of the next decade. Up to 6,000 jobs are expected to be created during construction at each site, thousands more in the supply chain, and a further 1,000 permanent jobs at both locations once operational. The Horizon venture, based at Brockworth, Gloucester, currently employs about 90 people and was set up in 2009 as part of the drive to meet the UK's carbon reduction goals and secure energy demand as old power plants are decommissioned. But RWE and E.On put the business up for sale in March after Germany's move to abandon nuclear power in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster. A consortium made up of EDF and British Gas-owner Centrica has maintained its interest but the two companies have still to decide whether to build two reactors at Hinckley Point, Somerset. Companies involved in the nuclear industry have expressed caution over entering the UK market. Because of the huge capital costs, stretched over many years, companies want some certainty over how much they might be paid for the electricity generated by their plants. Last week, the chief executive of EDF, Vincent de Rivaz, told MPs that his company needed safeguards from the government that the finances of future nuclear deals would be "fair". Delays over decision-making and financing have led to doubts that new power capacity will come on stream before existing plants go offline. A so-called "energy gap" is likely to lead to rising prices and a greater dependency on gas imports. Earlier this month, the energy regulator Ofgem warned that the UK risks running out of energy generating capacity in the winter of 2015-16. Its report predicted that the amount of spare capacity could fall from 14% now to only 4% in three years. However, the government said that its forthcoming Energy Bill would ensure that there was secure supply. With so many uncertainties still to be resolved, investment in the UK nuclear sector was still a "leap of faith", said George Borovas, head of nuclear projects at global law firm Pillsbury. So, he said, Hitachi's decision was a "significant... vote of confidence in the UK nuclear programme". Hitachi's proposed facilities will use its advanced boiling water technology, which is already used in four reactors in Japan. Mr Borovas said this technology was a "proven success", adding: "This should be very helpful with respect to its licensing in the UK and also opens up the possibility of significant export credit agency and commercial financing from Japan." Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said: "Hitachi bring with them decades of expertise, and are responsible for building some of the most advanced nuclear reactors on time and on budget, so I welcome their commitment to helping build a low-carbon, secure-energy future for the UK." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint called on the government to use this as an opportunity to encourage investment in nuclear research and design. Unions also welcomed Hitachi's move, with Mike Clancy, general secretary designate of Prospect, saying: "The Horizon venture is an important milestone in securing future low-carbon energy generation capacity within the UK and its importance to local and national economies cannot be overstated. "While Hitachi's advanced boiling water reactor design has yet to undergo the UK's generic design assessment approval process, it is a proven technology and therefore any construction in the UK will benefit from lessons learned from its construction in Japan."	The UK's nuclear expansion plans have been boosted after Japan's Hitachi signed a Â£700m deal giving it rights to build a new generation of power plants.
But analysts say high European gas stocks will limit the turbulence. Gas futures climbed by up to 10% in early trading, while the benchmark price for oil rose by more than 2%. Traders are worried about the stability of supplies from Russia, which provides a quarter of Europe's natural gas, half of it through Ukraine. However, a relatively mild winter has reduced demand for heating fuel, with storage levels at the main gas hubs about 20% greater than last year. In Germany, Europe's biggest gas consumer and Russia's largest customer, stocks are at more than 60% of capacity, capable of satisfying 60 days of demand. Russia is Europe's biggest supplier of natural gas, but the continent has been weaning itself off dependence on its neighbour for the last decade. It now imports less than 30% of its natural gas from Russia, compared with 45% in 2003, according to European Union statistics. Europe is also less reliant on the Ukraine link, with improved gas infrastructure now meaning supplies could go via alternative routes in the event of disruption. The Nord Stream pipeline, which goes through the Baltic Sea to Germany, or another route to Germany via Belarus and Poland, are two options. Russian state gas producer, Gazprom, also plans to build another sub-sea pipeline - the South Stream - to bypass Ukraine by 2016. "Low utilisation means Ukraine's gas network is of lesser importance today than in the past," said US market analysts, Bernstein Research, in a note to clients. There are also doubts that Russia could afford to disrupt or cut part of its gas supply to Europe, which is worth almost $100m (£60m) a day. Analysts estimate it accounts for about 3% of Russian economic output. Russia's economy registered disappointing growth of 1.3% last year, and its central bank has lowered its own forecasts, anticipating growth of below 2% until at least 2016. Gazprom said on Monday that supplies to Europe via Ukraine were unaffected, but a previous Russian supply cut to Ukraine caused major disruption across the continent and pushed up prices significantly. In January 2009 Russia turned off the taps to its neighbour in a row over contract prices and accusations that Ukraine had been siphoning off gas meant for European customers. The two-week shutdown, during a very cold spell, resulted in severe disruptions across the continent, with more than a dozen countries without their expected supplies of Russian gas. By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent Energy is at the heart of the commercial links between Russia and the European Union. Russia is the EU's biggest outside supplier of oil, and of coal and gas, which are important fuels for electricity as well as heating. Curtailing that trade is unappealing to both sides. Russia needs the income from its largest export market, and Europe needs the energy - though the timing makes it less vulnerable than it might be. A relatively mild winter is coming to an end, and Europe has healthy gas stocks. But energy is a battleground where neither the EU nor Russia wants to fight. Special report: Energy Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia, who were almost completely dependent on supplies via Ukraine, were left with major shortages. Parts of Europe had to shut down industrial plants and domestic heating systems, find alternative sources of gas or switch energy plants to oil. Slovakia and Bulgaria considered restarting mothballed nuclear reactors. While traders say healthy European gas stocks would limit the impact of another shutdown, any disruption in the current crisis would almost certainly lead to a sharp rise in gas prices. "Shifts in the global energy market have left Russia with less of a grip, but this nonetheless remains important," said Michala Marcussen, an economist at Societe Generale, in a research note. Gazprom has already warned Ukraine that it may increase the gas price for Kiev after the first quarter. "The situation with payments is worrying," said Andrei Kruglov, Gazprom's chief financial officer. "Ukraine is paying but not as well as we would like it to. We are still thinking about whether to extend the pricing contract into the next quarter based on current prices." Concerns about one of Europe's key gas supply routes have had a knock-on effect on other commodities, especially oil, as demand for alternative fuels increased. The benchmark oil price, Brent Crude, rose to a peak of $112.10 per barrel in early trading, its highest since 30 December. Its rise is also due to concerns about oil supplies from Russia, one of the world's largest oil producers, as well as the impact of any disruption in the gas market. "Oil markets are reacting on the potential that the situation could worsen," said Ben Le Brun, a market analyst at OptionsXpress. "I definitely suspect oil will move much higher, if it actually comes to war." Meanwhile, on the gas markets, UK prices for next-month delivery climbed as much as 10%, with German and Dutch prices rising by a similar amount, according to ICE Futures Europe exchange. The unrest in Ukraine also sent the Russian rouble to a record low against the US dollar, prompting Russia's central bank to raise its key lending rate by 1.5%. As a result, the main index of Russian stocks, MICEX, dropped by 11%, with Gazprom shares slumping by 13%.	Gas and oil prices have risen amid fears the Ukraine crisis could have a damaging effect on one of Europe's main energy supply routes.
11 August 2015 Last updated at 19:18 BST Safid has travelled 5,000 miles from his home and is currently one of thousands of migrants living in a camp called the Jungle in Calais, France. It's thought more than 600 child migrants arrived in the UK without their parents last month alone. And Safid told Newsround reporter Martin Dougan that he will do whatever it takes to try and get to Britain soon. Find out why child migrants want to come to the UK	An 11-year-old migrant from Afghanistan has been speaking to Newsround about being separated from his father during a year long trip to try and reach the UK.
The businessman has been at the helm at the St Lawrence Ground since 2008. Last year he clashed with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) when his side were overlooked for promotion after Durham's enforced relegation. Kent were Division Two runners-up, in most seasons normally a promotion spot, but the ECB decided instead to reprieve Hampshire from being relegated. Kennedy said: "I've really enjoyed the challenge of helping the club navigate through some tricky times but I firmly believe Kent cricket is in much better health than it was in 2008. "Last season gave us a glimpse of what could be achieved and I know that the club is in good hands. "I'd like to thank all the members and supporters for their loyalty, patience and understanding and look forward to seeing Kent thrive in all competitions under (head coach) Matt Walker and (captain) Sam Northeast." He added: "Relations with the ECB have been difficult with the advent of T20 discussions, and the battle over promotion and relegation along with various other issues, but I am happy to hand over to a new regime who will continue the work to return Kent to the top table." Under Kennedy, Kent had voted against the ECB's proposed T20 city franchise scheme. His reign saw the club record a £1m improvement in its finances through cost-cutting, and increased sponsorship and ticket revenues. He will leave the club following its AGM on 28 March.	Kent chairman George Kennedy is to leave his position at the Championship Division Two club at the end of March.
Police Scotland were called to investigate at the end of June when Annan Athletic failed to receive an end of season payment from the league. The League Two side were expecting about £18,000 but the funds were paid into a fraudulent account. BBC Scotland has learned that the money has been retrieved and that the police investigation continues. The SPFL said it has been subject to further attempts at hacking and fraudulent activity as recently as this week.	The Scottish Professional Football League is warning clubs to be on their guard against online fraud.
The National Trust is at Rhossili on Saturday, searching for remnants of a village which was engulfed by sand. Recent storms have eroded the cliffs below where the village was located, but there are fears further erosion will mean it will be lost in the sea. Robert Francis-Davies, chairman of Gower Landscape Partnership, said it would be "a coup" to find the remains.	People are being urged to help uncover traces of a 15th Century village on Gower before it is swept out to sea.
An ISI official told the BBC the compound in Abbottabad where Bin Laden was killed by US forces on Sunday had been raided several years ago. But the compound "was not on our radar" since then, the official said. The government of Pakistan has categorically denied any knowledge of the raid before it took place. No base within Pakistan was used by US forces, the ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement. It went on: "US helicopters entered Pakistani airspace making use of blind spots in the radar coverage due to hilly terrain." However, the ministry defended the ISI, saying: "As far as the target compound is concerned, ISI had been sharing information with CIA and other friendly intelligence agencies since 2009." Bin Laden, 54, was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda. He is believed to have ordered the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, as well as a number of other deadly bombings. The ISI official gave new details of the raid, saying Bin Laden's young daughter had said she saw her father shot. He told the BBC's Owen Bennett-Jones in Islamabad that the compound in Abbottabad, just 100km (62 miles) from the capital, was raided when under construction in 2003. It was believed an al-Qaeda operative, Abu Faraj al-Libi, was there. But since then, "the compound was not on our radar, it is an embarrassment for the ISI", the official said. "We're good, but we're not God." He added: "This one failure should not make us look totally incompetent. Look at our track record. For the last 10 years, we have captured Taliban and al-Qaeda in their hundreds - more than any other countries put together." The compound is about a kilometre from the Pakistan Military Academy - the country's equivalent of West Point or Sandhurst. The ISI official also gave new or differing accounts of some of the events of Sunday's raid. They included: The official said it was thought the Americans wanted to take away the surviving women and children but had to abandon the plan when one of the helicopters malfunctioned. By Owen Bennett-JonesBBC News, Islamabad Clearly there were people helping Bin Laden in this location... were they state employees, were they simply from Taliban-related groups, were they from the intelligence agencies? For all Americans may ask the questions, I doubt they will get any answers. There will be ambiguity about this and the Pakistanis will deny they had any knowledge whatsoever. The establishment here is made up of army leadership, intelligence agency leadership and some senior civil servants, and they have always run Pakistan, whether democratic governments or military governments, and those people do have connections with jihadis. The difficulty the West has is in appreciating there are more than 20 different types of jihadi organisations, and al-Qaeda is just one of them. The state has different policies towards different types of group and that subtlety is often lost on Western policy-makers. The helicopter was destroyed by the special forces unit. The US has not commented on anyone it captured or had planned to capture, other than saying it had taken Bin Laden's body. The ISI official said the organisation had recovered some documents from the compound. The CIA is already said to be going through a large number of hard drives and storage devices seized in the raid. The White House has not disclosed whether anyone has claimed the $25m (Â£15m) reward for leading the US to Bin Laden. White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan said there had been concern Pakistani forces would deploy to counter the US Navy Seal team conducting the raid but it had avoided any confrontation. The ISI official said: "We were totally caught by surprise. They were in and out before we could react." Our correspondent says residents near the compound in Abbottabad reported that Pakistani soldiers had asked them to switch off their lights an hour before the attack, but the ISI official said this was not true and that it had no advance knowledge of the raid. Earlier, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post, President Asif Ali Zardari admitted Bin Laden "was not anywhere we had anticipated he would be". But he denied the killing suggested Pakistan was failing in its efforts to tackle terrorism. Mr Zardari said Pakistan had "never been and never will be the hotbed of fanaticism that is often described by the media". "Such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news, but it doesn't reflect fact," he said. "Pakistan had as much reason to despise al-Qaeda as any nation. The war on terrorism is as much Pakistan's war as it is America's." Mr Brennan had said it was "inconceivable that Bin Laden did not have a support system" in Pakistan. He estimated Bin Laden had been living in the compound in Abbottabad for five or six years. Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir tried to draw a line under the matter, saying: "Who did what is beside the point... This issue of Osama Bin Laden is history." Bin Laden was America's most wanted man but had eluded capture for more than a decade. US officials say that after DNA tests they are "99.9%" sure that the man they shot and killed and later buried at sea was Bin Laden. US President Barack Obama watched the entire operation in real time in the White House with his national security team. Mr Brennan said: "The minutes passed like days." CIA director Leon Panetta narrated via a video screen from a separate Washington office, with Bin Laden given the code name Geronimo. Mr Panetta's narration lasted several minutes. "They've reached the target... We have a visual on Geronimo... Geronimo EKIA (enemy killed in action)." Mr Obama said: "We got him." Bin Laden, his son Khalid, trusted personal courier Sheikh Abu Ahmed and the courier's brother were all killed, along with an unidentified woman. Bin Laden was shot above his left eye, blowing away a section of his skull, and was also shot in the chest. The BBC's Andrew North in Washington says the White House is still discussing whether to release a video that was made of Bin Laden's burial from an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, which some Islamic scholars have said did not conform with tradition. Our correspondent says many people will want proof that Bin Laden is dead but the White House will be concerned about the reaction if the video, and still photographs of the body, are released.	Pakistan's main intelligence agency, the ISI, has said it is embarrassed by its failures on al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.
The new offerings include news bulletins from National Public Radio, the BBC and others as well as longer video and audio podcasts and clips. Spotify has more than 60 million regular users across 58 countries. It says about 20% pay for its premium ad-free subscription services. Chief executive Daniel Ek said that represents more than half of the global market in "streaming dollars". The company said it had also taken steps to match the music tracks it suggests to the various activities users engage in throughout their day. This includes a new running mode, which matches music to the pace of the subscriber based on feedback from their smartphone's built-in sensors. The firm said it had also created a new type of audio format that allows a song's tempo to be altered to match a runner's footsteps while keeping it in tune. And it has commissioned new track from composers and DJs including Tiesto, who made a brief appearance at the firm's New York press conference. "If it works, the ability of Spotify to adapt what it plays you as the day progresses is interesting," commented Andy Malt, editor of the music business news service Complete Music Update. "Being faced with a choice of tens of millions of tracks is daunting for a lot of users when they open the app, and while that catalogue is a big sell for the engaged music fans who were streaming's early adopters, it's less appealing to mainstream users. "The less users have to interact the more music the app can serve up to them. Adding non-music content, including podcasts and video, also has the potential to keep users within the Spotify app for longer." One of the new pieces of audio content is BBC Minute - an "alternative" round-the-clock news service, aimed at a youth audience, already offered to other digital platforms. Launched in April, it is a 60 second conversation of shareable news, updated every half hour. In addition, for a year-long period, overseas Spotify users will be able to listen to around 50 speech-only podcasts from BBC stations. "These programmes are already freely available in the UK, so we're running this trial only for overseas users," the corporation said in a statement. "This means we can generate income for the BBC to reinvest in programmes for licence fee payers as well as reaching new audiences across the globe." Disney, the sports network ESPN, the science-tech talks organiser TED, Conde Nast Entertainment and the US TV channels MTV and NBC are among those who have also committed to providing material. Spotify said it would suggest video and audio shows to users based on their past use. The announcement comes less than three weeks before Apple's developers conference, when the iPhone-maker is expected to reveal plans for a streaming music service based on its takeover of Beats Music. Spotify is also facing new competition from Tidal, a music service relaunched by the musician Jay Z and backed by other famous stars. Jay Z said last month that it had signed up 770,000 subscribers. The new services are initially restricted to iPhone users in the US, UK, Germany and Sweden, but will later be extended to other platforms and countries. Streaming may well be the future of music and Spotify may be the future of streaming, as Daniel Ek claims, but the Swedish chief executive faces a twin threat. Apple is about to launch its own music service and will be determined to win back customers lost to Spotify as downloads have stagnated. And the music labels, which have absolute power over the streaming company, have been flexing their muscles, making it clear they could withdraw their artists. So, by offering a new service which is about more than music Spotify hopes to take on Apple by winning over the kind of music fans who also like to snack on YouTube videos or catch up with podcasts. Meanwhile, it will be able to show the music labels that it has other options. But make no mistake, the stakes are high - if customers don't take to the new Spotify, plans for a stockmarket float will go on hold, perhaps forever.	Spotify has announced it is adding more non-music content to its app.
Saints' 3-0 reverse at Everton on Monday completed a difficult Christmas period for Claude Puel's side. But Stephens, who made his Premier League debut at Goodison Park, believes a change of form is on the cards. "We just need that little bit of extra luck, or extra quality to go 1-0 up," he told BBC Radio Solent. "These things happen and we'll bounce back." Stephens, 22, found himself introduced in the sixth minute at Everton, when injury forced Cedric Soares off. "I enjoyed playing the game," he said. "But at the end of the day, I want to win and being on the end of a 3-0 defeat isn't good. "We'll pick ourselves up and work hard and I'm sure it will turn round. I don't think there's too much wrong, it's not a disaster and it's not time to panic."	Southampton defender Jack Stephens has insisted it is "not the time to panic" despite their third defeat in six days.
The influx of migrants has put pressure on the authorities of the northern city to find accommodation. Some migrants are sleeping rough outdoors. Hamburg's law takes effect next week. In a separate development, prosecutors filed charges of inciting racial hatred against a co-founder of the anti-Islamic Pegida movement. The prosecutors in the eastern city of Dresden said they acted after Lutz Bachmann had on Facebook described asylum seekers "trash" and "animals". Pegida (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the  Occident) members have staged a number of rallies in recent months, attracting tens of thousands of people. Meanwhile, a new survey by broadcaster ARD said 51% of people admitted the influx of migrants scared them. It suggests a four-year low in Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity. She has said Germany can accommodate migrants who have genuinely fled war or persecution - a humanitarian gesture towards the many thousands risking their lives to reach Europe this year. But many politicians - including her conservative Bavarian CSU allies and various EU partners - have criticised the open-door policy. How long can Merkel's open-door policy last? Hamburg's new law is described as a temporary, emergency measure. Owners of empty commercial properties will be compensated. The law does not include residential properties. But the conservative opposition in the city, in the north of Germany, condemned the move. The authorities in Bremen, a city just west of Hamburg, are considering passing a similar law. Germany expects to host at least 800,000 asylum seekers this year - about four times the number it had last year. Many are from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. But the thousands arriving also include asylum seekers from Kosovo, Albania and other Balkan countries, whose claims are usually rejected. On Thursday more than 200 migrants fought each other in a mass brawl at a reception centre in Hamburg-Bergedorf. Police said Syrians and Afghans were involved in the latest clash. Similar fights have erupted at some other migrant centres in Germany. A bigger brawl took place near Kassel, in central Germany, at the end of September. In Berlin, Munich, Hamburg and elsewhere the authorities have erected tented camps for migrants - but with winter approaching they are deemed too basic as communal housing. There is hardly any accommodation left in Hamburg for migrants, who are entering the city at a rate of about 500 daily, ARD television reports. The Hamburg region's leftist government - a coalition of Greens, Social Democrats (SPD) and Die Linke - says the new law will be in force until March 2017. Confiscation will only take place if the property owner refuses to hand it over willingly in exchange for compensation. In the Brandenburg region, in eastern Germany, the authorities have halted the demolition of old social housing blocks. Instead they will be refurbished to provide 4,000 flats for migrants, the daily Die Zeit reports. Meanwhile Franconia, in north Bavaria, plans to build cheap modular units to house migrants for 10 years, after which they will be rented out as social housing for locals.	Hamburg has become the first German city to pass a law allowing the seizure of empty commercial properties in order to house migrants.
He made the claim at a rally. His team admitted it was incorrect, only for Mr Trump to repeat it at another rally. The money was paid at the same time US hostages were freed, but the president said it was a payment linked to the landmark Iranian nuclear agreement. Mr Trump said the video he saw was of the hostage transfer, not the payment. The White House announced in January it was making payments to Iran - a total of $1.7bn (£1.3bn) to settle a decades-old dispute over a failed military equipment deal - as part of the nuclear accord. A newspaper this week revealed that $400m of that was delivered in cash, flown to Iran at roughly the same time as four Americans were released in a prisoner exchange. The timing of the transfer brought attacks from Republicans, including Mr Trump. President Barack Obama denied any connection between the cash and the prisoner swap, saying: "We do not pay ransom for hostages." He said the payment had to be in cash because strict financial sanctions precluded other methods. Being Donald Trump means never having to say you're sorry - or mistaken. The candidate has made a habit of steadfastly sticking by comments whose veracity, to put it mildly, has been called into question. For instance, assertions that Muslim-Americans celebrated after 9/11, that neighbours didn't tell authorities they saw the San Bernardino shooters making bombs and that Mexico has a policy of sending criminals into the US have been roundly debunked by fact-checkers, yet all have been fixtures in Trump speeches. This track record makes it noteworthy that on Friday morning Mr Trump backed away from his recent claims that he saw a video of Iranians unloading crates currency from a US plane. Perhaps cooler heads in the Trump camp prevailed. Perhaps Mr Trump realised that his remarkably detailed misstatements were burying what could have been an effective campaign issue - the perception that the Obama administration was exchanging money for hostages. It's become conventional wisdom that there isn't a tactical political advantage - on foreign affairs, Clinton emails, etc - that Mr Trump can't mishandle. Republicans can only hope Mr Trump's backtracking here is a sign of new, more disciplined candidate emerging. However, the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington says it did not help that Iranian defence officials had described the money as a ransom payment. Mr Trump insisted on Wednesday he had seen video showing the money being delivered. His team on Thursday acknowledged this was not the case, saying Mr Trump was referring to cable news file footage of hostages being released. But Mr Trump repeated his claim at another rally later on Thursday. On Friday, his tweet was echoing the campaign team, saying: "The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!" Donald Trump has had a difficult week. His rival, Hillary Clinton, has seen a significant opinion poll boost since the Democratic convention. He has also run into trouble by rowing with the parents of a Muslim US army captain who was killed in Iraq and was criticised for calling Mrs Clinton "the devil". A number of high-profile figures, including Republicans, have come out against him. Republican Congressman Mike Coffman was one to air an anti-Trump advertisement. Former director of the CIA, Michael Morell, not affiliated to either party, said in the New York Times that he would "do everything I can to ensure [Mrs Clinton] is elected our 45th president". Citing Mr Trump's positions on Russia, Mr Morell called the New York billionaire an "unwitting agent" of Vladimir Putin. Endorsed Mrs Clinton Not voting for Mr Trump On Thursday, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan told fundraisers the party had to protect its majority in Congress or "we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank cheque". It echoed the "Let's not give Clinton a blank cheque" phrase used by Republicans in 1996 when it became clear Bob Dole would not defeat Bill Clinton. However, Mr Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, stood firmly behind him on Friday, telling NBC: "Donald Trump and I are standing shoulder to shoulder to say to the American people, 'we can be strong again'."	US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has backtracked on a claim that he saw video footage of a US cash payment to Iran.
Ambulance trusts paid private companies and voluntary organisations £68.7m to attend emergency calls in 2015-6, compared to £22.1m in 2011-2. They respond to all types of calls. NHS England said 999 calls for ambulances rose 4.5% last year. Unions attacked "creeping privatisation" and called for more money for staff recruitment. The ambulance service in England took 861,000 emergency phone calls in March 2016 - which equates to 27,800 a day - compared to 22,400 calls a day in March 2015, a rise of 24%. Contractors include private firms and charities such as St John Ambulance and the British Red Cross. Is the ambulance service at breaking point? Martin Flaherty, of the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, said trusts faced "unprecedented levels of demand" and used private or volunteer services "in support when absolutely necessary... at times of peak demand". £46m per year extra spent on private ambulances since 2011/12 4.5% rise in the number of 999 calls for ambulances over past year £13.6m spent by South Central Ambulance Service on private ambulances in 2014/15 9% of South East Coast Ambulance Service 999 calls were responded to with a private ambulance Of the 11 ambulance trusts, South Central spent the most; £13.6m in the year to April 2016. London spent £11.9m, according to Freedom of Information requests gathered by BBC South East. West Midlands and Isle of Wight said they rarely or never use ambulances from independent providers. East of England gave nine months of data for 2015-16. South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAMB) said private ambulances responded to 9% of its emergency calls last year, at a cost of £10.4m.  The previous year it spent £12.3m. SECAMB operations manager James Pavey said it faced an "extraordinary rise in demand" and had a growing shortage of paramedics. Some trusts, such as London and SECAMB, are now hiring from abroad, including Australia. The College of Paramedics said there were problems recruiting and retaining sufficient staff, who now have to be trained to degree level. College director Richard Webber said: "In the long term, we should not be using private providers in the way we are, but we do need to provide a safe and effective service to the public." "We should employ more people, training and supporting them effectively and providing that as part of the NHS." A Department of Health spokesman said: "We have employed 2,000 more paramedics since 2010 and training an extra 1,900 over the next five years." Unions said money should not be leaving the NHS and called for higher pay to attract staff. Alan Lofthouse, Unison lead officer for ambulance workers said: "It is creeping privatisation, something we are very concerned about. "In the short term people need an ambulance. But in the long term they can not be part of a fully-funded system because there is a profit being made by private companies." Private providers said they were regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and faced more scrutiny than NHS ambulance services. Alan Howson, of the Independent Ambulance Association, said any perception of private ambulances being unsafe was out-of-date. "This is no longer back-street ambulance services providing independent cover. "Quite often, crews from independent ambulance providers perform better than their NHS counterparts and that is also borne out from patient feedback." James Barnes of the Private Ambulance Company, which has a contract for the East of England, said: "There is a strict set of guidelines we have to meet or could be shut down." Using private ambulances to answer 999 calls is just another example of the health service under pressure. The number of calls to ambulances has more than doubled in the past decade to over 9m a year. They are also facing increasing delays at hospital with A&E departments run ragged dealing with the record numbers of patients coming through their doors. Crews find themselves queuing before they can handover their patients. It means the eight minute target for responding to patients is being missed - by a record margin.  Unions say recruitment and retention is a major issue in many services. So bosses are turning to private firms. They are fully regulated and vetted, but the situation is still far from ideal. Read more from Nick Follow Nick on Twitter	NHS spending on private ambulances for 999 calls in England has trebled in four years, BBC research has found.
Steelers coach Paul Thompson said the Devils had an advantage, after their request to rearrange their Elite League game 24 hours before the final was declined. League rules state teams cannot change fixtures within four weeks of a game. The Steelers face Coventry Blaze in the Elite League on Saturday, 4 March. "I know Sheffield have tried to make a big media frenzy out of having to play the night before a game," Kelman told BBC Wales Sport. "But 32 weeks of the year, pretty much, you play two games in a row and I think the fans need to understand that. "We had the foresight to plan not to play the night before a game, they did not and they wanted a rule put in place that you could not cancel a game in four weeks, so I don't feel bad for them at all. Cardiff Devils travel to Manchester on Friday to play Manchester Storm in the Elite League, and two days later take on the Steelers in the final at Ice Arena Wales. "It is advantage to Cardiff because they pulled that move on us that we could not move the game," Steelers coach Paul Thompson said. "It is not fair. It is a cup final, both teams should have the same opportunity so we are a little bit rattled about that, but I hope that comes back and haunts Cardiff." The Devils and the Steelers faced each other in the Challenge Cup final in 2015 and during that match it was the Devils who took the victory, winning 2-1 in the Sheffield Arena. Kelman acknowledged that in the Elite League playing back-to-back games is not uncommon, and the Devils even had to play a game the night before their Challenge Cup final in 2015. "Whatever media circus they want to create over having to play the night before a game - they do it every single weekend just like nine other teams in the league do," Kelman continued. "We are not worried about it and we are not rising to it. We are just focusing on the game. "I don't think the Cardiff Devils are the bad guys for making them obey the rule they put in place, I think it is kind of silly." The Devils are currently top of the Elite League standings on 71 points and will be aiming for their third Challenge Cup trophy on Sunday, after winning the cup in 2006 and 2015. The Welsh side were runners up in the competition in 2016 after losing 1-0 against the Nottingham Panthers.	Cardiff Devils managing director Todd Kelman says the Sheffield Steelers have caused a "media frenzy" ahead of their Challenge Cup final on 5 March.
The proposal, from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, calls on Switzerland to abandon its free movement of people treaty with the European Union and introduce strict quotas on immigration. Switzerland is not a member of the EU, but has adopted large sections of EU policy, including free movement and the Schengen open-borders agreement, in order to have access to Europe's single market. Brussels has always insisted that the Swiss will not be allowed to cherry-pick only the aspects of EU policy they like. But its successful economy, and soaring unemployment in many eurozone countries, make Switzerland a very attractive destination. In 2013, 80,000 immigrants joined Switzerland's population of eight million. To put that in perspective, that would be the equivalent of more than 600,000 people entering the United Kingdom, or more than 800,000 arriving in Germany. "It's getting too crowded," says farmer Martin Haab. "On the roads, on the trains, especially in the cities." Mr Haab's farm is just outside Zurich, sandwiched between a busy railway line and an even busier motorway. "I worry for my son," he explains, "and for my grandchildren. If we have 80,000 people a yearâ€¦ that means in 20 years, 10 million in Switzerland; in 40 years 12 or 13 million - that means the whole of north-west Switzerland will be one big city in the end." But while Mr Haab has genuine fears about overcrowding, he is also a local politician with the Swiss People's Party, and shares its hostility to the European Union, and its determination to crack down on immigration. He would like Switzerland to return to its earlier policy of hiring foreign workers on a temporary or seasonal basis, requiring them to come to Switzerland alone and to return home as soon the specific job they came to do is finished. "With free movement now, we know that only 50% of the immigrants work here," he explains. "The rest are just families." But Mr Haab's view is not shared by many Swiss employers, who claim their success is actually because of, rather than despite, free movement. Stephan Camenzind is director of one of Zurich's most successful architect firms, with orders including a contract to design Google's offices right across Europe. Of his 20 employees, just a third are Swiss, the rest are from the European Union. "We depend on a highly skilled workforce," he explains. "And that workforce we simply can't find in Switzerland, so we do depend on being able to look for talented staff in the European Union." So what would happen if his freedom to do that was restricted by quotas? "Well it's quite simple," he says. "We would have to shrink. We would lose our critical mass to compete globally, so basically there wouldn't be a business anymore." That is a worrying thought for his German employee Claudia Berkefeld, who has worked in the UK as well as Switzerland, and relishes the opportunities offered by free movement of people. "It concerns me in the sense that being able to move around freely and work in Europe [is important], I would find it very limiting if you couldn't do that." EU workers in Switzerland are not the only ones worrying about the consequences of a no vote to free movement of people. Swiss business leaders are anxious too. Jens Atteslander, an economist with the Swiss Business Federation, points out that Brussels has made it very clear that although Switzerland is not in the EU, it cannot simply abandon aspects of EU policy which are unpopular with its citizens, such as free movement, and keep the popular ones, such as access to Europe's single market. "Integration into the single market is absolutely crucial to our economy," he explains. "Over 55% of all our exports go directly to the European single market. We import over 80% from that market. "We got very clear statements from Brussels. They tell us: 'Listen, this is the fundamental principle of the single market, those who do not comply with it do not have access or integration into the single market.' We are here in a closed neighbourhood, we are in the heart of western Europe, so there is no alternative." The latest opinion polls show the referendum on free movement is likely to be very close. Despite the very real economic concerns, despite the fact that unemployment in Switzerland is just 3% and that sectors such as the health service (over a third of staff in Swiss hospitals are foreign) depend on workers from the EU, many voters are swayed by the argument that Switzerland just cannot take any more people. A yes to free movement will mean an open door to EU workers. A yes to quotas could have potentially disastrous consequences for the Swiss economy. But it will also be a signal to Brussels that at least one European country wants to opt out of one the EU's most cherished policies. Whichever way the vote goes, the result will have big implications, for Switzerland and for Europe.	Swiss voters are going to the polls on Sunday in a nationwide referendum on immigration which is being watched closely right across Europe.
Many of the city's roads had been blocked by barricades erected as part of anti-government protests. The wave of demonstrations, which started in San Cristobal almost two months ago, has since spread to the capital, Caracas, and other cities. At least 39 people have been killed in protest-related violence. The head of the National Armed Forces Strategic Operational Command, Gen Vladimir Padrino, said the police and the National Guard had "ended the curfew imposed by terrorists". Gen Padrino said no one had been hurt in the operation to clear the barricades in avenues Carabobo, Ferrero Tamayo and Espana. The governor of Tachira state, where San Cristobal is located, welcomed the operation. Governor Jose Vielma Mora of the governing PSUV party said that "the best present we can give to San Cristobal is the return of our children to school and of our good people to work". The mayor of San Cristobal, Daniel Ceballos of the opposition Popular Will party, was removed from office and sentenced last week to 12 months in prison for failing to order the removal of the barricades. Venezuela's Supreme Court ruled that Mr Ceballos had not only failed to guarantee public order but had lent his support to groups engaging in violent protests. The current wave of unrest started in San Cristobal on 4 February, when students took to the streets to protest against the alleged attempted rape of a university student. After the arrest of dozens of student leaders, the protests spread to Caracas and were joined by Venezuelans disgruntled by the country's high homicide rate, skyrocketing inflation and frequent shortages of staple foods. There have been almost daily demonstrations since, mainly in San Cristobal and Caracas, but also in other cities, such as Valencia and Merida. At least 39 people, among them both government and opposition supporters, have died in incidents linked to the protests. The government says "fascists" backed by foreign agents are behind the unrest, while the opposition accuses the security forces of using excessive force. Attorney General Luis Ortega said on Friday that her office was investigating 81 cases of alleged human rights violations. She said 17 police and military officers had been detained in connection with the allegations. The demonstrations are the largest in a decade and many of the protesters say they will not give up until the government resigns. Government supporters have also been holding rallies to show their backing of President Nicolas Maduro and his administration.	A top Venezuelan military commander says the security forces have retaken control of the streets in the western city of San Cristobal.
The company will allow advertisers to see whether online ad campaigns generate offline sales. Announcing the service, Google said that it captures around 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the US. Critics said it represented another blow to privacy. Google also announced a separate monitoring product in a blogpost, saying: "For the first time, Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and cross-channel - all in one place." The company has vast amounts of data on net users, from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search which combine details about the ads displayed on devices with what has been searched for in Google. Google can also collect location information from phones, allowing it to work out when a user has seen an ad, and whether they have searched for the product advertised and gone to an offline shop to buy it. It introduced store visit measurements back in 2014, using the location data on mobiles to track when people visited a store. "In under three years, advertisers globally have measured over five billion store visits," it said. It added that Google's "third-party partnerships" already capture approximately 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the US, but did not reveal who the partners were or how information was captured. Google will not have access to the details about what individuals spend - instead they learn the value of all purchases in a certain time period. "While we developed the concept for this product years ago, it required years of effort to develop a solution that could meet our stringent user privacy requirements," a spokesman said. "To accomplish this, we developed a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous." "What's really fascinating to me is that as the companies become increasingly intrusive in terms of their data collection, they also become more secretive," Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center told the Washington Post. The measurement of store sales will be aggregated and anonymised and no location data will be shared with advertisers. Users can opt out of the service by going to their ads setting page and unchecking the box that says: "Also use Google Account activity and information to personalise ads on these websites and apps and store that data in your Google Account". Users can also disable personalisation for all Google ads. And they can pause or delete their location history. The service is currently limited to the US - and would likely hit barriers if it was rolled out in Europe, privacy campaigners say. The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation aims to tighten the ways online firms use and collect data and will require online firms to get explicit consent from consumers about data use. "The one thing people regularly state as 'creepy' online is when an advert follows them around the internet.  These plans appear to extend 'creepy' into the physical world," said Renate Samson from Big Brother Watch. "If people want to avoid having their shopping habits monitored on the high street by Google, by shops or by banks they should restrict the amount of data they hand over. "Companies track and monitor in order to advertise to us. If we don't want them to do that, take control; don't give your email address for a digital receipt, check the terms and conditions, avoid using loyalty cards and where possible choose to pay with cash."	Google is planning to track billions of credit and debit card sales to compare online ad clicks with money spent offline.
Scientists found that even the lowest expected levels of warming could decimate populations. However the researchers found that restoring connections between butterfly habitats could help modify the worst impacts. The research has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Although many people believe that butterflies are creatures that love the warmth, periods of extremely hot and dry weather can significantly reduce populations. In this study, British researchers looked at the impact of an extreme drought event in 1995 on butterfly species. This was the most arid summer since records began in 1776. They identified six species, including the Cabbage White and the Speckled Wood butterflies, that were particularly sensitive to heat. They then looked at what might happen to these creatures under different levels of warming up to 2100. If emissions of carbon dioxide continue on a "business as usual" model,  and warming is more extreme, then extinctions of some of these species could begin in England as early as 2050. "We looked at the extent to which populations crashed from the drought and how long it takes them to recover," said lead author Dr Tom Oliver from Nerc Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. "What we're asking is, as droughts become more frequent whether the return time of the drought was more frequent than the recovery of the butterflies." "And when that was the case you'd get this gradual population erosion and in those places you'd get local extinctions." The researchers say that areas of the south east of England would be worst affected. However they argue that under less extreme warming conditions, changes to butterfly habitats could ameliorate the worst impacts. The team found that restoring connections between habitats that have been fragmented by human activities such as agriculture, was capable of making a big difference. Under a low emissions scenario, bridging these connections could improve the probability of butterfly survival by 50%. "If our habitats are very fragmented,  the impacts will be much more severe. In places where it isn't those populations might persist," said Dr Oliver. "It allows us to buy time until we get those global emission cuts in place." The researchers believe their study is a conservative estimation of how warming might impact these fragile species. They are concerned that, because of landscape changes in the UK throughout the 20th century, populations of some of the threatened species might be too low for them to recover from frequent droughts. The authors say that even people who are not impressed by the aesthetic appeal of butterflies should still be concerned about their demise. "Butterflies are important culturally as part of our natural heritage, but there are other functions that could be impacted by their extinction including pollution, pest control and decomposition of waste," said Dr Oliver. "Those un-swayed by the beauty and importance of having butterflies in the countryside ought to be concerned about the disruption to these functions provided by these species."

Land and Housing Minister Anna Tibaijuka had not shown "due diligence" when she took the money, he said. Ms Tibaijuka, a former UN official, denies any wrongdoing. She is a high-profile casualty in a corruption scandal that has rocked Tanzania's government and energy firms, straining relations with donors. On 17 December, Attorney-General Frederick Werema resigned after MPs accused him of authorising the fraudulent transfer of about $120m to an energy firm. He denied the allegation, but said he was stepping down because the controversy had "disrupted the country's political atmosphere". Mr Kikwete, in a televised address, said the government was still investigating allegations of impropriety against Energy and Minerals Minister Sospeter Muhongo and his permanent secretary Eliakim Maswi. The president's office later said that Mr Maswi had been suspended, pending the outcome of the probe. Ms Tibaijuka rejected parliament's call for her resignation, saying the $1m was a donation for a school where she serves as the main fundraiser. She accepted it in good faith and presented it to the school, she said. However, Mr  Kikwete said he had dismissed her because "one of the biggest questions raised is why this money was not paid directly to the school and was instead deposited in a personal bank account in her name," Reuters news agency quotes him as saying. Ms Tibaijuka was the executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, before she became an MP and government minister in 2010. Tanzania's parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, has been putting pressure on Mr Kikwete to sack top officials accused of siphoning government money in collusion with businessmen linked to the energy sector. An investigation by a parliamentary watchdog committee found that about $120m had been taken from an escrow account, paid to an energy firm and then given to various government ministers. A group of 12 donors - including Japan, the UK, the World Bank and the African Development Bank - decided in October to withhold about $490m until the government took action over the alleged corruption. Mr Kikwete took office in 2005 with a promise to tackle corruption in government.	Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete has fired a senior government minister accused of wrongly taking $1m (Â£640,000) from a businessman.
The visitors, managed by former Burton boss Gary Rowett, pinned the Brewers back in the opening exchanges. But Jackson Irvine then tested Blues keeper Adam Legzdins before former Birmingham loan signing Lloyd Dyer put Burton ahead with a superb finish. Jamie Ward volleyed the second, before skipper Michael Morrison headed Blues' best chance wide from a late corner. Burton's second victory in nine league games lifts Nigel Clough's side six places to 13th in the Championship, while Birmingham remain fifth after only their third defeat of the season - but their second on successive Fridays. The home side initially struggled to get out of their own half, creating their first clear chance when former Burton keeper Legzdins used his legs to deny Irvine after former Aston Villa trainee Ward flicked on. Northern Ireland international Ward then provided the pass for 34-year-old Dyer to run onto, and he gave the Blues keeper no chance with the outside of his left foot. Ward forced Legzdins to a smart near-post save after outsmarting Ryan Shotton, but benefitted from a marginal offside decision to drive home the second as Burton made it six games unbeaten in matches played on Friday evenings. Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby: "Quite often this season we haven't got what we deserved but tonight we could have won by more than two. That is the next stage for us, to really get the results that our performances deserve. "Psychologically, it is important for us to try and stay out of the bottom three if we can. It is going to be a battle to do that but nights like tonight undoubtedly help. "Jamie Ward has made one and scored one. That is what we brought him in for - that little bit of quality. The balance between him and Chris O'Grady is important. "Chris is working his socks off up there. He is such a great team player and appreciated by everyone in the dressing room." Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett told BBC WM: "We were very poor but Burton thoroughly deserved it. They showed a bit more energy and drive on a difficult evening for us. "Derby and Sheffield Wednesday have found out the hard way here too. Nigel has got a good side, who play with real forward impetus and quality. They'll turn a lot of teams over here, playing like that. "For the first 15 or 20 minutes, the game panned out how we wanted and we exploited the spaces. But then they got back into it, worked what we were doing and started to pin us back with their wing-backs. "After that we didn't play with anywhere near enough quality. We're going to have to be a lot better than that against Aston Villa next week." Match ends, Burton Albion 2, Birmingham City 0. Second Half ends, Burton Albion 2, Birmingham City 0. Attempt blocked.

Yorkshire, Lancashire and Derbyshire have been worst affected, after 2-5cm fell overnight, with 10cm reported on higher ground. Passengers waiting to depart Manchester Airport have reported being stuck on the runway for hours due to a lack of de-icers. Leeds Bradford Airport suspended all morning flights but has since reopened. Manchester Airport reported "minor delays to departing aircraft" -  but passengers told the BBC they had been stuck on board outbound flights. Shirley Hale said her Jet2 flight to Tenerife had been waiting to depart for over four hours. "We have been told that there are not enough de-icers at the airport," she said. The airport apologised and said de-icing was the responsibility of airlines and their ground teams. More than 100 schools were closed across East Lancashire and Oldham, with 80 shut in West Yorkshire. BBC Weather said Buxton in Derbyshire saw up to 17cm of snow, the deepest measured on Friday. The avalanche risk in the Peak District was currently extremely high, Buxton Mountain Rescue Team said. Parts of Staffordshire have been affected, with several centimetres of snow reported in Flash, England's highest village. Commuters have been urged to allow extra journey time, and the Met Office has issued snow and ice warnings. More on the snow and other stories in West Yorkshire Weather updates for Lancashire and Greater Manchester BBC Weather presenter Kay Crewdson said conditions were due to slowly improve into Saturday. Molly Greenwood reported 10cm of snow in the Huddersfield area. "Don't think I'm going anywhere," she said. Zulfi Hussain said the snow was causing "traffic chaos" in Woodhall Road, Calverley, near Leeds. Elliott Hudson, another West Yorkshire resident, said: "Looks like I have woken up in Narnia." West Yorkshire's Liversedge FC, who have had to cancel every home game for the last four months due to bad weather, tweeted a picture of snow with the caption: "It's not looking good for Liversedge FC's home game with Worksop Town tomorrow." The A628 Woodhead, A57 Snake Pass and A537 Cat and Fiddle roads are all affected, with delays reported on the M65 motorway. Highways England said the A57 eastbound in Great Manchester is closed between M67/A560 and B6174  due to severe weather conditions. It said teams were working to clear the road. Tony Hallwood, from Leeds Bradford Airport, said it reopened at about 09:00 GMT after crews used ploughs to clear snow from the runway. He said: "We are asking passengers to make their way to the airport as early as they can given the difficult conditions." Bus operators are also reporting delays to all services across West Yorkshire. Oldham Council has said 48 schools had closed this morning as a result of the snow and severe weather. Drivers are also being asked to take extra care after snow fell overnight in some parts of Northern Ireland. A Met Office yellow warning for ice and snow in northern England and Wales ended at 15:00.	Heavy snowfall has caused travel disruption in parts of northern England.
Albert Anthony Smith McDonald, 58, was found with head injuries on Cumbernauld Road, Riddrie, at 21:25 on Monday. He died on his way to hospital. Officers said the car driver is assisting with their inquiries. Police said Mr McDonald's family were "completely devastated" by his death and appealed for information. Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie said earlier: "We are following up several lines of inquiry, including speaking to local residents and accessing CCTV from around Cumbernauld Road and the surrounding area." She added that "Mr McDonald had significant injuries" when he was found and the investigating team was "trying to establish just how he sustained them". She said officers were trying to piece together his last known movements. "Understandably his family and friends are completely devastated, and specialist officers are providing them with support at this tragic time," she said. "It is imperative we find who is responsible for Albert's death. "I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of Cumbernauld Road around 21:30 or earlier, and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward to police." Det Ch Insp McLuckie added: "You may think that the information you have is insignificant however it may be the piece of information we are looking for."	Police investigating the murder of a man who was found seriously injured on a Glasgow street have traced the driver of a car seen near where he was found.
2 December 2016 Last updated at 18:32 GMT We look back at the 22-year rule of the controversial and outspoken leader.	Gambia's Yahya Jammeh, who once said he would rule the country for "one billion years", has lost the presidential election to property magnate Adama Barrow.
The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups. It also bans "wrong" information, including disputed international borders. The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law. The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography. Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (Â£10.4m). It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it. It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India "which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India. The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering "value added" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber. It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months. There is an exemption for government agencies and departments. Google already offers slightly altered versions of its maps inside India, eliminating the Line of Control that divides Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and locating the whole disputed region within India's borders. Both Google and Uber declined to comment. The laws extend beyond large international companies. Anyone creating, distributing, or owning unsanctioned maps must apply to a government agency for a licence, and submit the material for inspection. The geospatial data will then be considered by a security vetting committee, which will decide if the applicant is granted a licence. Once the material is cleared, it must be watermarked with the insignia of the vetting authority. "It's only a draft proposal before the country," the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said in a tweet. "I would appeal not to pass hasty judgment, but put up your suggestions." Speaking to the Economic Times, he said: "It is a general concern being raised that India as a responsible country must have provisions to secure its boundary and territory. "That is why the bill is necessary. "It is not a question of sending a message to any firm or company - but it is a question of addressing our own security concern." In a country where the number of people owning a mobile phone is rocketing, providing online maps is a big and growing business. If this bill goes through, no-one, from Google to the smallest business, will be able to run their map services in India without a licence. The government will control how anyone uses online maps. When I want to book a cab using a taxi app service, I'm sharing my location with the service to find a cab. The driver uses a map to navigate. When I take a picture and upload it with metadata, I'm creating mapping information that would require a licence. A growing protest online, with the hashtag "#savethemap", claims the bill won't just hurt individuals, but also small businesses. Campaigner Sumandro Chattapadhyay says companies such as Uber and Google will survive by getting all their maps vetted by the government. "But smaller companies have no means to know what kind of geospatial information they can store and what they cannot," she says. "Moreover, if a start-up requires three months to get approvals for your data before you can use it, it'll be as good as dead." The bill also bans the publication of such material outside the country, and is designed to apply to citizens of India living and working in other countries, explicitly stating offenders outside India will be subject to the same penalties. "This act needs to be dropped," said managing editor Arup Dasgupta, in a post on Geospatial World magazine's website. "This act does not, in fact cannot, even begin to comprehend the paradigm shift in geospatial technologies which makes it a non-starter. "India does need a geospatial information act, but it has to be an enabling and encouraging act that makes for faster and better implementation of programmes, not a regressive and punitive act as the proposed one," he said. The bill is still in the draft stage, and government is inviting submissions on it until 4 June.	India is introducing legislation to ban maps or satellite images of the country unless they are approved by government.
Commuters posted pictures of themselves wading through water outside New Malden station on Thursday evening. Thames Water said the flooding was caused by a burst water main on Coombe Road. It apologised to customers but said it could not estimate how many people were affected. Police and London Fire Brigade attended the scene, while trains were not stopping at the station. A Thames Water spokesman said: "We are sorry to anyone affected by the flooding in the New Malden area and to any customers who may be experiencing low pressure or no water. "Our engineers are on site and are working to isolate the burst pipe and stop the leak."	A burst water main has caused flooding outside a south-west London station.
The pop legend lost his cool during his performance at Gloucester's Kingsholm Stadium on Sunday. The steward incurred John's wrath for trying to stop people with cheaper tickets blocking the view of concert-goers at the front who had paid more. But sorry turned out not to be the hardest word, with John later getting her on stage and apologising. Stewards at the stadium, which is the home of Gloucester Rugby, were faced with the problem of some people moving to the front and blocking the view of others at the gig, which was supposed to be seated. The lack of crowd control has been criticised by fans, but promoter Marshall Arts, which was responsible for the stewarding, refused to comment about it. During the concert, the legendary singer-songwriter told the stewards to "lighten up". He told them: "These people have come here to hear music so if they want to put their hands in the air, let them." In an expletive-laden rant, John went to say it was "not China" and he picked out a female steward, telling her: "You put a uniform on and you think you're Hitler - well you're not." Moments later the woman could be seen on the big screen walking away from the stage area, while people cheered the Rocket Man writer's outburst. Steven Ward, from Tewkesbury, who attended the event, said: "This [concert] was seated, there were disabled people who were sat on our aisle who couldn't see, obviously they couldn't stand up to see the stage. "There were people fighting to get a view of what they were trying to look at and, for some reason, the stewards brought out barriers to try and stop people, but that made them worse because they congregated by the barrier." Gloucester Rugby's commercial manager, Mike Turner, said: "The Elton John concert is a stadium hire so Elton brings on his own stewards. "Our stewards man the corporate areas and everything else is manned by the production company Elton uses. "The stewards did their best to bring the concert back to how it should be." A spokesman for Marshall Arts said the concert had been a great success but she would not comment on any aspect of the stewarding, which she said was subcontracted to another company.	Sir Elton John likened a steward to Hitler as she tried to stop crowds from surging forward during a gig.
The dairies operation, which processes and distributes milk, is being sold to Germany's Mueller for Â£80m. It comes as profits at the UK's largest dairy food company fell 95% to Â£900,000 in the six months to September. Dairy Crest processes and delivers around 1.3 billion litres of milk a year for retailers and homes. Dairy Crest said in a statement that the deal was in the best interests of consumers, customers and dairy farmers. The dairies business accounts for about 70% of the company's revenues, which rose 1% to Â£682.1m during the six months. After the sale, which still needs shareholder approval and could take several months, Dairy Crest will focus on its profitable cheese and spreads operations. There are about 14,000 dairy farmers in the UK, producing 3.3 million litres a day. However, with milk prices having fallen, there has been much debate about whether the economics of the industry are sustainable. Investors approved of the Dairy Crest's decision to get out of a loss-making sector, sending its shares 10% higher in morning trading on Thursday. Muller said the deal would lead to lower costs and larger exports of dairy products made in the UK. Ronald Kers, chief executive of Muller UK & Ireland, said: "We are concerned that the dynamics of the UK fresh milk market are unsustainable for dairy processors in the mid to long term and this acquisition will allow us to reduce our costs, increase our efficiencies and invest in the future." Under the deal, Mueller's UK division - Muller Wiseman Dairies - will take over factories at Foston, in Derbyshire, Chadwell Heath, in Essex, and Severnside, near Gloucester. The deal also includes the Hanworth glass bottling site in Middlesex, where Dairy Crest is consulting with employees on the site's future, and 72 depots. Muller bought Robert Wiseman in 2012.	Dairy Crest, maker of Cathedral City cheese and Country Life butter, has announced a big slump in profits and the sale of its milk business.
Mr Cowen had to deny being drunk or hungover during the RTE interview. The taoiseach was interviewed live from his party's conference, which is taking place in Galway. On Wednesday he said: "I'm sorry that it emerged in the quality it did. There was a hoarseness in my voice throughout the day yesterday." He added: "It wasn't my best performance and I would like to apologise for that. "I would hate to think the reputation of the country or the office of taoiseach would in any way be affected by what I had to say." Mr Cowen again denied any suggestions he was hungover. "The assertions made subsequent to it were without justification, without foundation, were not correct, were not true," he said. Mr Cowen had attended the Fianna Fail party dinner at the Ardilaun Hotel in Galway on Monday night. Following the interview, the finance spokesman for the Republic's opposition claimed there were concerns over the leadership of the country. "There was a feeling this morning that this can't continue, the game is up," said Fine Gael's Michael Noonan. Simon Coveney, also of Fine Gael, who said in a Twitter message on Tuesday that Mr Cowen sounded "half-way between drunk and hungover" in the interview, has said he accepted the taoiseach's apology. Mr Coveney said that he believed Mr Cowen, but added that he did not regret his previous tweet. He said it took "a big person to apologise when big mistakes are made as was the case yesterday morning and the Taosieach should be recognised for that."	Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen has admitted that a controversial radio interview he gave on Tuesday was not his "best performance".
This edition in Lillehammer is only the second of its kind, with the first coming in Innsbruck in 2012. Over 10 days about 1100 athletes from 70 countries, aged between 15 and 18, will compete in 15 sports disciplines. Lillehammer 2016 will use many venues refurbished from the 1994 Winter Olympics, while Oslo, which is more than 100 miles away, will host the halfpipe events. The ethos of the Youth Olympics is cultural education and personal development, as well as an early introduction to the multi-sport environment, At Lillehammer 2016 the Sjoggfest [culture festival] offers athletes about 150 cultural and adventure experiences, such as ice climbing, parkour and live music acts. There are 70 gold medals at stake within the 15 disciplines at Lillehammer. Events familiar to Winter Olympic schedules, such as alpine skiing or speed skating, are part of the Games. But there are also some new formats on display in Norway. Alongside the regular ice hockey team format, there is an ice hockey skills challenge event where the individual must demonstrate their prowess with the skates, stick and puck in six different skill areas. In bobsleigh, rather than standard two-man or four-man bobs, the Olympians will compete in the monobob - where a single athlete rides by his or herself. And curling in Lillehammer will have not only mixed team curling - comprising a foursome of two boys and two girls from the same nation - but also a mixed doubles event, where boys and girls from different countries will pair up and compete together. The British Olympic Association has sent a team of 16 athletes to take part in alpine skiing, bobsleigh, curling, freestyle skiing, ice hockey skills challenge, luge and skeleton. This team size is down from the 23 who took part in Innsbruck in 2012. The youngest member of the team is Verity Lewis, who will be a month past her 15th birthday on Friday.  She is Team GB's ice hockey skills challenge competitor. Leading team GB is chef de mission, Adam Pengilly, a former GB skeleton athlete who competed at the Winter Olympics in 2006 and 2010. Winter Olympics bronze medallist curler Claire Hamilton is with the team in the role of youth ambassador. GB's best medal hopes appear to lie in the sliding sports. In monobob, 17-year-olds George Johnston and Kelsea Purchall are both ranked number one in the world. Another monobob athlete, 17-year-old Annabel Chaffey, was also ranked top in the world at the end of the 2014-2015 season. Also in medal form at the sliding centre is Ashleigh Pittaway in the skeleton. The Munich-born 15-year-old won four qualifying races for Lillehammer 2016 and took her first senior bronze medal at the European Cup in Konigssee, Germany, in January. Developing young people is one part of the Winter Youth Olympics, but nurturing the next batch of senior level Olympians is also an objective. From Innsbruck 2012, Team GB included the freestyle skier, Katie Summerhayes, who went on to compete at the Sochi Winter Games two years later. She then became the first British woman to win a freestyle skiing World Championship medal when she took silver in the 2015 slopestyle event. As well as Summerhayes, Jazmin Sawyers was part of the silver-winning bobsleigh team in Innsbruck. However, she subsequently returned to her track and field roots, where she won another silver - this time in the long jump at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.	The Winter Youth Olympic Games are a relatively new event.
Multiplication was a "very important" part of a child's mathematics knowledge, Mr Gibb said. Plans for such a test were in the Conservatives' election manifesto. Proposals to test 11-year-olds on their times tables were first announced by former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan in January 2016. However, the move was put on hold when her successor, Justine Greening, said there would be no new national tests or assessments introduced before the academic year 2018-19. Appearing before the Commons Education Select Committee on Wednesday, Mr Gibb confirmed the times table check would now go ahead. He told MPs: "I think it is an issue of policy. It is my view that there should be a multiplication check. "It was in our manifesto in 2015. We think times tables are a very important part of mathematical knowledge." If a child was trying to perform long multiplication or long division they needed to know their times tables, he added. "It's why it was in our manifesto," Mr Gibb said. "It's why we are introducing a multiplication check in 2018-19." The check will be taken by Year 6 pupils in the spring of 2019 - the cohort currently in Year 4 - alongside their national curriculum tests, known as Sats tests. Responding to the news, Anne Watson, emeritus professor of mathematics education at the University of Oxford, expressed concern for pupils who struggled with the test. "My main concern is what he [Mr Gibb] has in mind for the children who do not pass the test. "This group will include children with undiagnosed dyslexia, test anxiety, possibly some with slower physical response if this is a timed test, and might even include those who have perfectly good and fast methods of retrieval that do not fit with the test design. "If this is to lead to retesting ad nauseam until it is passed, what mathematics is going to be missed meanwhile and how much dislike of mathematics is going to be generated?" Russell Hobby, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: "We are extremely disappointed that the government are determined to push ahead and implement the multiplication check. "It is both unnecessary and un-costed and won't tell teachers or parents anything that they don't already know." Giving evidence to the same panel of MPs before Mr Gibb,  a senior official for the exams watchdog, Ofqual, answered questions about two security breaches that affected last summer's primary school tests. In the first, a version of the Key Stage 1 (five- to seven-year-olds) literacy test was published online, containing live test words. In the second case, the answers to a spelling, punctuation and grammar test due to be taken by 11-year-olds appeared on a website, where they remained in a password-protected area for several hours before being removed. Dr Michelle Meadows, Ofqual's executive director for strategy risk and research, told the committee: "We asked ourselves this very question, if we had been monitoring delivery more closely, would we have spotted what were essentially human errors, and we came to the conclusion that we probably wouldn't have." Ofqual attended meetings about the tests and scrutinised documents to do with their implementation, she said. "Would we have spotted occasional human error, if you take it in the context of the annual cycle of assessment that's year on year for the whole cohort? We suspect not," she said.	Pupils in England will sit a times tables check, from 2019, at the end of their primary years, Schools Minister Nick Gibb has confirmed.
The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. The White House said North Korea should "focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations". The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. "We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made," he said. "We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments." Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009. Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year. A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex. But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there. The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons "in quality and quantity". It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with "nuclear weapons any time". However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear. Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim. North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces. The two Koreas remain technically at war, because the 1950-1953 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.	The US has warned North Korea to refrain from "irresponsible provocation" after the communist state said its main nuclear facility had resumed normal operations.
Fellow Briton Stephen Cummings won the final stage from Le-Pont-de-Claix to Superdevoluy, but it was Froome who added to his 2013 and 2015 titles. The Team Sky rider had opened a 21-second lead heading into stage seven and held out to win by 12 seconds from Frenchman Romain Bardet. Froome won the Tour de France after both his previous Dauphine successes. This year's edition begins on 2 July. The 31-year-old had to survive some nervous moments in the final 15km on Sunday, as Spaniard Alberto Contador launched several accelerations on the penultimate climb. Bardet also tried his chances on a rapid descent between the final two climbs but Froome chased down every attack. Cummings, 35, was the last of a 20-man breakaway group to wilt and finished well clear of the chasing pack. Ireland's Dan Martin won the sprint for second with Bardet third, and both moved up a place in the overall standings thanks to the bonus points available on the line. Tasmanian Richie Porte, who started the day second, was caught out in the uphill sprint finish and lost two places. Meanwhile, Froome's Team Sky team-mate Geraint Thomas is 17th overall in the Tour de Suisse after finishing three seconds behind stage-two winner Peter Sagan. Stage seven result: 1.

25 February 2015 Last updated at 00:03 GMT The company behind the development, Tekever, said the technology could in the short term be used to enable people with restricted movement to control aircraft. Longer term the firm said piloting of larger jets, such as cargo planes, could be controlled in this way without the need for a crew on board. However, one aviation expert told the BBC he thought the industry would be unlikely to adopt such technology due to a perception of being potentially unsafe. Drone specialist Tekever, which works with security firms, police forces and the military, adapted existing Electroencephalography (EEG) technology so it could issue instructions to the software used to give the unmanned drone instructions. EEG works by detecting activity in specific parts of the brain. After several months of training, "pilots" are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down, which in turn steers the drone left or right. "We believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running," said Ricardo Mendes, Tekever's chief operating officer. "We truly believe that Brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions, and we're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products." In the future, some of this technology may be put to use to control much larger aircraft, although Mr Mendes acknowledged considerable challenges with both regulatory hurdles and public confidence. Those concerns were echoed by John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant based in London. "This to me is certainly at the moment a bridge too far," he told the BBC. "You could get someone radically-minded who might say it, but I'd be surprised if anyone would do it." Mr Strickland said the airline industry was instead focusing its innovation efforts towards things like better materials and more economical engines. Mr Mendes said the technology would incorporate safety measures to counteract the effects of someone having, for example, a seizure while piloting. "There are algorithms on board that prevent bad things from happening," he told the BBC. He added: "Technology is evolving, regulations are evolving. [Unmanned jets are] obviously going to happen. The question is not if, it's when."

At least 17 US-based and local groups receiving foreign funding were targeted, according to activists and Egyptian state media. An official said at least one of the US-based groups was operating without proper permits. The US state department said it was "very concerned" and urged authorities to stop the "harassment" of NGO staff. Some civil society activists have reported that employees were prevented from leaving while searches continued. "This is not appropriate in the current environment," state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, adding that senior US officials had been in touch with Egyptian military leaders to express their concern over the raids. Egypt's military has vowed to investigate how pro-democracy and human rights organisations are funded and has said repeatedly it will not tolerate foreign interference in the country's affairs. "The public prosecutor has searched 17 civil society organisations, local and foreign, as part of the foreign funding case," official news agency Mena cited the prosecutor's office as saying. "The search is based on evidence showing violation of Egyptian laws including not having permits." The US-based groups targeted include the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), loosely associated with the US Democratic and Republican parties. 'Guardians of freedom' Documents and computers have been seized as part of the investigations and one report said that the IRI's doors had been sealed with wax. Julie Hughes, Cairo Director of the NDI, told the BBC about 14 members of the security forces had turned up at its offices. "They came in and asked all of us to gather together in a room, to leave the laptops on our desks, and open and accessible," she said. "They went around the room from computer to computer looking through files and then gathering up those computers, and then about four and a half hours later they left." Both pro-democracy groups, who say they take a neutral political stance, run programmes to train members of nascent political parties in democratic processes. The Arab Centre for the Independence of Justice was also among those being investigated, its head, Nasser Amin, told AFP. Civil society groups have responded angrily to the raids. "[Former President Hosni] Mubarak's regime did not dare to undertake such practices prior to the uprising," the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said in a statement. The group said the authorities were "aiming to intimidate activists and rights advocates, gag their mouths and freeze their activities in support of human rights and against repression and torture". Nobel peace laureate and Egyptian reformist Mohamed ElBaradei said any attempt to stifle such groups would surely backfire. "Human rights organisations are the guardians of nascent freedom. Efforts to suffocate them will be a major setback," he wrote on his Twitter account.	Egyptian soldiers and police have raided the offices of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Cairo.
Goals from Ellen White and Rachel Yankey set up a game against France in Leverkusen on Saturday. "We had a game plan, the girls implemented it, we've topped the group and it can only increase our confidence," Powell told BBC Sport. "We were very, very good and I'm so proud of how well the girls played." England needed to avoid defeat against Japan to be sure of reaching the last eight. They got off to the perfect start when White's lob put them ahead after 15 minutes, with Yankey's clever finish in the second half wrapping up the points. "The ambition was to get out of the group," added Powell. "We're still in the competition, we're not going home and that is brilliant for England. "We made some changes to the team and they worked out, but we always knew it was going to be a squad game. Our opponents from now on doesn't matter. "Sophie Bradley was enormous, Jess Clarke did a job in the first half, we changed a few things and the girls did really well." White, who impressed throughout the game and could have had a second goal when her acrobatic volley was tipped over, admitted scoring was a dream come true. "It's indescribable, the feeling of scoring in a World Cup," said White. "It's the pinnacle of your career to play in this tournament. "I don't know what came over me for that," she said of her near-miss. "I was pretty unlucky but I'm pleased I got on the scoresheet to help the team. "We stuck together as a team and implemented the game plan, which we try and do every game but this one really worked. "We always had somebody kind of filling in, always there pressing the ball and worked really hard for 90 minutes and got the end product. "I think we deserved to win the game in the end. I'm so pleased we got the three points and we topped the group. "We know that if you want to be the best you have to beat the best, so we're happy to take anyone on now we're in the quarters. "They are a great team, Japan, and they put up a real fight and it was a hard game so it was a great win for us and a good team performance."	England women's coach Hope Powell praised her players after they beat Japan 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup.
Rents for grade A offices have risen to £15.50-per-sq ft over the past year, according to commercial agents. But they are still well below the UK average of £24. It is claimed that the prospect of a relatively low financial return is acting as a barrier to substantial build projects. In March, an Invest NI report said there is a shortage of grade A space office in Belfast. Grade A offices are classed as new or refurbished buildings, in prime locations, with open-plan layouts. Ian Duddy of Colliers International in Belfast said: "The shortage of grade A space in Belfast has led a number of major occupiers to develop their own headquarter buildings. "Further rental growth in the grade A market is necessary to encourage new development in the city." Office development has slowed since the 2008 property market crash. Loans of public money could soon be made available to property developers to help them build offices, after a recent report for Invest NI described supply as "extremely limited". Invest is exploring whether to advance loans as "a short-term intervention".	Rents for premium office space in Belfast city centre have risen by 19%, but experts say still not enough to generate a boom in developments.
Ben Hall, 25, from Port Erin was found hanged in his bathroom on a ward at Grianagh Court in Braddan in June 2012. Coroner John Needham said his suicide could have been avoided had the hospital fitted a collapsible shower rail. Unsafe rails at the hospital have since been replaced, said a spokesman. In an inquest hearing last week, Mr Needham added: "This amounted to a gross systemic failure in the basic care provided to Ben". "I have considered the systemic failures that led to this tragedy and I have also considered the steps that have been taken to prevent similar tragedies happening in the future. "I do note the large number of steps that the organisation has taken to change the various systems that failed in this case. All en suite bathrooms on the acute adult ward now have collapsible shower rails". The special rails, recommended by the chief medical officer in 2000, are designed to fall if a weight of 40kg (90lb) is suspended anywhere along their entire length. The government said: "The department of health and social care wishes to express its condolences to Mr Hall's family and friends following the conclusion of the inquest into his death.  The department accepts the Coroner's verdict and recommendation. "Following Mr Hall's death the department undertook an immediate and comprehensive review of the incident and implemented a number of measures in response. "The department will now urgently address the coroner's recommendations to determine whether there are any additional measures that were not contained within the department's own action plan".	The Manx government has apologised for the "gross systemic failures" of a psychiatric hospital which led to the death of a mental health patient.
Elections are being held in 27 English county councils and seven unitary authorities, last contested in 2009, as well as in Anglesey in Wales. Labour are defending the South Shields seat in a contest caused by the resignation of David Miliband in March. Mayoral contests are also being held in Doncaster and North Tyneside. Polls for all the contests opened at 07:00 BST, and close at 22:00 BST. Blue sky and sunshine are covering much of England, as millions of voters choose who will represent them on their local council. More than 2,300 seats are up for grabs in county councils and unitary authorities across the length and breadth of England, including Derbyshire, Lancashire, Somerset, Essex, Surrey, Leicestershire, Kent, Durham, Bristol and Cornwall. The Conservatives and Labour are putting up candidates in most seats, with 2,263 and 2,168 candidates respectively. The Lib Dems have 1,763 candidates. UKIP is fielding 1,745 candidates, three times as many as it did the last time these seats were fought in 2009, and the Greens have 893 candidates. Other parties standing include the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, which is fighting 120 seats, the BNP, with 99 candidates and the English Democrats, with 38 candidates. There are around 900 independent candidates. No elections are taking place in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The majority of council results are expected on Friday between 11:00 BST and 18:30 BST, although six councils - Lincolnshire, Dorset, Somerset, Essex, Gloucestershire and Hampshire - will declare their results in the early hours of Friday morning. The result for the South Shields by-election is also expected early on Friday morning.	Voters across England are going to the polls for council elections and a parliamentary by-election in South Shields.
The woman, who is in her 70s, was attacked in Sneem, County Kerry, on 20 September. The man was detained by officers in Killarney on Saturday morning. He is being questioned at Killarney Garda (police) station.	A man in his early 20s has been arrested by police investigating a serious sexual assault on a pensioner in the Republic of Ireland.
The 14-year-old was found dead on the banks of the River Leven in Dunbartonshire on 25 August 1996. Her mother, Margaret McKeich, recently led appeals as the inquiry reached 20 years without the killer being found. Crimestoppers said the reward would be paid for information which leads to an arrest and conviction. Information passed directly to the police will not qualify for the reward. Angela Parker, national manager for Crimestoppers in Scotland, said: "Twenty years on, and Caroline's family are still left with unanswered questions as to what happened to her. "I am asking for people who might have any information, no matter how insignificant they think it might be, to contact Crimestoppers anonymously, because you could be the person that provides the missing pieces to the puzzle. "We never ask who you are or any of your details. You'll never speak to anyone from the police or ever go to court. Please do the right thing, and tell us who is responsible for taking a young girl's life." Anyone with information is asked to contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or through an anonymous online form. Last week police said they were following up more than 20 calls after the murder inquiry featured on the BBC's Crimewatch programme. Some calls related to the identity of a hooded man seen near Caroline before she died. Video contributions to the programme were also made by Mrs McKeich and the schoolgirl's friend, Joanne Menzies, who was one of the last people to have seen her alive. Police Scotland's Homicide Governance and Review team recently started a fresh investigation and forensic scientists are re-examining more than 300 items collected at the time of Caroline's death.	The Crimestoppers charity is offering a £10,000 reward for information about the 1996 murder of Scottish schoolgirl Caroline Glachan.
21 November 2016 Last updated at 11:52 GMT Women of Africa is a BBC season recognising inspiring women across the continent.

Castle MacLellan Foods will receive the support for its Kirkcudbright base from parent company Kavli. It will allow the business to "capitalise on strong growth prospects for its premium products throughout the UK". The funds will be used to expand and streamline production areas within the factory which employs about 80 staff. Improvements will also be made to the storage facilities, amenities and services at the factory in order to "maintain the high standards" of the Castle MacLellan brand. Elaine McConnell, general manager at Castle MacLellan Foods, said: "This represents a momentous step forward for our business. "It also demonstrates the confidence the Kavli Group has in the UK market and in the Castle MacLellan Foods team. "It goes without saying that without the teamwork, commitment and dedication of our Dumfries and Galloway workforce we would not have secured this major inward investment to the region." She added: "Having the opportunity to grow the business allows us to safeguard future employment prospects for the area overall." Subject to planning consent, it is expected work will start on site in January 2014, with completion by September 2014. Castle MacLellan Foods said it would be "working closely with the local community over the coming months" to keep them informed of its plans and to ensure "minimal disruption to residents" when building work gets under way.	A £5m investment has been announced to allow the expansion of a pate firm's south west Scotland factory.
The Scots have won all five qualifiers to date and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday knowing victory would all but secure their place. But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. "Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating," she said. "We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. "It would be more heartbreak than humiliation." Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. "Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim," said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. "It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. "I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead." With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. "Iceland are top seeds in the group," Evans noted. "They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. "But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. "It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference." Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. "It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing," she recalled. "There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. "We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. "I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us." Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. "Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there," she added. "The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. "Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged. "The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different. "It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team."	Striker Lisa Evans admits it will be an emotional milestone if Scotland Women maintain their Euro 2017 qualifying form and reach a first major finals.
The anti-IS group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said a water pumping station had been hit, along with the Taj Hall and Furousiya area. IS-linked news agency Amaq  also said Raqqa's water supply had been cut. Russia said its bombers had targeted an arms depot, a chemical weapons factory and a training camp. A defence ministry statement said the strikes had inflicted "significant damage" and that a large number of militants had been killed. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), whose activists have reported on developments on the ground in Raqqa since IS militants seized control of the city in early 2014, said the water pumping station hit in Thursday's strikes was located in the nearby village of Kasrat. Residents found their water had been cut off "totally" afterwards, it added. Amaq also reported the "interruption of the water supply in all neighbourhoods". RBSS said 20 civilians had been killed and 50 others wounded in the air strikes, but the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll higher. It said 24 civilians had died, along with six others whose identities could not yet be confirmed. Raqqa, estimated to have a population of between 250,000 and 500,000, has become the de facto capital of the "caliphate" whose creation was proclaimed by IS two years ago after it took control of large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. IS militants are currently under pressure from two separate offensives west and north-west of Raqqa by Russian-backed Syrian government forces and an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters supported by the US.	Air strikes on so-called Islamic State's Syrian stronghold of Raqqa have cut the city's water supply, with 20 civilians reported dead.
The male in his early 30s was found with critical injuries in North Woolwich Road, Silvertown, at about 13:30 GMT. He was pronounced dead at the scene and inquiries are under way to locate his next-of-kin, the Met said. No arrests have been made. Two other cyclists were killed in the capital within hours of each other on Monday. Anita Szucs, 30, died after an apparent hit-and-run on Bounces Road, Enfield, while Karla Roman, 32, was killed in a crash with a coach on Whitechapel High Street, Tower Hamlets.	A cyclist has died in a crash with an HGV in east London.
At a fringe meeting about which political party best spoke for the working class, Tim Aker said the 2005 ban had upped levels of hidden drinking by forcing people "to retreat inwards". It was evidence of a "bankrupt" Labour telling people "what to do and think". Senior UKIP figures have also targeted new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. UKIP made big inroads into traditional Labour heartlands in May's election - coming second to the party in a host of seats in the north of England - but it has been suggested that Mr Corbyn's election could halt this momentum. But Mr Aker, who lost to Labour by 800 votes in Thurrock in May, said Labour had "ceased to exist" as a party of working people, choosing to "lecture rather than represent them". Citing the smoking ban as an example of a policy that had hit C1 and C2 workers, he said: "They (Labour) say all the time, despite ignoring the facts, that it was the pit closures that destroyed all the communities. "But I put it to you that the smoking ban has destroyed more communities than any any pit closure has done because when people don't have a place to meet, a place to socialise, they retreat in. "What sort of outcome is it to say 'we don't want you drinking and smoking, take it out of the licensed area', and it goes all the way back to the homes where people are drinking and smoking more in front of their children." In contrast to Labour, he said, UKIP would stand up for working people by giving them more power over their lives. "We are the ones that embrace the one concept that has helped working class voters more than the minimum wage, more than anything else - the greatest thing for the working class is democracy." Speaking to the BBC later, Mr Aker said the closure of pubs in many communities meant "there was no community left". He insisted he did not mean to "belittle the hardships of those who lost their jobs in the pits" but sought to "draw a parallel between their closures and the closure of pubs". Speaking at the same meeting, former vice-chairman Suzanne Evans said Mr Corbyn was an "unreconstructed communist and like all communists it is the poorest who will suffer (under him)". And speaking in the hall, deputy leader Paul Nuttall said Mr Corbyn was a "trendy lefty" rather than a working class hero and suggested that working people would not warm to a man "who says nice things about the IRA, wants to give the Falklands back to the Argentinians and, above all, won't sing the national anthem". More than ever before, he suggested, UKIP was poised to become the alternative to Labour in the Midlands and the north of England and to the Tories in the south of England. But it would only continue to make inroads in the traditional Labour vote if it was "bold and told it like it is". He added: "We must not tone down our language. We must not change. If we change and sound like all the rest, we are finished." Meanwhile, Matthew Goodwin - professor of politics at the University of Kent and the author of a book on UKIP's rise - has cast doubt on whether Mr Corbyn's election will stop the leaching of Labour votes to UKIP. Mr Goodwin told the fringe meeting that past assumptions that UKIP voters were "exiled Tories who liked to wear tweed and corduroy and spend most of their time playing golf" had been scotched by its performance in May - when it attracted 29% of working class votes, compared with Labour's 27%. "Labour is in real trouble among these groups and it is not a problem that is going to be fixed by Jeremy Corbyn," he said. But he warned that UKIP, as well as other parties, risked losing working class voters to "political apathy".	A UKIP MEP has told the party's conference the ban on smoking in public places in England has "damaged more communities than the pit closures did".
Under the first deal with Taqa, Proserv will build a control system for three subsea wells near the Tern platform in the Cladhan field. The other contract with an unnamed established operator involves subsea well and manifold control systems. Proserv said the deals strengthened its position in the subsea controls and communications field. Proserv chief executive David Lamont said: "Both contract wins reflect Proserv's industry-leading position and strong track record for delivering high-value integrated technology systems on time and within budget. "Proserv's fast-growing suite of technologies have been developed based on the company's 'ingeniously simple' philosophy and are underpinned by the company's international talent pool of technical and engineering expertise which has expanded considerably through organic growth and strategic acquisition."

Cheryl Cope, 51, from Haringey had suffered flu-like symptoms for 10 days before she was admitted to the Whittington Hospital. Her inquest heard she should have been diagnosed as having sepsis when she was admitted at 07.40 GMT on 27 February. She died 24 hours after being admitted to hospital. Blood poisoning or sepsis is a potentially life threatening condition that can be easily treated with antibiotics quickly but is often missed. Coroner Jacqueline Devonish said that while the cause of death was natural, Mrs Cope was not given the "best chance" of survival. She added it was "not possible to say whether Mrs Cope would have survived if treated promptly". The inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court heard the hospital was overcrowded that day. It had space for 280 patients, but there were 320 patients in the hospital at the time. Mrs Cope, an interior designer, was seen by a nurse who tried to carry out observation tests but could not complete them because of a malfunctioning blood pressure monitor. She took Mrs Cope to the urgent care centre where she asked a colleague to repeat the tests but this took longer than she had hoped because staff there also struggled to get a blood pressure reading. The hospital admitted Mrs Cope should have been treated earlier than she was. Ms Devonish said she would not be making recommendations to the hospital because it had already drafted a new policy to diagnose sepsis following Mrs Cope's death.	A woman from north London died in hospital because staff failed to identify she had blood poisoning quickly enough, an inquest has ruled.
St James' Park and West Ham United's ground were raided in April by HM Revenue and Customs as part of a Â£5m National Insurance fraud investigation. Newcastle's managing director Lee Charnley was among several men arrested and later released without charge. The ban remains in force until a court hearing on 22 June. High Court judge Mr Justice Supperstone imposed the ban after lawyers for Newcastle United applied for a judicial review against HMRC. He directed that any material retained by HMRC must be returned to the club. He also directed that the legal action involving the Magpies, who have just secured promotion to the Premier League, must return to court on 22 June. It is expected the club will then have to show that it has an arguable case to take to a full judicial review hearing. No details of the grounds of the challenge were revealed during Thursday's short court hearing. Lawyers for both the club and HMRC said they could not provide any further information. During the raids HMRC said it had seized business records and financial records as well as computers and mobile phones.	Tax officials have been banned from examining material seized from Newcastle United's ground, following a legal challenge mounted by the club.
Andrew Jones, 34, was convicted of grievous bodily harm and robbery after he left Reg Stocking lying in a pool of blood in West Bromwich. A jury at Wolverhampton Crown Court also found him guilty of a burglary using Mr Stocking's car as a getaway. Jones, of Dingle Street, Sandwell, was remanded into custody to await sentencing on 4 December. He was also found guilty of witness intimidation. Mr Stocking's blue Peugeot 207 was taken outside his home in Chapel Street, West Bromwich. Jones hid before jumping into the car while Mr Stocking opened his driveway gate, said West Midlands Police. Mr Stocking tried to stop Jones but he was hit and dragged by the car which left him in a critical condition with serious head injuries. Jones used the car as a getaway vehicle to steal a TV from a property in Groveland Road, Tipton just hours later. He stored the TV at his ex-partner's flat in Kendrick House saying "ask no questions and I will tell no lies". His ex-partner Stacey Johnson, 26, pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods at an earlier hearing and received a 12 month community order and was ordered to pay costs of Â£300. Detective Inspector Pete Rowe, from West Bromwich CID, said of the conviction: "We hope that this will give some comfort to the family as their loved one continues to recover from his ordeal and injuries."	A man has been found guilty of a car-jacking attack which left a 78-year-old man wheelchair bound, a court heard.
Shahid Tarafdar, 45, was hit by a Peugeot 307 on Stockport Road at about 15:45 GMT on 7 February. He was taken to hospital but later died. Michael Joyce, 21, from Reabrook Avenue, Manchester has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Both have been remanded to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court later. The teenager has also been charged with a number of other driving offences including driving whilst disqualified, failing to stop and report a collision and using a motor vehicle without insurance.	A 17-year-old boy has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving, after a man died after he was hit by a car in Levenshulme.
Media playback is not supported on this device Drogba, 39, has not played since leaving Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact in November. He will start out as a player but has also joined Phoenix's "MLS expansion franchise ownership group". "To own a team and be a player at the same time is unusual but it's going to be very exciting," Drogba said. "It's a good transition because I want to carry on playing but I'm almost 40 and it's important for me to prepare for my later career." Phoenix have just started their fourth season in the Western Conference of USL, which forms part of the second tier of the American league system. The Arizona club hope to become one of four planned expansion teams in MLS over the next three years. "I had offers from China, from England - in both the Premier League and even the Championship - but they were only as a player," Drogba told The Premier League Show. "This was the right offer because it was important for me to think about playing, because I enjoy it, but also to get to the next stage of my career." Drogba scored 157 goals in 341 appearances during his first spell at Chelsea from 2004 to 2012, winning three Premier League titles and the Champions League. Following moves to Shanghai Shenhua in China and Turkish side Galatasaray, Drogba returned to the Blues for the 2014-15 season, scoring seven goals in 40 appearances, helping Jose Mourinho's side to the title, before 18 months with Montreal. He joins former Chelsea team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips at Phoenix, who have one win and two defeats from three games this season. "I'm still a player but it's important to respect the decision of the manager," added Drogba, who is Ivory Coast's record goalscorer. "When we're on the pitch, he's going to be the one who decides and when we go to board meetings, it's a different thing." Watch the full interview with Didier Drogba in The Premier League show on BBC Two on Thursday, 13 April (22:00 BST) .	Former Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba has joined United Soccer League side Phoenix Rising as a player and co-owner.
The clause backing "common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange", was scrapped under Tony Blair in 1995. Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour "shouldn't shy away" from public control of railways and public investment in industry. Leadership rival Liz Kendall told the paper Clause IV belonged in the past. Tony Blair's move two decades ago to ditch the long-standing commitment in Labour's constitution to public ownership was seen by some as a symbolic step which made the party more electable in the post-Margaret Thatcher era. The original wording of Clause IV was replaced with a new commitment to "a thriving private sector and high-quality public services where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them". Mr Corbyn told the IoS he could consider bringing back the old Clause IV as part of a commitment to take "necessary things" back into public ownership. "I think we should talk about what the objectives of the party are, whether that's restoring the Clause IV as it was originally written or it's a different one, but I think we shouldn't shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways," he said. "I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail." Mr Corbyn's campaign momentum seems unflagging  - to the alarm of senior figures in the party. But he says the party needs a new statement of objectives - and that could be the original Clause IV. Jeremy Corbyn has already promised to renationalise energy companies and the railways and increase public spending on industry. One of Mr Corbyn's leadership rivals, Liz Kendall, condemned the idea as a "throwback to the past". Some party donors are alarmed by the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn win too. Businessman Assem Allam, who donated Â£300,000 to Labour during the election, has told the Sunday Telegraph he would stop giving money to the party if Mr Corbyn becomes leader, saying he never backed a "dead horse". Mr Corbyn is one of four candidates standing in next month's Labour leader election, alongside Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Ms Kendall - the leadership challenger seen as being the closest to Mr Blair's policies - fiercely condemned the idea of bringing back Clause IV. "This shows there is nothing new about Jeremy Corbyn's politics," she said. "Life had moved on from the old Clause IV in 1994, let alone 2015. We are a party of the future, not a preservation society." At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders	Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour could restore Clause IV committing it to public ownership if he became leader.
A report urges European aviation safety officials to take immediate action to ensure Super Puma H225 helicopters are safe. The Norwegian Air Accident Board warned that current fault detection measures may be inadequate. Iain Stuart from Aberdeenshire was among those killed in the crash. Mr Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk, worked for the oil field services company Halliburton. The Airbus Super Puma was travelling from the Gullfaks field to Bergen when it crashed near the small island of Turoey on 29 April. A preliminary report issued by the  Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) said it had found "features strongly consistent with fatigue" in parts of the main gearbox (MGB). It added: "It cannot be ruled out that this signifies a possible safety issue that can affect other MGBs of the same type. "The nature of the catastrophic failure of the LN-OJF main rotor system indicates that the current means to detect a failure in advance are not effective." The Super Puma H225 helicopter is currently grounded in the UK and Norway but the manufacturer Airbus has lifted a recommendation that flights be suspended worldwide. Airbus said at the time there was no evidence to link the crash with two previous incidents in Scotland involving the same model of helicopter. An online petition calling for all Super Puma 225s to be "permanently removed from service" has attracted nearly 30,000 signatures.	Air Accident investigators have found signs of metal fatigue in the gearbox of a helicopter that crashed off Norway, killing 13 people in April.
Sepsis can lead to shock and rapid organ failure following an infection. A snapshot of 290 hospital patients showing signs of sepsis found only 12% were initially screened and treated in line with best practice. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said more needed to be done and he was "open minded" about potential options. Last year, more than 7,500 people were admitted to hospitals with sepsis. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics - if spotted quickly enough. Research, due to be published later this week, was led by intensive care consultant Dr Tamas Szakmany. "We have seen in our study this year there was big variation in how the clinical teams were responding to sepsis," said Dr Szakmany. "There are important pockets of very good practice and we have seen there are hospitals, there are health boards, where the response is less good." The issue is the focus for BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme, following Welsh weatherman Derek Brockway as he explores how his own father Cliff died of sepsis last year. On 30 December 2014, 17-year-old Chloe Christopher collapsed and died after developing sepsis. Her mother Michelle told Derek Brockway about the heartbreaking last moments of her daughter's life. The Welsh health secretary told the forecaster: "We have got a health improvement programme. "We are the first country within the UK to have this early warning score system... but it has always been about how consistently that has been adhered to. "If we level out that variation, we will end up saving more lives. So I wouldn't pretend to you or anyone else that we are perfect where we are." Mr Gething said he is considering whether to make hospitals screen patients with symptoms in the same way. "I am open minded to that, absolutely," he said. "I am not going to run away from choices to be made about improving the service." Early indications from the second annual snapshot by Dr Szakmany's team, expected to be published next year, suggest there has been an improvement.	A killer condition linked to 1,500 deaths every year in Wales is not always being treated in the same way in Welsh hospitals, new research claims.
The 60-year-old Frenchman has been suspended along with Fifa president Sepp Blatter and secretary general Jerome Valcke. They deny wrongdoing. Platini, a Fifa vice-president, is the Football Association's preference to succeed Blatter at Fifa. The French FA wants the Court of Arbitration for Sport to intervene to ensure Platini can stand for election. Fifa's ethics committee began its investigation after the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings against Blatter in September. He is accused of signing a contract "unfavourable" to Fifa and making a "disloyal payment" to Platini. The ethics committee also opened an inquiry into Platini over the 2m euros (£1.35m) payment, which was made nine years after the former France footballer carried out consultation work for Blatter. Fifa will hold an emergency meeting on 20 October in Zurich to discuss February's presidential election, at which a successor to Blatter will be chosen. Platini, Uefa's president since 2007, has been backed by South America's football confederation following his suspension. Conmebol said he should be regarded as innocent until proven guilty. The French Football Federation is expecting a decision from Fifa's appeal committee within eight days. "The FFF has adopted the principle of an appeal if the decision of the Fifa appeal committee does not go Michel Platini's way," said a FFF spokesman. Blatter, 79, won a fifth consecutive presidential election in May but announced he would be stepping down just days later following the launch of two investigations into Fifa by United States and Swiss authorities. Platini is one of the favourites to replace him and still plans to stand. He has the full backing of Uefa, which is holding an emergency meeting next week.	Uefa chief Michel Platini is appealing after Fifa banned him for 90 days while corruption claims are investigated.
The             eurozone group  said reforms were Greece's "best guarantee" to overcome tough economic and social challenges. European markets were mixed in morning trading, after Asia had recorded earlier gains. The Syriza party, which rejected the bailout terms and came a close second, said it would lead the opposition. With 99.9% of ballots counted, interior ministry results put New Democracy on 29.7% of the vote (129 seats), Syriza on 26.9% (71) and the socialist Pasok on 12.3% (33). There are 300 seats in parliament and Greece has a rule that gives the leading party 50 extra seats. Greek voters had gone to the polls on Sunday following inconclusive elections in May. New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said Greeks had chosen to stay in the euro and called for a "national salvation government". By Gavin HewittEurope editor If Antonis Samaras is confirmed in power he will have a stronger opposition breathing down his neck. He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult. Already German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform bailout programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth. But the message is clear; the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay.  The German finance minister underlined that message when he said: "Greece's path will be neither short nor easy". He is now meeting President Carolos Papoulias, who is expected to give him the mandate to try to form a government. Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras said his party would not take part in the government, and would instead become a powerful anti-austerity voice in the opposition. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says Mr Samaras is expected to try for a broad coalition, hoping to create a stable government with a stronger popular mandate. He says Mr Samaras will push for a lightening of the bailout terms from Brussels, arguing that Greeks have accepted more pain by electing a pro-bailout party and that Europe should now cut Greece some slack. However, correspondents also point out that only 40% of voters backed parties that broadly support the bail-out deal with the EU and the IMF. Tough austerity measures were attached to the two international bailouts awarded to Greece, an initial package worth 110bn euros (Â£89bn; $138bn) in 2010, then a follow-up last year worth 130bn euros. Sunday's vote was watched around the world, amid fears that a Greek exit from the euro could spread contagion to other eurozone members and deepen the turmoil in the global economy. European stock markets were mixed in morning trading. Asian shares had earlier advanced. Japan's Nikkei 225 index and South Korea's Kospi both closed up 1.8%. BBC business editor Robert Peston says the election results have been seen by investors as avoiding the worst short-term outcome, which would have been political paralysis followed by a messy exit from the euro. In a statement on behalf of the 17 eurozone finance ministers, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Paul Juncker said that "continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece's best guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges and for a more prosperous future of Greece in the euro area". Election as it happenedProfile: Antonis Samaras In pictures: Greek elections In             a joint statement  European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also hailed the result, and expressed hope that a government would be formed quickly. German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Mr Samaras to congratulate him on his victory. A German government statement said she had "stated that she would work on the basis that Greece will meet its European commitments". The US stressed that it was in everyone's interests "for Greece to remain in the euro area". Mr Samaras said that the Greek people had voted to stay in the eurozone. "There is no time to waste," he said. "A national salvation government must bring economic growth and reassure Greeks the worst is over." He added: "There will be no more adventures. Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt," promising that Athens would "honour its obligations". Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, says this suggests that Mr Samaras wants to press ahead with spending cuts demanded by the country's international creditors. European leaders have warned that if the new Greek government rejects the bailout, the country could be forced to abandon the single currency. New Democracy should be able to build a majority coalition with the socialist Pasok. However, coalition talks may not be easy. In addition to Syriza's showing, four other parties which oppose or want a radical overhaul of the bailout look set to take between 60 and 70 seats. They include the far-right Golden Dawn, which has about 7% of the vote. The leader of Pasok, Evangelos Venizelos, proposed a broad four-party coalition including New Democracy, Pasok, the Democratic Left and Syriza. "No decision can be taken without this national unity," he said.	World leaders have welcomed the narrow election victory of Greece's broadly pro-bailout New Democracy party and urged Athens to form a cabinet quickly.
Koukash has owned the Super League team since 2013 but it has stated before he could leave Salford. "My plans are to make sure we win the next few games. We'll see what happens at the end of the season," he said. "I have not made my mind up to walk away, I'm working hard to make sure it is financially viable for next year." Salford scored 13 tries as they comfortably beat Featherstone on Sunday in a game where only 1,759 were in attendance at the AJ Bell Stadium. "It was a crucial game, there was no football around, there was good weather, it's a Sunday where families can come and we reduced ticket prices," Koukash told BBC Radio Manchester. "To only have 1,750 for a crucial game, I must say I'm very disappointed. What the fans all have to understand is that next year the club will only be able to spend what it can afford. "I can no longer keep bankrolling it the way I did. If the fans wanted to see a competitive Super League side they need to start turning up." Despite his future with the club being in doubt, Koukash said he could not buy another rugby league club if his time with Salford was to end. "Once you are a Red Devil, you will always be a Red Devil. I will never be involved with another club, that's it. The time when I finish from Salford, I will just sit back and enjoy the sport like any other fan," he added.	Salford Red Devils owner Marwan Koukash says he has still not decided whether he will sell the club at the end of the current season.
The study examined footage of the footballer before and after 2007, the year the Beckhams moved to Los Angeles. David dropped his H sounds at the start of words far less often than before the move to the US, the study found. And in a separate video study of wife Victoria, the ex-Spice Girl was found to be "definitely getting posher". A university spokesman said the research was part of a study into "how changing circumstances affect the way we pronounce words". Researchers contrasted the way Beckhams spoke before and after their move to the US, when David signed for Los Angeles Galaxy. Charles Boorman and Alix Roberts looked at changes in David's speech, while Naomi Proszynska and James Pickett investigated how Victoria spoke. The research revealed that David dropped the H in words such as "him" and "has" 80% of the time before the move to the US, but only 20% of the time afterwards. Mr Boorman said it was "clear that Becks, once a broader Cockney, nowadays speaks with more of a standard English accent". "In fact, he's even hyper-correcting himself, because he puts Hs into words when it's not really required - in America, they use the H sound more, which explains how he acquired it. "But my guess is that his dropping of those Cockney vowels was linked to his ambassadorial role for the Olympics and his subsequent high social status." Victoria - dubbed Posh Spice during her days with the Spice Girls - was found to correctly pronounce Ls in words such as "all" 25% of the time in 1997, with the figure rising to 46% in 2012. "All" can be pronounced "awe" by "working-class people in the south-east of England", the researchers said. Source: University of Manchester Ms Proszynska said: "In 1997, her speech resembled what we associate with the classic Essex girl but, by 2012, her speech no longer so strongly represented her Essex roots. "We think this may be connected with the fact that she's forged a different career as a widely respected fashion designer." Linguistics lecturer Dr Laurel MacKenzie said pronunciation was not "static" in adults. "The general assumption is that once we pass puberty our way of speaking is fixed," she said. "But recent research has revealed the extent to which we can be chameleons in the way we speak, even into adulthood. "Factors such as social mobility and geographical location can have an impact on the way adults pronounce words."	David Beckham has changed his speech over the past decade to "sound less working class", University of Manchester academics have concluded.
Windsor, Slough, Eton and Hounslow Athletics Club normally use the park's famous Long Walk for winter training. The Crown Estate now said the park's ground conditions are not suitable for the club's training sessions. Coach John Higgins said: "Mo Farah used to train with the club, and he used to train exactly on this venue". "It's really sad." Mr Higgins said although the club used an athletics track for summer training, in winter it needed an outdoor venue for athletes to train on grass for cross country fixtures. The club is used by children aged between eight to 18-years-old to train, and has been running since the 1880s, with Prince Philip as its current patron. "We need somewhere lit and that's why the Long Walk is so perfect". "It's a lovely place and we're very very careful about not littering, because we respect the place," he said. Russell Young, a father of two children at the club, said: "We're extremely disappointed, we don't really cut up the grass. "We thought they'd be quite happy to have children exercising on it." The nearby playing fields of Eton, where the Thames Valley Athletics Centre is based, are not lit and have cricket pitches which could be damaged by runners, while Upton Park in Slough is not safe for the club to use at present as the pedestrian crossing is out of service following a collision with a lorry. A spokesperson for Windsor Great Park said discussions were continuing with the club to find what other options may be available for the next season.	Young runners at Olympian Mo Farah's former athletics club have been banned from training at Windsor Great Park in preparation for cross country races.
The scene from Alice in Wonderland in Wardie Primary's assembly hall dates back to 1936 and was recently restored with a Heritage Lottery Fund. A mother has lodged a complaint about the image describing it as racist. Edinburgh City Council said it understands the offensiveness of the image but said it does not reflect the attitudes of the school. An Edinburgh City Council spokesman said: "The Alice in Wonderland mural at Wardie Primary School was painted in 1936 and is of both historical and artistic importance as evidenced by the fact it recently received full Heritage Lottery Funding support to restore the work. "While we understand the offensiveness of the image, it is in no way indicative of the attitudes of either the school or the council. "Our equalities policies and approaches are robustly multi-cultural and anti-racist, promoting diversity and good relationships among pupils." A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police in Edinburgh have received a complaint in relation to a mural at a primary school in the Trinity area. "Officers are now liaising with Edinburgh City Council education department with regards to this matter. "Police Scotland treats all reports relating to hate incidents extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate whenever a report of this nature is made."	Police are investigating a complaint about a mural at an Edinburgh primary school which features a golliwog.
Tumours in the ovaries are hard to detect in the earliest stages meaning it can be too late to treat them effectively by the time they are found. A trial of 4,051 women, reported in the journal Cancer, showed the method could identify those needing treatment. But a huge study taking place in the UK will give a final verdict on the test when it is completed in 2015. There is a survival rate of up to 90% when ovarian cancer is caught early, compared with less than 30% if it is discovered in the later stages. Unlike other cancers, the symptoms, such as pelvic and abdominal pain or persistent bloating, are often put down to other common ailments and the tumour can be missed. There is no mass screening programme to detect the cancer either. Scientists already know that levels of a protein in the blood, called CA125, are often higher with ovarian cancer. However, it is too unreliable on its own. It misses some patients and tells others they have the cancer when they are actually healthy. Researchers are now testing the idea of using the blood test to sort patients in risk groups based on levels of CA125. Instead of going straight for surgery, low-risk patients are tested again in a year, medium-risk ones after three months and high-risk patients have an ultrasound scan to hunt for tumours. The US study, at the University of Texas, followed post-menopausal women for 11 years on average. Ten women had surgery based on their ultrasound scan and all the cancers detected were at an early stage. Researcher Dr Karen Lu told the BBC: "Clinical practice definitely should not change from our study, but it gives us an insight - we didn't get a lot of false positives." She said the UK study of 50,000 people would give definitive results: "There are two big questions - do we see cancers at an earlier stage and do we decrease the number of deaths." Dr Sarah Blagden, from the Ovarian Cancer Action research centre, said: "Relative to the trial under way in the in the UK , this is a small study, but it does show that effective ovarian screening is possible. "In 2015 the results of the UKCTOCs study will become available and the results are eagerly anticipated, more so now that this American study has produced such encouraging results." Annwen Jones, the chief executive at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: "The results of this study are without doubt very positive, and we should take hope from that. "Early detection of ovarian cancer will be the key to transforming survival rates.  However, this study is very small, and there is no guarantee that the results will be replicated on a larger scale."	A new way of screening for ovarian cancer is showing "potential", according to researchers in the US.
Brandon Lewis said he asked Avon Fire Authority to commission an independent inquiry into the claims, which the authority refutes, on at least two separate occasions last year. The government has since ordered its own investigation. The authority said its chairman will make a statement at its next meeting. A spokesman said: "The fire authority will not be making a comment today, but the chairman will be making a statement at the next meeting of Avon Fire Authority on Friday 10 February." The allegations over the fire authority, which oversees the fire and rescue service, have not been detailed, but have been described as "serious and persistent" by the Home Office. Three senior officers left the authority in five years under "unusual circumstances". The BBC also uncovered evidence of infighting. But the fire service chief, Kevin Pearson has maintained the allegations as "old and unfounded". Mr Lewis said the complaints, if well-founded "would indicate that the authority was failing in its duty to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement". Independent consultant Dr Craig Baker will lead the statutory inspection. He has advised public sector organisations for over 30 years in the UK and overseas.	A fire authority repeatedly refused to start an investigation into allegations over the way it was being run, the fire service minister has said.
Hartley, 28, headed home from a 91st-minute corner to send the Pilgrims to Wembley for the first time in 20 years. "I've never experienced anything like that, it's the biggest moment of my career so far," he told BBC Sport. "I was sat in the dressing room and the boys were celebrating and I was just thinking 'what's happened?'" Having drawn the first leg 2-2 at Fratton Park, the Pilgrims - who finished fifth in League two despite having led the league by five points in November - had almost all the chances in the second leg at Home Park. But the game seemed to be heading for extra time until former Stevenage and Hartlepool defender Hartley came up with the winner in front of the Argyle end. "I remember connecting with the ball and it hit the back of the boy's head and hit my head again and went in," he said. "Then I woke up and there was some big bald guy kissing me in the face. "We set up perfectly to nullify Portsmouth's threat and I think we look like a real good outfit. "I don't think Accrington or AFC Wimbledon will fancy playing us at Wembley."	Peter Hartley says scoring the injury-time winner for Plymouth Argyle in the League Two play-off semi-final against Portsmouth is his greatest moment.
Infectiously-catchy earworm 'PPAP' (short for Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen') was performed by animal print-clad DJ Piko-Taro, a fictional character played by Japanese entertainer Kazuhiko Kosaka. And it goes like this: "I have a pen. I have an apple. Apple-pen! I have a pen. I have [a] pineapple. Pineapple-pen! Apple-pen. Pineapple-pen. Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen." But how did the 40-year-old DJ come up with such a bizarre song about fusing a pen with an apple and a pineapple? "When I was making this music with play, I was [just] singing it too soon," the newly-crowned internet star explained in a tweet to fans from an account created for his newly-coined character. It has all the ingredients for a viral video formula: an addictive beat, silly lyrics and a hilariously simple dance routine to back it up. And it was only a matter of time before the minute-long song, first uploaded onto Piko-Taro's official YouTube channel, quickly spread to Facebook. While the original video has gone on to amass more than 4m views, entertainment portal 9GAG's Facebook video surpassed that to draw more than 44m views. "I'm ruined - I will never get this song out of my head," lamented Facebook user Carlos AndrÃ©s Silva in a comment. Nelson Rivera Adrian Paige agreed, voicing concern for the number of times he has looped the video. "I am both highly amused as well as extremely confused." Other users like Daniel Hou who watched the video pointed out Piko-Taro's unique wardrobe. "Am I the only one who noticed that this guy is the real-life version of Borsalino [Kizaru] from One Piece," he said, drawing reference to the popular flamboyantly-dressed manga-anime character. But one man's catchy viral song may prove to be another's jarring burden. "Please stop sharing this annoying song, it's exploded on my feed and is driving me up the wall because it's so irritating to listen to," said Facebook user Hiro Kenshida in a plea. At time of writing, few mainstream Japanese news sites have covered this particular earworm, even though it has been widely picked up internationally. It has not particularly trended on Japanese social media. He has already been dubbed the next Psy and it could even be that this was precisely what was in mind - one catchy  ditty, pushed by digital influencers but with the precise aim of becoming a global phenomenon. But the hype did not stop there. Hundreds of tributes and covers of Piko-Taro's tune have also appeared on Facebook, each gaining cult followings of their own. Many Japanese stars, including popular duo Riko and Rika, came up with vines of their own. There's even been a heavy metal tribute as well as a cover from Thai social media star Happy Polla. What a time to be alive.	You are about to witness viral history in the making and none of it will make any sense to you.
The British-Brazilian duo were beaten by South Africa's Raven Klaasen and American Rajeev Ram 6-1 6-4 in an hour at the O2 Arena in London. But Murray and Soares have already overtaken Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut in the year-end rankings. After three round-robin match wins, they were outplayed by Klaasen and Ram. The latter pair will play Finland's Henri Kontinen and Murray's former partner, Australian John Peers, in Sunday's final. Kontinen and Peers beat the Bryan brothers 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 in their semi-final. Earlier, Jamie's brother Andy Murray kept his hopes alive of ending the season as the world number one singles player by beating Milos Raonic in a thrilling semi-final, which lasted three hours and 38 minutes.	New world number one doubles team Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares suffered a disappointing defeat in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals.
The discovery was made during work to extend the castle's main shop and ticket office. Historic Scotland said the find would help establish exactly where the defences stood. European experts are believed to have been used to apply the latest Italian military engineering techniques at the castle in the 1540s. They were brought in by Mary of Guise, widow of James V, at a time when intermittent warfare with England made it essential to have fortifications that could protect against heavy artillery in a siege. The defences are shown in a 17th Century engraving by John Slezer. Gordon Ewart, of Kirkdale Archaeology - whose team discovered the walling - said: "We knew the defences would have been in this area, but not exactly where because the Slezer engraving, and remaining military plans, are not entirely accurate. "This is what makes the discovery of physical evidence so important - it helps us identify exactly what existed - and to understand more about what the castle was like in the past." Much was changed at the castle between 1711-14 when the old defences were demolished during a programme of modernisation. Further alterations took place when the esplanade was created in the early 19th Century. Peter Yeoman, from Historic Scotland, said the discovery gave a "tantalising glimpse" of the fortifications created for Mary of Guise and paid for by the French king Henri II. Mr Yeoman said they were probably designed by the Italian engineer Signor Ubaldini, who was working on a similar defensive spur at the time at Edinburgh Castle. He added: "They are of great interest because they were early examples of a changing approach to military engineering, and among the most advanced in the whole of the British isles."	Archaeologists have found fragments of Stirling Castle's 16th Century outer defences.
Stephen Archer, the victim's brother, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, Greater Manchester Police said. The 49-year-old victim was airlifted to hospital from Surbiton Road, Newton Heath, with 70% burns after the attack on Monday. Armed officers arrested Mr Archer, 50, after an off-duty officer spotted him getting off a train at Marple rail station near Stockport earlier. Detectives believe the victim, who has not been named, was covered in petrol before being set alight. A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place later to establish the cause of her death. A 19-year-old woman escaped uninjured from an upstairs window of the house during the fire, which also seriously damaged the building. Three fire engines dealt with the blaze and several routes around Surbiton Road were closed off. Police then spent five days searching for Mr Archer, with his mother appealing for him to come forward after revealing he had sent her a birthday card.	A woman who was set on fire in an attack at her Manchester home has died.
The writer's political play This House has just transferred to London's West End, four years after it premiered at The National Theatre. Asked what his next project will be, Graham told BBC News: "I'm working on a TV drama about the referendum campaign. "I think [Brexit] is going to be the main occupying idea in all writers' heads for the next five or 10 years." He added: "That doesn't mean necessarily writing a dramatic re-enactment of referendum night, I think it just means the new mood we're living in, which is very different, a bit scary, very divisive, very angry, very confused." But Graham confirmed that his TV drama will "specifically tackle what happened" in the run-up to the EU referendum on 23 June. The playwright has previously written a short play about Brexit for The Guardian as well as The Vote, a play set in a polling station, which was televised on More4 on the night of the 2015 general election. His other credits include musical Finding Neverland - for which Graham wrote the script and Gary Barlow the music and lyrics - and Privacy, which made its debut on Broadway earlier this year starring Daniel Radcliffe. This House deals with the struggles of the Labour government between 1974 and 1979. It debuted at the National Theatre in 2012, and recently had a run at the Chichester Theatre before transferring to the West End. The play's director Jeremy Herrin said he was "delighted" by the reaction the play has had. "We haven't really changed much of it, James has kept the same script," he told the BBC. "When we first did it, the audience's obsession was much more about the coalition government in 2010 and how that was working out, and now it's much more about what's happening in the Labour Party." He added: "It's much more about dignity and honour in politics, and whether the procedure can reflect our natures. "Particularly post-Trump, it feels like that's the big question in the production - is it possible to be a decent human being in a parliamentary framework? So the play starts to answer that question." The Guardian's Michael Billington described This House as "enthralling" in his five star review of the play after its West End opening. "Graham brilliantly captures the daily machinations of politics," he wrote. "The whole ensemble contributes to a thrilling play that both relives history and transcends it." Writing in The Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish said This House is "the most intelligent, entertaining and informative political drama of this decade". He added: "This House is a must for those who want to learn more (or be reminded about) the very peculiar workings of Westminster and its often quietly heroic occupants." The play was described as "magnificently sharp and witty" by Fiona Mountford in The Evening Standard. "Whoever would have thought that the intricacies of a minority government struggling to pass a series of bills would have been so engrossing?" She added: "Both a treat and a triumph, this is a superlative night out in the West End." Comedian Jack Whitehall, who also attended Wednesday evening's press performance, described it on Twitter as an "incredible, amazing production". Culture Minister Matt Hancock said it was a "brilliant portrayal of 1970s political drama". Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) says there is a shortage of midwives and a fall in students and any future cuts will risk the quality of services. The Welsh government said the number of midwifery training places commissioned rose again this year. It also said all maternity units must meet recommendations on the number of midwives needed for safe services. It is the second year the RCM has carried out a State of Maternity Services report across Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. "Wales saw a trimming of training numbers in 2011/12 compared to the previous year. It is for this reason, and the fall in midwife numbers there, that the RCM is putting Wales on watch," the report said. "We are not yet ringing the alarm bell, but we are poised to do so; decision-makers in Wales must turn this deteriorating situation around." It went on that the the shortage of midwives that has emerged needs to be "eliminated without delay". "The government in Cardiff should act now," the report said. "The shortage we have identified in Wales should be easily eliminated - and we call on the government in Wales to do just that. "Given the emerging shortage of midwives in Wales, the number of student midwife places needs to be sustained; any further cuts would put the future quality of maternity services at risk." Midwife numbers fell in Wales in the last annual survey in 2011, where figures were 12% lower than in 2008, and the RCM said it was the third year in a row in which the number of midwives working in the NHS in Wales was cut. "Between 2001 and 2011 whilst the number of babies born jumped by just short of 5,000, the number of full-time equivalent midwives rose by just 35. "In last year's State of Maternity Services report we reported on an emerging shortage of midwives in Wales. We believe that this remained in 2011; whilst the number of births dropped a little, the number of midwives dropped too." However, Wales has seen a 34% drop in births to girls aged under 16. In England, the number of NHS midwives has continued to climb because of the UK government's good work, according to the report. A Welsh government spokesperson said:  "The numbers of midwifery training places commissioned has increased again this year from last year's numbers. "Decisions about training places are based on what the NHS needs to maintain services, service development, the numbers and age profile of staff and the drop-out rate from the courses. Clearly, plans also take into account the student midwives who are already in training and when these are expected to graduate and enter the workforce. "NHS organisations are responsible for ensuring that they have the appropriate number of staff and skill mix to meet fluctuating demand. Since 1999, the maternity workforce, including midwives and midwifery support workers, has increased by 12% in Wales. "We require all maternity units in Wales to comply with Birth Rate Plus - as recommended by the Royal College of Midwives - on the number of midwives required to deliver safe services."	Deteriorating maternity services in Wales must be turned around without delay, midwives have warned.
As Abid Naseer started his cross-examination in a New York courtroom of the police officer who searched his Manchester bedroom in 2009, he commented it was nice to hear a Mancunian accent again. Six years ago, the Pakistani national had been living in the north-west English city where he plotted to kill hundreds in a bombing attack at the city centre's Arndale shopping complex during Easter weekend. Naseer, who was extradited from the UK to the United States in 2013, was convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device. Defending himself at his trial in New York, the 28-year-old was polite, calm and professional. He denied he was involved in any form of extremism. But, according to the police officer who headed up the British investigation into his activities, his courtroom conduct was a performance designed to con the jury. In a cafe overlooking the Brooklyn courthouse where the trial was held, Det Supt Mark Smith said Naseer was a good actor, an al-Qaeda trained terrorist and a man with a determination to kill hundreds of people. He said: "He has had lots of time to develop his Westernised social skills, but I would say don't be fooled. Beneath that cool, relaxed exterior is a cold, calculated terrorist." Held in custody in the US ahead of his trial, Naseer had spent the months preparing his legal case and working out. One police officer commented that he had doubled in size since he was handcuffed and led away from a Cheetham Hill house in April 2009. Were it not for his arrest, detectives are convinced he would have gone ahead with a "mass-casualty" attack in Manchester city centre. Based upon intelligence gathered and the plots devised by other terrorists trained at the same al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan, police have pieced together what they believe would have happened. Emails sent from an internet cafÃ© near Naseer's home had been intercepted in the weeks before his arrest. The final message led police to believe an attack was imminent. Known as the "Hi Buddy" email because of the way it greeted an al-Qaeda operative, it reads: "I met with Nadia family and we both parties have agreed to conduct the nikah after the 15th and before 20th of this month. I have confirmed the dates from them and they said you should be ready between these dates." The jury was told female names, including Nadia, represented different ingredients used to make bombs. Wedding, or 'nikah', was a standard al-Qaeda code for a terror attack. Based on the Islamic calendar, investigators believed this email was referring to a planned attack during the Easter weekend in 2009. Other evidence included photos of Naseer's friends standing in front of the main entrances to the Arndale centre. He claimed they were innocent pictures as they travelled around Manchester. But retired Det Ch Insp Allan Donoghue described the images as "hostile reconnaissance". He said: "That for me was the most alarming thing. To see each entrance of the Arndale Centre being photographedâ€¦ that was clearly a means by which they would brief the would-be attackers as to what they would see as they made their approaches." Police think the first target would have been the Arndale Centre, which had been rebuilt following the IRA bomb attack on Manchester in 1996. The terrorists would have walked in carrying bombs made out of fizzy drink bottles in rucksacks or specially modified T-shirts. After the first wave of explosions, there would have been a second attack with more suicide bombers waiting in St Anne's Square for the rush of shoppers trying to escape. The target was chosen by al-Qaeda leaders because of the financial impact as well as the huge number of potential victims. According to Dr David Lowe, a retired special branch officer who now teaches law at John Moores University in Liverpool, it would have been a devastating attack. He said: "It would have potentially been bigger than the 7/7 attack in London. It would have sent shockwaves around the world. And it would have shown that not just capital cities are targets." The scale of the potential disaster is something the man who led the police investigation is well aware of. Det Supt Smith said the relief he felt at the time of the arrests continued today. "Every day since that time I've thought about this case and wondered exactly what would have happened if we didn't detain him. "I've always been convinced that we prevented an atrocity in Manchester."	Pakistani national Abid Naseer was convicted of plotting attacks in several countries after being extradited to the US from the UK, where police believe they averted an "atrocity" by his detention.

The four national football associations were unable to agree on sending Great Britain teams to Rio. Sampson, who led England to a bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup, described the situation as "frustrating". "I've watched the tournament and I believe this team would have won the gold medal," he said. "This group of players did earn the right to go to an Olympics and represent themselves and their country, but it's been taken away from them". England captain Steph Houghton, who scored three goals at London 2012 for Great Britain, added that it was "very disappointing" to not go to Rio. "That was originally our place - the place that we won at the World Cup, and it's hard, but at the same time there's no point about complaining we can't be there," she added. England's Football Association had put forward the idea of sending Great Britain teams to the Olympics, but Fifa said it would need the agreement of the ruling bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who were against it. Stewart Regan, the Scottish Football Association's chief executive, has been among those to voice concerns that a Great Britain team would threaten the separate status of the home nations at future international tournaments such as World Cups.	Great Britain could have won another Olympic gold had the women's football team been allowed to compete, believes England head coach Mark Sampson.
Earlier this month, NRW estimated the lagoon would mean 21% of salmon and 25% of sea trout dying each year, as they migrate to and from local rivers. Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no "clear scientific basis". NRW said its figures were based on the "best available evidence" it received. In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them. "Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication," the briefing said. "These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish]," the briefing adds. TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a "worst case scenario" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish. The Â£1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay. UK government ministers are considering the findings of a six-month review of the viability of the scheme, which is yet to be published. Wales' Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said the Welsh Government was "very supportive" of the scheme. But she said both it and the industry needed clarity on the UK government's position in the "very, very near future." NRW said it strongly disagreed with TLP's criticism, which it was "very surprised and disappointed by". Gareth O'Shea, an NRW executive director, said: "We have received a vast amount of evidence on this subject from the applicant and have held detailed discussions with the developer for a year-and-a-half where we have shared a huge amount of information, data and our methodology. "This has been assessed by independent experts and our own technical experts, and we have the utmost confidence that it is the best evidence available to enable us to make the right decision for the environment in Wales, as we are legally bound to do."	The developers of the proposed Swansea Bay tidal lagoon have accused Natural Resources Wales (NRW) of publishing a "grossly misleading" analysis of the project's likely impact on fish.
Hodgson made six changes, including resting captain Wayne Rooney, from the win against Wales - but a limp performance means Chris Coleman's side finish top of Group B and England's life is now more difficult if they go deeper into Euro 2016. England had the better chances, with Slovakia keeper Matus Kozacik saving well when Jamie Vardy broke clear in the first half, as well as blocking crucially from Nathaniel Clyne after the break. Rooney came on for the struggling Jack Wilshere after 55 minutes, but the pattern was set and Slovakia defended manfully for what should prove to be a precious point. Dele Alli had also a shot kicked off the line by Martin Skrtel just seconds after coming on as a substitute on the hour. England now travel to Nice where they face the team that finishes second in Group F - either Hungary, Portugal, Iceland or Austria - next Monday. It was a major surprise that Hodgson chose to make such mass alterations to an England team that had finally picked up some momentum with Thursday's last-gasp victory over Wales. That win put them in position to top the group by beating Slovakia. Instead, with nothing decided and with the group still open, Hodgson chose to leave out Rooney, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Hodgson introduced Vardy and Daniel Sturridge, who both scored against Wales, as well as Clyne, Ryan Bertrand, Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. It gave England a disjointed look and they ran out of steam and threat long before the end. Time will tell if this was the selection that proved decisive in England's Euro 2016 campaign - but the bottom line is when you make a controversial choice such as that, you need to win and Hodgson's side failed. Wilshere was given a starting role as Hodgson shuffled his squad to inject freshness and to give those on the margins some game time - but it was a move that failed. The 24-year-old Arsenal midfielder looked exactly what he is at the moment: less than fully fit and off the pace after a Premier League season where injuries meant he barely featured. Wilshere played just 141 minutes of Premier League football over three games at the end of Arsenal's season. This was no sort of preparation for a major tournament and it showed, but such is Hodgson's belief in his talents that he could not resist the temptation to select him, against all logic. He strived to somehow revive his best moments but it was not to be - not through any lack of effort, simply a lack of spark, his natural game dulled by the long absences. Wilshere looked a dejected figure as he went off to be replaced by Rooney after only 55 minutes, the possibility growing that his chances of making a serious impact on Euro 2016 badly damaged. The result leaves them off to the south of France and Nice, playing next Monday instead of Saturday - but they will surely regret not finishing top of Group B. This luxury now goes deservedly to Wales and while England will regard themselves as favourites to beat whoever finishes second in Group F, the price they pay could come further down the line. They now go into the half of the draw containing France, Germany and Italy - and will also have to regain the impetus they had finally built up by beating Wales but was lost in this disappointing draw. Not a good night for England. Not a good night for Roy Hodgson. England manager Roy Hodgson: "If we had won the game people would say we didn't miss them [the players who were left out] and when we don't they say the team selection is wrong, I am used to that one. "Finishing second is a disappointment but we are still in the last 16 and who is to say the team we will play will be that much stronger? "You just don't know, the way we are playing I am not frightened of anybody." Media playback is not supported on this device Slovakia coach Jan Kozak: "Our players tired as the game went on and England showed their quality and strength, but when you see an opportunity you give everything you can. "Perhaps I didn't expect to be pressed so deeply but we made some substitutions to neutralise the impact of their attack." England play their last-16 tie on Monday, 27 June at 20:00 BST, while Slovakia will have to wait to find out if they finish as one of the four best third-placed sides who progress.

Philip Hammond says the extra money - to be phased in over three years - will help support a system that is "clearly under pressure". It comes after months of warnings that services provided by councils for the elderly are under threat because of a lack of funding. The numbers getting help in care homes and in their own homes for daily tasks such as washing and dressing have been falling in recent years. This trend has been blamed for contributing to the growing pressures being seen in the NHS, particularly the rise in visits to A&E. Social care chiefs have said they will need to spend nearly £20bn on services this year. But even when you take into account the extra money being raised from council tax increases and NHS money that is being transferred across, (both previous policy announcements to help out the sector) councils are still nearly £1bn short of what they need. By 2020 that funding gap is predicted to grow to £2.6bn. The money announced in the Budget will go some way to plugging that gap, but clearly not all the way. It is expected to be phased in - with £1bn coming next year and the remaining £1bn spread out over the subsequent two. This will go into a pot shared across both services for the elderly, and those provided to younger adults with disabilities. Charities have called it a "sticking plaster" to the wider problems facing the sector. Although, to be fair to the chancellor, he said the extra money would be followed by a green paper later in the year to overhaul the entire system, which has remained largely unchanged since it was created along with the NHS, after the Second World War. About 500,000 people in England pay the full cost of their care in England. This can prove very expensive. One in 10 people face costs of over £100,000 once they pass the age of 65. And there is growing evidence these self-funders are helping to prop up the council-funded side of the market. Analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees councils pay care home firms are £100 a week below the actual cost of providing the care. Its researchers say this shortfall has effectively created a "hidden care tax" with self-funders now paying more than 25% extra for the same care. To limit these costs the coalition government announced in 2013 it would be introducing a cap on the cost of care so no-one paid more than £72,000 over their lifetime. This was meant to be introduced in 2016, but that was delayed until 2020. The green paper that was announced in the Budget will set out how - indeed if - that policy will be incorporated into any future changes. But the extra money will do nothing to help these people. More than 4m people over the age of 65 have care needs, but only about 1.35m of them get formal care - either by paying for it themselves or relying on council help. What happens to the rest? There are 1.5m people who are cared for by family and friends and another 1.2m who struggle by with little or no help. In theory councils could use the extra money to increase the number of people they help. But given there's already a shortfall in funding to maintain the status quo, it seems doubtful this will happen. Again, the promise of longer-term reform remains their best hope. They may also benefit from extra support announced in the Budget for the NHS. There is £100m extra to help A&Es ahead of next winter and £325m over the next three years to help with NHS reform by getting local plans off the ground to shift care out of hospitals and into community services. Eventually this should help boost services such as GPs and district nursing, which the frail elderly are heavy users of. However, given the health budget is currently nearly £120bn a year, the impact of this extra money will be limited.

Stead curled home with 14 minutes remaining to cap a fine comeback at the Northern Gas and Power Stadium after Louis Lang cancelled out Toto Nsiala's opener. Hartlepool flew out of the blocks and took an eighth-minute lead when Nsiala bundled home at the back post after Lewis Alessandra beat his man and sent in a pin-point cross. There was plenty more action in an entertaining opening period, Stead and Matthew Bates hitting the woodwork at either end. The former struck the post again early in the second half, before Lang capitalised on Pools' defence switching off by slotting a deserved equaliser into an empty net. Stead would eventually produce the decisive moment, turning coolly in the area and sending a left-footed strike beyond Trevor Carson. Pools pressed for a leveller to preserve an unbeaten league start, but their efforts proved in vain as the Magpies collected a first win of the campaign. Report supplied by Press Association.

The 39-year-old Englishman has not played in a competitive match since the World Championship quarter-finals in April, and has not entered next week's UK Snooker Championship. "I do want a place within the sport, and I'm trying to fathom what that place is," he told Eurosport. "I'm trying different things." O'Sullivan also opted not to defend his title at last week's Champion of Champions in Coventry, which Neil Robertson won. He is currently playing exhibition matches. "It's been tough at times but I truly feel I have a good idea of what it is I want," he said. "I don't want the pressure of being the top man in snooker any more. I feel that should be left to the new generation of players. "It's funny really. I'm actually enjoying my practice more then ever. I play for fun now. I still try to be the best I can be, but I don't have to be so serious about being so committed to it. "Me and my mates play a lot these days."	Five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan says he no longer has any interest in being snooker's "top man" but has not retired.
The East Superleague side fell behind when Paul Quinn fired in from a corner for his second goal in two games. Rose drew level through a Jamie Reckord own goal, but Graham and Alex Schalk put the Premiership side in control. However, the semi-professionals refused to buckle and Ruari MacLennan scored his fourth cup goal before Graham pounced to finally settle the tie. While County move into the quarter-final draw, the first junior side to reach the last 16 of the competition were far from disgraced. It is an indication of the strength of his squad that County manager Jim McIntyre was able to make six changes to the side that beat Celtic in last week's League Cup semi final. There was certainly no sign of disruption early on as the Premiership outfit raced into the lead in their first serious attack after a bright start by the visitors. Colin Leiper nearly headed Ian McShane's corner into his own net with Ryan Baptie clearing off the line, but the ball broke to Quinn, who hammered home from 12 yards for his second goal since his return from Aberdeen. Many would have expected the Rose to wilt after that fourth-minute setback, but they showed real character to take the game to the Staggies and create a couple of decent chances. Conor Kelly fired a shot over the bar from the edge of the box then Tommy Coyne swapped passes with Graham Weir before forcing Gary Woods into a save from a similar distance. County's main threat continued to be from set pieces, with Quinn and Raffa De Vita going close, while Linlithgow goalkeeper Ally Adams made an outstanding diving save low to his left to prevent Brian Graham converting Jonathan Franks' inviting cross. Rose have shown resilience throughout their Scottish Cup adventure and, after Ruari McLennan then Blair Batchelor had shots blocked, Scott Boyd blasted it off the goal-line against Reckord and into the empty net to spark wild celebrations among the Rose players and their large travelling support. They continued to give as good as they got at the start of the second half, with Batchelor forcing Woods into a save, but the Premiership side's superiority at set pieces paid off. McShane whipped in another corner from the left and Graham raced clear to head home from six yards. Schalk finally killed off the tie five minutes later as Jackson Irvine found space in the box to head on for the Dutchman to slam the ball in from close range. Back came the junior side with a slick passing move climaxed by MacLennan's finish in 75 minutes only for the Staggies to spoil any chance of a fairytale finish. Graham scored his seventh goal of the season with a shot from the edge of the area to leave Rose to concentrate on next week's Scottish Junior Cup tie away to Kilwinning Rangers.	Brian Graham's double helped Ross County end junior side Linlithgow Rose's brave Scottish Cup run.
Another 130 people were wounded in what authorities said was a "premeditated, violent terrorist attack". Four suspects were shot dead, one arrested and other are being sought Xinhua said. City officials said evidence implicated militants from the western region of Xinjiang, but this was not verified. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have sent condolences to the victims and their families. President Xi urged "all-out efforts" to investigate the attack. "Severely punish in accordance with the law the violent terrorists and resolutely crack down on those who have been swollen with arrogance," Xinhua quoted the president as saying. Witnesses said that the men, who were mostly dressed in black, attacked people at random. A survivor named Yang Haifei, who was wounded in the back and chest, told Xinhua he had been buying a train ticket when the attackers rushed into the station. "I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone," he said. He added that those too slow to flee were cut down. Some who escaped were desperately looking for missing loved ones. Yang Ziqing told Xinhua she and her husband had been waiting for a train to Shanghai "when a knife-wielding man suddenly came at them". "I can't find my husband, and his phone went unanswered,"  she said. Social media users in China posted pictures of the attack on the internet, but correspondents say they are being taken down. Images seen by the BBC show men and women lying on the floor in pools of blood following the attack. Kunming officials, quoted by Xinhua, later said that evidence at the scene showed it was "a terrorist attack carried out by Xinjiang separatist forces". Xinjiang is home to the Muslim Uighur minority group which has a long history of discord with Chinese authorities. State broadcaster CCTV said top security official Meng Jianzhu would travel to Kunming to oversee the handling of the investigation.	An attack by knife-wielding men at a railway station in Kunming in south-west China has left at least 29 dead, the state news agency Xinhua says.
Adele Bellis, then 22, lost an ear, is now partially bald and was left with "life-changing" permanent scarring. The attack, at a bus stop in Lowestoft, Suffolk, on 14 August 2014, was ordered by her ex-boyfriend Anthony Riley, 27, Ipswich Crown Court was told. Jason Harrison, 39, from Lowestoft, admits the attack and said Mr Riley promised to reduce a drugs debt. Mr Riley, of Raglan Street, Lowestoft, denies false imprisonment, conspiracy to apply a corrosive liquid and conspiracy to cause GBH with intent. Harrison claims a "jealous" Mr Riley recruited him as part of a campaign to "humiliate and control" his partner of nearly seven years. But he had been reluctant to go through with the attack until Mr Riley threatened to harm him, his girlfriend and family, he said. He owed Mr Riley Â£10,000 and would be let off some of it if he carried out the attack, he said. Mr Riley told him where she lived and gave him Â£500 and a coffee jar containing sulphuric acid, the jury was told. He aborted two attacks causing Mr Riley to punch him and put a knife in his mouth, Mr Harrison said. "I didn't want to do this attack. I'm not a violent person," he said. Prosecutor Andrew Jackson had earlier told the court Mr Riley arranged for co-defendant Leon Thompson, 39, to stab Miss Bellis in the face and posted a revenge porn sex video on Facebook. Mr Thompson, 39, of Alma Road, Lowestoft, denies wounding with intent, having a knife in public, conspiracy to apply a corrosive liquid and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial continues	A man threw acid in a beautician's face because he feared for his life, family and girlfriend, a court has heard.
Many of Paris's tourist attractions, including the Louvre and the Musee d'Orsay, closed on Saturday amid heightened security. The institutions reopened at 13:00 local time following a minute's silence to honour those who were killed. However the Eiffel Tower will remain closed until further notice. A message on the tower's website added "the Eiffel Tower will not sparkle" on Monday night, during the period of national mourning, at the request of Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. A total of 129 people died in the attacks by Islamist militants. People were targeted in bars and restaurants, the Bataclan concert hall and the Stade de France. In explaining the decision to reopen the venues, French Culture Minister Fleur Pellerin said although France had suffered a tragic event, "culture is more than ever this symbolic place of self-discovery". Ms Pellerin added the government would help to boost security measures at public cultural institutions in Ile-de-France, the region immediately surrounding Paris. Its landmarks include the Louvre, which houses Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, as well as the Eiffel Tower and the Notre Dame Cathedral. Eighty-nine people died at the Bataclan venue, where US rock band Eagles of Death Metal had been performing. Many concerts scheduled to take place in Paris over the weekend, including those by U2, Motorhead, Foo Fighters and Deftones, were also cancelled. Cinemas were also ordered to close following Friday's attacks, but most reopened on Sunday.	Public museums and other cultural venues in Paris have reopened following the attacks in the French capital on Friday.
IS militants launched at least four suicide attacks, with reports saying at least 25 people were killed. The first of the attacks was near the Turkish border crossing. It is thought to be the first fighting in that area. The battle for Kobane has left hundreds of people dead and forced more than 200,000 to flee into Turkey. The US-led coalition is supporting the town's defenders with air strikes. Turkey has allowed some Kurdish fighters from Iraq to travel through its territory to assist in defending Kobane. However, Turkey views Kurdish forces with suspicion, following a decade-long battle for autonomy by its own Kurdish minority. IS controls large swathes of both Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The militants have been trying to overrun Kobane for the past two months. In the early stages, it looked as though the town's fall was only a matter of time. But the Kurdish fighters have defended tenaciously and kept hold of roughly half the town. They have been supported by a small number of well-armed Iraqi Kurdish fighters, some other Syrian opposition units, and of course by the coalition air strikes. The first suicide vehicle bomb targeted a Kurdish position close to the Turkish border at dawn on Saturday. Kurdish sources said the bomber had crossed from Turkey, but Turkish officials denied this as "lies". Clashes followed at the site of the attack and to the south-west of the town. The UK-based activist group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said there were three more suicide bombings - one an individual with a suicide vest and the other two vehicle bombs. As the clashes intensified, there were reports that IS had brought up tanks to join the fighting. Meanwhile two US-led air strikes were carried out against IS positions in the east of Kobane. In all, 25 people were killed in the clashes, most of them IS fighters, reports said. IS has captured parts of the town and dozens of villages in the area around it in an offensive lasting more than two months. But it has met stiff resistance from local Kurdish fighters, who have held about half the town assisted by small numbers of Iraqi Kurds and Syrian Arabs, and backed by US-led air strikes.	Fighting has intensified in the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane, where Kurdish forces have been holding Islamic State at bay since September.
The Gold Hill Cheese Run sees entrants run up the cobbled Shaftesbury street with a 55lb (25kg) cheese. The event, based on activities of cheese traders in years gone by, began in 2012 as part of the town's food festival. Barnaby Cox, 18, who has won the race twice, has put his success down to "technique and power". Organiser Charlie Turnbull said the event was a tribute to a millennia of cheese making in the Blackmore Vale, with "slightly mad" participants racing with the locally-made cheeses which are 35cm (14") in diameter. "Each one takes up to 500 pints of milk - that's a lot of effort from a lot of cows. But they are not very convenient to carry up a hill." The street was made famous when it was used in a Hovis bread television advertisement filmed by Ridley Scott in 1973. It depicted a boy struggling to get up the street on his bicycle to deliver bread to the sounds of Antonin Dvorak's New World Symphony.	A cheese-carrying race up a famous Dorset street is due to take place later.
The blast in a town in Puebla state was apparently caused by thieves attempting to steal fuel from the pipeline. Oil gushed through the streets and caught fire, destroying homes and cars and forcing hundreds of people to flee. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has visited the scene and promised to launch an investigation. Puebla State Secretary Valentin Meneses said the explosion injured 52 people as well as destroying 32 houses and damaging scores more in San Martin Texmelucan - a small community about 80km (50 miles) east of Mexico City. He said that according to early indications, a criminal gang had punctured the pipeline. "They lost control because of the high pressure with which the fuel exits the pipeline. The streets began to flood, then came a spark and we saw rivers of fire in the streets," he said. In pictures: Mexico pipeline blast One local resident said she awoke at about 0530 local time to a strange, overpowering smell, like petrol. Minutes later, her street looked as if it was flowing in tar, and then it erupted in flames. Her husband knocked down a wall, allowing them to escape from the back of their home. "It was like we were living in an inferno. Everything was covered in smoke," she said, quoted by AP news agency. The fire was brought under control by midday, and the state oil monopoly Pemex said it had shut the pipeline down. President Calderon arrived in the town later on Sunday to survey the damage and visit the injured. He offered his condolences to the victims' families and said those responsible for the incident would be brought to justice. Pemex says that theft of oil from its pipelines is a chronic problem, costing it hundreds of millions of dollars a year.	At least 28 people have been killed and many others injured in an oil pipeline explosion in central Mexico, officials say.

The 25-year-old man reportedly calls himself Harald Hitler. The man, sporting a side parting and a trademark moustache, had been seen having his photograph taken outside the house in Braunau am Inn in which Adolf Hitler was born. The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. "The young man knows exactly what he is doing," the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists. But as the Nazis began to lose control in 1944, it was shut.	A Hitler lookalike has been arrested in Austria on charges of glorifying the Nazi era, local officials say.
Slovakian Imrich Joni, 20, stabbed and strangled Gordon Bolan, 68, at a flat in Kenmure Street in Pollokshields last summer. An earlier trial at the High Court in Edinburgh heard that Joni hid the pensioner's body in a wardrobe. Judge Lady Scott described it as "a brutal murder" which had left Mr Bolam's family "utterly devastated". Joni, who lived at various addresses in the south side of Glasgow, murdered Mr Bolam at a date between 29 June and 14 July 2016. In April, he was found guilty of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. When he appeared for sentencing on Tuesday, the court heard the 20-year-old - who had denied any wrongdoing during his week long trial - had now accepted he killed Mr Bolam. The court was told he had expressed "genuine remorse" for his actions because he could not continue living with "the lie" of denying his guilt. His trial heard that Joni struck Mr Bolam with a knife before throttling him with a piece of fabric at an address in Kenmure Street. He then concealed his victim's remains in a bedroom wardrobe. In a bid to cover up his crime and destroy DNA evidence, the murderer then washed upholstery, floors and other surfaces. He also got rid of his trainers and the clothing he was wearing on the day he murdered Mr Bolam. But Joni was caught after detectives found his DNA around Mr Bolam's property. Forensic scientists also discovered his DNA on the ligature which was placed around Mr Bolam's throat. Defence advocate John Scott QC told the court that his client was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder caused by years of being physically abused by a family member. Telling Joni that he was likely to be deported from the UK following his release from custody, judge Lady Scott said: "Mr Bolam was a man who struggled with ill health but nevertheless lived a normal life. He was a much-loved member of his community. "His family have been left bereft and utterly devastated by his death. "I accept that you have expressed genuine remorse. I also take into account that you have suffered emotional and physical abuse and that you are a young man with post traumatic stress disorder. "This was a brutal murder. Balancing all these factors I have decided that you must serve at least 13 years before you become eligible to apply for parole."	A man who murdered a pensioner at his home in Glasgow has been ordered to spend a minimum of 13 years in jail.
City remain without long-term absentees Gabriel Jesus and Ilkay Gundogan. Liverpool will assess forward Roberto Firmino, who missed last weekend's win against Burnley with a minor injury. Dejan Lovren, who has been nursing a knee problem, played for the under-23 side on Monday and is fit to make his first senior appearance since January. Divock Origi is doubtful because of a knock and illness, while injured duo Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge will again miss out. Steve Wilson: "Pep Guardiola is well used to managing his sides through a sequence of big games. However, it is unlikely that with either Barcelona or Bayern Munich he approached such a run with each fixture so laced with the danger of defeat. "After Liverpool at the Etihad, Guardiola travels to Arsenal and Chelsea as a prelude to pitting his wits against Arsene Wenger again in the FA Cup semi-final. "City might win the lot - but, after Monaco, Guardiola surely cannot completely silence the nagging voice which says that they could also lose the lot. "Jurgen Klopp will have studied Monaco's approach to beating City and concluded that it was not so very far removed from his own preferred modus operandi - an approach which earned Liverpool a thumping win at City last season." Twitter: @Wilsonfooty Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: "I have heard people have written that I will change 12 or 13 players [this summer]. That is impossible. They have contracts. You have to pay them. "We will try and improve the team. Next month and a half I expect a huge step forward. Next season will be better. Just because they are out of contract doesn't mean they will all leave. Some will stay." Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on Guardiola: "I am not in doubt about his quality. Maybe a few people are but I am not. I respect him a lot. "I know probably a few people think (differently) now they are out of the Champions League but I think the way they played was quite impressive as Monaco. "City could have won the game easily in the second half but because they are human beings they missed a few chances. For me City is the most difficult team to play. I know their image at this moment in this country is a little bit different." There could be a backlash from City after their defeat by Monaco but, even if there is, I don't see them keeping a clean sheet. The Reds will get chances but they will have work to do at the other end too. I am going for a draw, which I think Liverpool would take now.

Jamie Leek of Clifton, Nottingham died in Zante in June 2012 when he was hit by motorcyclist Spiridon Koklas. A Greek appeal court has upheld his sentence of four years and 10 months but suspended it for three years. Jamie's mother Lydia said the family "feel cheated of justice". "We are mortified by this and at a loss for words. We have to accept it is probably the end of the line in legal terms," she said. Jamie and his family were on holiday in the resort of Kalamaki to celebrate his parent's 10th anniversary when he was hit crossing the road with his father. More updates from across the East Midlands The day he died was his ninth birthday. Mr Leek suffered a broken arm in the accident but Jamie died later in hospital. Koklas was convicted of involuntary homicide and involuntary bodily harm in 2015, but had appealed his sentence. He was not in court for the appeal hearing. After a previous hearing, Mrs Leek said the rider "didn't show any remorse to us at all. He didn't show he was sorry one bit". The family have been supported by Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood, who has asked two prime ministers  - David Cameron and Theresa May to help raise the issue. Both promised the MP they would help the family by contacting the Greek authorities. Ms Greenwood said: "I am really shocked, angry and upset that despite the long quest for justice for their son Jamie it has resulted in what feels like a totally inadequate sentence. "It has taken several years to get to this stage and then for the sentence to be suspended feels like a complete kick in the teeth."	The family of a nine-year-old British boy who died after being hit by a motorcyclist in Greece five years ago are "mortified" that the driver will not be jailed.

The 28-year-old footballer's contract was terminated hours after he was dropped for Saturday's Premier League match against Manchester United. He will stand trial on Friday on two further counts of sexual activity with a child, which he denies. Sportswear firm Adidas has cancelled its contract with the midfielder. After Johnson's arrest in March 2015, the club suspended him, but then lifted the ban following talks with his representatives and the Professional Footballers' Association. In his last appearance for the Black Cats, England international Johnson - who played while on bail - scored in a 2-2 draw against Liverpool at Anfield. Johnson, who was born in Sunderland, began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then to Sunderland for £10m in 2012. When asked about the winger's future at a news conference earlier on Thursday, Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce said: "He'll not be available for this weekend. We will see how it goes after that." The trial of Johnson, who has won 12 England caps, will take place at Bradford Crown Court and is expected to last two weeks.	Adam Johnson has been sacked by Sunderland after pleading guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.
As a result, how - and not just whether - a claimant is able to accomplish tasks like walking and planning journeys will help determine the amount they are entitled to in benefits. Claimants who manage the tasks, but not "reliably", will get higher payments. Ministers admitted there were concerns that the proposals were "unclear". The Personal Independence Payment (PIP) will replace the existing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in April. People who are less mobile will be entitled to higher payments. Campaigners had warned that people deemed capable of walking more than 20 metres could receive lower payments - even if they were unable to do so "safely, reliably, repeatedly and in a reasonable time period". Ministers had previously denied the claim and argued that these words did not need to be written into legally binding regulations. But minister for disabled Esther McVey said on Thursday: "I know that disabled people and their representatives feel strongly that this important concept is set out in law and I am happy to do this." She added: "Our intention has always been the same - we want to target support at those who need it most. "We have always said that we will not just look at whether individuals can carry out activities but also the manner in which they do so." Critics of the government's changes say one third of disabled people live in poverty and an estimated 42% fewer people would be eligible for mobility allowance as a result. In exchanges in the House of Lords last week, Crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson, a Paralympic gold medallist, criticised the government for its "lack of consultation with disabled people" about the proposals. Fellow crossbencher Lord Alton has said the fact people will have specially adapted vehicles taken away from them had caused "widespread disbelief and considerable distress". For ministers, Lord Freud conceded: "I have to accept that there was inadequate discussion of the changes and that there is inadequate understanding of them."	Regulations governing eligibility for benefits for disabled people will be changed after criticism of their likely impact, the government has announced.
But that requires a very patient man or woman to select the most important periods of play. Now scientists in Spain are trying to make that work easier by getting a computer to do it. The technology is being designed to automatically edit a whole game down to the key moments. The people behind it at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia have been working on it for a few years and have just published 18 pages of exactly how it works. Arnau Raventos is the lead professor on the project. He tells Newsbeat they have "been working with the local television companies in Spain in order to try to make the job easier for the person who manually does the summaries currently." Without having to read the full report (we did that for you) - in short - it analyses what are known as key-frames. So, every part of the match is looked over by the computer to spot tell-tale signs of when something interesting is happening. That might be lots of players grouped together, lots of zoomed-in action, extra noise from the crowd or the sound of the referee's whistle. Arnau calls them "occasions". "We want to find specific combinations of moments in a football match. A goal is an occasion." We thought of an example: if a defender goes down in the penalty box, everyone groups around them, you'll hear a whistle, there's lots of faces in the shot and a penalty happens. In theory, the technology should capture that. There is a long way to go though. The technology could frustrate even the most lukewarm of football fans because it hasn't quite nailed exactly the magic moment - when the goal goes in. In a test on five matches, the technology detected 70 per cent of the total goals. "We need to be sincere," says Arnau. "We need to say that at the moment it's not possible to perform a complete automatic summary just yet. It's difficult to detect all the goals." "However, we think it's very easy to discard those moments that are not important. For example, the panoramic views. They are easy to detect and to discard them so that already makes the job of the editor easier."

Stuart Hamilton, 37, was last seen by his friends and family two weeks ago. Hamilton, from Gorgie in Edinburgh, was seen on CCTV at Haymarket Station on Sunday at 10:16. He then travelled by train to Manchester. He was then spotted by a former colleague near Buckingham Palace in London on Tuesday at 13:30. Mr Hamilton is white and of medium build. He is about 6ft 2in with short, dark, receding hair. He was last seen wearing a blue top along with a black hooded top, blue jeans and white trainers. He was also carrying a dark rucksack. Police Scotland has been working with Greater Manchester Police and the Metropolitan Police Service. Insp Jonathan Elliot, of Police Station, said:  "We are continuing our search for Stuart, which has now moved to London. "Anyone who knows Stuart's whereabouts in either Edinburgh, Manchester or London, or recognises his description, is asked to contact police immediately."	A missing man last spotted on CCTV footage taken at an Edinburgh train station has now been seen in central London.
The 32-year-old has agreed a two-year contract with the Rams and is the first signing by manager Gary Rowett. Davies made 29 appearances for Hull last season as they were relegated from the Premier League. "I believe, under this manager for a full season, the squad we've got is capable of promotion or at least the play-offs," he told the Derby website. Davies was with Hull for four years, having previously played for Luton, West Brom, Aston Villa and Birmingham City. He has played more than 460 games as a professional, scoring 26 goals. "I believe that, at my age, people start thinking that you want to wind down and look for a bit of security but that is not the case with me; if I'd have wanted that, I would have stayed at Hull," he said. "This is an opportunity for me to reinvigorate myself. I've enjoyed my time at Hull and there are a lot of people that I'm going to miss but I want to do the best for my career and I believe that is with Derby County." The Rams finished ninth, 13 points outside the Championship play-off places, under Rowett, who was appointed manager in March following the sacking of Steve McClaren.

Officials at Grade II listed Guildford Cathedral said last year it was at risk because of deteriorating plasterwork, which contained asbestos. A £7m fundraising campaign was launched and now has only £500,000 left to meet the final target. Preparatory work will begin next month before building starts in October. The building, which is the last Church of England cathedral to be consecrated on a new site, is visible for miles from its Stag Hill location. Earlier this month, the cathedral was awarded a £4.6m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It has also raised funds from donations and a "buy a brick" campaign, which more than 200,000 people took part in. "Guildford Cathedral is a unique and vital community resource that brings people together," Mayor of Guildford David Elms, told a benefactor reception on Tuesday. "So many have already responded - because saving the cathedral matters." Repairs and improvements will include restoration of the cathedral's organ, better disabled access, new lighting and sound system and making its archive materials more easily available to the public.	A 1960s-built cathedral that was "at serious risk of closure" has raised more than 90% of its £7m target for urgent repairs and development.
Kelly, 25, returned late from a trip home to Australia and was dropped for Saturday's Qualifiers loss to Leigh. Peacock said talks are "ongoing" about resolving the disciplinary issue and whether he will face London on Sunday. Asked if Kelly had a future at the club next season, Peacock told BBC's Super League Show: "It's all down to Albert. At the moment, it's all up in the air." Kelly has been an influential figure for Hull KR since joining at the start of 2015, helping the Robins to last season's Challenge Cup final. A win over Leigh would have put Rovers second in the Qualifiers table, but a 25-18 home defeat left them fourth and battling to preserve their Super League status for next season. Former England captain Peacock continued: "It was a difficult decision to make because at times Albert has played very well for us this year, and just the enormity of the game. "But you show compassion and give someone time to go home, and they stay longer and hamper your preparation for potentially the biggest game of our year so far - you have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. "It's disappointing for me, but his actions end up letting the club, the players and the fans down because he wants to do something outside what we're trying to do as a club." Meanwhile, stand-off Maurice Blair will miss the game against London after being allowed to return home to Australia to attend the funeral of his brother.	Hull KR head of rugby Jamie Peacock is unsure if half-back Albert Kelly will remain at the club in 2017.
The "twisted light" approach relies on what is called light's orbital angular momentum, which has been put forth as an unexploited means to carry data. Now a number of researchers, including some formally commenting in New Journal of Physics, say the idea is misguided. Responding in the same journal, the approach's proponents insist the idea can in time massively boost data rates. That promise is an enticing one for telecommunications firms that are running out of "space" in the electromagnetic spectrum, which is increasingly crowded with allocations for communications, broadcast media and data transmission. So others are weighing in on what could be a high-stakes debate. "This would be worth a Nobel prize, if they're right. Can you imagine, if all communications could be done on one frequency?" asked Bob Nevels of Texas A&M University, a former president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Antennas and Propagation Society. "If they've got such a great thing, why isn't everyone jumping up and down? Because we know it won't work," he told BBC News. The disagreement in New Journal of Physics provides a window on the time-honoured practice of open debate in academic journals (as opposed to the increasingly widespread approach of debating issues before they are even formally published): a kind of "he says, she says" with references. The principle behind the idea is fairly simple. Photons, the most basic units of light, carry two kinds of momentum, a kind of energy-of-motion. One, spin angular momentum, is better known as polarisation. Photons "wiggle" along a particular direction, and different polarisations can be separated out by, for example, polarising sunglasses or 3D glasses. But they also carry orbital angular momentum - in analogy to the Earth-Sun system, the spin angular momentum is expressed in our planet spinning around its axis, while the orbital angular momentum manifests as our revolution around the Sun. The new technique aims to exploit this orbital angular momentum, essentially encoding more data as a "twist" in the light waves. That the phenomenon exists is not in question - it has been put to use recently in studying black holes, for example. What makes the current debate devilishly complex is arguing whether experiments by Bo Thide of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and colleagues really do use and benefit from it. The team has carried out very public demonstrations of the idea, sending data across a Venice lagoon in a test first described in a New Journal of Physics article. But even before that article made it to press, other researchers were questioning the approach's validity. In a paper in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Lund University's Ove Edfors and Anders Johansson argued that what was going on was a version of "multiple input, multiple output" - or Mimo - data transmission, a technique first outlined in the 1970s. "I've been trying to have a discussion with these guys, asking for arguments - because all the arguments they have put forward have been perfectly explainable by standard theories," Prof Edfors told BBC News. "What I get back is 'you don't understand, you're not a physicist', and I say 'well, try to convince me'." Julien Perruisseau-Carrier at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL), and colleagues make much the same argument in their comment paper published this week. But it seems clear that the controversy arises as a conflict between the disciplines of physics and engineering. "These people are physicists, they have their own research," Prof Perruisseau-Carrier told BBC News. "But the authors are trying to spin off some of their work into a telecommunications issue. "The fact is they didn't understand that what they were doing, as we explained, is a subset of something very well-known and documented." Detractors argue that the demonstrations so far have only used two "modes" to transmit information, perfectly replicating a Mimo setup - and that if Prof Thide and colleagues try to extend the work - to the promised tens or hundreds of possible modes, they will fail. For his part, Prof Thide insists that it is the engineers who have misunderstood. "The typical wireless engineer, even if a professor, doesn't know anything about angular momentum," he told BBC News. "The points made by these people... are in contradiction to each and every textbook there is in electrodynamics. This is not something invented by us, something we found out on a coffee break - this is on solid theoretical foundations going back through several Nobel prizes." But the groundswell of resistance to the technique seems to be growing. Prof Nevels and his Texas A&M colleague Laszlo Kish have published a paper in PLOS ONE that they believe is the simple, final proof of its impossibility - and more academics are signing on as co-authors. Prof Perruisseau-Carrier says that the idea will prove itself valid or otherwise soon enough. "They mentioned they have some contact with telecoms companies - we were very happy to see that. There's no doubt that as soon as they defer to a real expert, that people will notice [that the idea is flawed]," he said. "We are convinced that this will not go anywhere."	An idea to vastly increase the carrying capacity of radio and light waves has been called into question.
The pedestrian was hit at the Texaco garage on Roman Farm Road, Hengrove, on Tuesday evening and trapped by the car until it stopped on Creswicke Road. Shakrun Islam, 30, of Chipping Sodbury, is due before Bristol Crown Court on Friday. He was remanded in custody. The victim, Kyle Clarke, died at the scene from his injuries. His mother, Helen Stockford, said in a family statement: "We would like to thank the public and the emergency services for all their support on Tuesday night. "We would ask the media for privacy at this time to allow us to grieve in peace."	A man has appeared before magistrates in Bristol charged with murder after a man was knocked down and dragged under a moving car.
In England, only schools with academy status are allowed to form trusts to sponsor weaker schools. And, the Local Government Association said, a shortage of "good quality" sponsors often left failing schools "in the dark about their future". Ministers said there was no legal frame for council schools to be sponsors. The Local Government Association says 91% of council maintained schools are rated  good or outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted - so they should be allowed "to play a direct role in raising education standards and improving life chances, including taking on the running of failing academies". New analysis of Ofsted ratings for the LGA by education analysts Angel Solutions found a higher percentage of good and outstanding grades among council maintained schools than among academies. Of 14,890 council maintained schools inspected, 91% are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, compared with 85% of 5,058 academies, say the researchers. There are wide variations within the academy category, with sponsored academies, which are forced into academy status after poor Ofsted ratings, predictably faring worse than converter academies, which must be rated good or outstanding before being allowed to convert. The LGA points out that the majority of academies are converter academies. Inspection ratings for 4,103 converter academies showed 89% rated good or outstanding but among the 955 sponsored academies inspected the figure was only 65%, according to the analysis. Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said the figures proved councils had "the track record, experience and expertise to help lift schools out of academic failure". "The government must commit to removing the unnecessary red tape and give high performing maintained schools the option of becoming academy sponsors. "Councils want to be regarded as improvement partners, not obstructionists to school improvement," said Mr Watts, who is also the leader of Islington Council. "With a shortage of academy sponsors and struggling schools currently in the dark about their future the simplest remedy is to give councils the power to turn these schools around where this is the best option locally." Mr Watts also voiced concerns about the local knowledge and capacity of the eight Regional Schools Commissioners, whose job is to oversee academic standards. He said that without the help of councils "the early warning signs of failing" risked being overlooked. "It is not acceptable that we have to wait for poor exam results, whistle-blowing about financial impropriety or an Ofsted inspection to trigger intervention. "Councils are best placed to oversee school effectiveness and take immediate action where required," added Mr Watts. A Department for Education spokesman said there was no legal framework for a council or council-run school to sponsor a school unless they opened a trust - and this would involve converting to academy status. "We would encourage good or outstanding council-run schools to apply to become a sponsor so they can share their expertise," said the spokesman. The spokesman said councils could not run multi-academy trusts "as legally less than 20% of members and trustees are allowed to be 'local authority influenced' to ensure the trust remains autonomous from the local authority".	A ban on top council-run schools sponsoring failing schools amounts to "red tape" and should be dropped, say council bosses.
Following an eighth-placed finish in 2015, Swansea endured a run of just two wins in 17 Premier League games before Francesco Guidolin was named as their new head coach on 18 January. Salomon Rondon's last-gasp equaliser on Tuesday denied them a win at West Brom. "We might have [not have] won, but I definitely think we are seeing the old Swansea again," Sigurdsson said. "We are playing much better than we were. Things weren't good [earlier this season]. "We weren't playing well and keeping the ball like we used to - that's hopefully changing now." Swansea were in unfamiliar territory after the departure of former boss Garry Monk on 9 December and the playing squad faced criticism. But after Tuesday's 1-1 draw, Baggies' Welsh boss Tony Pulis believes the Swans have enough quality to avoid relegation from the Premier League this season. "When in possession, they pass the ball so well and could have scored two or three goals," Pulis said. "I think Swansea have too much quality to not stay up." Sigurdsson, the Swans' goal-scorer at the Hawthorns, is currently on his best run of goal-scoring form since his initial loan spell at the Liberty Stadium in 2012, scoring in four of his five appearances so far in 2016. And the Iceland international felt the Swans had done enough to earn a third straight win on Tuesday. "It feels a bit like a defeat, to lead coming into the last few minutes," Sigurdsson added. "We played really well, until the last few minutes. But if you'd have offered us seven points from our last three games, we'd have taken that." Swansea currently lie in 16th place in the Premier League table ahead of home clashes with Crystal Palace and Southampton.	The "old Swansea City" are back after earning seven points from three games, says midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson.
Steven Souley, 26, and his accomplice Zico Malavin, 20, were remanded in custody after they admitted attacking Robert Eadie, 25, in Glasgow in 2014. The victim required surgery to repair a wound to his groin and penis after being hit with an axe and knife. Souley was previously jailed for seven years for killing a man in 2010. Sentence on both accused was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow after they admitted assaulting Mr Eadie to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. The court heard that the attack happened at a Christmas party hosted by Mr Eadie's sister at her flat in the city's Summerston area. Souley and Malavin, who were not invited, turned up at about midnight. Souley was armed with an axe and Malavin - who was wearing a red Christmas jumper - was clutching a knife. Mr Eadie's sister, who knew the pair, demanded that they leave. Her brother was attacked after he tried to put them out of the flat. Souley and Malavin both fled the scene and police and paramedics were called. A knife and a Christmas sweater were later found at a property linked to Souley. It was months later that the pair were charged. The court heard that Mr Eadie needed an operation to repair a "deep wound" to his groin and to his penis. He also suffered injuries to his head and hand. He was released from hospital days later, but will be permanently scarred. Souley and Malavin, both from the city's Drumchapel area, will be sentenced next month. Souley was jailed in 2011 after being convicted of the culpable homicide of 41-year-old Andrew Curran. In May 2014 he was deemed safe enough to be freed early. Zico Malavin's brothers were both found guilty of murder over the attack on Mr Curran. Angus Malavin was jailed for 18 years and younger brother Zak for 17 years. Mr Curran died from a sword wound to the neck. The fatal park attack happened following a row over a bottle of Buckfast. A fourth Malavin brother, Kris, was jailed for seven years in 2014 after he tried to run down and kill a key witness in the murder trial.	A convicted killer has been sent back to jail after he admitted carrying out a brutal attack on Christmas Day, months after being freed early.
The 29-year-old world number 21 took the first game 12-10 after an impressive trick-shot between his legs with the scores tied at 10-10. But Egypt's 2014 US Open winner edged the second and third games 11-9 and 12-10 before winning the fourth 11-5. Simpson had beaten Egypt's Karim Ali Fathi in the opening round. "Played my first trick shot today. Wanna know how I did it? Me too....," Simpson wrote on Twitter after the match.	Guernsey's Chris Simpson has been knocked out of the US Open, despite pushing world number one Mohamed El Shorbagy in their second-round tie.
But now that she's wielded a dagger and showed off her martial arts moves to dispatch the undead as a very modern Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Lily James wants to play action heroes. When a film starts with the line "it is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains", it is clear this is going to be no ordinary period drama adaptation. The corsets and courtship are still there, but so is a horde of the undead, rampaging through the 19th Century countryside and the world that Jane Austen fans hold so dear. "When I heard the title, I was a bit confused," admitted James. "I was slightly cynical about the idea of putting zombies into Jane Austen, but literally within a few pages of the script I was sold and I loved it. "I thought, what a fresh, exciting, fun way to revisit this story. And it was this idea of being an action hero - I just loved it. "I want to be an action hero forever more." One of her main sparring partners was Sam Riley, who plays Colonel Darcy, with their verbal battles as imagined by Austen made rather more physical. "When I was hitting Sam, I would get a bit carried away," James confessed. "He was really gentlemanly, and wouldn't tell me until after. "But I was really going for him a bit hard, so he was pretty bruised. You get caught up in the heat of the moment and the adrenalin. You forget you're actually not meant to punch them for real." She says she was more inspired by films like The Terminator when preparing for the role, rather than re-watching famous adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. "I needed Liz Bennet to feel quite tough," explained James. "So I watched Linda Hamilton in The Terminator and Angelina Jolie and tried to channel their strength." She also watched YouTube clips, forwarded to her by her trainer, to see the "grace, skill and accuracy" needed in martial arts. Putting this spin on the story brings Liz Bennet, as she prefers to call her, up to date and makes the story "more modern", said James. "She's breaking the mould, she's not giving in to that structure in life. She's already such an independent, fierce character, and in this version even more so, because she's a fighter - so it's total girl power, total strength." Australian actress Bella Heathcote, who plays "sensible" older sister Jane, agreed it was "great" that the Bennet sisters are the ones who save the day in the new film. "It's pretty rare for one woman to be the heroine, let alone five of us," she said, adding that while "everyone said it could have been horrible having five girls all together", there was no cattiness within the group. She insisted Jane is "still the nice girl" in this version, "but she gets to kick ass and kill a few zombies". Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies novel was on the New York Times bestseller list for more than 41 weeks. This film adaptation had been planned since 2009 but there were delays due to changes in the cast and crew, including the role of Elizabeth, which was originally lined up for Natalie Portman - now producer of the film. Some Austen fans may not appreciate their beloved romance being infiltrated by brain-guzzling zombies, but James said the point of the film was to reach out to people who may not otherwise "engage with the classic". "I think we've taken Pride and Prejudice and handled it with absolute love and care," she said. "We're all huge fans of Jane Austen and we've been incredibly sensitive and the story is the heart of the movie still. The characters and the action is propelled by the brilliant plot." Heathcote agreed that classics are there for the taking when it comes to bringing them up to date for a modern audience. "I feel like people shouldn't be precious with them," she said. "They're not precious with Shakespeare - they do all kinds of interpretations and settings. "So why not do it with all the classics? Because otherwise, they're going to be dated and going to be forgotten." And what would Austen herself have thought? "I think she'd have loved it," said James, adding that the author "had a great sense of humour". Much of the humour in the film comes from Parson Collins, played by Doctor Who star Matt Smith - who is James's partner. "He just improvised and made everything up," she said. "I was laughing so much, he was so funny." The end of the film hints at a sequel - and James and Heathcote both said they would love that to happen - but critics have not been entirely convinced. Mark Kermode wrote in the Observer that the mash-up "lacks bite", the Financial Times said "the title is the funniest thing", Variety thought it "awkward and unsatisfying", and Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian said it "seems like it's just laughing at Austen". But the Radio Times described it as "perversely clever", saying it "works like a charm", and Geoffrey Macnab in the Independent gave it four stars, saying it was "energetic and occasionally inspired". James is currently in the US, filming Baby Driver, in which she plays an American diner waitress. But perhaps she shouldn't stop the Shaolin martial arts moves training just yet - after all, there's still Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters ready to be adapted. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is in UK cinemas now.	She is best known for period dramas - having been seen most recently in War and Peace and Downton Abbey.
The 34-year-old England international, who scored 15 league goals last season, has signed a three-year deal. "It's great to be back," said Defoe, who as a teenager spent the 2000-01 season on loan at Bournemouth from West Ham, scoring in 10 successive matches. "It was an easy decision, joining a top team with a top manager. The one thing I can guarantee is goals." The former Tottenham, Portsmouth, West Ham and Charlton player is seventh on the Premier League all-time goals list with 158 in 468 appearances. Cherries manager Eddie Howe said Defoe's signing is a "huge moment for the club". Defoe moved to Sunderland in January 2015 after a brief spell at MLS side Toronto and, after saving the club from relegation in the 2015-16 season with 15 goals, signed a contract extension until 2019. There was a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave on a free transfer if Sunderland were relegated, which he was able to trigger when the Black Cats finished bottom last season. Defoe made his England debut in 2004 and played at the 2010 World Cup, but did not feature for the national side between 2013 and 2017. His excellent form last season earned him a recall to Gareth Southgate's side, and he scored his 20th international goal against Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier in March. Defoe is Bournemouth's second signing of the summer, following the arrival of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic from Chelsea. "We want to bring players here who can have a big impact on our continued rise and we believe Jermain fits that as a natural, proven goalscorer," added Howe. The Cherries finished ninth in the Premier League last term - their second season in the top flight. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has re-signed for former club Bournemouth on a free transfer.
Estimated figures from its Federal Statistical Office said gross domestic product was 1.9% higher last year than in 2015. The annual figure is based on an early estimated that growth was around 0.5% in the fourth quarter. However, the actual fourth quarter figure will not be released until early next month. The 1.9% figure for 2016 was slightly above expectations, and builds on the growth rate of 1.6% in 2014 and 1.7% for 2015. Germany's exports were up by 2.4%, but that was outstripped by import growth of 3.4%. Household spending grew by 2%, while government spending was up by 4.2%, partly because of an increase in spending on assisting the vast numbers of asylum seekers the country has taken on. The country has enjoyed seven years of economic growth. Unusually for a developed country, it has a budget surplus. Last year's totalled 0.6% of gross domestic product, down a touch on 2015's 0.7%.	Germany's economy stepped up its pace of growth in 2016, thanks to higher household and government spending.
Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the "core funding" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. "The funding system is chaotic," says Byron Rhodes. "It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example," he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? "If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money." Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only  17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run authorities such as Derby, Leicester and Nottingham, got nothing. The leader of Derby City Council, Ranjit Banwait, has launched a "fair funding for Derby" campaign. He says the allocation of government funding is unfair and political and the cuts they're having to impose on leisure services and culture are devastating. "Now they are threatening our ability to protect the vulnerable and our ability to function is under threat," said Mr Banwait. Back in Melton Mowbray, Byron Rhodes has some sympathy for the Labour council in Derby. "Derby probably have some greater needs," he says. But once more he is talking about seizing an opportunity in a crisis. Leicestershire's finance team are working on a submission to put to the government with good arguments on how to restructure the way funds are allocated. "We're going to do it. We're going to work up a system which is fairer." He has the backing of local MPs and is talking to neighbouring authorities. And with a hand out to Derby, he says: "If they want to talk to us about how to improve things I'm happy to speak to them." It's a crucial time to get things right. The government is moving to a system where, by 2020, the grant will go. Councils will instead get an allocation of funds from the business rates instead. How they come up a formula for doing that in a fair way, which helps those authorities with most need, is the next challenge.	"It's all about taking an opportunity in a crisis," says the outgoing Conservative leader of Melton Borough Council.
Victoria Police posted a public appeal on Monday to locate Daniel Damon who is wanted for failing to answer bail for traffic and drug matters. Damon replied to the post and to a number of other users commenting on the situation. He told police he would turn himself in after getting things "organised". "Can you use a better photo tho. This is a horrible mugshot," said Damon, 25, in response to the warrant. "Hi Daniel, please visit your nearest police station and we'll arrange for a new photo to be taken!" police replied. "Yea I plan on it once I get a few things in order... just gotta organise myself a lawyer and get everything organised," he said. Police describe Damon as 180cm tall (5ft 11in), medium build, with brown hair and eyes and a fair complexion. He also has numerous body tattoos. Senior Constable Melissa Seach told the BBC that police were making enquiries to locate him but he had not turned himself in. She said police officer sometimes used social media as a tool as part of their investigation and it had led to good results in some cases. "This may encourage someone that may know him to call us and provide information anonymously to crime stoppers," she said. Damon's post was commented on by various people with some commending his sense of humour. But most were keen on Damon being brought to justice. "Yes think you may need that sense of humour where your going Danny boy," said Sue Hartley. "This bloke is too arrogant for his own good," said Ajay Conodie. "Victoria Police, he's not very good looking is he? Don't bother with any more photos," said Julie Benic Duck.	An Australian man is still at large after an exchange with police on Facebook where he asked them to change his mugshot.
Shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle called the rumoured plans "unacceptable interference". A BBC source said it would be odd to make it harder for people to watch programmes they had paid for. The government denied it intended to determine the scheduling of programmes. Details are expected in this month's White Paper on BBC Charter renewal. 'External regulation' A number of Sunday newspapers carry reports suggesting the BBC will be called upon to defend its scheduling where rivals are unfavourably impacted. A government source told the Sunday Times the White Paper was intended to "set a broad set of principles and guidelines". "How that is applied to individual programmes and scheduling is a matter for them. But they will be subject to external regulation." It could see the BBC forced to move popular shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, or the recent BBC One hit The Night Manager, from peak-time slots on a Saturday or Sunday night - ending the traditional ratings wars. In the past ITV has criticised the BBC for "aggressive scheduling" citing, among others, the conflict between The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. Mr Whittingdale has previously expressed concerns about the BBC's flagship News at Ten bulletin being broadcast at the same time as ITV's. Ms Eagle said:  "John Whittingdale is behaving as if he were running the BBC - he is not. "This kind of meddling in day-to-day scheduling decisions would be a completely unacceptable interference in the independence of the BBC. "The public will wonder why the government is interfering with the BBC, and why they are trying to dictate when they can schedule hugely popular programmes like Strictly Come Dancing." The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said no final decisions had been taken, but added: "The Secretary of State has made it clear on a number of occasions that the government cannot, and indeed should not, determine either the content or scheduling of programmes." Media commentator Steve Hewlett said he thought there would be something in the charter "more general" about the BBC's approach to its impact. "In other words, increasing the BBC's sensitivity to its impact on commercial competitors. "Not just in TV and radio but also online and amongst the newspaper publishers. "I'd be very, very surprised if there is a specific injunction not to schedule any particular programme anywhere because it's far too detailed, it's exactly what the government or the regulators shouldn't be doing." The BBC source denied "aggressively scheduling" but added: "We do show programmes at the times people want to watch them". "Research has shown that an element of competition drives up quality across the industry and the public would be deeply concerned if the BBC's ability to show programmes such as Strictly, Doctor Who, and Sherlock, at the times convenient to them were taken away. "It would be odd to make it harder for people to find and watch the programmes they have already paid for." A recent independent report into the BBC, commissioned by the government, researched the impact of scheduling similar shows at the same time. The report, published in February, concluded the impact was "not statistically significant", calculating a dip of no more than 1% in viewing figures, irrespective of whether it was a drama or a light entertainment show. The only noticeable impact it found was where the BBC and ITV schedule the same type of dramas - such as crime - at the same time.	Labour has accused Culture Secretary John Whittingdale of "meddling" after reports he will allow commercial broadcasters to challenge the BBC over peak-time scheduling.
A 34-year-old man was arrested in connection with an outstanding warrant and is expected to appear at Glasgow Sherriff Court on Monday. A 15-year-old male was arrested for offensive behaviour and resisting arrest and a 16-year-old male was arrested for offensive behaviour. Three men were arrested outside the stadium in connection with assault. The men, aged 29, 28 and 27, and all from Glasgow, are expected to appear at Aberdeen Sherriff Court on Monday. Police said the two teenagers will be reported to the relevant authorities. Match Commander Supt Innes Walker said: "The vast majority of fans from both football clubs followed the advice given and conducted themselves appropriately. "The policing operation was assisted by specialist resources including the horses, the dog unit and roads policing and we appreciate the support of the overwhelming majority of fans and members of the public in allowing the Friday night game to be enjoyed and pass safely." Celtic won the match 3-1.	A total of six people were arrested after the Aberdeen v Celtic game at Pittodrie on Friday.
The 35-year-old has been without a club since  at the end of last season. Morrison scored nine goals in 36 games for Ireland and was part of their squad at the 2002 World Cup. The striker is available to play for Exeter in their League Two game at Accrington on Friday night. Morrison began his career at Palace in 1997 and scored 71 goals in 181 games before moving to Birmingham City for club-record fee of £4.25m in 2002. After three seasons at St Andrews he returned to Palace for £2m before moving to Coventry City in 2008. He spent two seasons at the Ricoh Arena before moving on to Sheffield Wednesday, and after loans at MK Dons and Brentford, joined Colchester in 2012.	Exeter City have signed former Republic of Ireland, Crystal Palace and Birmingham City striker Clinton Morrison on non-contract terms.
Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone. ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second. Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish. Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership. Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box. When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead. Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence. St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals. It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal. Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves. There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead. They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away. St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick. Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory. St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems. "Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well. "Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet." Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season. "You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today. "I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games. "But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January).

The girl, aged 15 at the time, had met a man called David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in the autumn of 2004. The defendant, now 34 and called Davina, denied the charge. She will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody and said it was likely she would be held at a male prison. He added: "If I were to release on bail there are substantial grounds to believe she would be a risk to herself and a risk of failing to attend for whatever reason. "I will therefore have to remand in custody. It will have to be a male prison in Winchester but it will be an issue for the prison service." He also told the jury at Portsmouth Crown Court: "It's been a slightly unusual case and it's not been an easy case." The court heard that Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, attempted to commit suicide last summer. Protocols have been put in place for her detention at the prison, a court officer explained. During the trial Ayrton spoke about her sexuality, and said she she had not "made any physical changes or enhancements" to her body or taken any medication. She changed her name in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court was told she raped the teenager while two others were asleep in the garage. The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had "only drunk a can and a half of Foster's" and clearly recollected the events. The court heard that in 2014 Ayrton told a worker at the care home where she lived in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack.	A transgender woman has been found guilty of raping a girl when still living as a man.
Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: "China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. "Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of  natural resources that were available in the immediate environment." These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. "We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places." The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was "a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today". "We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago," he added. "And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party." The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: "It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. "The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink."

Media playback is not supported on this device Then you look at the statistics, and a more complicated picture emerges: a 30-point winning margin but less possession than Italy, less territory, more tackles missed and fewer line breaks made. Nit-picking or nagging doubts? That is the problem with thrilling wins like the one in Cardiff: they inflate expectations, convince the giddy that a team is not just ascendant but untroubled. England started slowly, again, and were once again behind with a quarter of the contest gone. They then took control for half an hour, played with pace and imagination and considerable verve, and were out of sight by the time Italy staged their late and immaterial fight-back. That will be enough for some. In the corresponding fixture two years ago Stuart Lancaster's men were held try-less. In Jonathan Joseph they had not only Saturday's outstanding performer but a young dancer and dasher who is terrifying defenders and delighting supporters every time he is given the ball. Lancaster, for one, wants more. Miss 22 tackles in Dublin on Sunday week and he knows dreams of a Grand Slam will remain exactly that. Give away breakdown penalties to a side with a player who can kick off the tee - Ireland's Johnny Sexton will not be as profligate as Italy 10 Kelly Haimona - and it will be a far steeper road back. For George Ford, man of the match in the Millennium, this was a different sort of challenge in a different sort of match. So far in his nascent Test career the 21-year-old fly-half has had to deal with a disorganised Samoa, an Australian pack going backwards at pace and a giant Welsh back-line determined to dent both his confidence and body. A week ago there was plenty of kicking from hand, a resolve under intense pressure, a premium on his penalty points. On Saturday he could have missed every effort from the Twickenham turf and still seen his side win with something to spare. Instead it was all about the attack - controlling the tempo, choosing his options, freeing the talent outside him. He began well, clearing from his own line off his weaker foot after Ben Youngs' poor pass had cut his time and space. A minute later he was putting a probing kick deep into Italian territory, dabbing another into the 22 only to see it gathered to begin the move that led, 70 metres and two minutes later, to Sergio Parisse's opening try for Italy. Ford, as the win over Wales showed, is not cowed by early disappointment. It was his precision long-range penalty tight to the corner flag that set up England's opening try through Billy Vunipola's line-out drive, his ability to play flat to the gain-line that was creating options for the runners and ball-carriers cantering in support. Not always did he make the right choice. Half an hour in he wasted turnover ball with a poor kick straight down the gullet of his opposite number Haimona. At other times he became a fraction static, passing the ball standing still rather than running at the defensive line to commit and confuse defenders. But in his vision and hands he has what England fans crave from their number 10: creativity, a little conjuring, the quickness of mind and foot to make it count against a well-drilled defence. So it was in the move that led to Joseph's second try. He hung behind his pack, hinting that he might drift down the blind-side, then scything back round to the open spaces on the right after Billy Twelvetrees had come in at first receiver. Twelvetrees timed his pass behind Luther Burrell, and then Ford worked his magic - spotting Anthony Watson drawing one defender wide, faking a quick pass outside to Joseph and then delaying it a fraction as the covering man committed, before popping up a pass for his Bath team-mate to come onto at full pace. After the conversion he was gone, replaced for the final hurrah by another creative mind in Danny Cipriani. But the learning-curve continues, his precocious talents an increasingly pivotal part of Lancaster's plans. His personal stats were solid rather than spectacular: 15 points, just one kick missed from tee from seven, 47 metres made with ball in hand, 31 accurate passes. His kicking style requires a little further fine-tuning, even if he has improved markedly in the last year. There is so much there, and at such a young age, that few doubt that the progression will continue. There is the character, preternatural yet visible from the moment he began playing in England's age-group teams ahead of his time. There are the little details, like the way he manages to almost imperceptibly shift his weight in contact to ride out or roll big tackles. And there is ambition: this is not enough, I must do more. There is also a connection with the key men outside him. Joseph made more metres (123) than any other player, beat five men in seven carries, made two clean breaks. It was Ford's pass that set him away both times. Together with the solidity of England's set-piece, the impact of their replacements and the form in other key positions of Chris Robshaw and Ben Youngs, it means England are aware of two things: they must aspire to better still, but they have the tools to get there. Media playback is not supported on this device	After the unexpected delight for England supporters of last week's stirring comeback victory over Wales, Saturday's 47-17 win over Italy appears a predictable pleasure: six tries, some scintillating running, a 21st victory in 21 contests between the two.
Plans were approved for Coastal Oil and Gas Limited to drill in a field at St Nicholas. The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a "thorough assessment" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. "It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this," a spokesman said. "Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment." The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was "unproven", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.	Permission has been given for exploratory drilling for oil and gas in the Vale of Glamorgan.
"Welcome to Canada - honeymoon capital of the Commonwealth," David Johnston said before crowds at Government House. Prince William, who began his address in French, Canada's official language alongside English, said he and his wife had had a "longing" to visit together. The duke and duchess earlier visited Canada's National War Memorial. The couple will be staying at Government House - also known as Rideau Hall - while in Ottawa. Prime Minister Stephen Harper spoke after the governor general, saying: "Your journey across our fair Dominion marks the beginning of your journey into the hearts of Canadians. We wish you all the best on both counts. "We are both honoured and delighted that you have chosen us for your first official tour together." Prince William responded: "Merci beaucoup, Votre Excellence et Monsieur le Premier Ministre, pour votre accueil chaleureux." This was translated live on Canadian television as: "Thank you very much Your Excellency and Prime Minister for your warm welcome." The duke continued: "Catherine and I are so delighted to be here in Canada. By Peter HuntBBC royal correspondent They are the British and, indeed, the Canadian monarchy's future. The enthusiastic, large crowds were keen to catch a glimpse of their future king and queen - this in a country where, according to a recent opinion poll, almost half of its citizens think the monarchy "is a relic of a colonial past that has no place in Canada today". The dissenters weren't in evidence today. The streets were filled by the dedicated and the curious. They saw a much talked about "fresh and modern" royal couple carry out a tried and tested programme of engagements, including a speech by Prince William in English and French. He'll be partially bilingual for the next nine days as he tours a country which has had both French and British monarchs. More from Peter Hunt "Instilled in us by our parents and grandparents, who love this country, we have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time - and before we were married, we both had a longing to come here together. "The geography of Canada is unsurpassed and is famous for being matched only by the hospitality of its people." Switching to French again, Prince William joked: "It will improve as we go along." The royal couple later attended a barbecue hosted by Mr Johnston, who acts as the Queen's official representative in Canada. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth and Queen Elizabeth II, Prince William's grandmother, is its head of state. At the war memorial earlier, Prince William laid a wreath and his wife Kate placed a bouquet of flowers. They split up to greet some 3,000 well-wishers. Before their walkabout fans could be heard chanting: "We love you Kate", but there were also screams for the duke. Alexandra Anghel, 18, from Ottawa waited five hours to see the royal couple. She said the duchess seemed "down to earth". "It was a surreal moment to meet her, someone I never thought I would ever meet and there she was in front of me. William's lineage is amazing, he's literally walking history - I can't believe I saw walking history." The duke and duchess, who married in April, will visit seven Canadian cities on their nine-day visit, before heading to the US. On Friday, they will celebrate Canada's national day. The pair will also visit Quebec, Prince Edward Island, where they are to participate in a dragon boat race, and Calgary. In Calgary they will open the Calgary Stampede - an annual rodeo and festival dubbed the "greatest outdoor show on Earth". Canada has created a new royal flag for the visit, which features three maple leaves, from Canada's national tree, at its base. The flag flew from the cockpit of the jet carrying the royal couple when it touched down from the UK on Thursday afternoon local time. It will also fly from their cars and buildings they are visiting or staying in. Map of tour highlights The visit will be closely followed by the media, with nearly 1,400 journalists - including about 100 from Britain - accredited to cover the visit. The Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly packed up to 40 different outfits for the tour. She left London wearing a dress by French designer Roland Mouret and a blazer by Canadian label Smythe les Vestes and changed into a navy lace dress by Erdem Moralioglu during the flight to Ottawa. Mosha Lundstrom Halbert, associate fashion news editor at Canadian fashion magazine Flare, said Kate's choice of clothing was symbolic. "It's very exciting," she said. "To me, Erdem really represents the crossover between British and Canada fashion. He's really established in the UK but Canada is where he was born and raised." BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt says Canada is a safe first visit for a royal spreading her new wings, while US residents continue to be fascinated by Britain's royalty. The cost of the visit to the Canadian government, not including security, is estimated to be 1.4 million Canadian dollars (Â£958,580). A poll commissioned by the Toronto Star newspaper found that more than half the 18 to 34 year-olds questioned about the visit were indifferent about the trip. The duke and duchess will travel to the US state of California for two days from 8 July, attending a black-tie Bafta reception and dinner in Los Angeles on 9 July. Prince William is Bafta's president.	Canada's governor general has welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Ottawa at the start of the royal couple's first official overseas tour.
Brook, the IBF welterweight champion, will jump two weight divisions to fight undisputed world middleweight champion Golovkin in London on 10 September. Sheffield's Brook, 30, is one of 14 current British world champions. "Beating Golovkin would make me the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world," Brook told BBC Sport. "When we only had one or two world champions, the reaction when you won a world title was: 'Yes, unbelievable for Britain.' But now it's more a case of: 'Oh, someone else has won a world title.' "No-one is shocked any more. So you do have to do something outrageous to stand out. "I've wanted to be the best since I was a little kid. Imagine me beating him and taking those belts to be the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. It would be unbelievable." Brook is unbeaten in 36 professional contests and has made three defences of the IBF welterweight belt he won from American Shawn Porter in 2014. However, Brook was criticised for the quality of, or more correctly lack of, his recent opponents before signing to fight Kazakhstan knockout artist Golovkin. The 34-year-old is unbeaten in 35 pro contests and has 32 early victories to his name, giving him a knockout percentage of 91%, the highest in the history of the world middleweight championship. "There's a buzz in the air with this fight - it's a mega-fight," said Brook, who weighed 176lb at a check weight 30 days before the fight, 16lb over the middleweight limit and 11lb more than Golovkin. "It isn't just a world champion fighting a world champion, it's the biggest fight you can make in world boxing. "You've got two unbeaten fighters with a lot of knockouts between them going up against each other. "It's ludicrous a guy is jumping up two divisions to face somebody no one will fight. It's got everything and that's why everyone needs to tune in." Brook is bidding to succeed where domestic rival Amir Khan failed - Bolton's Khan jumped two weight divisions to fight then WBC champion Saul Alvarez in May and was knocked out in six rounds. Golovkin, who owns the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, is one of the most avoided boxers in the world - Mexico's Alvarez chose to vacate his WBC title rather than fight him.	Kell Brook says he chose to fight Gennady Golovkin because he needed to do something "outrageous" to stand out from the crowd.
The 11 imams, sheiks and religious teachers from nine countries met a Holocaust survivor and Poles whose families risked execution to save Jews from the Nazis, in the Polish capital's Nozyk Synagogue as part of the tour. They have been around museums, including the recently opened Museum of the History of Polish Jews on the site of the former Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw. And they also visited the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. "The main aim is to get Muslims who are leaders all over the world, particularly in the Middle East, to acknowledge the reality of what happened here and to be able to teach it to the people that they lead," said trip organiser Rabbi Jack Bemporad, who is executive director of the US-based Center for Interreligious Understanding. He was standing underneath the red brick watchtower over the main entrance to Birkenau, the largest of more than 40 camps that made up the Auschwitz complex. This was where the Nazis installed four gas chambers and crematoria to speed up the murder and disposal of people, who were mostly Jews, from across Europe. Auschwitz-Birkenau, set up by the Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland, is largely intact and is now a museum. Historians estimate 1.1 million people were killed there - one million of them were Jews but there were also Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and others. "I think that when someone wants to deny the Holocaust or think that it is exaggerated, which many of them do and certainly many of their followers do, when they come here and see it, their experience is such that they can no longer think that," Rabbi Bemporad said. Beside the ruins of one of the gas chambers - the Germans blew them up as they retreated, in an effort to hide their crimes - the Muslim leaders paused for a moment's silence. "You may read every book about the Holocaust but it's nothing like when you see this place where people were burned," said Mohamed Magid, president of the Islamic Society of North America. "This is the building, the bricks. If they were to speak to you and I, they would tell you how many cries and screams they have heard." Mr Magid, who is originally from Sudan, first visited Auschwitz-Birkenau during a trip organised for American imams in 2010. He said the experience had led him to hold an annual Seder, a Jewish ceremonial meal, at his mosque in Virginia where he invites people to listen to the story of a Holocaust survivor who was saved by a Muslim family. "We go back more committed to human rights and more understanding of conflicts and how to resolve them, but also to be careful of a curriculum that teaches racism and hatred," he said. Earlier, the group had taken photos as they walked around an exhibition in the red brick barrack blocks at Auschwitz, about 2 miles (3kms) from Birkenau. They made comments such as "Can you imagine?" and "It's beyond comprehension" as they saw a great pile of hair shorn from women prisoners that was used to make rudimentary textiles. They shook their heads as they saw faded children's shoes and dolls in glass cases. After they had seen just two of the 14 exhibition blocks, some of the group asked for a break and they knelt in prayer beside the camp's execution wall. Barakat Hasan, a Palestinian imam and director of the Center for Studies and Islamic Media in Jerusalem, said he "didn't know many details about the Holocaust" before the trip. "I felt my heart bleeding when I was looking at all this. I was fighting back tears," he said through an interpreter. "As a Palestinian living under occupation, I feel sympathy for the pain and injustice that was inflicted on the Jews," he added. Mr Hasan said he did not believe there were people in the Muslim world who denied the Holocaust happened, but he said there was discussion in his community about whether the commonly quoted figure of six million Jewish victims was correct. "Maybe now after seeing what I've seen, maybe the numbers are correct also," he said, adding that he would write articles and mention his trip on Facebook. As he walked along the railway line and unloading ramp at Birkenau - where the trains hauling cattle cars crammed with Jews arrived - Ahmet Muharrem Atlig, a Turkish imam and secretary general of the Journalists and Writers Foundation in Istanbul, said he wept when he saw a photograph that showed children looking scared as they got off a train. "Unfortunately the Muslim communities and congregation don't know much about the Holocaust," he said. "Yes, we've heard something. But we have to come and see what happened here. It's not just about Jews, or Christians, this is all about human beings because the human race suffered here."	Muslim leaders from around the world have taken part in an unprecedented trip to Germany and Poland to see and hear for themselves about the horrors of the Jewish Holocaust.
LudoSport has opened its first academy teaching seven forms of combat from the Star Wars world using flexible blades mounted on weighted hilts. The sport began eight years ago in Italy but has only just come to England with the first classes in Cheltenham. Instructor Jordan Court said people were already "hooked". The classes in Cheltenham began last month. So far there are six pupils, but this number is expected to increase. Mr Court attended an international boot camp to learn the different stages of the sport which range in characteristics from defensive in stage one to "aggressive and flamboyant" in stage four and "unpredictable" in stage seven. The 34-year-old said fighting with "an elegant weapon for a more civilized age" was a childhood dream come true. "My brother and I used to steal our Mum's bamboo garden canes to fight with," he said. The lightsabers used in the sport are all hand-made and are provided for use during the classes, Mr Court said. The sport is so new to England that there have only been a handful of classes so far but Mr Court said there were plans to begin teaching in Bristol by the end of October... if "the Force" was with the academy. Lightsaber Combat Academy There are several ranks for those wishing to become a fully-fledged Jedi Knight:	Star Wars fans are being given the opportunity to become Jedi Knights and learn how to wield lightsabers in combat.
A Chinese statement issued during a visit by US Secretary of State John Kerry said the nuclear issue was the "shared responsibility of all parties". Mr Kerry said the two sides must decide "very quickly" how to proceed. North Korea has recently threatened nuclear attacks, and is feared to be preparing a missile launch. A flurry of warlike statements from Pyongyang has prompted speculation that a launch could happen on 15 April, when the country marks the 101st birthday of the nation's founder and former leader, Kim Il-sung. By Damian GrammaticasChina correspondent After weeks of rising tensions, and North Korea's threats of nuclear war, the diplomatic efforts to tackle this crisis are gathering pace. The pledge to work with the US is a clear signal of China's displeasure with North Korea. China is North Korea's only ally, and is not going to stop supporting the North, but wants it to calm things down. The question is will North Korea listen? In recent weeks the North's  regime has made clear it now views having nuclear weapons as vital to its survival. It has said explicitly that it won't bargain them away. North Korea has reportedly moved at least two Musudan ballistic missiles to its east coast, but on Saturday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted officials in Seoul as saying that no new movement of the mobile launchers had been detected for two days. US officials including Mr Kerry have been playing down a leaked Pentagon report which warned that Pyongyang could have developed the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile. Since the UN imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea in February, its leadership has promised to restart a mothballed nuclear reactor, has shut an emergency military hotline to South Korea, and has urged diplomatic staff to leave, saying it cannot guarantee their safety. The North says it has also been angered by joint US-South Korean military exercises. Though its rhetoric has been more bellicose than usual, analysts say it fits a long-standing pattern, and may be intended to boost the popularity of Kim Jong-un, who came to power last year. In Beijing Mr Kerry held talks with President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. In comments to Mr Xi, he said the world was facing "a critical time with some very challenging issues". Among them were Korean tensions but also "the challenge of Iran and nuclear weapons, Syria and the Middle East, and economies around the world that are in need of a boost", he said. He later issued a statement saying the US and China were able "to underscore our joint commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner". He said the two sides would have "further discussions to bear down very quickly with great specificity on exactly how we will accomplish this goal". Missile defences in the region North Korea's missile programme The statement was issued after talks with Yang Jiechi, China's top diplomat. Mr Yang said China was "firmly committed to upholding peace and stability and advancing the denuclearisation process". "To properly address the Korea nuclear issue serves the common interests of all parties. It is also the shared responsibility of all parties," he said. China is North Korea's only ally and major trading partner, but has grown increasingly frustrated with its growing belligerence. Even so, the BBC's Damian Grammaticas reports from Beijing that persuading China to up the pressure on North Korea will not be easy. China might be frustrated by Pyongyang's behaviour but it is still the North's lifeline, so Beijing is unlikely to cut vital supplies of food and fuel since it feels that may make the North even more desperate and unpredictable, our correspondent adds. Following meetings in the South Korean capital, Seoul, on Friday, Mr Kerry said no country had a closer relationship with Pyongyang than China. Noting that Beijing, like Washington, wanted denuclearisation on the peninsula, he added: "If that's your policy, you've got to put some teeth into it." He warned North Korea against any missile launch, saying it would be a "provocation and unwanted act" which would further isolate North Korea and its people who, he said "are desperate for food, not missile launches". But he also said the US had tried to tone down its own statements, and cancelled some military exercises. "I think we have lowered our rhetoric significantly and we are attempting to find a way for reasonableness to prevail here," he said. Mr Kerry is on a four-day trip to Asia, and travels to Tokyo on Sunday. Russia has also expressed growing concern over North Korea and said on Friday that it had issued "an urgent appeal" to Pyongyang  "to refrain from actions which could lead to further escalation of tension". Some estimates suggest that the missiles North Korea has moved to its east coast could travel 4,000km (2,500 miles), although it is not believed that the Musudan has been tested before. That would put US bases on the Pacific island of Guam within range.	China and the US have vowed to work together to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear programme and to settle tensions through dialogue.
Kirsty Parkes, who was a history and English teacher at a school in West Lothian, cannot apply to be re-registered for one year. It follows a hearing held by the General Teaching Council for Scotland over two days in June. Ms Parkes did not attend or seek representation. The incidents happened during the 2012/13 school session. The written decision from the hearing said: "The panel was of the view that the conduct found proved had clearly called into question the respondent's fitness to teach. "The respondent had failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries in using a personal email account to contact a pupil." The panel said the teacher had also "failed to act as a role model to pupils" and had "failed to uphold the integrity of the exam process". The statement added: "This was in relation to the inappropriate storage and loss of papers; allowing the SQA rules in relation to exams to be breached and in providing essays for pupils to use in exams. "The panel was of the view that public confidence in the respondent and teaching as a profession had been undermined by the conduct." The panel also found that the teacher's conduct "fell significantly short of the standards expected." The complaint also included allegations that school procedures were not followed and that the teacher was dishonest.	A school teacher has been struck off the teachers' register for helping pupils to cheat in their exams.
The 24-year-old joined the Bantams on a three-year deal last summer after being released by Blackburn and scored once in 16 appearances. He previously played under Iron boss Graham Alexander when the duo were at Fleetwood. "We're really pleased because I think he will bring a lot to the team," Alexander told the club website.	Scunthorpe United have signed Bradford City winger Josh Morris for free on a three-year deal.
Jebb, 19, made 21 appearances for the Gunners' under-18 side last term and is an England Under-17s international. McAllister, 25, missed most of pre-season after ankle surgery and is yet to feature for Shrewsbury this season. "It's a good move for Macca and one which will hopefully see him play some games," said Town boss Micky Mellon. "He is an experienced player and really needs to be playing games now that he is fully recovered from his operation."	Stevenage have signed midfielders Jack Jebb and David McAllister on one-month loans from Arsenal and Shrewsbury Town respectively.
She said the Games would bring "honour and pride" to the country. Ms Rousseff, who has seen her popularity plunge amid a serious economic crisis, says the country will rise to the challenge and will organise a safe and successful Games. She said 12,000 people would be chosen to carry the Olympic torch through some 300 Brazilian cities next year. "We are now 399 days from the opening of the Olympic Games and on August 5 the whole world will look at us, will see the Olympic flame light up," Ms Rousseff said at a ceremony in Brasilia. The torch relay will begin in the Brazilian capital in May and will end at Rio's Maracana stadium in August, at the Olympic's opening ceremony. The Olympics organising committee and sponsors will choose the torchbearers in the next few months. Each person will carry the torch for 300 metres. The relay will take the torch through the Federal District, where Brasilia is, and 26 states during 90 to 100 days. Ms Rousseff has promised security will be a priority, inviting the thousands of fans who travelled to Brazil for the football World Cup to return for the Rio Games. Members of the International Olympic Committee have expressed concern over delays in the works for the Games. Another major concern has been pollution in the waters of the Guanabara Bay, where the sailing and windsurfing events will be held. The authorities say they understand athletes' concerns but insist that water pollution will not pose a major health risk during the Olympics, which will be held in August 2016. "We are confident that we can meet the challenge before us," said Ms Rousseff. "We will put on a historic Olympics." Rio de Janeiro will be the first South American city to host the Olympics.	Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has unveiled the torch to be used at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Media playback is not supported on this device Jack Duggan's late winner secured a 1-0 victory on Tuesday and set up a third-round tie at Wycombe in January. Stourbridge had gone out in round two in three of the previous five seasons. "This has got to be the biggest (achievement) beating a League One side at home," Hackett told BBC WM 95.6. "This is what the FA Cup is about." Hackett, who has been in charge of his home-town club since 2004, continued: "I thought we were outstanding. We certainly didn't get lucky, we were the better team. "It's one of those special nights and it's a great occasion for everybody connected with the football club. "Everybody connected with this football club are heroes. I spoke to a gentleman who comes on the coach every week and never misses a game home or away - I told him 'these nights are for you'. "Hugh (Clark, Stourbridge president) has been here 50 years and experienced some tough times at this football club, so he gets rewarded. We all do." Northampton, who are 13th in League One, started the match four divisions and 89 league places above Stourbridge - who began the day eighth in the Northern Premier League - in the English football pyramid. Manager Rob Page told BBC Radio Northampton: "The better team won and that hurts me to say that, but credit's got to go to them. "It's a hard one to take and I'm embarrassed at the minute. We'll take any criticism we get and we deserve every bit we get for this." The former Wales international defender added: "I apologise for that performance, I didn't expect that at all. Stourbridge deserved their victory, we congratulate them and wish them all the best, but we're all hurting."	Manager Gary Hackett said Stourbridge were "outstanding" in their shock FA Cup second-round defeat of League One Northampton as the seventh-tier side reached round three for the first time.
The "surprising find" in Avebury, which is 30m (98ft) wide, is thought to be one of the site's earliest structures. The square of megaliths appears to have been erected around the remains of a Neolithic house, which sat at the centre of the colossal stone circle -  the largest in Europe. Archaeologists have hailed the discovery "unheard of". For more archaeological digs and historical findings from around England follow our Pinterest board Dr Mark Gillings, from the University of Leicester, said in their "wildest dreams" they had not been expecting to find what he has described as a "stone square circle". The discovery comes 80 years after the archaeologist and marmalade magnate, Alexander Keiller, discovered a line of standing stones near the 6m (19ft) upright stone known as the obelisk. The vast 330m (1,082ft) wide stone circle of Avebury was built between about 2850 BC and 2200 BC. Containing three stone circles and boasting 100 huge standing stones originally, it has been the subject of considerable archaeological interest since the 17th century. The discovery of previously unknown megaliths inside the monument has been greeted as a "great surprise". "We have detected and mapped a series of prehistoric standing stones that were subsequently hidden and buried," Dr Gillings said. "Together, these reveal a striking and apparently unique square megalithic monument within the Avebury circles that has the potential to be one of the very earliest structures on this remarkable site." Dr Joshua Pollard, from the University of Southampton, said their geophysical survey had "finally completed" Keiller's work. "It has shown the line of stones he identified was one side of a square of megaliths about 30m across and enclosing the obelisk," he said. "Megalithic circles are well known from the time when Avebury was built, but square megalithic settings of this scale and complexity are unheard of." The archaeologists think the stone square might commemorate and monumentalise the "ancestral house of the first people who lived in Avebury". If proved correct, it may help to explain why the Avebury monument complex was built.	An ancient formation discovered within a Neolithic stone circle in Wiltshire is actually a square.
The falls came after the head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers suggested that the Cyprus model, which involves a tax on bank deposits, could form a template in any future bailout. On Monday morning, hopes the deal would solve the crisis lifted shares. By 15:30 GMT, all major European markets had fallen into negative territory, joined by US stocks. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, later addressed his country in a television broadcast. The deal was "painful" but the best that could have been struck under the circumstances, he said. He said that controls limiting restricting the movement of capital would be temporary and he promised to protect the weak, saying that welfare payments would be met. Earlier, markets in Europe and the US moved downwards when Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch Finance Minister who as head of the Eurogroup played a key role in the Cyprus negotiations, said the deal represented a new template for resolving future eurozone banking problems. "If there is a risk in a bank our first question should be 'OK, what are you in the the bank going to do about that?'," he told Reuters and the Financial Times. He later added a clarification saying that Cyprus was "a specific case with exceptional challenges". The Cyprus deal puts the burden for dealing with problem banks on their shareholders and creditors - in this particular case, customers with large bank balances - rather than the government and taxpayers - and bondholders, who lend through financial markets. Our World Economics Editor, Andrew Walker, pointed out the more usual approach to failing banks in the current crisis has been for the state to inject new capital. He says that Cyprus's banks are unusual in that they have relatively low amounts of financial market investors which could be tapped. In the past, nations such as Ireland have pumped billions of taxpayers' money into propping up their banks, rather than risk upsetting large investors and spooking the financial system. Mr Dijsselbloem said the pattern for bank rescues should see shareholders take the first hit, then bond holders, who lend money through financial markets, and only then should depositors with large bank balances be tapped. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor But Mr Dijsselbloem's remarks raised fears that other European countries with struggling banks may face the same solution as Cyprus, which agreed to force those with cash on deposit above 100,000 euros (Â£85,000), many of whom are Russian, to pay a substantial tax. Cyprus will receive 10bn euros ($13bn; Â£8.5bn) in bailout funds, but has agreed to a major restructuring of its banks. Small savers will be protected but Cyprus's second largest bank - Laiki Bank - will be wound up and split into "good" and "bad" banks, with its good assets eventually merged into the Bank of Cyprus, the country's biggest bank. The two banks will remain closed until Thursday, while all others will reopen on Tuesday after being closed for more than a week, Cyprus's central bank says. By Robert PestonBusiness editor The Cypriot government suggested that account holders with deposits of more than 100,000 euros should expect to lose about 30% of their balances. The UK's FTSE 100 index ended the day down 0.2%, while Germany's Dax gave up 0.5%, and France's Cac lost 1.1%. In New York, the Dow Jones was 0.5% lower. In Madrid, the market slipped 2.5% while the Milan index was down 2.27%. The euro was also driven lower, falling to a six-week low against the pound. The euro was down 0.6% to 84.74 pence. Jeroen Dijsselbloem The new deal for Cyprus, unlike previous agreements, does not require the approval of the Cypriot parliament. The uncertainty over the future of Cyprus in the eurozone was sparked a week ago when its parliament rejected an earlier bailout deal, which also included a controversial bank levy. Despite the Cypriot economy's relatively small size, many analysts had been concerned that the crisis would spread to the wider eurozone, had Cyprus been forced to give up the single currency. There were fears that the country's possible exit from the euro would trigger a loss of confidence across the single currency bloc, and prompt investors to withdraw from other troubled economies, such as Greece. However, while Cyprus is now likely to remain in the eurozone, the country still faces significant obstacles as it attempts to recover from the crisis. The EU-IMF deal involves a massive restructuring of the Cypriot banking system, as well as austerity measures and tax increases. There has also been significant public anger in Cyprus at the intervention of European authorities, and the credibility of the Cypriot government has been questioned. "We see a risk that Cyprus' sovereign debt burden post-bailout might not be sustainable, as the country is likely to enter a deep recession caused by the shrinkage of the banking sector and severe deleveraging," warned Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS.	European and US stock markets have fallen despite the agreement of a bailout deal for Cyprus.
Media playback is unsupported on your device 16 October 2014 Last updated at 08:45 BST Alcohol is responsible for around 1 in 20 of all deaths in Wales - 29 a week - according to Public Health Wales. A higher proportion of children in Wales aged 11 to 16 were drinking alcohol than in England or Scotland. The report said progress was being made with heavy drinking falling among adults under 45 but could be on the increase among older people. Linda Bailey, a consultant with Public Health Wales, said advertising and sports sponsorship needed to be tackled.	Heavy drinking remains a major problem stretching health services in Wales, a new report has warned.
Concerns had been raised by the Pakistan Cricket Board over threats from Hindu extremists, who attacked the offices of Indian cricket's governing body last year. However, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Thursday that the team had been cleared to play in March and April. "I am pleased that our government has given its consent," said Shaharyar. "As a duty of care, we have asked [world cricket governing body] the ICC to put in place special arrangements for the Pakistan cricket team while in India." India and Pakistan have not played a Test series since 2007 due to fallout from the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008, blamed on militants based across the border. Since 2009, Pakistan have played their 'home' Test series in the UAE after a terrorist attack on the visiting Sri Lankan team led to a boycott on tours to the country. The World T20 runs from 8 March to 3 April. Pakistan are scheduled to play a qualifier team on 16 March in Kolkata, then hosts India on 19 March in Dharamsala.	Pakistan will play in the World Twenty20 after the government approved their participation in India.
Joseph Mensah was arrested on suspicion of assault on Sunday before being transferred to Manchester Royal Infirmary with leg injuries. After jumping from the first-floor window, he is believed to have caught a number 50 bus on Upper Brook Street. Greater Manchester Police have appealed for anyone with information about Mr Mensah's whereabouts to contact them. He is described as black and of heavy build and was wearing a dark coat and jeans at the time of his escape. Police were at the hospital at the time, but were not specifically tasked with guarding Mr Mensah. Det Ch Insp Chris Mossop said: "We are currently investigating the circumstances that led to Mr Mensah's escape and are continuing to search for him. "I would like to remind those who may be hiding him it is a criminal offence to do so. "I would also make a direct appeal to Mensah as he was originally admitted to hospital for injuries to his leg and needs treatment."	A suspected criminal is on the run after leaping from a hospital window and catching a bus.
Mr Natzler has served as acting Clerk since the retirement of Sir Robert Rogers last year. A panel led by Mr Bercow initially recommended that Australian Carole Mills take the role but MPs objected and she has since withdrawn. News of Mr Natzler's appointment was met with cheers by MPs in the Commons. The recruitment of a new Clerk, Parliament's most senior legal and constitutional adviser, has been dogged by argument over the past nine months. MPs said Ms Mills, the original choice of the House of Commons commission who works in the Australian Parliament, did not have the relevant constitutional experience and accused Mr Bercow of a "stitch-up". Mr Bercow insisted that the appointment must have the confidence of MPs and "paused" the recruitment process before re-starting it. As part of a modernisation of procedures, the current responsibilities of the Clerk will now be split, with a new post of Commons director-general taking over responsibility for the day-to-day commercial and administrative functions of the Commons. Announcing Mr Natzler's appointment in the Commons, Mr Bercow said he had been chosen from a field of four candidates. Welcoming the appointment, David Cameron joked that Mr Bercow had "gone to the ends of the earth" to find the most qualified candidate and he was "very glad he found the right answer right here in Britain". Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Natzler's appointment was "well deserved". Before Sir Robert's retirement, Mr Natzler served as Clerk Assistant for many years.	David Natzler has been named as the next Clerk of the Commons, ending a controversial process which pitted Speaker John Bercow against some MPs.
The Faraday Lecture Block dates back to the 1960s and the university says its "tired and monotonous design" means it has become a bit of an eyesore. As well as new multi-coloured external glass cladding, the building will have a new entrance hall, extended second floor and improved access. Work on the 11-month project is due to start in January. The university said the new look would add vibrancy to the building and the mall area. The majority of construction will take place during the Easter holidays and summer months. A spokeswoman said: "It'll create a good impression and reflect the standards that Swansea holds and a professional atmosphere that fits in with the degrees that are taught in that building".	One of the main buildings on Swansea University's Singleton Park campus is to undergo a £2.75m makeover.
The 26-year-old had explored options with Williams and Renault but said on Sunday he was "happy and proud" to be with Force India. He added: "I want to thank all the teams that showed interest. It flatters me incredibly and pushed me to be strong." Force India are currently fourth in the constructors' standings. The team had always insisted they had Perez under contract for 2017 but it took some time to finalise commercial arrangements with the driver and the group of Mexican companies that sponsor both him and the team. Perez's career was hanging by a thread when he was dropped by McLaren after one season with them in 2013 but since joining Force India he has scored four podium finishes to add to the three he achieved with Sauber in 2012. In the process, he has emerged in the last couple of seasons as one of the better-regarded drivers behind the big names in the leading teams and has more than justified his place at the pinnacle of the sport, despite the fact he brings money to a team to secure his place. Both Williams and, particularly, Renault were interested in him, but he has decided that Force India is his best competitive opportunity. The team have one of the smaller budgets in F1 but have impressed in recent years for their ability to produce a competitive car. If they can maintain fourth position this season under pressure from Williams, it would be their best finish since the team were in their original guise as Jordan, who peaked with third place in 1999. Perez's decision leaves only a few loose ends to be tied up in the 2017 F1 driver market. Williams are expected to announce shortly that they are promoting Canadian novice Lance Stroll, who on Sunday won the European Formula 3 championship, to partner their current driver Valtteri Bottas. Brazilian Felipe Massa announced last month that he was retiring at the end of the season, which would leave Renault as the only major team not to have firmed up their drivers. Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari are all retaining the same line-ups as this year and McLaren are promoting their reserve driver in Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne to partner two-time champion Fernando Alonso in 2017. Alonso's current team-mate Jenson Button has decided not to race next year. The team have an option to bring him back in 2018 if they want to, but the 2009 champion said at the Malaysian Grand Prix this weekend that it was "quite possible" he would not race in F1 again. Renault have long been expected to promote their French reserve driver Esteban Ocon into one of their cars next season, with both current drivers Kevin Magnussen and Jolyon Palmer under pressure for their seats. But Renault have not yet made their decision and are taking their time. The lack of availability of other drivers means either Magnussen or Palmer may be retained, although that is not believed to be Renault's first choice.	Mexican Sergio Perez is to continue with Force India for a fourth successive season in 2017.
He told MPs the UK would never be a world-beating economy unless young people were better educated. And he called for "much bigger devolution to the people who know where the [failing] schools are". On improving literacy and numeracy, he added: "We need it across the country and we need it yesterday." The Conservative grandee, who was deputy prime minister in the 1990s and subsequently advised David Cameron on regional strategy, made the comments as he gave evidence to the Commons Business Innovation and Skills Committee alongside former chancellor George Osborne. Claiming that the UK is "29th as a country in the world league of education" - it was 23rd in reading in 2015, according to the OECD's Pisa rankings and 26th in maths - he stressed: "If we accept that - we'll never be a world beating economy in the future because it's all about people - it's about education and then about skills. "And if you want to have skilled people, you'd better educate them properly before you start making them skilled." Lord Heseltine, whose leadership challenge helped trigger Margaret Thatcher's departure from Downing Street in 1990, said standards need to be set by a strategic commission, chaired by the prime minister "that are relevant to the best in the world and not the 29th". "If I could design an industrial strategy it would start in the primary schools," he said, adding that about a quarter of children leaving primary schools are "illiterate and innumerate" by modern employment standards. "My own view is clear - there needs to be a much bigger devolution to the people who know where those schools are and they know the people that run them and they know where the inadequate results are coming from - in my personal experience of life: show me the problem, show me the person in charge." Lord Heseltine cited one success story - Northamptonshire's "Race to the top" initiative - which aims to make Northamptonshire one of the highest performing counties for education by 2020. "We spend a lot of time discussing the theories of education and the structures of education, but what we want is good head teachers," he said. "Wherever you go in this country there is a skills shortage - that is a serious problem facing the expansion of the economy and it's a highly centralised process - not devolved on the scale that it would seem to me reflect the market opportunities."	Lord Heseltine says the UK's skills shortage is a serious problem - and if it was up to him he would start industrial strategy in primary schools.
Racism in football has hit the headlines at Premiership level recently, but a BBC Wales investigation indicates it's also a feature of the amateur and grassroots game in Wales. Teams from black and ethnic minority communities have told Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme of the comments, abuse and hostility they say they encounter at some matches, from players, spectators and even match officials. There have been a number of racial incidents at football matches in Wales over the past year, including last April when a linesman at a Welsh League game between Cwmbran Town FC and Grange Harlequins FC, from Cardiff, was disciplined by the Football Association of Wales for a comment made to a player. He was fined Â£750 and banned from the Cwmbran Town ground for five months. And last August, Pontypridd team Graig FC were disciplined by the South Wales Football Association for misconduct after supporters of the side were racially abusive towards visiting STM Sports FC, from Llanrumney, Cardiff. Mohamed Dualeh, secretary and manager of Tiger Bay FC, made up of predominantly Somali players from south Cardiff, told the programme of an incident in a game in which his team played. "The team that we were playing, one of our players was involved in a rough challenge. The referee decided that was worth a red card," he said. "The referee pulled his red card and issued to the wrong player. The team captain approached the referee and said 'ref, you are sending off the wrong player.' "He looked at the player and said 'you all look like the same.' "The wrong player walked off the pitch and served a three-match ban when he's not the one who was involved." Sunil Patel, campaigns manager for Show Racism the Red Card in Wales, who provide anti-racism education and awareness training, said the organisation would be launching a campaign later this year to encourage players to report incidents of racism, in the hope of obtaining a clearer picture of the extent of the problem. "We've had reports for about five years, since we were established," said Mr Patel. "Things that players and clubs tell us is about the racism that's coming from the fans, specifically in areas that are not that diverse, reports of referee bias maybe towards the other team, also players being racist towards other players on the pitch as well. "We are hearing this on a regular basis, really." A recent online survey by Staffordshire University, of 2,000 football fans and players, concluded that around 60% had witnessed or experienced racism in football since 2000. Professor Ellis Cashmore, who led the study, told the programme: "It's almost like a knee jerk response, that it's part of football culture that you give the black player a hard time through hissing and booing and racial abuse, and it's just gone either unnoticed or, my own suspicion, is that it's been deliberately ignored. "You would assume it would have disappeared completely but it hasn't, its still there, it's been there consistently, and in recent months we've seen it flare up in the most dramatic fashion." The regional football associations and Football Association of Wales are responsible for dealing with complaints and disciplinary issues. FAW spokesman Ian Gwyn Hughes told Eye on Wales the governing body took a "zero tolerance" approach to racism and supported the work of Show Racism the Red Card. Eye on Wales is broadcast at 13:04 GMT on Sunday 11 March on BBC Radio Wales.	It's the ugly side of the beautiful game.
Mr Matheson has served as a Labour councillor in the city for 17 years - five of those as leader. He stepped down from the leadership last September and was replaced by Frank McAveety. A by-election will be held for his Anderston/City ward, the date of which has yet to be confirmed. Mr Matheson said: "As a cities man, I am delighted to accept this prestigious appointment which comes at a perfect time for me. "Having served as a city leader I am fortunate to be in a position to still contribute to the development of international cities in a non-political capacity." Mr Matheson will be a visiting professor at Strathclyde University's Institute for Future Cities - part of its economics department. In his role he will be expected to write, lecture and assist with research projects across the UK and abroad. The move appears to mark the end of Mr Matheson's political ambitions for the moment. Last year he stood for the depute leadership of the Scottish Labour Party and came second in the first round of voting. He later decided against putting himself forward as a possible Labour candidate for Holyrood.	The former leader of Glasgow City Council, Gordon Matheson, is to leave the authority to become a visiting professor at Strathclyde University.
It said the compression ignition engine was up to 30% more fuel-efficient than its current engines. It plans to sell cars with the new engine from 2019. Last week, Mazda said it would work with Toyota to develop electric vehicle technology and build a $1.6bn plant in the US. Mazda research and development head Kiyoshi Fujiwara said it was imperative for the company to pursue the "ideal internal combustion engine". "Electrification is necessary but... the internal combustion engine should come first," he said. Mazda said the Skyactiv-X, as it is known, would be the world's first commercial petrol engine to use compression ignition. The technology breakthrough puts the firm ahead of rivals including Daimler and General Motors that have worked on compression ignition for decades. According to Mazda, the fuel-air mixture ignites spontaneously when compressed by the piston in the new engine. The carmaker said the Skyactiv-X combined the advantages of petrol and diesel engines to improve efficiency. It has no plans to supply the engine to other carmakers. The move comes as the car industry pours massive investment into electric technology in response to stricter emissions standards around the world. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a bid to reduce air pollution. In July, Volvo said all new models will have an electric motor from 2019. The Chinese-owned firm aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025. Mazda also plans to introduce electric technology in its cars from 2019. In theory, a compression-ignition petrol engine should have big advantages.  But it isn't easy to make technology work - and some of the biggest companies, including General Motors, have already tried. So why should a relatively small Japanese manufacturer like Mazda succeed? Well, partly because - unlike the really big players - it isn't afraid to take risks. It has done in the past. It's the only mainstream manufacturer, for example, which has persisted with rotary engines in its cars. Like compression ignition motors, they have theoretical benefits, but create complex engineering challenges. Mazda's rotary has had some success. The company won the Le Mans 24 Hours race with it in 1991, and the latest version was fitted in its RX-8 sportscar. Popular with drivers, it was sadly unreliable. If the new motor is to be a success, it needs to be reliable as well as efficient. And Mazda needs to be able to persuade regulators that petrol engines still have a strong future. It may prove to be the perfect stop-gap, as electric cars are developed and charging infrastructure is created. Or it may turn out to be a brilliant idea, which has come to fruition just a few years too late.	Japanese carmaker Mazda has developed a more efficient petrol engine at a time when the industry steers toward electric vehicles.
The 20-year-old has played seven games for the Swans since making his £1.75m move to the Liberty Stadium from League Two Exeter City in January 2015. Grimes made his only Premier League start to date in September, having scored his first Swansea goal in the League Cup a month earlier.

But the annual Easter School at St Mary's University College Belfast drew more than 250 pupils from across the west of the city this week. Classes are targeted at those who require extra support in preparation for GCSE Maths and English. Four days of tuition are offered to schoolchildren who are at risk of not achieving a pass grade. Geraldine McAteer of the West Belfast Partnership Board, which manages the programme, said demand for places is high and pupils are "incredibly keen" to take part. Ms McAteer puts the popularity of the classes down to the environment and ethos of the school, which is one of "relaxed but focused learning". "They're mixing with children their own age, from other schools, in their own clothes, their civvies," she said. "They're in a university environment, working with different tutors and university students who volunteer to shepherd them around. So it has actually gained a reputation as quite a fun experience. "A grade C is a passport to so much, so this is to help get them over the line," said Ms McAteer. Maths tutor Jim Stott said the additional support often provides the encouragement students require to keep on studying at a time when their predicted grades may discourage them. "They're keen to tell you what exact areas they need more support with. "It may be trigonometry or algebra, so we break them up into small groups and when they're getting the extra attention, they soak it up. They're really committed to it. "It's very relaxed - I'm not standing at a board talking to children, the children are taking part in it. Sometimes they're at the board. "Pupils tend to gel together very well. They're not necessarily from the same schools, and that's part of the attraction - they like to mix with young people from other schools." Ms McAteer explained that the Â£25 fee is waived for those who cannot afford it. "This is a great social justice model," she said.  "We raise money from the Department of Education which enables us to pay for tutors and hire of premises. "There are some people who can afford to pay that amount per hour. But this is 16 to 20 hours tuition for Â£25. "But if we find out from the school that a family can't afford that cost, it's overlooked. Our main aim is to get the pupils in, to give them assistance, to get them to pass." Ms McAteer said the West Belfast Partnership Board hope to roll the programme out to other parts of the city over time.	It's a strange phenomenon - teenagers opting to return to the classroom over the Easter Holidays.
The Conservative government lead by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper had asked Canada's Supreme Court to hear an appeal of that ruling. Debate over the niqab came to a head during the 2015 Canadian elections. Mr Harper was accused of using the issue stir up fears against Muslims. Newly elected Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau opposed the appeal during his campaign. The official court application for the appeal has been discontinued, officials have said, according to the Canadian Press. "Canada's diversity is among its greatest strengths, and the Liberals are ensuring that successful citizenship continue to be included in the Canadian family," Justice Minister Jody-Wilson Raybould and Immigration Minister John McCallum said in a statement. Zunera Ishaq, a Pakistani-born woman, had challenged the Conservative government's law against wearing niqabs when swearing an oath to become a Canadian citizen and won. While serving as prime minister, Mr Harper angered many when he pledged to set up a police hotline to report "barbaric cultural practices" after taking a hard line on the niqab debate.	The Liberal government in Canada has abandoned a legal challenge that sought to require women to remove their niqabs or face coverings during citizenship ceremonies.
The traditional Tuesday and Wednesday slot used by Uefa will be set aside as the first leg coincides with the 'Twelfth' marches in Northern Ireland. It's understood the new date has been agreed by the clubs and approved by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Linfield must first defeat La Fiorita of San Marino in a first-round clash. The Northern Ireland champions will host La Fiorita in Belfast on 28 June, with the return leg on 4 July. If the Blues progress they will play the 1967 European Cup winners, who are managed by County Antrim-born Brendan Rodgers, for the first time. The first leg of the Champions League second round qualifiers are scheduled to take place on 11/12 July. However they are key dates in the annual Orange celebrations, sparking fears of trouble with Celtic's large travelling support heading to Belfast at the height of the marching season. Linfield's national stadium is located in the largely loyalist Sandy Row area. Police are understood to have ruled out the match taking place on either the 11th or 12th amid concerns tensions could erupt between Celtic and Linfield fans. A possible solution to the dilemma would have been to switch the ties, with Celtic hosting the opener in Glasgow before the return a week later. Linfield dismissed that possibility as they look to cash in on the right to host the all-important first leg, Blues chairman Roy McGivern telling BBC Sport a home leg first was always "the preferred choice" of the Irish Premiership champions. Celtic defeated Irish League opposition in Belfast four years ago with a 3-0 win over Cliftonville in a Champions League qualifier.	Celtic's potential Champions League qualifier with Irish Premiership champions Linfield has been pencilled in for Friday 14 July at Windsor Park.
Charlene Walker, 36, suffered a single stab wound at the Darlington home of Julie Gowling in December. The 44-year-old tried to cover up the killing and dispose of the weapon, a kitchen knife, by burying it in a garden, Teesside Crown Court heard. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told the mother-of-four she must serve a minimum of 14 years in prison. The court heard Gowling, who had denied murder, got into a heated argument with Ms Walker - a known drug user - over the missing cash on 6 December. It ended when Gowling lost her temper and stabbed Ms Walker in the chest. She then fled the house and tried to dispose of the knife. The court was told Ms Walker died as a result of massive blood loss. After the hearing, Det Supt Dave Ashton, of Durham Police, said: "Our condolences go to the family of Charlie Walker who, since her death have shown nothing but dignity and courage. "Ms Walker had a difficult life in many ways but the extreme act of violence which ended her life was not justified during an argument over a relatively trivial matter."	A woman who stabbed her lodger during a row over a missing £21 has been jailed for her murder.
The 26-year-old victim had been standing at a bus stop in Wallacewell Quadrant in Glasgow at about 23:45 on Friday when a car pulled up beside him. A young man who was a passenger in the car got out and chased him with a hammer into a nearby park. The car was then driven at him and hit him before two other men jumped out and attacked him with weapons. The attackers then got back into the vehicle - a small silver car - before driving back onto Wallacewell Road. One of the men is described as being in his early 20s with blond hair. He was wearing a red top. The other two men are described as being in their late teens to early 20s. Their victim is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Det Con William Corkindale of Shettleston CID said: "This was a horrendous attack which has left the victim seriously injured and it is imperative that we trace the people responsible. "I would appeal to anyone who was in the area around the time the incident took place, who may have witnessed what happened or saw anything suspicious, to come forward. "We understand that the front passenger window of the small silver car involved was smashed and so I would also ask anyone who noticed a car matching this description to get in touch."	A man has been left in a "serious but stable" condition in an attack being treated by police as attempted murder.
At an event in Hove, the prime minister said all good schools should be able to expand and his government had supported that right. The Weald of Kent girls' grammar school wants to open an annexe in Sevenoaks. The Department for Education (DfE) is considering the plans which have the backing of Kent County Council. The law forbids the opening of new grammar schools, but changes made by the coalition government in 2012 allow enlargement of existing schools. "I strongly support the right of all good schools to expand. I think that's very important and that should include grammar schools," the prime minister said: "Under this government grammar schools have been able to expand and that is all to the good." Mr Cameron was responding to a question about the the proposed satellite grammar school in Sevenoaks. But he would not be drawn on when the government was likely to make its decision. "As for the decision that the Department for Education has to take, they have to take that having [looked] at all the evidence and after having proper consultations and making the decision in proper time," he added. Sevenoaks is the only major Kent town that does not have grammar provision. Bids made in 2013 were turned down because the DfE said they did not comply with the law. But the current plans put forward by Weald of Kent girls' grammar school are believed to have met the criteria. If approved, the annexe could pave the way for more grammars to open satellite campuses. General secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Christine Blower, has previously called the plans for grammar school expansion "yet another unnecessary distraction".	David Cameron has voiced his "strong support" for the expansion of grammar schools during a visit to the South East.
She had the "biggest year of her career", playing 95 shows, bringing in an average $2.4m (£1.5m) per city, according to Forbes. Endorsement deals with companies like Pepsi and H&M, along with the surprise album she released in December 2013, helped her to the top spot. The self-titled album was released on iTunes with no prior promotion. Beyonce has just announced she'll be releasing a platinum version of that album later this month, which will include new songs and a concert video.

Completing the top three is Pink, who played 85 dates during the time period Forbes used to make its estimates. Her earnings were valued at $52m (£32.5m). Other artists on the list include Rihanna in fourth with $48m (£30m) and Katy Perry, who took home $40m (£25m), in fifth. Forbes calculated earnings by looking at income from "touring, record sales, publishing, merchandise sales, endorsements and other ventures" between June 2013 and June 2014.

London 2012 Olympian Andrew Lawrence scored 14 points while NBA player Ben Gordon added 13. Coach Joe Prunty's team led for most of the first three quarters before being overhauled by their guests in the last 10 minutes of a well-contested game. GB now begin their Eurobasket qualifying campaign with a game in Hungary in midweek. "The key to the qualifiers will be completing on every play. We have to make sure that we're going as hard as we can on both ends of the floor," Prunty told BBC Sport. "I think at times tonight we lost a little of our fire." Prunty turned to his strongest line-up in the final warm-up match before he cuts the roster for the six-game qualifying programme. GB led 35-24 on Lawrence's three in the second quarter but the Dutch took the lead early in the third. Gordon then hit three threes in a row - his first points of the game - to restore GB's advantage. Netherlands, who were led by 18 points from Worthy De Jong, scored the first 10 points of the fourth quarter to lead 71-60 and held on to win despite the hosts' comeback in the last six minutes. Prunty was pleased with the contribution of Gordon, a player who has joined the team despite missing out on the place available to him for London 2012. He said: "You're always trying to find to your rhythm as a player and with one another. I thought he [Gordon] had a good showing tonight, he certainly had a very good stretch in the third quarter."	Great Britain lost to the Netherlands in Manchester for the second time in two days, going down 79-68.
Edward Furneaux, 74, died after crashing his car into a tree in Kewstoke Road, Worle, on the morning of 19 January. The body of his 70-year-old wife, Anne, was found at a property in Pilgrim's Way the same day. No-one else is being sought in the murder inquiry into Mrs Furneaux's death, Avon and Somerset Police said.	A husband and wife who died in an apparent murder-suicide in North Somerset have been named.
But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, A-levels and GCSEs. "It's a deeply cultural thing," says Sir Vince, who held office during the Coalition government. "It got built into the British mindset... if you're clever, you go to university, and if you're not so clever you go off and do a trade of some sort," he says. "It's still the case that if you're academically inclined and you don't know what to do, you go to university. "The others are told, 'Why not do an apprenticeship?' without being given much of a steer as to how to do it. "And that's completely wrong, for many people it would be better if they went down that route from day one." Sir Vince, who once taught Open University economics courses, is now getting back to his own educational roots. He is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University. There will be no shortage of contemporary upheavals for these online students to talk about. Sir Vince talks of a "bizarre Alice in Wonderland world" in which the Chinese Communists are now the advocates of free trade while the United States, under President Donald Trump, is raising the banner of protectionism. "You've got a hard-line Communist out there defending the liberal international economic order," he says. He describes himself as a "big fan of the Chinese", adding: "like George Osborne". Sir Vince had a close-up view of economic decision-making by politicians. He ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations. George Osborne's approach to cutting the deficit, in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was shaped by the rules set by US economist Kenneth Rogoff, says Sir Vince. And he says that the current rise of nationalism, populism and the push for protectionism are the direct fallout from the economic hangover from the recession. "The real energy behind this new populism does come from 2008," he says. "Real wages have declined, particularly in deprived parts of the country, public spending has been cut because of the deficit." He says this has delivered a shock to a political system built on a post-War assumption of rising living standards. Sir Vince's new teaching project forms part of the wave of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. Moocs are also characterised by being free - and his period in office as business secretary saw him taking the controversial decision to raise university tuition fees in England to Â£9,000 per year. Tuition fees have hung like a dark cloud over the Liberal Democrats ever since - but he remains a stout defender of the fee increase. "It was the right thing to do, but very, very politically painful," he says. The alternative was to cut the further education budget. "I wasn't willing to go along with that." The fees are in effect a graduate tax, rather than a fee, he says, and the Liberal Democrats' big mistake was signing a pledge not to increase fees. He says he was "vehemently opposed" to this promise before the 2010 election. "I could see that if ever we got into government, it would be a disaster. "But there was a very strong head of steam and the leader felt he had to go along with it, and once we were in government we were inevitably exposed." The Politics of Economics and The Economics of Politicians will be available on Futurelearn from 20 March.	"Britain has done appallingly badly at vocational education for many years," says Sir Vince Cable, former business secretary, as Theresa May's industrial strategy promises to regenerate technical training and tackle the skills shortage.
The claim: England and Wales have the highest incarceration rate per head of the population in Western Europe. Reality Check verdict: In 2014 England and Wales did indeed have the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe, marginally ahead of Scotland. Together with former home secretaries Jacqui Smith and Ken Clarke, he had written a letter to the Times calling for the prison population in England and Wales to be cut from the current level of more than 85,000 to the level in 1993 of about 45,000. They referred to 1993 as being the year in which Michael Howard said that "prison works". The prison population grew rapidly after that point, especially in the following five years. In the last five years it has been pretty much static at about 85,000. Since 1993 the prison population has almost doubled over a period when the overall population of England and Wales has grown by about 17%. Mr Clegg was only talking about England and Wales because in the rest of the UK the justice system is a devolved power, controlled by the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. He also said: "We already have higher rates of incarceration per head of the population than anywhere else in Western Europe." This chart based on Eurostat figures for 2014 shows that England and Wales is indeed ahead of the rest of Western Europe with 146 prisoners per 100,000 population, narrowly ahead of Scotland's 145. Northern Ireland had 93 prisoners per 100,000 population.

Most of the main streets are waterlogged, bringing the city to a standstill. Many offices, schools and colleges have been shut due to rains in the past week. The rains have also affected at least 80,000 people in northern parts of neighbouring Sri Lanka. A depression formed in the Bay of Bengal has triggered rains in coastal areas of India's Tamil Nadu state and Sri Lanka. Government officials said around 10,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in Chennai, the Reuters news agency said. The National Disaster Response Force and the army are also helping in ongoing rescue work. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalitha, has announced a 5bn-rupee ($75m; Â£49m) relief fund for flood-affected areas. "The rain that was meant to be spread out over the monsoon months has poured in just a few days," she said. "No precautionary measures would have managed to prevent water logging and damages. In areas where flooding and damage have been caused, relief, rescue and repair works are being taken up on a war footing," she added. Images from Chennai show the difficulties people have been facing to access essential services.	More than 70 people have been killed as incessant rains continue to batter the southern Indian city of Chennai, media reports say.
Jamie Bishop, who was 44, was a left-handed batsman who also represented Wales at minor county level. Glamorgan cricket club chief executive Hugh Morris described him as "a hugely talented cricketer" who had an outstanding record for Pontarddulais cricket club. South Wales Police is not treating the death as suspicious. Tributes were also paid on social media, from sporting figures including Steve James, Edward Bevan, Sean Holley, John Devereux and Rick O'Shea.

The blast happened in the early hours of Monday at the Weston Road branch in Long Ashton, near Bristol. Cash was stolen and three men were arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life. Two men, aged 22 and 24, from Southport near Liverpool have been held on suspicion of the same offence. Villagers described the attack on the building as "shocking", "insane" and "a hideous act". Owners David Andrews and Andrew Crabb said they hope to reopen "as soon as possible" after assessing the damage. Many villagers posted their support on the store's Facebook page.	Two more people have been arrested over an explosion at a post office by thieves attempting to steal a cash machine from its front.
The miner said it would sell 27 billion shares at 1p per share. That compares with a share price of 16.25p on Friday. Its shares have already tumbled 90% this year as it has also struggled to cope with strikes and rising costs. Lonmin had already stated that its shares would be issued at a "significant discount". Shares in the platinum miner rose nearly 10% to 17.75p in early trade on the London Stock Exchange. Lonmin will use the cash raised to help secure $370m (£246m) in bank loans which will mature in 2020. Those loans will replace an existing $543m of loans, which are due to be repaid next year. The company urged shareholders to approve the cash call, saying the injection was crucial to its survival. It said if shareholders did not approve the rights issue, its lenders would not allow it to refinance its debt. Platinum prices have fallen by about 22% in the last year. "The rights issue has been fully underwritten and we hope shareholders vote positively. We firmly believe that the rights issue is in the best interest of our shareholders," Lonmin chief executive Ben Magara said in a statement. The rights issue came as Lonmin reported an annual loss of $2.2bn, compared with a loss of $326m a year earlier. The majority of its losses came from a $1.5bn impairment charge at its Marikana mine in South Africa, where 34 miners were killed by police during strikes and unrest in 2010. Miners have been suffering heavily in recent months as a result of lower commodity prices. But Lonmin was also hit hard by another miners' strike in South Africa in 2014. In July, it announced plans to close or mothball several mine shafts, putting 6,000 jobs at risk. It said on Monday that about 3,100 people had since left the company. Last month, Glencore announced the sale of two of its copper mines in Australia and Chile, in an effort to reduce a debt pile of £19.5bn created by its 2013 takeover of Xstrata. The share sale is the second in three years at the embattled platinum minter. Lonmin issued an $800m rights issue to shore up its balance sheet in November 2012.	Platinum producer Lonmin has priced its £270m share sale at a discount of 94% as it fights for survival after a near-collapse in the commodity's price.
Writing in her autobiography, she claimed the director "threw himself" on top of her in the back of his limousine and tried to kiss her. The actress described the encounter as "an awful, awful moment". Hedren added that she didn't tell anyone because "sexual harassment and stalking were terms that didn't exist" in the early 1960s. She continued: "Besides, he was Alfred Hitchcock, one of Universal's superstars, and I was just a lucky little blonde model he'd rescued from relative obscurity. Which one of us was more valuable to the studio, him or me?" Hedren appeared in The Birds in 1963 and the following year starred in Marnie - both of which were directed by Hitchcock. The actress, now 86, made the claims in her autobiography Tippi: A Memoir, which is published in November. She has spoken in the past about the director's alleged treatment of her, but has gone into more detail in the memoir. Hedren described a later encounter in Hitchcock's office where the director "suddenly grabbed" her and "put his hands" on her. She wrote: "It was sexual, it was perverse, and it was ugly, and I couldn't have been more shocked and more repulsed. "The harder I fought him, the more aggressive he became. Then he started adding threats, as if he could do anything to me that was worse than what he was trying to do at that moment." After refusing his demands, Hedren said Hitchcock "looked directly into my eyes, his face red with rage, and promised, 'I'll ruin your career.'" The actress said Hitchcock then made her life difficult, refusing to submit her work for the Oscar nominations or let her take on other acting roles while he still had her under contract. Hedren, whose daughter Melanie Griffith is also an actress, said: "I've made it my mission ever since to see to it that while Hitchcock may have ruined my career, I never gave him the power to ruin my life." She went on to say that, despite his treatment of her, she felt "a wave of sadness" when he died in 1980. "It surprised everyone that I went to Hitchcock's funeral," she wrote, adding: "As far as I was concerned, there was no unfinished business between us, nothing more that needed to be said. "I'd already healed and moved on by the time Hitchcock died, far past anything I'd ever imagined for myself. So in the end, I was there to say, 'Goodbye, and thank you, Hitch.'"

Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told the BBC "Syria is doing its best" to comply with the timetable to destroy its chemical weapons. Syria missed Wednesday's deadline to hand over its entire stockpile. Mr Mekdad said a shipment of weapons came under attack twice on its way from Damascus to the port of Latakia. "We shipped two shipments to the Syrian coast," he said. "The second shipment was intercepted by fire from terrorist groups." He added: "This is a serious business. Syria is in war, and the Americans and others have to take this into consideration." He described as "absolutely unacceptable" US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent condemnation of the government's use of barrel bombs in the city of Aleppo. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claims 246 people, including 73 children, have been killed in Aleppo in the last five days alone after barrels containing explosives and metal fragments were dropped by military helicopters. Activist group The Aleppo Media Centre claims 14 people were killed in barrel bomb attacks on the Masaken Hanano district on Thursday, citing footage appearing to show bombs being dropped from a helicopter onto a civilian area. "We are defending our people against terrorist attacks. We have never bombarded places with civilians," Mr Mekdad insisted, accusing the US of "still supporting terrorist elements" in the country. The Syrian government, via state media, also denied reports that rebels had seized most of Aleppo's central prison. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said members of the Islamic Front coalition, dominated by the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the al-Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, mounted the assault, freeing hundreds of detainees. But state television insisted soldiers and security forces had "thwarted an attack against the prison by terrorist groups". The Observatory says fighting is still going on, but the Ahrar al-Sham brigade and the Aleppo Media Centre, a citizen-journalist outlet, say rebels now completely control the prison. It is reported to hold at least 3,000 detainees, including Islamists, activists and minors, in horrific conditions. Syria has about 1,300 tonnes of declared chemical weapons. The US said last week that so far only about 4% of the stockpile - 30 tonnes - had left the country. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said he was "concerned" that the UN-backed plan was falling behind schedule and said Damascus "had to take responsibility for fulfilling its commitment". Russia - a key ally of Syria - has said Damascus should complete the transfer of its chemical weapons to the coast for removal by ship by 1 March. A deadline was set last year for all the weapons to be destroyed by the end of June. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is overseeing the destruction operation, has admitted the process has been slowed down by security concerns. Mr Mekdad stressed: "Syria is committed to all its agreements, with the OPCW and the UN Security Council. We shall implement on time all our obligations."	Syria says international accusations that it is delaying the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile are "absolutely unjustified".
Back-row forwards Horstmann, 35, and Salvi, 31, have agreed one-year deals, while lock Atkins, 26, has extended his contract by two years.

Joshua Dobby appeared at Bromley Magistrates' Court earlier charged with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving. Makayah McDermott and Rozanne Cooper died after the car crashed in Penge, south-east London on Wednesday. Three girls were also injured and remain in hospital. No application for bail was made during the short hearing and Mr Dobby was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 30 September He was also charged with: More updates on this and other London stories The Met said the three injured girls - two aged 13 and one aged eight - were related to Makayah and his aunt, who was a 34-year-old hairdresser. The car struck the group at about 14:05 BST on Lennard Road. It had been pursued by police from nearby Birkbeck Road in Beckenham. One witness said the car was being followed by two police vehicles when the driver "lost control and ploughed into a family". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating. Over the past 10 years, 252 members of the public have died following road traffic incidents involving the police in England and Wales, according to the IPCC. In London, there were 498 crashes involving a pursuit by Met officers in 2015-16. Friends and neighbours left floral tributes at the scene of the crash on Thursday. Family friend Emma Cameron called the news "devastating" and said Ms Cooper was "a genuinely lovely girl". "She never had a bad word to say about anybody. She was the kindest friendliest warmest person. It's just awful," she added. Makayah had recently auditioned for a part in a television series. His agent Sam Brown, managing director of Brown and Mills Entertainment, described Makayah as "an extremely talented young actor" and "joy to be around". "We cannot express enough our sadness and our thoughts are with the family at this terrible time," she added. A victim support fund for those injured in the crash on the Gofundme website had raised nearly Â£5,000 by Friday morning.	A 23-year-old man has been remanded in custody following the deaths of a 10-year-old boy and his aunt who were a hit by a car being pursued by police.
Hospital radiographer Aidan McNicholl, 36, died following the collision on the A5 at Cerrigydrudion on Sunday. Andreas Werner, 46, of Leipzig, failed to spot the motorcyclist as he turned his VW Transporter right causing the fatal crash. The father-of-four pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Llandudno Magistrates' Court. He was fined Â£1,000 and also banned from driving in the UK for two years. Prosecutor Sarah Marsh told the court the victim's family saw no value in Werner, who was staying in a cottage with his family near Bala, being sent to jail. She said: "They accept it was a momentary lapse and nothing will bring him back." Craig Hutchinson, defending, said Werner was remorseful and could offer no explanation for the crash.	A German holidaymaker has been fined Â£1,000 after causing a crash which killed a motorcyclist in Conwy county.
Proposals for the upgraded tennis court at Anmer House would see it moved from its current position to improve views from the hall. The new court, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, would would be resurfaced with astroturf, says the application. King's Lynn Borough Council will consider the plans at a later date. The application, lodged by the Estate Office at Sandringham, says the "current tennis court needs extensive work to resurface" and it would make sense to "remove all the existing court and start again". It says: "On completion of the new court, the garden will be prepared to reinstate the fencing and re-erect parkland iron fencing." The Royal couple are known to be fans of tennis and have previously been spotted attending games at Wimbledon.	Plans to revamp the tennis court at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's country mansion have been submitted.
The Dow Jones fell 23.15 points to 18,529.42. The wider S&P 500 was 1.23 points lower at 2,182.64, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 6.22 points to 5,244.60. The announcement that US cancer drug firm Medivation would be purchased by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sent its shares soaring 19.7%. Pfizer shares were down 0.4%. Crude prices fell 3.4% on signs of rising supplies. Brent crude fell to $49.16 a barrel, while US oil dropped to $47.43. Oil giant Chevron dropped 0.4%, and Marathon Oil sank 7%. Aside from the oil price fall, investors are cautious ahead of the annual meeting of central bankers later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "It's oil and then we've got Jackson Hole hanging over us, and there is always some surprise that comes out of Jackson Hole," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, in Chicago.

The 49-strong team for the event, which will be at London Stadium in Stratford from 14-23 July, contains 10 athletes who won gold at Rio 2016. Two-time Paralympic champion Peacock, 24, missed out on the 2015 World Championships through injury and will look to recapture the 100m title he claimed in 2013. Media playback is not supported on this device Britain won 31 medals in Doha two years ago, including 13 golds, finishing fourth in the medal table. London will be the first time the event has been held in the same city and in the same summer as the World Athletics Championships, which run from 4-13 August. Six-time world champion David Weir is not included after withdrawing from British Athletics following a fallout with coach Jenni Banks, and double T11 100m and 200m Paralympic champion Libby Clegg misses out with an injury. Cox, 26, who has multiple sclerosis, won gold medals in track cycling and athletics at Rio 2016, but has focused her training on athletics this year before her defence of her T37 100m title. Cockroft, 24, won world gold in the T34 100m, 400m and 800m two years ago, a treble she repeated in Rio last year. Whitehead, 40, can become a four-time T42 200m world champion in London, while Jo Butterfield will be given the opportunity to defend her club throw titles in the F51 and and Aled Davies his shot title in the F42 . T38 sprinter Sophie Hahn, who has cerebral palsy, can win her third individual 100m world title, despite only being 20. Paralympic champions Hollie Arnold and Aled Sion Davies are among nine athletes from Wales included.	Paralympic champions Jonnie Peacock, Hannah Cockroft, Richard Whitehead and Kadeena Cox are in the Great Britain squad for next month's World Para-Athletics Championships in London.
In Theresa May's letter triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty she states: "We believe its necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.' But Donald Tusk responded today: "Starting parallel talks on all issues at the same time as suggested by some in the UK will not happen." Bluntly, the divorce bill would have to settled before talks on trade can begin. What's more, only one party to the break-up, the European Council, would decide if the settlement is good enough. This rebuff was always likely, and the Downing Street response restrained - in effect, reminding us we were simply at the beginning of the negotiating process. So no flames fanned, but it may not be long until Theresa May feels the heat. Ahead of a divided Labour Party in the polls, she may be at the zenith of her political popularity. Because now her own party's apparent unity is set to be tested. If some of her own MPs don't like the size of any proposed financial settlement, they may not only suggest it's better to walk away with no deal, but attempt to apply pressure to this end. That in turn might lead to the largely self-muting Remainers in her ranks to find their voice. And there are more time bombs in Tusk's draft guidelines. If Theresa May wants a transitional deal, she will have to accept a "supervisory" regime for a time - presumably the European Court of Justice whose jurisdiction she wants to end. So UKIP are likely to claim by the next election that we are still "half-in, half out". And with the EU refusing to do a final trade deal until after the UK has left, it may be difficult for her to demonstrate the benefits of leaving - allowing the Liberal Democrats to claim we should never have cast aside single market membership in the first place. It's an old political adage but one with which Theresa May will be familiar: "you cannot please all of the people all of the time." But she may find it a challenge to please some of the people some of the time, even in her own party.	A tale of two sentences, drafted in two different capitals, exposes the clear blue water between London and Brussels.
Less County Championship cricket, a change of numbers in the two-division structure, a more attractive school summer holidays time slot for the T20 Blast and a Lord's one-day knockout final in July are the key outcomes. The aim is to ensure that cricket retains its popularity beyond the time when the current ageing generation which watches Championship cricket has gone - by making it more attractive to the supporters of the future. BBC Sport's county cricket expert Kevin Howells "As someone who earns a lot of his living watching Championship cricket, it's expected that I would fight tooth and nail for it to remain totally unchanged. I can't do that, no matter how much good people feel angry about the reduction in games. "The reason is simple. There is too much cricket being played and, despite the best efforts to develop a more user friendly 'appointment to view' schedule, we have still been left with too many competitions all mixed up. It has felt a mess. "The new schedule is clear and strong. Of course, for every positive, one can argue a negative. I could list things I personally would change, such as unequal games between teams in Division Two. But that misses the point of what's trying to be achieved. Over the season, the best teams will be crowned champions of their respective leagues. "One small reservation would be to what extent the Championship might have a stop-start feel to it? There will be a decent start in April and then generally two major blocks mid-season and most importantly at the end of the summer. Until we are in that season, I reserve judgment. "My suspicion is that the T20 schedule is county cricket's last chance to prove it can work before a city franchise is given a green light. The authorities have done what they can and are to play it when families have free time in the summer holidays but the weather remains the biggest player in its future. "Finally, the One-Day Cup should receive much-needed profile. I'm really looking forward to a Lord's final in July, where it belongs." ECB director of cricket Andrew Strauss, a member of the eight-strong group that devised the changes, said: "Last year a county player could change between formats as many as 24 times over the summer. Next year, that could be down to as few as six. "This will help develop skill levels and create a better narrative to the summer. An improved structure gives us a better chance to develop our players and encourage more people to play. A successful England team helps to attract new followers." Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes the T20 Blast should be seen on terrestrial television and not shown exclusively on Sky, as is currently the arrangement. "I really do believe that it needs to be seen by more," he told BBC Sport. "Whether it's mixed in with a pay-per-view, that's probably the way that it could go to structure it better. I just think more people need to see it." In Short: County cricket needs a new tournament - Vaughan	From 2017, the English summer cricket schedule is to change again.
During a "very busy two hour period" on Friday, the fire service said it received more than 100 calls to over 30 flooding incidents in Southend. Six people were rescued after their vehicles got stuck at a flooded roundabout on Woodgrange Drive. The roof of the Pearl Dragon restaurant collapsed under the weight of the rain. No-one was hurt. Crews were also sent to the Sea Life Centre, opposite the restaurant on the Eastern Esplanade, to pump water from the building. Martin Richardson, owner of the Happidrome on Southend's Golden Mile, said the amusement arcade had been overcome by water. "It came through the back, the side, it came through the wall, it came through the roof, the main drains," he said. "At least four of the arcades on the promenade suffered. "It's going to be a long while before we're open." Mark Baumann, owner of the Bourgee restaurant on the seafront, said he watched in vain as flood water entered the building. "I've never seen rain like it," he said. "The water started to come into the restaurant, and then it went further, and further. "It was all hands on deck - some of the customers helped to squeegee the water away." The rain has resulted in traffic delays, with the A12 London-bound at Witham blocked by flood water. BBC Travel has the latest on the disruption.	Six people were rescued from cars trapped in flood water, as heavy rain hit Essex overnight.
Muir, 23, broke McColgan's 25-year-old record by 14 seconds at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow on Wednesday, with a time of 14 minutes, 49.12 seconds. McColgan said she felt excited to see her last record broken by Muir. She had earlier raised concerns about whether Muir's race had met all the criteria set by UK Athletics for record-breaking attempts. She had told BBC radio's John Beattie programme it needed to be a "genuine race" and may not have been as "Muir had been the only competitor". "It was a mixed 3K race where all the other girls ran 3K and it was only Laura who finished the 5K," she said. "We were wondering if to get a record ratified you have to have drug testing as well. "So we were just wondering if they had everything in place to actually have it ratified as a record." However, British Athletics confirmed Muir's time was expected to be classified as official. A spokesman said: "The time will undergo ratification but is expected to be confirmed". Rules stipulate that if there is no doping control at an event where a British record is set, there is no requirement for the athlete to submit drug tests. McColgan said Muir had what it took to win world medals. "To run 14.49 indoors is pretty good," she said. "But she is a 3.55 minute 1,500m runner, so you would expect someone like Laura to run (5K) in something like 14.30. "So there's still a lot more in the tank and I don't think that's the fastest 5K she's ever going to run. "She's got the ability to get down to 14.30, which is really mixing it with the top in the world." McColgan said Muir's race, which saw her lap other runners, had been similar to her own record-breaking race 25 years ago. "I ran on my own right from the start with nobody really pushing me at all," she said. "I actually lapped a young Paula Radcliffe about two or three times." McColgan said it was a bonus that her record was beaten by a fellow Scot. "She is world class," she said. "She just needs to get her race tactics right so that she can start winning some medals." Muir broke her own British 1500m record at the Diamond League meeting in Paris in August and reached the 1,500m Olympic final at Rio 2016.	New 5,000m British indoor record holder Laura Muir has what it takes to win world medals, Liz McColgan has said.
Jin Ok scored the game-winning goal after GB had come back from 2-0 down. Third-period goals from Angela Taylor and Leanne Ganney levelled the game after Jong Su-hyo and Won Chol-sun had put North Korea in charge. The game gives Britain their first point of the tournament but they are bottom of Group A after three games. "Nobody likes losing and it's disappointing," said Britain's head coach Cheryl Smith. "I am more disappointed because we took some risks. We were 2-0 down, took a risk and got the goal back. "We got our heads together and the girls listened and we got back into the game. "The game was going our way when we got back into it at 2-2, but we just didn't finish it. "We had the chances in overtime but we just did not get it done." Britain, who have also lost to the Netherlands and South Korea in this event, return to action tomorrow when they face Slovenia at 16:30 (08:30 BST).	Great Britain's women fell to an overtime defeat by North Korea in their third Group A game in World Championship Division Two in Gangneung.
Cunningham, 40, left his role with Saints in April and will work alongside head coach Neil Jukes at Leigh. Owner Derek Beaumont has relinquished the head of rugby position because of his business commitments. Leigh have won one and lost one of their two fixtures in the Qualifiers, after finishing 11th in Super League. The Centurions have five games left this term to secure their Super League status for next season. Beaumont said: "Keiron has substantially more experience than myself and I feel his appointment will bring in someone with a fresh pair of eyes and a different approach, as well as a different voice around the place to freshen things up. "I still have the utmost confidence in Neil Jukes and my coaching team and their ability to achieve our goals, which I believe will be increased by Keiron's presence." Cunningham, a former St Helens, Wales and Great Britain hooker, added: "I have not come in to take anyone's place, but to add my knowledge and experience at this stage of the season. I get on well with Neil and he is a good friend. "Derek has brought me in to ease the burden on Neil and bring my experience to Leigh. Hopefully I will bring a new set of eyes and structures and I'm delighted to have been given this opportunity."	Former St Helens head coach Keiron Cunningham has been appointed head of rugby at Leigh Centurions for the rest of the 2017 season.
Chancellor Werner Faymann said numbers would be capped at about 37,500 in each of the next four years, compared to the 90,000 applications last year. Serbia responded by saying it would limit migrant passage to those seeking asylum in Austria or Germany only. The head of the European Commission has called for a summit on migration. Jean-Claude Juncker said he was worried there would not be enough time to address the issue at the next extraordinary summit of the EU's 28 member-states, due on 18-19 February. It is expected the UK's membership of the EU will dominate that meeting. The EU is drawing up plans to share the "burden" of refugees more evenly among member states, scrapping the rule that means they must claim asylum in the first country they arrive in. Cameron faces refugee 'burden' battle There has been speculation this will shift the refugee burden from southern EU states to northern ones. With some EU states already bringing in temporary border controls, the Commission fears the passport-free Schengen area could collapse if a solution is not worked out by March. Austria has become a major transit country for migrants seeking to claim asylum in  Germany. Correspondents say the influx has contributed to the popularity of the far right in Austria, sparking tensions in the governing coalition. "We can't take in all asylum-seekers in Austria," Chancellor Faymann said after a national asylum summit in Vienna. "We must also step up controls at our borders massively," he added. In Belgrade, Labour Minister Aleksandar Vulin, the government's coordinator on the migrant crisis, said: "From today, based on the decision of the Austrian government... migrants will not be able to continue their travel if they have not expressed intention to seek asylum on the territory of Austria or Germany." More than one million refugees and other migrants entered the EU clandestinely last year, mainly by sea, the majority of them seeking asylum in northern European states. Most were from Syria, gripped by civil war, followed by Afghanistan and Iraq. At least 31,000 have arrived by sea so far this year despite the winter weather, the UN refugee agency says.	The Austrian government has said it will sharply reduce the number of asylum applications it accepts this year compared with 2015.
The sign outside Chimes cafe in Machynlleth, Powys, says: "The more you weigh, the harder you are to kidnap! Stay safe. Eat cake!!" April, five, went missing on 1 October 2012 near her home, sparking the biggest search in UK history. The cafe's owner said the sign was not meant to be distasteful or offensive. She added the sign had been on "display for many weeks" and she had "only received one comment". "April Jones's family have been in here recently, when the sign was up, and have not said anything," she said. However, she admitted she could "appreciate how others would interpret the message", but believes those who have complained "have taken it the wrong way". Machynlleth resident, Angharad Penrhyn Jones, took to Twitter to say: "A sign outside a cafe in #Machynlleth: "The more you weigh, the harder it is to get kidnapped. Eat cake!" In view of #AprilJones, shocking. "I went to talk to cafe owner and apparently the sign is 'humorous' and the kidnapping happened 'years ago', and I am being 'hypersensitive.' Author and former parliamentary candidate, Mike Parker, said: "I think the sign is totally inappropriate and my first thought was how distasteful it was considering what had happened previously in the town". The cafe is situated behind the landmark clock tower in Machynlleth, which played a prominent visual role during the search for April when a large pink ribbon was placed on the railings outside. Mark Bridger, 47, of Ceinws, Powys, was found guilty of abducting and murdering April in a sexually motivated attack and must spend the rest of his life behind bars. Her remains have never been found.	A cafe owner has defended a sign urging people to eat cake to avoid being kidnapped in the town where April Jones was abducted and murdered in 2012.
The Scottish Medicines Consortium is due to take evidence on Kadcyla on Tuesday. Lesley Graham is one of four women who, along with charity Breast Cancer Now, have launched a petition for it to be approved. She told BBC Scotland it offered women like her "a little glimmer of hope". Kadcyla is used to treat a specific type of tumour - HER2-positive - when breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body. Currently, it is not approved for use on the NHS in Scotland. The SMC is due to reconsider that this week, with its decision to be announced next month. Last year Ms Graham, a 39-year-old mother of two from Barrhead, wrote to health secretary Shona Robison after being denied the treatment. She was later granted it after a second appeal. Along with three other woman - Lesley Stephen, Alison Tait and Anne MacLean-Chang - she has been calling for it to be made available automatically on the NHS. Their petition, backed by the Daily Record newspaper, now has more than 13,000 signatures. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme, she said: "If there's something out there that can help people, then it needs to be made available. "The repercussions of someone losing their mum or their daughter are widespread. It has a rippling affect. Everyone deserves a chance at life and every child deserves a mum." She added: "To be told that you have cancer and your life is therefore limited because of that is devastating enough. "But to then be told there is something that can potentially buy you some time or keep you well for longer, but you can't have it, seems to me barbaric." She described living with an incurable cancer as like "swallowing a hand-grenade and not knowing when it is going to go off". "This treatment offers a little glimmer of hope that it will buy us time and offers hope that in the meantime maybe someone can come up with something that will keep us here in addition to that," Ms Graham said. Breast Cancer Now said there were about 118 women in Scotland who "could benefit from this drug if it was approved tomorrow". The charity's director Mary Allison said: "The treatment options for this type of breast cancer are relatively limited. Kadcyla is an incredibly effective drug because of the impact it has on the cancer, but also because of the quality of life people are able to have. The side effects of this compared to other chemotherapies are far less. "This drug is available in 18 other countries in the world. It is a commonly-administered drug and one that many oncologists throughout the UK, and in Scotland, would wish to give their patients. "It is a proven, front-line treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer." In September last year, NHS Grampian agreed to give Kadcyla to Anne MacLean-Chang, a nurse from Elgin, after she wrote to the first minister asking for reform of drug funding. She fought breast cancer but it later spread to her liver. Speaking to presenter Kaye Adams ahead of the latest meeting of the SMC, she said being told there was a drug available but that she could not have it made her determined to campaign and fundraise to ensure she got the treatment. "I felt like a bear protecting her cubs because I need to be here for my children," she said. "Anyone can get cancer or a life-threatening disease but I don't think, in 2017, I ever imagined I would be in the situation where there was a drug available in many parts of the world but I was being told it's out there but you can't have it." BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle wrote about the drug in 2014, spelling out how its high cost was causing a funding conundrum.	A mother campaigning for a life-extending breast cancer drug to be made available on the NHS has said it seems "barbaric" to deny women the treatment.
Somebody had placed a garland of fresh flowers on the rusting wreckage of a tank. Men died here and were remembered. Although the fields were empty it was possible to imagine them filled with workers harvesting the sunflower crop. This was the lull, the space between bombardments when the land reminded us of its true purpose: not a battlefield but a place of abundance. I remarked to a colleague that the calm was our greatest enemy here. It lulled us into a false sense of ease. And then it started. I heard shouts of "Go, go, go" in English and Ukrainian. There were loud cracks and flashes in the fields nearby, then the surge of adrenalin; the fear - impossible to convey - of being caught in the open by artillery. Another small moment in the life of a war we have reported on for the past year. Much of that time has been spent in the villages around Donetsk airport, like Pisky. Of a pre-war population of 3,000, there are now only around 40 people left. We had come back to Pisky to spend a night in the company of a couple who refused to leave one of the most embattled places on the Ukrainian front. Anatoliy and Svetlana Kosse, both aged 68, were among the few residents still here. All around them were the ruins of houses struck by shellfire. Their days and nights are punctuated by the noise of artillery, rockets, mortars and gunfire. But alongside this murderous back and forth there was a more hopeful soundtrack. We heard it in the garden where Anatoliy tends his bees, in the kitchen where Svetlana cooked us dinner from the vegetables she grew and the eggs from her henhouse. It was the unrehearsed but determined music of life that refused to be yield in the face of war. The village sat close to Donetsk airport and on the frontline between the Government and rebel armies. There was no electricity or water. Food supplies were meagre: the couple survived on what they produced and on occasional aid deliveries. "It is terrifying," said Svetlana. "Before I only had a few grey hairs here. And now you can see. When I look at myself with my glasses on, it is terrifying." So why did they stay? Why did they not leave for the city? I asked these questions of Anatoliy as he tended the beehives. "I am taking care of them, they are here, how can I just leave them?" he replied. This was home. To leave would be to abandon all they had worked for. In fact Svetlana did move to the city for several months. Anatoliy stayed behind to take care of the home they had created together with its crop-filled garden, beehives and neat rows of flowers. We were sitting over dinner when Svetlana described what happened after she left. "When he was alone here, every morning and evening we called each other. I had a strong pain in my soul and so did he. He was a lonely man here because all the neighbours moved away." So she returned. They decided to endure the danger and the stress. I asked Anatoliy what his wife meant to him. "How can I explain what she means to me?" he said. Then he smiled and leaned across and placed his head on her shoulder. They both laughed. The shelling and shooting went on. It was a perfectly clear, starlit sky. And below the stars, shining brightly, we could see the unmanned aerial drones searching for targets on the ground. When we left the following morning I told Anatoliy and Svetlana that in war I had met all kinds of people but they were among the nicest and bravest I'd ever come across. "You make too much of us," Anatoliy replied. They laughed again. I was struck by how much laughter there was in this home. Every day now I read of fighting in Pisky; I think of the beekeeper and his wife and I curse the war that threatens such decent people.	It was a perfect afternoon in early summer.
Ogogo, 27, has resumed training as he continues his recovery from a knee operation in early February. "The physio and the surgeon are both impressed with how quickly he's got to this point," Shrewsbury boss Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Shropshire. "If he keeps joining in and he feels good, I'm not going to rule him out but I'm not going to rule him in either." Ogogo suffered medial knee ligament damage against Scunthorpe on 11 February but had still played in enough games this season to trigger a contract extension. The former Arsenal trainee joined Shrewsbury from Dagenham & Redbridge in June 2015 and has made 79 appearances for the club.	Shrewsbury Town midfielder Abu Ogogo could make a surprise return before the end of the season.
The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A   deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to."	Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at.
Alan Knight, 51, admitted murdering David Bond, 50, in Worthing and was sentenced at Hove Crown Court to serve at least 19 years. After the hearing, Sussex Police said the killing in August followed a row over the cleanliness of the house in Osmonde Close where they both lived. Det Ch Insp Tanya Jones said the tipping point was the microwave oven. Describing the level of violence as "horrendous", she said: "His reaction was extreme for something, which in reality, was very small." Police said Mr Bond was last seen on 6 August in The Warwick pub, but an argument began after he arrived home. Knight texted his friend to say his landlord had asked him to move out. He wrote: "Shall I just kill him and you find me somewhere to duck till we get a plan..." Police said he later messaged the friend to say he was "only joking" but then sent six images of Mr Bond's body, which she did not believe. The next day, Knight drove Mr Bond's car to Hove and withdrew Â£600 before abandoning the car in London and visiting a friend in Southend. The friend later told Essex Police she believed he had killed his landlord. Shortly afterwards, Sussex Police went to Mr Bond's house where his body had been seen. Det Ch Insp Jones said Knight knew what he was doing and described it as "a cold and calculated crime". She said the pair only lived together for about six months. In a statement, Mr Bond's family said: "David was a caring loving son and father to his two sons, David Jr and Christopher. Out of no reason, his life was taken away cruelly."	A lodger has been jailed for life for stabbing his landlord 29 times after a row about cleanliness.
Bangladesh police are investigating the murder of an Italian aid worker who was shot on Monday, with the Islamic State group saying it is responsible. The two-Test series was due to begin in Chittagong on Friday, 9 October. "One man gets killed, an Italian, and the tour is off. We've had 50,000 people killed in Pakistan," Khan said. Khan was referring to figures estimating the number of "fatalities in terrorist violence" in Pakistan since 2003. In May, Pakistan hosted their first home full international fixture since gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team on its way to play in Lahore in 2009. "A certain amount of tension is likely through terrorism, but they have to trust the Bangladeshis, the Indians, the Sri Lankans and Pakistanis. We give them 100% protection," Khan added. "Some of the countries, like Australia and New Zealand, are perhaps oversensitive." Cricket Australia had initially delayed the team's scheduled departure on 28 September while it worked on a "revised security plan". But it now says that official advice means it had "no alternative but to postpone the tour". The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it was "disappointed" by the decision but is "committed to rescheduling the series at a later date". On Wednesday, the BCB had promised "VVIP" treatment for the Australian team, saying they would be given the same level of security afforded to visiting heads of state. England are due to tour Bangladesh to play two Tests and three one-day internationals in October and November 2016.	Australia were "overly sensitive" to postpone their tour of Bangladesh over security concerns, says Pakistan Cricket Board president Shahryar Khan.
23 December 2016 Last updated at 01:13 GMT But much of India's milk is collected from small farms across the country, and by the time it reaches consumers it's impure and old. Some of it is even mixed with chemicals like urea in attempt to increase the quantity and fat content.

India is a huge consumer of milk - it's used to make yoghurt, cheese and a wide range of Indian sweets.
Amos dislocated a shoulder in the 32-8 defeat by Australia and will have an operation in the next week. The 22-year-old Dragons wing tweeted: "Operation set for Monday, aiming to be back in February". "It's unlucky for Hallam... but a great opportunity for Keelan," said Wales assistant coach Neil Jenkins. Find out how to get into rugby union with our special guide. Wales have already selected Cardiff Blues pair Cory Allen and Tomos Williams as injury replacements. They are waiting to discover the extent of scrum-half Rhys Webb's ankle injury suffered against the Wallabies. Amos injured his left shoulder stretching for the try-line late in the game against the Wallabies. But it is not the same shoulder he dislocated playing against England in the 2015 World Cup. Dragons backs coach Shaun Connor the region were upset by Amos' injury. "It's devastating for us, but even more so for Hallam," said Connor. "We're going to miss him, but back-three is a position where we have strength in depth." Giles has been in outstanding form for Ospreys, scoring eight tries in five appearances for the region this season. His pace, footwork and small stature - he is 5ft 8in (1.73m) and 12st 1lb (77kg) - have led to comparisons with Wales' record try scorer Shane Williams, which Jenkins acknowledged. "I think he has a little bit of X-factor about him," said Jenkins. "He's different to the other guys that we've got. I know a lot of people will point out similarities to Shane. "He's not the biggest of players but he's quick and he's electric on his feet and he's brave. "So we'll see how the next couple of weeks go - you never know. "He's got to take his chance with both hands and show the coaches and the players involved what he's all about. "He's already done that with the Ospreys and I'm sure he'll do it in our environment."	Wales have called up uncapped 18-year-old Ospreys wing Keelan Giles for the rest of the autumn international series following an injury to Hallam Amos.
Powell, 22, scored 12 goals in 41 appearances for Championship side Wigan during a loan spell in 2013-14. He joined United for £3m from Crewe in 2012 and was loaned out to Leicester City and Hull City before his contract expired in June. "He is the one player we wanted this summer and we are so happy we've got him," said Wigan boss Gary Caldwell.	Wigan Athletic have signed former Manchester United midfielder Nick Powell on a three-year contract.
Backbench MPs can speak relatively freely about their views, and Mr Corbyn took full advantage of this inside and outside Parliament. It's well known to most, by now, that he was the most rebellious Labour MP of recent times - voting against the party leadership 533 times since Tony Blair came to power in 1997. But he has made his voice heard on a dizzying range of issues since the day he first arrived in the Commons in 1983, as MP for Islington North, often using a Parliamentary tool known as an Early Day Motion (EDM). According to data on Early Day Motions on the Parliament website, since 1989 Mr Corbyn has signed 19,485 motions. Of those he was the primary sponsor of 766 and a co-sponsor on 2,727. Early Day Motions are "are formal motions submitted for debate in the House of Commons" according to the Parliament website, yet it goes on to say "very few are actually debated". Essentially they are petitions for MPs to start or put their name too. They aren't necessarily  an effective way of bringing about change and some MPs have previously called them "narcissistic" and "pointless". But they are a good way for an MP to draw attention to an issue without having to wait for their turn to come around for things like an adjournment debate, backbench business debates - or until their number gets drawn for a Private Member's Bill. To start with there probably wouldn't be a London Eye. In 1996 he filed a motion titled "Ferris wheel and the homeless". The motion said it was depressing that planning permission had been granted "for a 500 foot giant ferris wheel on the South Bank of the Thames" it went on to say it would "be an eyesore and totally inappropriate for that site". He called for the money to be spent on the homeless instead. There would be no nuclear weapons either. Mr Corbyn is a long-time supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. During his time as an MP he has submitted over 50 Early Day Motions voicing his opposition to nuclear arms in the UK and abroad. Shortly before becoming Labour leader he had submitted one titled "Trident and the Strategic Defence and Security Review" which called for the review to set out "how it has considered the delivery of UK defence and security capability without nuclear weapons, including threat assessments, estimated costs and all non-nuclear options". Mr Corbyn is a staunch defender of animal rights and has signed many an EDM calling for an end to cruelty (including one urging the BBC not to repeat an episode of Michael Palin's Around the World in 80 days in which a snake was skinned alive). But it was a 2004 motion tabled by the late Labour MP Tony Banks that caught commentators' eyes when Mr Corbyn became Labour leader, for its apparent call for the obliteration of the human race (Mr Banks had a well-developed sense of humour). It read: "That this House is appalled, but barely surprised, at the revelations in M15 files regarding the bizarre and inhumane proposals to use pigeons as flying bombs; recognises the important and live-saving role of carrier pigeons in two world wars and wonders at the lack of gratitude towards these gentle creatures; and believes that humans represent the most obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal species ever to inhabit the planet and looks forward to the day when the inevitable asteroid slams into the earth and wipes them out thus giving nature the opportunity to start again." Closer to home, in the House of Commons, Mr Corbyn wants to remove the vending machines that are "packed with crisps, fizzy drinks and confectionery" and instead offer "fruit and a number of healthy beverages and snacks". Early Day Motions are sometimes used as a way to congratulate schools, sporting stars and the work of individuals. Being a football fan Mr Corbyn has congratulated his local football club, Arsenal 13 times - both the men and women's teams. His most recent was in June congratulating "Arsenal on their twelfth winning of the FA Cup" adding further congratulations  to "the whole team, manager Arsene Wenger and all supporters on this triumph and the wonderful skills displayed in the final". Other causes he has promoted include providing Al Jazeera English channel for MPs to watch on the parliamentary estate to help them be "better informed". Jeremy Corbyn would also like a memorial in Parliament for protester Brian Haw who camped in Parliament Square for years, protesting against wars, especially the Iraq one. He died in 2011. There are some causes Jeremy Corbyn has consistently felt needed raising, many concerning human rights. He has repeatedly raised the issue for the rights of the Kurdish people, those in Western Sahara, the Dalits in India and the Palestinians. In 1992 after the defeat of President George Bush he welcomed the end of his presidency and referenced the US's "unprecedented" military action in "Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Libya and the Gulf". The Early Day Motion finished by saying the signatories were "relieved" Mr Bush had been "so emphatically defeated in the election in November". Mr Corbyn has been very supportive of Bolivian socialist President Evo Morales, submitting three Early Day Motions to congratulate him on his electoral wins, one congratulated him on his campaign which was "dominated by the demand that oil and gas reserves should benefit the people of the country and a rejection of new liberal economies". Jeremy Corbyn's recent appearance at the Stop the War Coalition Christmas fundraiser caused controversy for the Labour Party. His long support for the organisation and previous position as chairman has come under heavy scrutiny after controversial comments by the group. But in 2006 and then again in 2010 he praised their hard work for organising protests first against sending British troops to Afghanistan and then later calling on them to be withdrawn. Another controversial area where Mr Corbyn and the Parliamentary Labour Party have had differences is on armed police in the UK. In 1994 he was against increasing the number of armed police vehicles in London. The Early Day Motion said the move would "lead to a spiral of violence with criminals seeking to further arm themselves in response" and warned it about a substantial risk of "wrongful or accidental shootings". As a proud six times winner of the Parliamentary Beard of the Year contest, Mr Corbyn was always going to sign an Early Day Motion opposing a ban on British Rail workers wearing facial hair. But so outraged was he by the idea that he inserted an extra line into Lib Dem MP Alex Carlile's 1991 motion, pointing out that "beards are healthy and create the sympathetic image necessary for staff dealing with deeply distressed passengers". And finally... it seems Jeremy Corbyn is an advocate of composting. In 2002 his Early Day Motion stated it was "a good, effective and wholly natural way of dealing with organic waste". He called on the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to publish free advice to tell people "how to make the best of compost heaps." During 2012-13 there were 1,139 early day motions and it cost approximately £374,500 to print them, £3,500 in IT support costs and £33,500 in staff costs. The government said the cost "has fallen considerably" after they reduced the amount of printing. In 2009-10 the total cost was approximately £1,000,000. We've also done a rough check here and reckon it would take at least 15 hours going at full pelt to sign your name 19,485 times...	Before Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party he was a very active and opinionated backbencher.
A point against the Dutch side could keep Celtic in the hunt if Group A rivals Fenerbahce fail to beat Molde in Norway, but Deila feels his team must keep their fate in their own hands. "I still see an opportunity to go through, and that's what we are going to fight for," Deila said. "We have to go for winning the game." Group winners Molde registered home and away victories over Celtic to leave the Scottish champions bottom of Group A with two points from their four matches. Ajax are only a point better off, and Deila does not expect Frank de Boer's side to travel to Glasgow with great confidence. "They have also struggled lately in Europe," the Norwegian commented. "They haven't won away for a long time, so we have a very good opportunity. It's always very hard to come here to Celtic Park. "We are going to do everything we can to make it even harder for them and get three points." "I think that's the same for Ajax as well, they want to win. So it's going to be an interesting game and a big opportunity for us to get a good result and go down to Turkey and do everything for ourselves. "I think we've been a little bit unlucky in some of the games. Last year I can say we were maybe a little bit lucky, but this year I think we have been a little bit unlucky. "You can talk about being unlucky, but it's also about being good in the right moments. We have made some stupid mistakes and have lost some important points." Celtic will be forced to field a makeshift midfield against Ajax, with injury ensuring Scott Brown will join the suspended pair of Nir Bitton and Stefan Johansen on the sidelines. Kris Commons is also a major doubt for the match. "It is of course more tricky because a lot of the experience is out, but we have good players, players who can fill those roles," Deila continued. "We have to put together a team that can bring a good performance." "I really want to succeed in Europe. That's what everybody wants. "It's nothing to fear. It's a football match that we have a big opportunity in."	Celtic manager Ronny Deila says his side must beat Ajax on Thursday to keep their hopes of advancing to the Europa League knockout stage alive.
Reports suggest Chinese buyers are acquiring the clothing retailer, which started in London in the 1850s. Its illustrious fans have included the Queen Mother, Margaret Thatcher and actors such as Cary Grant. But after the British firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on China and last year saw its UK sales fall 16%. Hong Kong-based YGM Trading, which bought it for £15m four years ago, said Aquascutum is due to be sold in March 2017 to two buyers. The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, YGM said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm Shandong Ruyi Group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to Bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a Mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, John Emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by British soldiers during the First World War, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer Edmund Hillary in the first confirmed ascent of Mount Everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with Sean Connery wearing one in Another Time, Another Place in 1958 and Sophia Loren in The Key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its Nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration. Under YGM's ownership, the company's primary focus has been China, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Last year it closed 14 stores in China amid declining sales, but opened one in Europe. In the UK, its three remaining standalone stores are in Westfield London, Great Marlborough Street and Jermyn Street.	Aquascutum, whose luxury raincoats have been worn by royalty and film stars, is being sold for $120m (£97m).
But with no private company yet to get a craft with passengers onboard into orbit, or even sub-orbit, how can you best endeavour to lead an industry that is still very much in an embryonic state? Final Frontier's cramped headquarters are testament to the very early stage of its business sector. It is based in a tiny studio in Brooklyn Navy Yard that can barely fit co-founders Ted Southern and Nikolay Moiseev, two assistants, and a few tables. Bits of fabric and plastic tubing litter almost every available surface. However, humble surroundings have not stopped the company from dreaming big about the future possibilities - and profits - of commercial space travel, which has already seen more than $1.4bn (Â£900m) of investment from companies including Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic. And that figure is expected to more than double over the next 10 years as commercial space tourism is set to become a reality. Mr Moiseev, a former space suit designer for Zvezda, Russia's national space suit supplier, left his home country to strike out in the US. He has tried on and tested almost every space suit ever designed, and was responsible for designing the suits worn by cosmonauts on Mir, the former Russian space station, and the crew of the current International Space Station. But Mr Moiseev thinks that those designs are nothing compared with what lies ahead. "In the near future a lot of people - tourists - any age, with different health conditions, will fly in space," he says. "And the high operation pressure is a challenge for the space suit designer." This is the issue that Final Frontier says it is hoping to solve: how to design a space suit, not for an astronaut, but for a normal person who just happens to be headed to outer space. Mr Southern says: "Spaceflight is notoriously uncomfortable - tight, hot - and sometimes the spacesuits just make it worse. "When they're pressurised they're hard to move, you need special liquid cooling garments generally for space suits, and they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars," says Mr Southern. "So that's what we're trying to overcome here, we're going for a suit that's lightweight, inexpensive, safe and also more comfortable than traditionally military style spacesuits." But first there's the small matter of money. Mr Southern says: "A lot of rocket companies that are coming online now are hoping to fly 2014, 2015, 2016 - years out. "So it's been a challenge for that reason finding funding, finding partners, and finding customers." Although the pair first started dreaming and designing in 2007, after meeting at a Nasa-sponsored astronaut glove design competition (which they later placed at in 2009), they did not set up Final Frontier until 2010. At first, Mr Southern poured in his extra earnings from his day job as a costume designer for Broadway shows and circus firm Cirque de Soleil, into the business. "People always raise an eyebrow - 'Wow that's so different - props and costumes and spacesuits'," says Mr Southern with a smile. "In fact I see a full continuum there. Failure was not an option on Broadway either." Contracts with Nasa - to design radiation coating for fabrics and bits of space suits, including a pressurised elbow-and-shoulder assembly - provided Final Frontier with funding. As did an agreement with zero2infinity, a Spanish company interested in exploring suborbital trips. But in addition to traditional means, in June 2012 Final Frontier Design turned to crowd-funding website Kickstarter. Using the $27,632 they raised on the site, they were able to build the "3G" suit, which is the third version of their lightweight space suit. Meant to be worn inside the space capsule in case of a loss of pressure, it was unveiled this summer. Funding is not the only challenge: Final Frontier must also deal with competitors. There are the established space suit manufacturers, like David Clark and Boeing, who have a long history of providing suits for Nasa. Then, there are rival start-ups like Orbital Outfitters, which like Final Frontier features a founding team that includes space outsiders, such as a former Hollywood special effects artist. Finally, there are the in-house space suit design centres at a number of the commercial space tourism companies, such as SpaceX, which is led by Elon Musk, the founder of PayPal. Peter Homer, a private astronaut glove developer who started his own firm, Flagsuit (tagline: "Fits like a glove"), says there's more than enough room for everyone. "Right now, there's not a lot of competition because there's no market," says Mr Homer, who is also collaborating with Orbital Outfitters. Mr Homer won the Nasa glove competition in 2007 and 2009. "It's about trying to keep going and trying to keep moving the technology forward. I and others are kind of waiting for the customers to be ready for their space suits." So Mr Southern and Mr Moiseev continue to wait, and build. They've hired interns for the summer, who are busy testing various suit fabrics and gloves. For Mr Southern and Mr Moiseev, their unlikely partnership and even more implausible business quest, is not just about a business opportunity but also about the way they see the future. "I see it as inevitable that the human race will expand beyond the surface of the Earth, it's unfortunately finite limited surface area here," says Mr Southern. "I think it's pretty critical that we survive in these challenging environments."	Final Frontier Design wants to be the number one space suit designer for commercial space flights.
The 45-year-old led the Cumbrian side to seventh in the National League this season, seven points off the play-offs. Pools defender Matthew Bates had been in caretaker charge of the side after Dave Jones left in April. Barrow owner Paul Casson has stated Cox has a sizeable buy-out clause. Hartlepool's relegation on the final day of the season meant they dropped out of the Football League for the first time in 96 years.	Relegated League Two side Hartlepool United have been given permission to speak to Barrow manager Paul Cox about their vacant managerial position, reports BBC Radio Cumbria.
Victory over her Czech opponent would have put Konta in with a chance of breaking into the top 20 of the world rankings for the first time. Novak Djokovic reached the last 16 of the men's singes with a 7-5 7-5 win over German Phillipe Kohlschreiber. Rafael Nadal beat fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-0 7-6 (11-9). Two-time champion Serena Williams defeated Kateryna Bondarenko 6-2 6-2 to earn a quarter-final with Simona Halep.	British number one Johanna Konta is out of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells following a 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 6-3 defeat by world number 19 Karolina Pliskova.
Police said the attackers entered the property on Craigmillar Castle Road at about 20:15 on Friday. Police believe the attack may have been targeted. A 38-year-old man suffered serious, but non-life threatening, facial injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment. The second victim, aged 49, did not need medical attention. Det Insp Alan O'Brien. of Police Scotland, said: "We believe this may have been a targeted attack and are working to establish the full circumstances. "I'd urge anyone who may have seen suspicious behaviour by three men in the area at this time to come forward. "We're also eager to trace any suspicious vehicles seen in the street around this time, and I'd again ask anyone who may have information about this get in touch."	Two men have been assaulted by three masked attackers at an address in the Craigmillar area of Edinburgh.
Friday is likely to be the busiest day of the year, with air traffic controllers expecting to handle more than 8,800 flights - a record number. They have called for a drastic modernisation in the way aircraft are guided across UK airspace. It comes as the government launches a discussion to shape the UK's aviation industry for the next 30 years. Air traffic controllers expect to manage a record 770,000 flights in UK airspace over the summer - 40,000 more than last year. But the ability of the the UK's National Air Traffic Control Service (Nats) to deal with this surge is being stretched to the limit, it is claimed. Nats director Jamie Hutchison said: "In the last few weeks we have already safely managed record-breaking daily traffic levels, but the ageing design of UK airspace means we will soon reach the limits of what can be managed without delays rising significantly." The Department for Transport estimates that, if airspace management remains unchanged, there will be 3,100 days' worth of flight delays by 2030 - that is 50 times the amount seen in 2015 - along with 8,000 flight cancellations a year. The government wants the public to submit ideas on a wide range of subjects, from airport bag check-ins in town centres to noise reduction targets. The six themes it will consult on over the coming months are: Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: "Our new aviation strategy will look beyond the new runway at Heathrow and sets out a comprehensive long-term plan for UK aviation. "It will support jobs and economic growth across the whole of the UK. "Our vision puts the passenger at the heart of what we do, but also recognises the need to address the impacts of aviation on communities and the environment." Meanwhile, airport capacity is expanding way beyond Heathrow's new runway. Friday also marks the start of a Â£1bn investment programme to double the size of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2. The number of planes taking off and landing at Stansted has gone up every month for almost four years. Cardiff Airport has seen an 11% rise in traffic, and Luton is recording growth of 7% this year alone. The problem of volume has been complicated by shifts in travel patterns. Destinations including Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have lost out to Spain, Italy and the US, which means major changes in the flows of traffic into UK airspace. Nats itself is rolling out a new Â£600m ($747m) computer system known as iTec that could result in more flights and fewer delays. But Juliet Kennedy, Nats operations director, said: "What is needed is a clear and stable UK policy that recognises how important our airspace is as a critical part of our national infrastructure. "It is essential that we are able to balance the needs of airspace users with the environment and, of course, with the communities who experience aircraft noise."	Air traffic controllers are warning that UK skies are running out of room for record numbers of planes.
Liverpool City Council used a online budget simulator to ask residents about a proposed council tax rise of 5%, plus a further 6% to pay for social care. Joe Anderson said the plan would not go ahead after 57% of respondents said no. He also revealed plans for a Liverpool lottery in his New Year message on his Liverpool Express blog. He said following the "feedback... I will not be proposing to hold a referendum on any additional increase beyond the 4.99% limit set by government". Work was continuing on the full details of the authority's budget, he said, which would then undergo consultation in 2017. He added that he was "surprised and proud that so many, 43%, said yes". "It's a truly heart-warming reminder of how caring our city really is," he said. Green party leader Councillor Tom Crone said the consultation was a "sham exercise". "The weak consultation was never going to secure support for a tax rise," he said. He said the mayor's decision not to hold a referendum meant there would be "tens of millions of pounds more cuts to services in the coming years". Liberal Democrat leader Councillor Richard Kemp, said: "The public were never going to buy it over concern about the waste of existing council tax income." Mr Anderson said the Liverpool lottery card would help local causes, adding that more details of it would be revealed in the coming months. "Liverpool people are amongst the most generous in the country and I believe will support the initiative to help us cope with the growing numbers of people dependent on us," he said. Councillor Kemp said his party would oppose the lottery idea. He said: "The overwhelming evidence is that existing lottery users are already from the most deprived parts of the community. "A new Liverpool lottery will be a tax on the poor to pay for services to the poor."	There will not be a referendum on an additional council tax rise in Liverpool after the results of an online poll, the city's mayor has said.
Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said the money would be given "to develop inspirational projects that could have a transformative local effect". She said it would be a legacy from next year's Great Exhibition Of The North, to be held in Newcastle and Gateshead. It comes after the government scrapped projects in the north and then backed a £30bn Crossrail 2 scheme for London. Jake Berry, minister for the so-called Northern Powerhouse, welcomed the cash injection. He said: "The North is a cultural powerhouse, as well as an economic one, and this £15m fund will give a boost to the region's vibrant culture and tech sectors. "We've already invested over £3.4bn for projects to boost local economies in the Northern Powerhouse and this latest funding will help make sure the Great Exhibition of the North creates a legacy for years to come." Under the scheme, towns and cities across the north can apply for grants of up to £4m per project via the Northern Cultural Regeneration Fund. Projects such as opening a new tech start-up centre or renovating live music venues would be considered. Ms Bradley said: "We want as many people as possible to benefit from the Great Exhibition Of The North, and this fund will boost the Northern Powerhouse and help build a lasting legacy across the whole region." The first round of bids will be coordinated by Local Enterprise Partnerships in Cheshire and Warrington, Cumbria, East Riding, Greater Manchester, Humber, Lancashire, Leeds, Liverpool, North East, Sheffield, Tees, York and North Yorkshire. Successful projects are expected to be announced in March 2018.	A £15m cash fund to boost culture and creativity across the North of England has been announced by the government.
Last week, the 31-year-old Brighton midfielder was named in the Wales squad for their upcoming friendlies, over two years after his last call-up. "Wales manager Chris Coleman said to have a better chance of going in the summer he'd like to see me playing regularly," Crofts told BBC Radio Kent. "I wasn't guaranteed that with Brighton, so it was a tough decision." Crofts has featured 18 times for the Seagulls, who are second in the Championship, this season but his last outing came in the defeat by Cardiff on 20 February. The former Norwich man has won 27 caps for Wales, with the last of those coming against Serbia in September 2013. However, he could add to those in the friendlies against Northern Ireland and Ukraine during the international break. "With the Euros coming up for Wales it was important for me to get some games under my belt before the end of the season," he added. "After speaking to Chris, my place isn't guaranteed even if I play, but it gives me the best opportunity." Crofts began his career at Gillingham and has returned to Priestfield Stadium until the end of the campaign, although Brighton have a 28-day recall clause as part of the deal. He scored 19 goals in 191 games in his first stint at the Kent club and he hopes he can help the Gills, who are fourth in League One, win promotion to the Championship. "This year I have got three massive goals; Brighton to get promoted, Gillingham to get promoted and a place at the Euros," he said. "I am going to work as hard as I can to achieve those things. I'll give it everything I have got."	Andrew Crofts says his ambition to play at Euro 2016 is part of the reason for his loan move to Gillingham.
The nine employees were made redundant when Ilex closed earlier this year. Ilex was set up in 2003 to regenerate two former Army bases but was shut down in March amid accusations it failed to deliver enough investment and jobs. The ex-workers taking the legal action have accused the Northern Ireland Executive of breaching employment law. A spokesperson for the executive said it could not comment as the case was before an industrial tribunal, which is due to be heard early next year. Ilex was criticised in an independent review in July 2015 over failings in the redevelopment of Fort George Army base and Ebrington Barracks in Derry. The report said the lack of progress in infrastructure investment, specifically in developing business accommodation, was particularly concerning. Among its successes, however, the company pointed to its role in helping to build Derry's Peace Bridge and the opening of the Northern Ireland Science Park on the Fort George site. In March, 18 Ilex workers were made redundant and the two bases were handed over to Derry City and Strabane District Council. Nine of those workers are taking action against the Northern Ireland Executive claiming their jobs should also have been transferred to the council. They have accused the Northern Ireland Executive of breaching a law which ensures workers move from one employer to another when a business changes hands.	Former staff at a government-run regeneration body in Londonderry are taking a case against Stormont over the way they lost their jobs.
A 59-year-old teacher from London received £185,000 after she slipped a disc in her back after she was knocked to the ground by two unruly pupils. A member of teaching staff in north Wales was given £100,000 compensation when the chair he sat on collapsed. The NASUWTteaching union said it had won £16,077,328 for members last year. A Department for Education spokesperson said:  "School employers are responsible for the health and safety of staff and pupils whether the local authority, governing body or academy trust, and they must adhere to the Health and Safety Act 1974." Teachers also received smaller payouts over accidents in the workplace, including a £55,000 package for a female member of staff in north-west England who tripped on a tear in the lino surface of her science classroom. She was later diagnosed with chronic back syndrome. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said many of the injuries would be reduced if employers "took the welfare of staff seriously" and followed good health and safety practices. She said: "The consequence of negligence is careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money spent in compensation. "Unfortunately, there is no incentive for employers to take health and welfare seriously when they witness the government cutting funding for inspection and failing to take steps to secure compliance with the law. "Failure to respect the rights of employees and to comply with employment law is also prevalent. "Employers flout the law, but it's the teachers and the taxpayers who pay the price. "While compensation is important, it can never make up for the fact that teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often cannot continue in their chosen career." Separate data from the NUT, which keeps its overall compensation figures private, said there were two cases of personal injury compensation paid to its members last year. One included a £46,000 payout to a teacher who suffered "severe psychological injury" following "a sustained campaign of bullying and harassment by senior leadership". Another NUT member was awarded just under £4,500 after she fractured a finger on a defective doorknob, causing her long-term aches and a deformity. The union said it offered legal help in 130 cases last year, including 71 involving criminal activity and 57 in employment cases.	Teachers won millions of pounds in compensation last year after suffering discrimination and serious injuries in the line of work, a union said.
When only the top two went through from each group, you could generally expect to meet another good team as soon as you reached the knockout stage. But the expansion of the tournament for Euro 2016 means that this time, if we can win our group, we will play the third-placed team from Group A, C or D in the last 16. They will almost certainly be weaker, giving us a much easier route to the quarter-finals - something which I think is a must for Roy Hodgson's team. We have to get that far, otherwise, with the players we have and the format of these finals, we will have failed. So, a positive start against Russia is imperative. We go into England's first match in Group B not knowing which system we will play - a midfield diamond, a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1. In our final warm-up game, against Portugal, the diamond failed. There is no hiding from that. It did not work because most of the midfield was too deep and defensive and the forwards ended up like wingers, dealing with the opposition full-backs, when they should have been picked up by the wide midfielders or our own full-backs, higher up the pitch. A few weeks ago I thought the diamond was probably the best way to get Wayne Rooney, Jamie Vardy and Harry Kane in the same team. Now, I will be amazed if that happens. I played under Hodgson and his assistant Ray Lewington for three years at Fulham and, knowing them like I do, they will choose a system that their players feel comfortable in. That is the most important thing. They will have had a good look at what went wrong with the diamond and will either revert to the 4-3-3 shape they used in March's win over Germany or the 4-2-3-1 that everyone will be familiar with. Personally I would go with a 4-2-3-1 but I think Roy will use 4-3-3. Unfortunately, that means he will have to leave out Vardy. I don't think playing strikers out wide works just to get them in the team because they look so unnatural doing it. Rooney is different when it comes to taking one of the wider roles because he has done it before and would not operate as a winger. He would sit narrower. That way he can support Kane and also drop deeper as Dele Alli flies forward. Media playback is not supported on this device Whatever the formation and selection, what I want to see from England in Marseille is a high-intensity performance, with us on the front foot, pressing Russia and trying to make things happen. We can do that in a controlled fashion so we do not have to be gung-ho. But it will be up to us to take the game to Russia because they will definitely have a more cautious approach. We should beat them with the extra quality we have in attacking areas but we certainly will not just roll them over. Their defensive record in qualifying once Leonid Slutsky took over was pretty impressive, conceding only one goal in four matches. I am not expecting a great game on Saturday, if I am honest, but I would expect us to dominate the ball and have a good go at them. Russia will be dangerous too, of course. Artem Dzyuba is a powerful centre-forward and there are plenty of players with good technical ability in their side, even without injured playmaker Alan Dzagoev. There is concern about how England will cope at the back against Russia - and everyone else - because we have looked so vulnerable at times in our warm-up games. But the fact we are not perfect defensively does not worry me too much because we have the firepower to cause opposition teams a lot of problems. If I have any doubts about England it is actually about the creative aspect of our team in midfield. From my perspective as a former midfielder, we played it too safe in the games against Turkey, Australia and Portugal and just looked to keep possession. We have some steady, solid players but they have to be braver on the ball. Dele Alli gives us that higher up the pitch when he looks to slide in Harry Kane - but, in the middle of the pitch against a tight defence like Russia's, who is going to find a pass to unlock the opposition? The only player we have who can really do that from deeper positions is Jack Wilshere. If he is fit, he will start. Eric Dier has become an important player in that holding role because he is in such good form and Wilshere is not 100%. But in an ideal world, Wilshere would be sitting in there dictating play. He is not quite as defence-minded as Dier but, as a ball player, he is superb. It might be a case of easing him into this tournament but, when he is fully fit, he will be the key to giving us that balance we need in midfield because he sees the passes that no-one else does. Who do you think should start at Euro 2016? Step into Roy Hodgsons shoes and pick your XI - and then share it with your friends using our brand new team selector. Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan in France.	England have never won their opening game at a European Championship but there is an extra incentive for them to finally put that right against Russia on Saturday.
Jo Deering died in 2011, aged 52,  just months after being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Under-fire Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust admitted it could have made better decisions about her care. However, Ms Deering's sister, Maureen Rickman, said the trust's findings "deserved to be binned". In December, the BBC revealed that the trust, which provides services to about 45,000 people in Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, had failed to investigate hundreds of unexpected deaths since 2011. Ms Deering, from New Milton, Hampshire, had paranoid schizophrenia and was discharged from hospital two weeks after being sectioned. She was sent home where she was the main carer for her 89-year-old mother, who had dementia. Four months later she took her own life. Her family said the trust should not have allowed her to go home while she was still ill. In its 2012 report, the trust said the medical team based at Waterford House who cared for Ms Deering should "be commended for their ongoing efforts to work with Joanna and her whole family in as an inclusive a way as possible, despite significant complications". Ms Rickman said: "There isn't an investigation here, nothing of the sort. I could have carried out a better investigation myself to be quite frank." She added: "It deserves to be binned - nobody would have known anything from this at all, there is nothing to take away from this other than a load of psycho babble and twaddle." In a statement, Dr Lesley Stevens, medical director at the trust, said the report found its "decision-making process about granting leave, and how we communicated this with Jo and her family, could have been better". "Robust actions to learn from this incident were fully implemented at the time," she added. She said the trust had provided community support to help Ms Deering with her role as a carer. "The way we investigate and learn when things go wrong, has changed substantially," she added.	The family of a woman who killed herself after being discharged from hospital has labelled a report into her death "psycho babble and twaddle".
Thirteen people were killed when British paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march through the city in January 1972. A fourteenth died later. The 66-year-old former paratrooper was arrested in County Antrim on Tuesday. It is understood he is being questioned over the deaths of William Nash, Michael McDaid and John Young. He is soldier J, who was one of the soldiers who appeared before the Saville Inquiry. Leo Young, whose brother John was killed aged 17 on Bloody Sunday, told BBC Radio Foyle that he welcomed the news. "A flood of emotions came into my head when I heard the news about the arrest," said Mr Young. "A prosecution has to happen soon. We waited for over 40 years and this is a big step. "I think about my brother every day. His life was cut short and I keep thinking about him because he would probably be married today. "I was 24 at the time and going through those inquires was a real battle. "This is a giant step and I feel for all the families involved." John Kelly, whose brother Michael was among those killed on Bloody Sunday, said the arrest "gives fresh hope". "This is a massive moment for the families and the city," said Mr Kelly. "My brother's death is no different to any other death on that day. This is major development and I hope there is an arrest in relation to my brother soon. "Hopefully there will be prosecutions soon." Sir Gerald Howarth, a Conservative MP and former defence minister who represents former soldiers on duty at the time of Bloody Sunday, said there are hundreds of families dealing with murder across Northern Ireland. "We cannot forget that a lot of families haven't had justice yet," said Sir Howarth. "It would be good if we could just close this chapter. "I'm not excusing what happened but I do not think it is in the public interest for former soldiers to be prosecuted. "This is now a matter for the prosecuting authorities though."	Detectives are continuing to question a former soldier over the deaths of three people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry.

Boss Jaap Stam has no new injury worries but may make changes after the Royals suffered back-to-back league defeats to drop to fifth in the table. Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic has no new injury worries following Saturday's 1-1 draw at local rivals QPR. Forwards Floyd Ayite and Neeskens Kebano are away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. The Whites travel to the Madejski Stadium six points behind Reading and five points off the play-off places. The fixture has been rearranged after the original meeting on 30 December was abandoned because of fog at half-time, with the score 0-0. Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire: "Sometimes you lose a couple of games in succession, that's football. But it's about the mentality in the team. Are you mentally strong to turn it around and start winning games again? "Fulham have got a great team, play very good possession football as well and we know that and everyone else is aware of it. "We need to make sure we play well and try and make it difficult for them. "There's a lot of games coming up at the moment, but after a loss, it's good to play again quickly as you have a chance to redeem yourself." Fulham goalkeeper David Button told BBC Radio London: "The abandonment was a bit strange. It was lucky the game was level because otherwise I'm sure it would have been a bit controversial. "We have to show Reading respect because they are ahead of us in the table. They play a similar passing style to us, so we are wary of them. "We are hopeful we can get in the play-offs. They are in our way to achieving what we want. We want their play-off spot and are not afraid of talking about it." BBC Radio Berkshire's Tim Dellor Reading's meetings with Fulham over the last couple of years have never been dull. Last year the two sides drew 2-2 at the Madejski Stadium. Reading's most recent trips to Craven Cottage have ended in heavy defeats. Expect goals. According to the BBC Weather forecast, we should also expect mist. Reading go into the game having lost two consecutive Championship games for the first time since August. Jaap Stam will want to avert any slide quickly. Defensively, Reading have looked particularly vulnerable lately. Fulham have a play-off spot in their sights and will move to seventh with a win. The stats and the history point to this being a huge game in the context of both sides' seasons.	Reading will be without left-back Jordan Obita who is suspended following his sending off against Derby County.
People currently get antiretroviral therapy only when their white blood cell levels drop. But a US-led study has now been cut short as early treatment was so beneficial for patients. The United Nations Aids agency has called for everyone to get immediate access to the drugs. Around 35 million people are living with HIV and more than 2 million start antiretroviral therapy each year. The discovery of drugs to attack the virus has profoundly changed the way the disease is treated. But there has been fierce debate about when treatment should start. World Health Organization guidelines say treatment should start when there are fewer than 500 white blood cells in every cubic millimetre of blood. The trial on 4,685 people in 35 countries, organised by the US National Institutes of Health, compared this approach with immediate treatment. The trial started in 2011 and was due to run until the end of 2016. But an interim analysis of the data showed that cases of Aids, deaths and complications, such as kidney or liver disease, had already been halved by early treatment. All patients on the trial are now being offered antiretroviral drugs. The director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Anthony Fauci, said: "We now have clear-cut proof that it is of significantly greater health benefit to an HIV-infected person to start antiretroviral therapy sooner rather than later. "Moreover, early therapy conveys a double benefit, not only improving the health of individuals but at the same time, by lowering their viral load, reducing the risk they will transmit HIV to others. "These findings have global implications for the treatment of HIV." Michel Sidibe, executive director of at UNAids, argued: "Every person living with HIV should have immediate access to life-saving antiretroviral therapy. "Delaying access to HIV treatment under any pretext is denying the right to health." Dr Steve Taylor, the lead HIV Consultant at the Birmingham Heartlands HIV Service, told the BBC the trial was hugely important. "Not least that they will they will change the way HIV treatment is prescribed in the UK and around the world. "Based on this study, people will be able to access treatment much earlier than currently, which is good for their own health and will reduce HIV transmission." Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: "These exciting results should dramatically change the approach to treatment for people living with HIV, both in the UK and internationally."	HIV drugs should be given at the moment of diagnosis, according to a major trial that could change the way millions of people are treated.
The women, who worked at Kinsley Academy, claimed their pay had been cut after the contract switched from Wakefield Council to C&D Cleaning. The three women were reportedly dismissed by C&D Cleaning on Monday. C&D have been approached for comment but confirmed to the Guardian the trio had had their employment terminated. Labour MP for Hemsworth Jon Trickett said: "With only days till Christmas it looks like Scrooge has been brought back to life from Victorian times." For updates and more stories from across West Yorkshire Lesley Leake, Karen McGee and Marice Hall went on strike in September saying their pay had been slashed and their pensions, holiday and sick pay had also been cut when the contract changed hands after the primary school became an academy. In October about 100 people joined the women on a protest march through Barnsley, where C&D Cleaning is based. According to reports the women were sacked following a disciplinary hearing on 19 December. Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "I am angered that three striking primary school cleaners from Kinsley have been sacked. "When I met them, they explained how their wages were cut following the outsourcing of their contracts to a private company. "Outsourcing is bad for our public services and workers. The cleaners' jobs must be brought back in-house with fair pay and conditions." The BBC has approached C&D Cleaning for a comment. In a statement published in the Guardian, the company said the women had been invited to a disciplinary hearing to "respond to allegations of gross misconduct". It said: "The outcome of the hearing was termination of employment. "The company will not comment further at this stage so as not prejudice any internal process." Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: "These women bravely took action to protect their wages and employment rights. "To then sack them just days before Christmas is heartless in the extreme."	Three cleaners who went on strike over a pay dispute have been sacked in a move branded Scrooge-like by one MP.
Police found the child after being called to at a home at Bromsgrove Cottages in Faringdon at around 13:20 GMT on Tuesday. A 40-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder and the child's next-of-kin have been informed. The boy was said to be of primary school age. Police have increased their presence in the area. They said this was in order "to provide reassurance". Visit our live page for the latest updates. Supt Rory Freeman, local police area commander for South and Vale of White Horse, said: "This is a very shocking discovery and I am aware it may have a very direct impact on the community of Faringdon. "We would advise any members of the community affected by this incident to speak to one of the neighbourhood policing team." The woman remains in police custody. Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting 730. Police tape remains around the line of cottages, and uniformed and plain clothes officers are coming and going as the investigation continues. News that something serious had happened spread rapidly on social media on Tuesday night. This morning passers-by are saying they are shocked and saddened by what's happened. One lady walking to school with her son stopped to give a rose to one of the police officers monitoring the cordon. This is quite a visible place opposite the fire station; a lot of people go past here, so the police are asking anyone with information to contact them.	A murder investigation has been launched after a boy was found dead at a house in Oxfordshire.
Northampton Town's League One 3-0 home win over Coventry City was disrupted several times by fans on Saturday. Northamptonshire Police said six arrests were made when spectators from the away stand invaded the pitch and a further three when flares were let-off. Coventry City said the disruption was "unacceptable". Northampton declined to comment. Those arrested were bailed. Northampton Town said it would not comment until a decision was made by the Football Association or English Football League on an investigation. "The repeated disruptions to yesterday's match at Northampton Town were unacceptable," a Coventry City spokesman said. "Coventry City FC will support all subsequent investigations by the police and football authorities." Match reports said the fans were protesting against the Coventry club's owners. Supt Chris Hillery said: "During the fixture we were made aware that some of the spectators in the away South Stand had planned a mass pitch incursion at a designated time. "As a result, match officials turned off the scoreboard time display and officers were placed in front of the West Stand and in the players' tunnel to prevent people intent on disorder entering these areas en masse." There was no serious disorder, violence or injury, police said.	Nine men have been arrested over a pitch invasion and flares being thrown at a football match.
Deputy Education Minister Mduduzi Manana appeared in court last week to face the assault charge. He is accused of hitting the woman during an argument at the venue. On Saturday, a brief statement from President Jacob Zuma's office said he had accepted Mr Manana's resignation, and thanked him for "his contribution to the work of government". Mr Manana has previously apologised for what he called a "shameful incident". He claimed he was provoked, but "should have exercised restraint". His political party, the African National Congress, welcomed his resignation and also thanked him for his service. When the allegations first emerged, the ANC said "such behaviour is unacceptable ... violence against women is the shame of our times". The allegations caused widespread outrage in South Africa, where violence against women is not uncommon. During his initial court hearing, he was brought into the courtroom through a separate entrance, and journalists were not permitted inside. But Police Minister Fikile Mbalula insisted that Mr Manana would not receive any special treatment. "The deputy minister will not be treated with special kid gloves but will face the full wrath of the law. The state fully supports the victim," he said. He was released on bail of $375 (Â£290) pending further investigation.	A South African minister has resigned amid accusations he assaulted a woman in a nightclub earlier this month.
The problem is that so many of the initiatives and ideas sold to the country as ground-breaking prove to be business as usual. So the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid went out of his way to sound no-nonsense and tough today. He accused some English councils of "fudging" the numbers on housing need in their area and warned them that he was not going to allow that to happen anymore. But the response to the government's proposals has been decidedly mixed. Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey described them as "feeble beyond belief". "Re-treading old ground" was how the National Association of Commercial Finance Brokers described the White Paper.  "Kicking the can down the road," one big investment fund said. The chief executive of the housebuilder Inland Homes, Stephen Wicks, bemoaned the failure to relax rules on green belt development. "Brownfield in itself can't possibly sustain the long-term housing requirements of the UK," he said.  "It can go an awful long way but there needs to be a relaxation of some green belt to enable us to deliver the numbers that we are required to do." The White Paper does include measures to encourage developers, housing associations and councils to build more affordable homes more quickly, both to rent and to buy. But this government seems to speak with two voices on housing: the communities department wants to shift the balance of power firmly towards new development in places people want to live, but Number 10 and some influential Tory backbenchers are sympathetic to the passionate concerns of those who wish to protect the countryside and particularly the green belt. The real question that lies behind all the rhetoric and policy bullet-points is whether the balance of power between development and local opposition has fundamentally changed. Ministers now accept England needs 250,000 new homes every year, they have described the housing market as "broken" and they agree that radical change is the only way to mend it. But many have yet to be convinced that this White Paper amounts to a "realistic plan" to achieve that.	Over the last three decades, governments of various stripes have promised radical change to solve England's housing crisis and today's White Paper is no exception.
The deal to stop fighting was agreed between the Syrian government and some rebel groups fighting against them. There has been a war in Syria since 2011 and since then, it's thought 300,000 people have lost their lives. Four million people, including children, have been forced to leave the country and seek safety in nearby countries and Europe. So far, the new ceasefire, which started at midnight on Thursday, seems to be holding, although there have been reports of isolated fighting in some areas. Read our guide to find out more about why there is a war in Syria and why the city of Aleppo is so important. A ceasefire is an agreement by opposing sides to stop fighting in a war. This can be for a certain amount of time as a short break or it can be agreed for a longer period of time. In this ceasefire in Syria, there are many groups involved. Syrian government forces, the Free Syrian Army and many rebel groups have all agreed to the ceasefire. But not all groups operating in the country are part of the deal. The group that calls itself Islamic State and other extremist Islamist groups, are not part of the ceasefire. Islamic State have taken over large parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and fighting against them is continuing, whilst the ceasefire is underway. If the ceasefire does continue to hold, then peace talks aimed at ending the war in Syria could be held within a month.	A new ceasefire is underway in the war torn country of Syria in the Middle East.
After a five-year approval process, the humble Yakka Skink - a secretive lizard known to hide under rocks and inside hollow logs - and the Ornamental Snake brought to a halt a A$16bn ($12bn; Â£8bn) mine, rail and port project proposed for the Galilee Basin in Queensland. The two reptiles are among Australia's most threatened species. Because the federal environment minister failed to take into account what the mine could mean for their habitat, his earlier approval for the mine was overturned by the Federal Court of Australia. The mine may still go ahead but the delay is the latest chapter in a long history of Australian flora and fauna causing grief to developers. Back in 1995, one of the last known colonies of the endangered Green and Gold Bell frog delayed the construction of a multi-million dollar residential development in inner-city Sydney. A few years later, the frogs were found frolicking in an abandoned brick pit where authorities had planned to build a tennis court for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The courts were built elsewhere while the frogs got a specially built habitat. Now they are in the way of a key major road project in Sydney. In the mid 2000s, a new species of flowering shrub was discovered in the Lower Hunter Valley, north of Sydney. Named Persoonia pauciflora, botanists were excited to discover it grew nowhere else in the world. Unfortunately, it was growing on the site of a proposed housing development. When word got around, someone ripped out 300 of the last 500 of these rare plants. The culprit was never found. The discovery of a threatened or new species can cause havoc for developers, delaying or even putting an end to a project. What overturned the Queensland mine's approval? A small conservation group in Mackay, Queensland, challenged the environment minister's decision to approve the mine on a number of legal bases, including: Approved Conservation Advices are scientific and legal documents that explain the conservation requirements of species to avoid their extinction. It was this last point that convinced the court to overturn the minister's approval. In the state of Victoria, the Orange-bellied Parrot was centre stage in a long-running saga about whether a wind farm could be built in South Gippsland. The federal environment minister banned the 52-turbine project in 2006, on advice that turbine blades posed a small risk to the critically endangered bird. The minister eventually reversed his own decision and the wind farm is going ahead. In the case of Indian company Adani's giant coal mine in Queensland, environmentalists and scientists are worried about more than threats to reptiles. Dredging associated with an expansion of port facilities for the mine poses a huge risk to the Great Barrier Reef; exports would further entrench the world's reliance on carbon polluting fossil fuels; and the mine could threaten artesian water. The Department of the Environment on Wednesday said reconsideration of the project did not require revisiting the entire approval process. New approval documentation could be ready within eight weeks. Adani described the court decision as simply a "technical legal error". But environmentalists say protecting endangered species is vital work. "To describe an endangered species as a technicality and groundwater as a technicality is in line with Adani's environmental record around the world, which is appalling," said Geoff Cousins, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation. "The government should simply strike this project down."	This week a giant coal mine that could produce millions of tonnes of coal for export to India was scuttled by two Australian reptiles.
Rezgar Zengana posed as a taxi driver to pick up his 25-year-old victim in Argyle Street before raping her at a flat in Cessnock on 10 December 2006. The 33-year-old Iraqi national fled after being convicted of the attack. Zengana features in a most-wanted list of nine UK suspects who are thought to be in the Netherlands. The list has been put published by the UK charity Crimestoppers and the National Crime Agency (NCA). Dave Allen, from the NCA, said: "Those who believe they can use the Netherlands to evade capture or continue illegal activities soon find out that it is not a safe haven."	One of Scotland's most wanted fugitives is still believed to be hiding in the Netherlands almost 10 years after he raped a woman in Glasgow.
On Friday, Facebook was given 72 hours to take down the page 'Keeping our kids safe from predators', which had focused on paedophiles in Northern Ireland. The man took the case after discovering that his photograph and threatening comments were posted on the page. Facebook complied with the order, but a similar page appeared within hours. The High Court judge who ordered the removal of the original page, Mr Justice McCloskey, held that the contents of the original version amounted to prima facie harassment of the man and risked infringing his human rights. While the judge granted anonymity to the sex offender, he also stressed that the ruling does not suppress information about him or his criminal record that is already in the public domain. A detailed written version of the judge's verdict discloses further details about the man's catalogue of crimes. Known only as XY, the man at the centre of the case has a total of 15 convictions for sexual offences, all of which were committed in the 1980s. He was released after serving half his prison sentence, only to be detained for a further six months for breaching a condition of his licence. The judge who sentenced him reportedly expressed particular concern about his lack of insight into his offending. It has also been confirmed that he first offended when he was still a juvenile. When he issued the proceedings against Facebook, the man claimed harassment, misuse of private information, and a breach of his right to privacy and freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment. Mr Justice McCloskey's written judgment discloses that one of the remedies being sought is a claim for damages against Facebook Ireland Ltd. That issue has not been determined, with the ruling only on interim relief. The court heard the man suffers from ill health and fears being attacked or burnt out of his home. In a statement filed as part of his case he said: "I am in fear for my safety and in a state of constant anxiety as I believe if this material continues to be published it will only be a matter of time before the threats materialise into an attack on me or my home. "The defendants are publishing comments intended to vilify me, some of which are directly threatening. "By publishing this material about me, the defendants are providing a vehicle for others who may have criminal intent to gain information about where I live and to stir up hatred against me." Mr Justice McCloskey ruled in his favour after balancing the competing rights to privacy and freedom of expression. He pointed out that the interim injunction would cause minimal disruption to Facebook. The judge added that details about the man's name, physical appearance, criminal record and whereabouts were already in the public domain. "This information will remain in the public domain, come what may," he said. "The order of this court does not suppress publication of this information in any way. "Rather, it simply requires certain modest steps to be taken by the operator of a social networking site to ensure that, pending the substantive trial of this action, the plaintiff is not exposed to further conduct which I consider, to a high level of arguability, to be unlawful." The judge also emphasised that cases of this type will be "intensely fact-sensitive". He said: "The court is mindful of the contemporary controversy surrounding other contexts, such as online bullying of schoolchildren and the potentially appalling consequences of this gravely worrying phenomenon. "This judgement does not speak directly to other contexts. Rather, it is confined to the particular litigation context in which is it provided."	A convicted child sex offender, who won a landmark court case forcing Facebook to take down a website page monitoring paedophiles, is now seeking damages.
The 85 children had to eat peanut protein every day - initially in small doses, but ramped up during the study. The findings, published in the Lancet, suggest 84% of allergic children could eat the equivalent of five peanuts a day after six months. Experts have warned that the therapy is not yet ready for widespread use. Peanuts are the most common cause of fatal allergic reactions to food. There is no treatment so the only option for patients is to avoid them completely, leading to a lifetime of checking every food label before a meal. The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, tried to train the children's immune systems to tolerate peanut protein. Every day they were given a peanut protein powder - starting off on a dose equivalent to one 70th of a peanut. The theory was that patients started at the extremely low dose, well below the threshold for an allergic response. Once a fortnight the dose was increased while the children were in hospital, in case there was any reaction, and then they continued taking the higher dose at home. The majority of patients learned to tolerate the peanut. Claire Rooney describes the daily anxieties of having a daughter with multiple food allergies. 'Niamh's allergies have changed our lives' Lena Barden, 11, from Histon in Cambridgeshire, said: "It meant a trip to the hospital every two weeks. "A year later I could eat five whole peanuts with no reaction at all. "The trial has been an experience and adventure that has changed my life and I've had so much fun, but I still hate peanuts!" One of the researchers, Dr Andrew Clark, told the BBC: "It really transformed their lives dramatically; this really comes across during the trial. "It's a potential treatment and the next step is to make it available to patients, but there will be significant costs in providing the treatment - in the specialist centres and staff and producing the peanut to a sufficiently high standard." Fellow researcher Dr Pamela Ewan added: "This large study is the first of its kind in the world to have had such a positive outcome, and is an important advance in peanut allergy research." But she said further studies would be needed and that people should not try this on their own as this "should only be done by medical professionals in specialist settings". The research has been broadly welcomed by other researchers in the field, but some concerns about how any therapy could be introduced have been raised. Prof Gideon Lack, who is running a peanut allergy trial at the Evelina Children's Hospital in London, told the BBC: "This is a really important research step in trying to improve our management of peanut allergy, but is not yet ready for use in clinical practice. "We need a proper risk assessment needs to be done to ensure we will not make life more dangerous for these children. He warned that 60% of people with a peanut allergy were also allergic to other nuts so a carefree lifestyle would rarely be an option. Prof Barry Kay, from the department of allergy and clinical immunology at Imperial College London, said: "The real issues that still remain include how long the results will last, and whether the positive effects might lead affected individuals to have a false sense of security. "Another issue to address is whether there will be long term side-effects of repeated peanut exposure even where full allergic reaction does not occur, such as inflammation of the oesophagus. "So, this study shows encouraging results that add to the current literature, but more studies are needed to pin down these issues before the current advice to peanut allergy sufferers, which is to avoid eating peanuts, is changed." Maureen Jenkins, director of clinical services at Allergy UK, said: "The fantastic results of this study exceed expectation. "Peanut allergy is a particularly frightening food allergy, causing constant anxiety of a reaction from peanut traces. "This is a major step forward in the global quest to manage it." Prof Simon Murch, an allergy expert at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: "This is clearly a promising paper but it certainly isn't a cure. "Nevertheless this study does point towards a promising new direction of therapy and once further testing has been carried out, and techniques refined, it may prove to be a therapy with widespread use in hospitals in future." But he added: " This is not something that should be undertaken at home, or indeed outside specialist centres."	Doctors say a potential treatment for peanut allergy has transformed the lives of children taking part in a large clinical trial.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the impact on sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) "could not be fully mitigated". The Â£1.1bn M4 proposal would cross four SSSIs along the Gwent Levels. Welsh Government lawyers argued environmental concerns had to be balanced against other interests. The inquiry in Newport heard the scheme would mean about 105 hectares of designated land, set aside for the protection of water invertebrates, would have to be lost. The Gwent Levels' unique network of ditches, known as reens, were dug during Roman times and have since become a habitat for a range of rare species. The Welsh Government has pledged to replace lost reens with new ones. Dr Jessica Poole, of conservation body Natural Resources Wales (NRW), told the inquiry discussions between the regulator and the Welsh Government meant she was content with the proposed design of the new reens. But she said there was no guarantee they would work, and it could be some time before they supported the aquatic insects the sites are meant to conserve. Replicating a complex ecology that has developed over centuries would be "challenging", she said. NRW said the Welsh Government had not demonstrated the project would comply with its statutory duty to promote sustainable development. Should the alternative blue route, suggested by transport expert Prof Stuart Cole, be adopted - the motorway's impact on SSSI land would be "significantly reduced", Dr Poole said. But the inquiry heard several issues NRW had raised in letters responding to the project's draft plans had been addressed and it was now satisfied on matters including water quality, drainage and some protected species such as otters and bats. Morag Ellis QC, acting on behalf of the Welsh Government, said it was for Welsh ministers to balance any potential impact on SSSI land with other public interests related to the new motorway. Claiming adverse effects were "fully mitigated for" was to apply a standard not in accordance with the law, she said. She described the changes NRW had made to its initial objections after extensive discussions with Welsh Government as "a major step forward".	The scale of loss of conservation land caused by the proposed M4 relief road would be "unacceptable", a public inquiry has heard.
Joyce Watson, Labour AM for Mid and West Wales, backs a fingerprint ID system of cashless payments to help poorer children. She is due to launch a debate on the issue in the Senedd on Tuesday and says some pupils are going hungry to avoid being seen to claim free meals. She says there is a mixed picture on the use of cashless payment systems. Her office's research indicates that in Denbighshire, for example, all secondary schools use some sort of cashless system, whereas in Anglesey none do. Most commonly, in schools where children still pay with cash for their dinners, pupils eligible for free meals are given tickets. The AM believes this makes it easy for such children to be identified and put at risk of bullying. She recommends rolling out a system by which children have accounts to pay for school dinners which can be topped up either by their parents or by the local authority if they qualify for school meals. All pupils would then pay for their meals by a biometric reading of their fingerprint at the till without anyone knowing how their account was funded. Ms Watson said: "68% is the average take up of free school meals where we have a system that identifies against a near 100% where we have a system that doesn't identify those who have free school meals and those who don't. She claimed that in schools without a cashless system there were "an awful lot of children simply going hungry" to avoid being seen to have free meals. "[They] can't concentrate. Their sugar levels fall and their behaviour is also adversely affected by what's happening," she said. Ms Watson intends to use her short debate during the assembly plenary to remind fellow AMs of a government commitment to roll out such cashless systems. She said: "[Education Minister Leighton Andrews] did commit to rolling this out by September 2012. "I want to know that that is happening. And I really think that this archaic practice of identifying children has to stop." Addressing security concerns, Ms Watson said pupils' fingerprints were stored securely by the company that installed the biometric technology away from the school and could not be accessed by authorities. One disincentive to move to a biometric system may be the cost, which the AM estimates at up to Â£30,000 for installation and Â£2,000 a year for maintenance. However, Stephen Jones, head teacher of Ysgol Glan-y-Mor in Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, said its piloting of a biometric payment system over the last four years had delivered results. He said it had cut the time pupils queued for lunches as well as removing any stigma attached to free school meals. "The children like it," he said. "It's almost a fun element to having their lunch, the fingerprints. "It's much quicker so they're happy about that. "The offshoot, I suppose, would be that parents can actually have computerised printouts of all the food and drink that their children consume and they can keep an eye on whether they're having a healthy diet or not."	Wales should put an end to the "stigma" children face for claiming free school meals, an assembly member claims.
We Were There was written by Leicester singer Bob Wragg for the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain. Mr Wragg, 82, said its original release was deemed "inappropriate" following the outbreak of the Falklands War. The recording features many of the winning side including Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters. The song came about through Mr Wragg's friendship with keeper Gordon Banks, England's victorious goalkeeper in 1966, and he asked him about recording a song to wish the 1982 side well. Many of the World Cup winning players feature in the video, with the exception of brothers Bobby and Jackie Charlton, who were away at the time, and Nobby Stiles, who was ill. The recording, which has sat in the attic at Mr Wragg's Isle of Man home for more than three decades, includes captain Bobby Moore playing tambourine. Mr Wragg, who performed with the 1950s variety act the Dallas Boys, said: "The atmosphere was amazing but I had to teach a few of them to sing - I even taught Alan Ball to sing a harmony. We had a right knees up. "I heard the lads were in Leicester to shoot a promo so I had one night to write a song and one day to record it and make a video. The record label loved it but then the Falklands war broke out and it was shelved." The singer is a founder member of what has been described as Britain's first boy band and now lives in Laxey with his wife. He decided to search his attic for the song and video after reading that three of the squad were living with Alzheimer's disease. It has been released coincide with the European Championships in France and all funds from the song will go to the charity Alzheimer's Research UK. Mr Wragg added: "This is a nostalgic delight and will support a very worthy charity - I was so emotional watching it back knowing that some of the lads have passed away now."	A football anthem sung by England's 1966 World Cup winning side has been released after spending 34 years hidden in an Isle of Man attic.
Michelle O'Neill hosted a departmental breakfast at the Balmoral Show on Thursday morning. In attendance was the Chinese consul general Madam Wang Shuying. Chinese inspectors visited Northern Ireland pork plants in April as part of a process to approve local pork for export. Ms O'Neill said she was also hoping to agree access to Chinese markets for beef and chicken. US consul general Greg Burton was also at the event. Northern Ireland is hoping to sell beef into the United States. Ms O'Neill said she was also working with Irish agriculture minister Simon Coveney to resolve labelling issues that have hit Northern Ireland lamb sales to meat plants in the Republic of Ireland. She told guests that the quality of Northern Ireland food was "something that carries our reputation around the world." She said it was "safe, traceable and sustainably produced" and she would seek to use that reputation to open doors. It is the second day of the Balmoral Show, the biggest showcase for Northern Ireland's farming and food industries.	The agriculture minister is to return to China next month as attempts to access markets there continue.
Nottinghamshire Police said it would expand its categories to include misogynistic incidents. It means abuse or harassment which might not be a crime can be reported to and investigated by the police, and support for the victim put in place. Nottingham Women's Centre said it hopes it will help give more victims the courage to report incidents. Chief Constable Sue Fish claimed it will make the county a safer place for women. "What women face, often on a daily basis, is absolutely unacceptable and can be extremely distressing," she said. "Nottinghamshire Police is committed to taking misogynistic hate crime seriously and encourages anyone who is affected by it to contact us without hesitation." Work on the idea first started with the Nottinghamshire Safer for Women Conference last year, co-hosted by the police with the Nottingham Women's Centre. BBC TV reporter Sarah Teale was harassed in the street while reporting on the conference. The force defines misogyny hate crime as: "Incidents against women that are motivated by an attitude of a man towards a woman and includes behaviour targeted towards a woman by men simply because they are a woman." The classification now means people can report incidents which might not be considered to be a crime and the police will investigate. Nottingham Women's Centre has been helping train call centre, force control staff and officers on the beat to recognise misogynistic hate crime and ways to tackle it. These officers will also examine if and how a victim can be supported or if anything can be done to help prevent them being targeted again. Domestic abuse will not be recorded as a misogyny hate crime because it has its own procedure, the force said. Melanie Jeffs, centre manager at Nottingham Women's Centre, said: "We're pleased to see Nottinghamshire Police recognise the breadth of violence and intimidation that women experience on a daily basis in our communities." She added: "Recording this as a hate crime will give us a detailed picture of how often, when and where it is happening. It has been very difficult to build that picture before but we will now get detailed data to analyse. "Showing that the police take it seriously will also give people the confidence to come forward and report offences." A crime that the victim or any other person perceives to be motivated by hostility or prejudice towards any aspect of a person's identity. Police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland annually monitor five strands of hate crime: Forces can include their own definition of a hate crime with several recently adding sub cultures.	Harassment of women is to be recorded as a hate crime in a bid to tackle sexist abuse.
The Tigers opened talks with an interested party in May. They have been up for sale since 2014, after the Football Association turned down owner Assem Allam's request to change their name to Hull Tigers. It has been a tough summer for Hull, who have just 13 fit players because of injuries, and whose manager Steve Bruce was a candidate for the England job. Bruce was interviewed on Monday for the England post, which is set to go to Sunderland's Sam Allardyce. A club statement said: "Whilst the owners intend to continue discussing a sale to interested parties in September, the priority for the coming weeks is strengthening the squad ahead of the start of the new Premier League season, particularly given the number of injuries sustained to key players during pre-season." Hull - who won promotion back to the top flight in May - open the Premier League season by hosting champions Leicester on Saturday, 13 August.	Hull have put takeover talks on hold until September to "ensure stability during the transfer window".
Twenty hostages and two police officers died during a 12-hour siege when Islamic militants stormed a cafe in the capital city Dhaka on Friday. England are scheduled to play three one-day internationals and two Tests in Bangladesh. The ECB said that "safety and security of players was always paramount". England will play all their fixtures in Dhaka or Chittagong during their month-long visit, which begins with an ODI on 7 October. The ECB said it will consult with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office over security in Bangladesh, and would take "appropriate steps" if advised that "the environment is not acceptably safe".	The England and Wales Cricket Board says it is monitoring the security situation in Bangladesh before England's tour in October.
The Dudley Muslim Association has offered Dudley Council £325,000 to drop court action in a dispute about the site where the mosque is to be built. If accepted, the association would retain ownership of the land on Hall Street, and the council would not invoke its buy-back clause. The council has so far incurred £213,000 in legal costs. The land at the centre of the dispute was bought by the association 10 years ago, with the aim of replacing its current building on Castle Hill, which it said it had outgrown. Proposals include a community and training centre, sports facilities and a two-storey car park, but the mosque itself and its three prayer halls have been the focus of opposition. Branded at times a "mega mosque", the plans have attracted EDL supporters from across the country, although community leaders have in turn accused them of "scaremongering". At its meeting on 25 June, the council's cabinet will refer the settlement offer to its scrutiny board for consideration. Pete Lowe, leader of the council, said both the authority and the association were keen to avoid further costly legal disputes. "We are carefully considering that offer in the interests of everyone concerned," he said.	An out of court settlement has been offered by a Muslim group to end a long-running dispute over a new mosque.
The company's boss has outlined new plans for the social network. One will let you see what you missed while you were offline, say sleeping. "We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app," Twitter explained in a blog post. Another new function could filter tweets, making the app more like Facebook by sifting through the content posted by your friends to find the pictures and jokes it thinks you will be most interested in. This may be unpopular with the users who enjoy the chronological nature of the social network. The change you'll see soonest affects direct messaging. It's not yet clear what the changes will be, but according to Twitter it has "several updates coming that will make it easy to take a public conversation private". The first of these will begin rolling out next week: the ability to share and discuss Tweets natively and privately via Direct Messages. Twitter says it will allow you to upload your own videos directly to the timeline by the beginning of 2015. It also hopes to make it easier for people who are just joining the site by providing them with a ready-made list of people to follow. Twitter described it as "an instant, personalized timeline for new users who don't want to spend time cultivating one on their own". The company admitted that about 125 million people go to Twitter's homepage each month and decide not to sign up, Twitter's new features were mentioned by boss, Dick Costolo, at an investor day. The changes are important to Twitter's financial future, given the competition it faces from other social media companies, and the stock price rose after Mr Costolo spoke.

They are asking him to "reconcile" the "tensions" between tougher restrictions and the desire for economic growth. Net migration figures fell last year, with officials saying this was "largely due" to a drop in foreign students. But the government says it is committed to stamping out abuses of the immigration system. On Thursday, the House of Lords is set to debate the impact of immigration policy on UK higher education. The coalition has pledged to restrict the level of annual net migration - the balance between the number of people who come to live in the UK for the long-term and the number who are leaving - to "tens of thousands". Since last year, all institutions which want to sponsor non-European Union students for a visa must be accredited as "highly trusted". Potential entrants have to speak a higher standard of English and the "post-study work route" to staying on has been closed, unless graduates have an offer of one of a list of skilled jobs. The overall UK net migration figure fell from 242,000 to 183,000 in the year to March. The Office for National Statistics said this was "largely due" to a decline in the number of foreign students despite an increase in the number of arrivals from China - the UK's largest overseas student market. Opponents of the government's changes say they damage the economy by restricting the lucrative movement of students to the UK, putting universities at a disadvantage. In their letter to Mr Cameron, the five select committee chairmen urge "further action to encourage international university students to study in the UK". They add: "Doing so has the potential to support economic growth in the immediate and longer term, supporting jobs in university towns and increasing export earnings. "International students who study in the UK also build relationships which last over time, laying the foundations for future business opportunities in emerging economies, and supporting our foreign policy objectives." They also ask the prime minister to "reconcile the remaining tensions between visa policy and aspirations for growth by removing international students from the net migration target". The signatories include three Labour MPs: Keith Vaz (Home Affairs Committee), Adrian Bailey (Business Committee) and Margaret Hodge (Public Accounts Committee). The others are cross-bench peers Lord Hannay (Europe Sub-Committee) and Lord Krebs (Science and Technology Committee).	The chairmen of five parliamentary committees have written to David Cameron to urge him to remove overseas student numbers from migration targets.
The vehicle was taken from a farm in Tilney St Lawrence, near King's Lynn, Norfolk shortly before 20:00 GMT on Saturday. It was abandoned in Oakroyd Crescent in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, after it was driven in to a dead end. A man in his 20s from Wisbech has been arrested in connection with the incident. Norfolk and Cambridgeshire Police forces were involved in the pursuit.	Police chased a tractor between two counties in a pursuit involving six patrol cars and a force helicopter.
This will be ripe territory for both sides because they believe that is where the highest numbers of undecided voters are to be found. Morgan Brobyn, from Vote Leave, said he was looking to take advantage of the split loyalties many feel because of their previous support for remain-supporting Labour. He said: "It is a combination of failed aspirations which they see around them and because they don't see any tangible benefit to the EU or any difference it's made to their lives. "The level of structural funding is not enough of an incentive for them to remain." Lord Hain, who is running the Welsh Labour In campaign, said between a fifth and a third of voters in its heartland areas were undecided. He said: "People are beginning to get alarmed. We are going to have to fight for a vote that people took for granted. "There is a big section that is undecided and they will hold the key." It means that rock-solid Labour areas will become political battlegrounds during the next week, in marked contrast to normal elections where the results are often foregone conclusions. Unlike in a first-past-the-post general election, every vote in a referendum counts as the the entire UK. In effect, becomes one giant constituency. The Valleys feature prominently in the areas that Vote Leave will be focusing on in the final days of the campaign. As well as Merthyr Tydfil and Caerphilly, they include Port Talbot, Cardiff and Newport. In the north, extra resources will be deployed in the constituencies of Clwyd West, Aberconwy and Wrexham. Leave campaigners say their blanket leafleting approach will be replaced by more targeted door-to-door canvassing in the final days. Any undecided voters expressing some degree of sympathy for a Brexit to a Vote Leave campaigner can expect another visit on June 23rd as the campaign focuses on getting its vote out. Senior Vote Leave figures admit some of their data is too narrow but they believe they are ahead in most parts of Wales apart from Anglesey, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Cardiff and in Newport where they say they are neck-and-neck with remain. They claim to have had up to 500 activists operating in Wales in the past week. The make-up of the teams vary. In the Vale of Glamorgan, around 80% of the local Conservative activists who campaigned for the party in the recent assembly and general elections are out campaigning for leave. The remain side is more difficult to characterise because it is made up of a number of different elements. Wales Stronger In is the umbrella organisation, but it works alongside parties like Plaid Cymru, and parallel with the much larger ground operation run by Labour. Labour has run a separate operation involving up to 1,000 people on a weekly basis, and has focused entirely on traditional voters using a combination of doorstep canvassing and town centre stalls. From here until the referendum, Labour's focus will be in the south Wales valleys and Newport, where the party admits there is plenty of heavy lifting to be done. Lord Hain believes in some areas it is developing into a head versus heart debate. He says people have begun approaching them saying their heart wants them to leave but their head is telling them to stay. And it is this remark which they are latching onto, as the leave side try to generate a sense of momentum in the final stage of the campaign.	The main battleground in Wales in the final week of the referendum campaign will be the south Wales valleys.
The claim: Anyone can win £50 million by correctly predicting the result of all 51 games in the Euro 2016 football championships. Vote Leave says this figure represents the amount of money the UK sends to the EU every day. Reality Check verdict: Unlikely anyone could win this prize. The odds of winning are only slightly better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street. The UK does not send £50 million a day to the EU. But, as the Reality Check team have been finding out, the chances of winning are staggeringly small. There are a total of 36 games in the group stage of the tournament and 15 knockout matches. The odds of correctly forecasting all 51 games randomly are a sextillion to one. Now, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages. The finals feature 24 teams for the first time and with 16 of them qualifying for the first knockout round, the results are harder to predict. Even if you had a 70% chance of getting each one right, the odds are probably about one in 80,000,000 - quite a bit worse than your chances of winning the lottery (45,000,000 to one since you ask). Vote Leave recognise that the odds are slim but campaign director Dominic Cummings defended the contest, saying: "We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP." For the record, MEPs earn 8,213 euros (about £6,250) per month. To qualify for the prize, participants have to enter their phone number, together with their email and home addresses, with a Vote Leave source admitting it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters. Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, described the competition as a "con". But Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to "opt out" from receiving campaign information "at any time". Odds aside, Vote Leave have based their competition prize figure on the assertion that the UK sends £50m a day - or £350m a week to the EU. They've been sharply reprimanded for this by Sir Andrew Dilnot, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority for using it. He described it as "misleading" and said it "undermines trust in official statistics". We've looked into this claim before and concluded that once you allow for the rebate and money that comes back to the UK for things like farming subsidies, the UK sends roughly £23 million a day to the EU. This would be a very tidy lump sum but not nearly as generous as the amount that Vote Leave is offering. Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate	Vote Leave has promised a £50m prize for the person who correctly predicts who they think will win each game of the 2016 European Football Championships this summer.
Education select committee chairman Neil Carmichael said parents would be "wondering what to do" after Friday's ruling, and would need clarity. The High Court concluded Jon Platt had no case to answer because his daughter had attended school regularly overall. The government has said it will now consider making alterations to the law. Term-time holidays: Your stories What are the rules on holidays? What might change now? The Isle of Wight Council had asked the High Court to clarify whether a seven-day absence amounted to a child failing to attend regularly after Mr Platt, 44, took his daughter on holiday, despite her school refusing permission for the trip. The court backed magistrates who had ruled Mr Platt, had no case to answer. Speaking to BBC Radio Four's Today programme, Mr Carmichael said: "I certainly think we need a period of reflection on this matter because this ruling causes a huge amount of confusion. "Instead of confusion we need clarity - clarity for parents and clarity for the schools, because people will be wondering what to do next given the scale of the change." Since 2013, tougher government regulations have meant head teachers can grant leave of absence to pupils during term time only in "exceptional circumstances". Shadow schools minister Nic Dakin told Today the previous rules, which allowed head teachers to grant leave for up to 10 days under "special circumstances", had been "working effectively". But Mr Carmichael said the problem with that policy was in defining what counted as "special circumstances". "You'd have to be very careful about defining what you think is a special circumstance," he said. "The government will have to think very carefully about this because what we don't want is the special circumstance happens to be 'There's a cheap holiday and we'd like to go'." Rather than reverting to the previous system, which he argued could lead to classroom disruption because of families taking children on cheaper holidays, Mr Carmichael suggested that term times could be "more flexible". He said this was a suggestion he would be making to the education select committee when it considers the issue. Mr Dakin said the ruling was the "worst of both worlds" because it left uncertainty for both teachers and parents. He criticised the decision to change the rules around term-time holidays and called on the government to look at the issue again. "I think it was a foolish move and I think it's led to where we are today," he added. Sal Davies was fined in 2008 for taking her children, aged six and seven, out of school for 10 days to see their grandparents in Asia. She told BBC Radio 5 live: "I really don't think those 10 days out of school damaged my children, changed their educational potential. "I think they've done really well. They met family members. It was where I was born. It was a wonderful trip." But Patsy Kane, an executive head teacher of Whalley Range and Levenshulme high schools in Manchester, said parents needed to take the "really long term view" on their children's education. "There are 13 weeks' holiday throughout the school year when parents can take trips. "There's six weeks in most areas for the summer holiday. That really is plenty of time for extended family trips." Mr Platt was issued with a Â£60 fixed penalty fine following the holiday to Disney World in April 2015. After he missed the payment deadline, the council doubled the fine to Â£120 which he also refused to pay. The council then prosecuted him for failing to ensure that his daughter attended school regularly, contrary to a section of the Education Act 1996. Mr Platt successfully argued there was no case to answer as the prosecution had failed to show that the child did not attend regularly. Even with this and other absences, Mr Platt maintains her attendance remained above 90% - the threshold for persistent truancy defined by the Department for Education. According to local authority data, almost 64,000 fines were imposed for unauthorised absences between September 2013 and August 2014. Many parents complain that the cost of going away in the school holidays can be four times as much as during term time. But the government says there is clear evidence "that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chance of gaining good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their life chances". The Independent's travel editor Simon Calder told BBC Radio 4's PM programme on Friday the ruling would "certainly" lead to prices coming down in school holidays, but would also cause them to "gradually" go up in term time. He said the travel industry was "quietly absolutely delighted" by this because they wanted prices to be more level throughout the year.	A High Court ruling backing a parent who refused to pay a fine for taking his child on holiday in term time will cause "huge confusion", an MP has said.
Sports Direct also reported a big drop in half-year profits, which it blamed partly on the fall in the pound. The retailer, which has been criticised over working conditions, said reported pre-tax profits fell 25% to Â£140.2m. However, the firm added that it would be buying a corporate jet for Â£40m. Chief executive Mike Ashley said the past six months had been "tough for our people and performance". Announcing the company's results, Mr Ashley said: "Our UK sports retail business continues to be the engine of Sports Direct, but our results have been affected by the significant deterioration in exchange rates, and our assessment of our risk relating to our stock levels and European stores performance." Mr Hellawell, who has been under fire during his tenure as chairman, used the results statement to launch a blistering attack on the way in which the company had been treated. "I have no doubt that the extreme political, union and media campaign waged against this company has not only damaged its reputation and influenced our customers, it has impacted negatively on the morale of our people," he said. "I begin to question whether this intense scrutiny is all ethically motivated. One of the most damaging consequences has been for the very people our critics supposedly support. "The board accepts responsibility for our shortcomings, but there has also been disproportionate, inaccurate and misleading commentary. "The individuals at the heart of our organisation are blameless. They are increasingly upset and angry at the barrage of detrimental comments about the company, which in their view is unjustified." Sports Direct has suffered from a number of scandals in recent months. After HMRC looked into whether workers at its Derbyshire warehouse were paid below the minimum wage, a damning report by the the Business, Innovation and Skills committee said employees of the company were "not treated as humans". Since the criticism over its treatment of staff began, a delegation of MPs claimed an attempt was made to record them in a private discussion while on a visit to the firm's Shirebrook warehouse. Most recently, an investigation into the company's accounts was launched. Several senior employees have also left the company. Dave Forsey stepped down as chief executive and was replaced by Mr Ashley. Acting finance director Matt Pearson was replaced by another interim appointment, Herbert Monteith, in October. A subtle sign of the change in mindset at Sports Direct comes deep in the fine print of today's interim results. Under the prim heading "corporate assets and facilities", the company says it is about to take delivery of a corporate plane. Business aircraft are always a potential source of embarrassing headlines, and Sports Direct has had its fair share of those over the last year. But finally it has shown it has learned one of the ways to avoid such headlines - be upfront about what is happening and explain it, and the sting is drawn. Elsewhere, the company's critics were given a few sops. The veteran banker David Brayshaw has been recruited as an independent director, and may perhaps be in line to take over as chairman, should Keith Hellawell, the incumbent, not survive another vote on his tenure on 5 January. Mr Hellawell offered to resign earlier this year, but was convinced not to by Mr Ashley. However, after failing to receive the necessary support from a majority of the company's independent shareholders who voted at the annual general meeting in September, the chairman will stand for re-election on 5 January next year.	Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell has lambasted critics of the sportswear firm, saying an "extreme political, union and media campaign" has damaged its reputation.
But once the votes are counted, what can residents expect to pay in council tax? Below are the figures for a Band D property for every council area in Wales for the current financial year of 2017/18, how much that has gone up by for the current year, and what the average property in the area actually pays. They are grouped here by police force region - council tax includes the police precept which is added to the overall bill paid by homes. Local government is not fully funded by council tax. Much of the funding for councils comes in the form of grants from the Welsh Government, which in turn gets its funding from the UK government in London. In 2017/18 a total of £4.1bn is being divided among Wales' 22 councils. The lions share of council cash goes on schools - with social services following behind, as shown in the graph above. Residents pay council tax based on which band their property is in, based on its worth. Band D has historically been used as the standard for comparing council tax levels between and across local authorities. It is used to charge tax to a property that, in Wales, was worth between £91,001 to £123,000 on April 2003 values. Council tax gets lower the cheaper a property is, and higher the more expensive a property is. Council tax figures source: Welsh Government	Voters will go to the polls on Thursday to determine who will represent them on local councils.
Many wept as they prayed for the pope outside the city's main cathedral. The vigil was followed by a Sunday morning Mass, with the dead pope's body sat in the papal chair dressed in ceremonial robes. He died at the age of 88 on Saturday, after reportedly suffering from cancer. He led the Church for four decades. Coptic Christians make up 10% of Egypt's population of 80 million, making them the Middle East's largest Christian minority. After attacks on Coptic Christians in recent years, Pope Shenouda had urged officials to do more to address the community's concerns. A crowd of mourners estimated to be larger than 100,000, spent the night outside St Mark's Cathedral, many weeping as they prayed for the pope. Thousands queued to see Pope Shenouda, whose body was placed in a coffin before being seated on a ceremonial throne wearing embroidered vestments and a golden mitre, and holding a gold-topped staff. The government has given Coptic Christians three days off work to prepare for his funeral. The BBC's Jon Leyne, in Cairo, says there is no timetable yet for the selection of his successor, who will be elected by a conclave of senior bishops. Tributes have come in from around the world, with Roman Catholic Pope Benedict XVI offering prayers and US President Barack Obama praising Pope Shenouda as an "advocate for tolerance and religious dialogue". Egypt's military rulers expressed the hope on their Facebook page that his wish of "preserving the unity of Egypt and the unity of its social fabric" would be achieved. And a senior Muslim cleric, the Grand Imam of the prestigious al-Azhar university, Ahmed al-Tayeb, expressed sorrow and said he "greatly remembers his vision towards Jerusalem and its history". Pope Shenouda had returned recently to Egypt after seeking treatment abroad. Our correspondent says he sought to protect his Christian community's position within the Muslim majority by striking a conservative tone and lending tacit support to President Mubarak's rule. Whoever succeeds him now faces the task of reassuring the Coptic community as the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood look on the verge of sharing power in Egypt for the first time, our correspondent says.	Tens of thousands of Egyptian Coptic Christians have held an overnight vigil in Cairo to mourn the death of their spiritual leader, Pope Shenouda III.
Yorkshire Water said the problem was detected at water treatment works at Tophill Low and Keldgate. A spokesman said the issue had now been resolved but it could take several hours for water supplies to return to normal. The HU7 and HU8 postcodes were particularly affected by the problem, along with other places in the city. Tens of thousands of residents could be affected, but the exact figure will not be known until an investigation has been carried out. Yorkshire Water said: "We apologise for the inconvenience caused this morning and hope to get the issue resolved and the water supply back to normal by the end of the day."	Thousands of homes in Hull have been left without water due to a technical fault.
The BBC, in collaboration with tech company This Place, has developed a way people can select programmes using a cheap, brainwave-reading headset. The headset works with an experimental version of the BBC's iPlayer on-demand platform. Users can turn on and operate the app by concentrating or relaxing their minds. "It's an internal prototype designed to give our programme makers, technologists and other users an idea of how this technology might be used in future," said Cyrus Saihan, head of business development for the BBC's Digital division. In the first trial, 10 BBC staff tried out the app and were able to launch iPlayer and start viewing a programme via the headset, he said. "It was much easier for some than it was for others, but they all managed to get it to work," said Mr Saihan. This type of technology could be used to help people with a broad range of disabilities who cannot use traditional TV remote controls very easily, Mr Saihan believes. Manipulating electronic devices using brainwaves is becoming more widespread. For example, in February technology firm Tekever demonstrated how a drone could be remotely controlled using brainpower alone. The pilot controlled the aircraft wearing a skullcap embedded with electronic sensors that could read his brain activity. You can watch a video about the iPlayer mind control project here.	If you think controlling your TV with your mind is the stuff of science fiction, think again.
The 34-year-old has been absent from the club since a training-ground row after the 5-1 Scottish Premiership loss at Celtic on 10 September. Alongside agent Eddy Jennings, he attended a meeting with club officials last week. Barton, who joined from Burnley in May, has repeatedly said he wants to return and fight for his Rangers place. "Joey Barton has been told he will return to full-time training following the conclusion of a disciplinary procedure," read a statement on Rangers' website. "The Auchenhowie [training base] management team will inform the player of appropriate training arrangements to which he must adhere for as long as he remains a Rangers player. "Neither the club, nor the player, will comment further." Barton is also facing Scottish FA charges for breaching betting rules. He was charged with placing 44 bets on games between 1 July and 15 September. The former Manchester City, Newcastle United and QPR player, who has one England cap, left Burnley under freedom of contract at the end of last season, signing a two-year contract at Ibrox. He has made eight appearances for Mark Warburton's side, who are second in the Premiership. Barton was not available for comment but said earlier on Wednesday on Twitter that it was "a lovely day for a @Iceman_Hof session and a run!" in reference to Dutch ice bath training guru Wim Hof. BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson The fact that Joey Barton is returning to full-time training does not necessarily mean the resumption of his Rangers career. Under Fifa rules, a player under contract at a club must be provided with training facilities. The fact that the player was suspended reflects the view of the management team about the serious nature of a training-ground row in September. Any return to the first-team squad would need to be handled in such a way as to not disrupt the mood and unity among the players. Rangers' statement does not say that Barton is returning to the first-team squad, or will be available for selection, and only the management team at their Auchinhowie training base is mentioned, rather than first-team manager Mark Warburton. Either the player does eventually return to the first-team squad, or his Rangers career effectively remains over and what happens in the January transfer window will be significant.	Rangers say midfielder Joey Barton "will return to full-time training" following a club-imposed suspension.
Sports Minister Carál Nί Chuilίn said they stood down just before she was due to meet board representatives. They were there to discuss a report by the Head of Internal Audit at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Department of Education. Ms Nί Chuilίn said she advised the remaining members at the meeting "of my deep concerns at the issues raised by their staff" with the internal auditor. On Friday, the minister called for the meeting to consider the findings of the report into "serious allegations" about the "leadership, management and the overall culture" of the organisation. After Monday's meeting, she said she had accepted the board members' resignations, and thanked them "for their efforts in promoting and fostering sport during their time in office". In a statement, she said: "Given the ongoing challenges in Sport NI, I am taking steps to intervene directly to support both staff and the remaining board members. "I also wish to advise staff that their concerns are being taken seriously and that they will be fully addressed." Chair of the culture committee Nelson McCausland said the situation was "shocking and unprecedented". "That is why we need to get Carál Nί Chuilίn in front of the committee as soon as possible," he said. "It tells  us something about the department and the way that the minister has been running the department," Mr McCausland told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. "We also want to talk to the people who resigned, they have a story as well. "It is a whole quagmire, we need to get to the bottom of it. The minister owes that to the public, to Sport NI and to the  committee." Ms Nί Chuilίn said she would meet the remaining board members later this week. No-one from Sport NI was available for comment.	Nine members of the Sport NI board have resigned with immediate effect.
This brings the number of military dismissals to more than 3,000 following the failed coup, in which rebel units used tanks and aircraft to try to oust President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Saturday Mr Erdogan announced steps to put all armed forces under direct government control, amid a crackdown. He accuses US-based cleric Fetullah Gulen of being behind the coup attempt. At least 246 people died as rebel soldiers tried to seize power on 15 July. Mr Gulen denies any involvement. The latest soldiers to be dismissed include Mr Erdogan's chief military adviser, a top aide to the chief of the general staff and the defence minister's chief secretary. On Saturday the government announced plans to close all military academies and bring land, naval and air forces under the control of the defence ministry. The proposals need to be approved by parliament. The coup has triggered a massive purge, with 66,000 public sector workers dismissed and 50,000 passports cancelled. The state has also shut 142 media outlets and detained journalists. A three-month state of emergency has also been declared. President Erdogan has ignored international unease about the crackdown, telling his foreign critics: "Mind your own business."	Turkey's government has sacked another 1,389 soldiers accused of being linked to the coup attempt earlier this month.
The company also says its franchisees were helped by a "record low cheese price, favourable wheat price and a fall in fuel costs". Pre-tax profits were Â£73.16m, up from Â£62.1m in 2014. E-commerce sales now account for 77.7% of all UK deliveries and 48.6% of online sales are made using its app. Domino's says online orders in the UK rose by nearly 29% last year and app-based orders shot up by more than 41%, with 11.5 million people now having downloaded the app in total. "The thing that customers want more than anything else is convenience and that means food that's delivered to their home," chief executive David Wild told the BBC. The second most important thing, he said, was food that can be ordered online. "We have seen a massive increase in our online orders - a total of 11.5 million app downloads since we launched our app two or three years ago - and what we have learnt is that customers like to find it easy to get hold of a pizza and that's the most important trend," Mr Wild said. The chain opened a record 61 new stores in the UK in 2015, taking its total number of outlets to 869 by the end of the year. Domino's said its franchises had seen increased profitability over the course of the year "primarily as a result of the benign food price environment combined with the group's purchasing power". "In 2015 we passed on savings of Â£11m from lower food costs primarily from cheese and dough and the outlook remains favourable for 2016." Apart from the UK business, Domino's Pizza Group also owns the franchises in the Republic of Ireland, where it has 47 stores, and Switzerland where it has 15, as well as Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Last December, it entered into a joint venture to buy Germany's biggest delivery chain, Joey's Pizza. That deal was finalised at the beginning of last month and as a result Domino's Pizza Group is no longer directly operating in Germany. In the UK, Domino's featured in a Channel 4 documentary called "A Slice of Life" which was viewed more than a million times and which it said, resulted in a significant increase in recruitment applications. During the year Domino's launched the Tikka Pizza and reintroduced the hot dog stuffed crust pizza. In the first nine weeks of trading in 2016, UK like-for-like sales grew by 10.5%, in Ireland they were up 13.7% and in Switzerland 4.3%. "Momentum continues with a good start to 2016 despite increasingly tough comparatives through the rest of the year," Domino's said.	Domino's Pizza has revealed what it describes as "excellent" results for last year, driven primarily by the growth in its digital sales.
The stone is thought to have been in Soulbury, Buckinghamshire for 11,000 years. The road was built round it. Residents said they would chain themselves to it when the council said the stone may have to be moved. The council has now said it would be "lunacy" to move it, but was looking for ways to make the road safer. Local legend claims the rock, known as the Soulbury Boot, appeared on Chapel Hill after villagers fought with the devil and cut off his foot. Some people also claim it rolls down the hill as the church chimes midnight. More rolling news from Buckinghamshire as it happens It is not known how the boulder gets back up the hill, but it was in its usual place when a motorist allegedly hit it, damaging her car and later claiming compensation, according to the Leighton Buzzard Observer. A Buckinghamshire County Council spokesman told the BBC it had been discussing the future of the stone with the parish council "following the alleged incident". Removing the stone was "an option" but the council was aware it would not be a popular choice. A Facebook community group launched a Save our Soulbury Stone (Soss) campaign calling for residents to reject any proposal to move it, with some vowing to chain themselves to the rock to protect it. However, Conservative councillor Mark Shaw has now told the BBC that "to move it, or even discuss moving it... would be absolute madness". He described it as the "heart and soul" of Soulbury. "What we want to do is clearly make the road safe and secure for all drivers but actually it would be absolute lunacy to move that stone," Mr Shaw said. "Let's bear in mind this is about one person who's crashed into this stone in over 11,000 years."	A large boulder which has sat in the middle of a road for decades is to stay where it is despite a car crashing into it, a council has said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says the full evacuation of civilians and rebels is likely to take several days. Government forces, backed by Russian allies, took nearly all remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo this week. It represents a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad. He hailed the "liberation" of Aleppo and said history was being made. Global solidarity over Aleppo How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo What's happening in Aleppo? What happens next? The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed. "Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out," the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left. "No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days," she added. The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province. US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out "nothing short of a massacre" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva. "The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people," he said in Washington. John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks. But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. "You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate," he told me. Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith. Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - "delusional diplomacy", the Washington Post called it. Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one. Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city. A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo. The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed. As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured. The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances. Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal. The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: "A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants." "This corridor is 21km long," he said, adding, "6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups." Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. In a televised address, he said Turkey would take "children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions". The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred. UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer. "If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo," he told reporters in Paris. The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members. Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages. Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years. In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be "the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters. He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front. Idlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer. It also borders the coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect.	More than 3,000 people have been evacuated in buses and ambulances from a besieged rebel-held enclave in the Syrian city of Aleppo, officials say.
The 29-year-old terminated his contract with the O's after the transfer window closed, and cannot join another EFL side until January. "I wouldn't say I'm in a predicament, but I have never been in this position before," Cox told BBC Radio London. "It is not a nice thing for a footballer. I'm not able to do my job." The former Brighton man continued: "I am going to have to sit it out again for four months before I can kick a ball in the League again. "I'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done." Cox left Orient on 1 September after turning down a move to League One Northampton Town. Having spent six years with the O's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, Cox said he was "an emotional wreck" on his departure from Brisbane Road. "I didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, I felt like I had no choice," he said. "We had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons. "It is a club I will always love. When I finish playing I want to be a manager and if I can go back there and manage one day that would be great." Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an EFL club which will commence in January before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness. "I was just getting back in the groove," he said. "If I can get something sorted sooner rather than later League-wise, then great. "Hopefully the clubs I speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as I need to play. "Come January, I need to be ready to kick on." Cox has already held initial negotiations with League Two side Crawley Town. "It interests me because they are local to where I am," he said. "It ticks the boxes and I used to play with the captain Jimmy Smith at Orient. The manager [Dermot Drummy] wants attractive attacking football, which is great for me because that is the way I like to play. "By no means is it a done deal. We have had talks and we'll see how that goes." You can hear an interview with Dean Cox on BBC Radio London's Saturday Sport show, which begins at 13:00 BST.	Winger Dean Cox says he will have to remain patient as he searches for a new club after leaving League Two side Leyton Orient by mutual consent.
Images showed the Italian's Astana team car pulling alongside him and then both he and the car accelerating rapidly. Judges decided Nibali was either towed by the car as he held it, or grabbed a water bottle extended from the window. Britain's Chris Froome lost four seconds to rival Nairo Quintana as Esteban Chaves won the stage. Nibali, winner in 2010, had lost 88 seconds after being involved in the crash with around 30km of the stage remaining. Meanwhile, Tour de France champion Froome is chasing a Vuelta-Tour double that has been done just twice before. However, he could not match Quintana's kick on the final ascent as he finished seventh in Caminito del Rey. Colombian Chaves leads the overall race by five seconds after beating Dutchman Tom Dumoulin, with Froome's Team Sky team-mate Nicolas Roche in third. Ireland's Roche made his bid for victory on the steep 4.5km climb to the finish line but ran out of energy in the closing couple of hundred metres, leaving Movistar rider Chaves and Giant's Dumoulin to fight out the sprint for the line. Chaves picked up 10 bonus seconds for being first. Quintana rode clear of the chasing bunch before eventually finishing sixth, 26 seconds adrift of Chaves, and being credited with the same time as Spain's Joaquim Rodriguez. Froome finished one second ahead of another of his rivals for the overall victory, 2009 Vuelta champion Alejandro Valverde. Stage two result: 1.

Police closed the motorway in both directions near East Midlands Airport to allow "a clear flight path" for the plane, which landed safely on Saturday. Traffic was stopped between J23a and J24 at 21:30 GMT for about 20 minutes. East Midlands Airport said the closure was "precautionary" after a Jet2 flight with 153 people on board alerted them to a suspected malfunction. A spokeswoman for Jet2 said flight number LS670 called for assistance on its approach to the airport after the pilot noticed a "fault indication". She said the flight landed safely before being inspected. Highways England, which manages the motorway, tweeted to alert motorists to the "aircraft emergency" and motorway closure. In 1989 a Belfast-bound British Midland flight crashed on the M1 near Kegworth, Leicestershire, killing 47 people, as it diverted to East Midlands Airport.	A section of the M1 was closed due to an "aircraft emergency" on a flight from Gran Canaria.
The 29-year-old Scot has signed a two-year contract with the Gloucestershire outfit.

League Two club Cheltenham Town have signed Hibernian striker Brian Graham on a free transfer.
Richard Brittain, a former champion on the TV programme Countdown, travelled from England and used Facebook to find Paige Rolland, 18, at her work. He admitted assaulting Miss Rolland with a bottle to her severe injury on 3 October 2014 at Asda, Glenrothes. Sheriff Martin Jones deferred sentence until a later date. A motion for bail was refused. Glasgow Sheriff Court heard Brittain uploaded part of a published book of his called The World Rose onto a website called Wattpad, where people can read and critique literature written by others. Miss Rolland read the excerpt of Brittain's book and left comments about it. Procurator fiscal depute Harry Findlay said: "The complainer had read some of that material and gave feedback of what she thought to be the merits or otherwise of the book. "The feedback was negative. What followed were comments made by the accused which give an indication that he was displeased." In October last year, Brittain went to the Asda store Miss Rolland worked in after she began her shift. Mr Findlay said: "He went to the alcohol aisle and picked up a bottle of wine, he then went to the aisle where the complainer was working. "He approached her from behind, she was kneeling down collecting cereal from the bottom shelf of the aisle. "While doing so, the accused approached without warning, any provocation or words and he struck the complainer on the back of the head with the bottle. "One blow. It made contact and the wound bled immediately and she had a moment of unconsciousness." Miss Rolland was taken to hospital suffering from a cut to her head and treated for a head injury. The court also heard that a month before the attack on Miss Roland, Brittain stalked a university classmate, Ella Durant, 23, who moved from London to Glasgow. He used her Twitter and Instagram accounts to find where she worked and turned up on two occasions to speak to her. Brittain, whose address was given as Palgrave, Bedford, pled guilty to engaging in a course of conduct which caused Miss Durant fear or alarm by repeatedly pursuing her, approaching her, following her and publishing a story about stalking her in September 2014. Defence counsel Michael Meehan told the court that in relation to the message from Brittain to Miss Rolland after she criticised his work, his client pointed out she had not read the published version and asked her to remove her comments. The court was told he also contacted her in September this year with an apologetic message.	An author tracked down a teenager in Fife and hit her over the head with a bottle after she gave his book a bad review, a court has heard.
The Real Madrid forward headed the vital goal in Cyprus as Wales won 1-0 in Nicosia and stay top of Group B. With the top two qualifying for France, three more points will be enough to seal Wales' place at a major finals for the first time since 1958. "We've never done it so I'm guessing it's going to be hard," Bale said. "But this group is focused, we really know what we need to do and hopefully we can deliver on Sunday. Media playback is not supported on this device "It would probably be the best thing we've achieved. If we can get across the line it'll be an amazing thing, not just for us but the whole nation and the whole of Welsh football. "We know what's coming. All out attention has been focused on the Cyprus game, we haven't thought about the Israel game at all. "That's the good thing about this team, we haven't taken our eyes off the ball once." Wales had not won in Cyprus since 1992 and as chances came and went in Nicosia on Thursday it seemed as though they would be denied once again. But with eight minutes remaining on the clock, Jazz Richards picked out Bale and the 26-year-old met the ball with a thumping header that gave the excellent Antonis Georgallides in the Cyprus goal no chance. "I've not scored too many better [headers] and at a vital time, which was important," added Bale. "Obviously it wasn't our best performance in terms of attacking but we defended well as a unit and showed again what a good team we are. "We try to defend as a team from front to back, but the backline were incredible. In the end we deserved to win, we created the better chances." Wales boss Chris Coleman said that Joe Ledley remained a "huge doubt" for Sunday's match against Israel with the hamstring problem that saw the Crystal Palace midfielder miss out in Cyprus. But West Bromwich Albion defender James Chester has a chance of playing after his hamstring injury kept him out in Nicosia. West Ham United's James Collins is another option at the heart of defence. But after the performance of skipper Ashley Williams, Chris Gunter and Ben Davies in Nicosia, Wales manager Chris Coleman may be unwilling to tinker with his winning formula. Former Wales captain Kevin Ratcliffe: "We kept it nice and tight at the back and weren't chasing things. "Cyprus had a lot of possession in the second half but never really got in behind us and hurt us. "I was a little bit concerned down the left-hand side on one or two occasions and I think a better side might have exploited that. "We've got to rectify that for the next game, because Israel would have seen that we're lacking left-sided players with the nous to get across the pitch on a consistent basis. We are lacking that with Joe Ledley not in the squad. "But we are resilient at the back: Chris Gunter and Ashley Williams were immense along with Jazz Richards, who was so comfortable in that position. "One goal is enough the way we defend."	Gareth Bale says Wales will be stepping into the unknown on Sunday when they attempt to beat Israel in Cardiff and seal their place at Euro 2016.
Cyber-attacks, trolls, terrorist propaganda, sexism, racism, Twitter mobs... stop the web now, Mr Berners-Lee, we want to get off. So, when it came to compiling 2015's list of the most viral videos and memes (see 2012's, 2013's and 2014's), I decided to impose a couple of ground rules to keep things upbeat. Rule number one: nothing miserable. The world was a scary place in 2015. Consider this list a safe, feel-good haven. Rule number two: nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral. As in, a committee of advertising executives didn't sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit. Of course, everyone wants their posts to be popular, but let's just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun. Off we go! One of the remarkable things about Ruairi McSorley is how he managed to change a tiny soundbite into a media career. Asked by UTV reporter Gareth Wilkinson about the weather conditions in Northern Ireland, McSorley's charming accent led to him being dubbed the most Irish man in the world. His "frostbit" soundbite has led to countless TV appearances, events and, soon, a charity single. If you're not a fan of American Football - and sometimes even if you are - the half-time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extravaganza. And not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe "malfunction" has their been a more talked about moment than singer Katy Perry's performance. She was joined on stage by two adorable backing dancers, although one of them, the shark on the left, struggled to keep up. Left Shark fever swept the world, coming to symbolise the daily struggles we all face to keep up with the world. Katy Perry's lawyers tried to trademark "left shark", but were denied. Also in February, a garment now consigned to history as simply "the dress" was stirring debate. Optical illusion, colour blindness', strange lighting - whatever caused the difference of opinion, the image of the white/gold or blue/black dress became one of the most shared of the year. And then we all agreed it was blue and black. Didn't we? If Katy Perry's Left Shark was a symbol of life's daily struggles, the shot of a weasel hitching a ride on a woodpecker is a reminder of how we should all be able to get along, no matter our differences. "Weasels are fearless," commented wildlife expert Lucy Cooke. Evidently! Also in March, shocking footage emerged from Thailand showing an elephant, clearly intoxicated, clambering into a bath. Did I say intoxicated? I meant adorable. Annual sense-of-humour-vacuum April Fools' Day brings a flood of prank videos. Most are terrible, but some are beautifully executed - like this magic from a maths teacher in California. It racked up an impressive 13 million views. Maths was a continuing theme in April. This brain teaser, originally posed to Singaporean schoolchildren, had the world scratching its head and arguing over the solution. Did you figure it out? (The answer's on Wikipedia…) "Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing." So wrote a poster on 4chan, the notoriously dark online message board. They attached a picture of Sean O'Brien, a large Liverpudlian, who had been dancing at a gig. After attention was brought to the apparent "fat-shaming", the internet rallied round and Mr O'Brien was tracked down. In May, the Dancing Man had a huge party thrown for him in Los Angeles - attended by Monica Lewinsky, Moby and Andrew WK. "I'm still pinching myself," Mr O'Brien said. Back in London, it was a "hipster cop" that had people talking. Peter Swinger - who sports a stylish, curly moustache - was spotted on duty at a protest march. However, according to the Daily Mail, a close relative said Mr Singer, a father of three, was "definitely not a hipster". What a hipster thing to say. Behold, the best double-take ever captured on film. Champion surfer Mick Fanning waiting just six days to get back into the water after this terrifying incident. The 34-year-old was competing in South Africa when two sharks appeared in the water. No problem for Mr Fanning, though - he just punched one of them and swam off, avoiding probable death. Kevin Innes found a pile of dog toys in a shop in Norway. And then he pressed them. The Guardian called the resulting clip the "best thing on the internet today". I'd go as far as declaring it the best thing on the internet this entire year. Why? It sums up the very best thing about viral hits - that ability to give the entire world that "oh, you had to be there" experience. Also in August, everyone melted after watching this little lad who definitely isn't going to miss his mum when he's at school. The undoubted star of this next clip is the woman in the passenger seat. Quiet, stoic… resigned. Next to her, the now world-famous Ronnie Pickering. Who? Ronnie Pickering. Who? RONNIE PICKERING! Mr Pickering's road rage was captured on film by cyclist Steve Middleton, and spread around the world as people asked: "Who's Ronnie Pickering?" The video can be viewed here, but be warned it contains a flood of swear words. Mr Pickering's son later took to Twitter to say his Dad's a great guy and a great laugh. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt - we all have our off days. Meanwhile, in September, this Manhattan rat was having the "on" day to end them all. In this internet age, it's quite reassuring that the humble music video format still has the ability to get people talking. Though now, it's not enough to merely like a music video - you have to remix it. Hip hop artist/dancing visionary Drake's video for Hotline Bling spawned hundreds of remakes. To save you the time, just watch this one - it's by far the best. For a short while in October it seemed that every cat owner in the world was buying up cucumbers to scare their cats. (Although it must be said that experts later advised against it - it's pretty mean.) There are numerous theories as to why cats seem to jump out of their skin at the sight of a cucumber - one expert, speaking to ABC News, said it's because cats are genetically wired to bounce away from snakes. Ever since the demise of CBBC's Record Breakers, the public's appetite for world-beaters has been left unsatisfied. Good job we've got Otto, then, a bulldog who rode a skateboard through the legs of 30 people. If there's one thing we've learned this year, it's that being Irish increases your viral potential by roughly 100x. Here, TV news reporter Teresa Mannion took to the coastline of Galway, in the west of Ireland, to broadcast to RTE viewers. But Storm Desmond had other ideas, giving poor Ms Mannion a right blustering. "Don't swim in the sea!" she screamed in her dramatic live report. And then the internet got to work. And on Christmas Day, a lot of Dads fell off their hoverboards. So, there we have it. An eclectic year of road rage, Irishness, dresses and sharks of varying ferocity. The next year could see big changes to the internet. Debates on encryption and censorship may alter the very fabric of how this series of tubes works. But through it all, let's hope we keep our sense of humour and not take ourselves too seriously. When life gives you cucumbers, make a video. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC (and tell me what I missed!)	It's been a bit of an annus horribilis for the internet and all of us who frequent it.
And I don't get to say that very often. On the one hand, eurocrats were hurried - in wind and rain - into EU courtyards to stand in photo-op-ready groups to form the number 60. (It's the EU's 60th birthday celebration this Saturday.) And on the other - after months of cajoling, thinly-veiled frustration and angst from Brussels - the UK government finally made clear the date it will officially trigger the Brexit process. Next Wednesday. But whereas Saturday really is a huge deal for the EU - marking decades of togetherness at a time when the union is very much under threat from populist nationalism across the EU, inequality and discord in the eurozone, migration complications and Brexit itself, of course - next Wednesday, while an historic day in the UK, will not play out so big this side of the Channel. There is a determination here that Brexit must no longer be allowed to dominate and overshadow EU politics as it has done since way before the UK referendum even. One high-level source told me that after Brussels received Britain's formal notification of its intention to leave, Brexit would immediately be downgraded to one of many EU issues to be dealt with, rather than The Big Thing. "There will be no major political apocalyptic show," he assured me. But of course, the underlying EU fear remains that if a Brexit deal is too sweet for the UK, other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door. Brussels officials are grateful that Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 this week, so close to the EU's birthday bash. The tone there will be resolutely upbeat, rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club. As for the what-happens-next with Brexit, the rule in Brussels is: don't expect too much too fast. Ever. The remaining 27 EU leaders, or at least their teams, began getting diaries together on Monday. To fix a date (expected in around five or six weeks) for that all-important summit when they'll agree their red lines and guidelines for Brexit negotiations. The European Commission will lead the UK talks from the EU side - but all the initial meetings will be about who will meet, when, in which country, discussing what and in which order. Most probably little of substance will be achieved before the autumn. The EU prefers to get the key elections coming up in big-hitters France and Germany out the way first. But any delay is painful for the UK. The Article 50 timer is set for two years and the clock starts ticking next Wednesday.	Brussels was abuzz on Monday.
But does it? Is the problem any worse than it ever was in north Wales' biggest town, and are Wrexham's problems any worse than any other similarly-sized area? Lisa is a former drug addict. By her own admission, she used to take every drug available to her. She has been five years in recovery though, and now works with charity and support services provider CAIS, trying to help users who want to go into recovery. Few know Wrexham's drug scene better than her, and she does not believe the number of drug users in Wrexham has increased in the last decade. Nor does she believe Wrexham's drug problem is any worse than any other comparable town. "I think it's everywhere," she said. "This problem is everywhere in all towns. Some are just hidden more than others." What has changed dramatically though, is the type of drugs many people are now using. New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) - some of which were formerly known as so-called "legal highs" - are now the choice drug of many users. "People are taking that (NPS) more than they're taking heroin," said Lisa. "Heroin's dropping, crack cocaine is dropping and the NPS in increasing. I believe it's because it's cheaper, the quality's better - the quality of that man-made drug is better." Lisa also describes NPS as "sociable drugs," which users tend to take with others. Often, she says, users congregate together to take the drugs, making the problem more visible, and possibly creating a perception drugs use is rising. NPS are typically much cheaper than heroin or other drugs, and can be bought, Lisa says, for about Â£5. She also knows of some users buying single-hit "one-pops" for as little as Â£1. Despite their price, she says the NPS are frighteningly strong - often more powerful than heroin. "They are stronger. From the effects we're seeing with people, they are definitely stronger, and that's why a lot of heroin users are now swapping to the NPS." She says some users are left "zombified". "They don't know where they are; they don't know their own names. The first 10 minutes...they could easily walk out in the road. It really does dislocate them." Lisa says that on average, a new batch of NPS hits Wrexham's streets every three weeks. They bear new names, and the effects on users often differ. Black Mamba is one of the better-known substances available in Wrexham. The latest - which began to emerge a fortnight ago - is called Triple X. You know when a new batch hits the streets, she says, because users look like zombies as they adjust to the new effects. Some then develop a tolerance to it - until the next release comes along. The constant release of new substances presents huge challenges for those trying to combat their effects. Carry Burton is a harm reduction manager with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. She helps run a mobile outreach service for users. Asked how worrying the new trend is, she says: "Certainly for us as a health service, it does pose serious concerns. We are worried about people's health. We are concerned about people's safety. For heroin users, if they overdose on heroin we have Naloxone that we can give to save lives. We can't do that with new psychoactives, so we have to find alternative interventions. "We are...very keen to try and keep people healthy, but how best to do that still remains a bit of a question mark really for us all." She believes other towns of a similar size probably experience similar problems to Wrexham. However, in north Wales - with the exception of the "odd little pocket here and there" - the harm reduction team are only witnessing the rise of NPS in Wrexham. Some believe that could be because Wrexham has a relatively high concentration of charities or service providers which help drug users, homeless people, or others in need. Dave Jolly, North Wales Police's chief inspector for the Wrexham area, says: "I think Wrexham is unique from the point of view of the visibility." He adds: "I think what you've got now is a collective group of about 47 men and women who are generally moving from one service provision to another within their day...predominantly they hang around the town centre, so their visibility is enhanced." While Lisa from CAIS believes many heroin users are now switching to NPS, Chief inspector Jolly says he knows of heroin users who are trying Black Mamba and "shunning it" because they don't like the "adverse reaction". "If they're running away from it, then clearly there's something about it that's very sinister." He admits the problem with NPS is probably going to get worse for Wrexham and other areas. A "joined-up approach" between health professionals and other services providers, supported by police, is what is needed to combat the problem, he says, and to try and "understand why these people are doing what they're doing".	When pictures of people apparently high on drugs in Wrexham's bus station were posted on social media earlier this month, it prompted claims by some the town has a major drugs problem.
The environment department said anyone who injures, kills or disturbs Arctic Terns could face prosecution. A spokesman said three walkers with dogs were seen "attacking" the birds with sticks and stones last weekend. Biodiversity Officer Dr Richard Selman said: "Arctic terns will defend their nests and this can be painful." He added: "Unfortunately, terns abandon their nests when the pressure from people or predators gets too great. "They nest in a limited area and I hope people will respect the controls provided in order to give them the best chance of raising their young". Arctic terns, which have the scientific name of Sterna paradisaea, have an average wingspan of 75-85cm. The birds, which mate for life, lay one or two eggs in a small space of ground.	An attack on nesting birds in a breeding colony in the north of the Isle of Man has prompted a warning from wildlife officials.
A further 24 shops have been closed down altogether, while police have also arrested 186 alleged offenders. The Home Office said it was "encouraged" that so many retailers had been "denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade". However, the charity DrugWise said the ban had driven the market underground. Legal highs became popular on the drug scene around 2008. They contain substances which mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy and go by names such as Spice and Black Mamba. What are legal highs? 'Legal highs made me punch my own face' Laws criminalising the production, distribution, sale and supply of the drugs - known as the Psychoactive Substances Act - came into effect at the end of May. Commander Simon Bray, from the National Police Chiefs Council, said London's Metropolitan Police had also seized nearly 14,000 nitrous oxide or laughing gas canisters since the change. Mr Bray said although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact on use of the drugs, "intuitively I think it must have had an effect". "It will certainly make it less easy for the casual first-time user to get involved in this sort of stuff," he said adding that he believed many people were "lulled into buying these things" thinking they were legal and therefore safe. The Angelus Foundation, which educates people on the risks of legal highs, said it believed many online traders had also shut down. Jeremy Sare, director of communications at the charity, told the BBC: "I think the ban has made a big difference and we are supportive of the legislation. "What we are surprised about is the online supply hasn't surged. Traders seem to have stopped selling. It is still early days and we may look back in 12 months and see more online trading but many look to have closed. "Many were operating within the law but now the law has gone against them so they haven't continued." He said the two biggest groups still using the drugs were homeless people and prisoners. Greg, originally from Essex and now living in west Wales, told BBC Radio 5 live about his experience of a legal high known as Holy Smoke. "I had just a little bit... My head just started spinning and I had this paranoid feeling. I just wanted to go home and hide but I couldn't walk properly. I honestly thought that I was going to die. "From what I've heard it is still pretty regularly available. I think most people still think it's legal." "Alison" a recovering drug user, has also used legal highs. "They've got names like Train Wreck, Black Cobra and Pandora's Box," she said. "It's still really easy to get. You can get three packets for about Â£25. "No prices have changed. Nothing has changed at all. People are still walking around with it and selling it from home. I don't think it [the ban] has made one bit of difference." However, Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, said although the ban may have put off "casual and curious" drug users, it had not deterred those with a serious drug problem and had driven the market underground. "It's moved from the shops to the street," he said. The drugs have been linked to 444 deaths since 2010, including two brothers from Scotland. William McGough, 30, was in the grip of an addiction to the drugs when he drowned in a river in Wick, Scotland, in 2013. Then, in May, the body of his brother Simon, 37, was found next to a packet of the psychoactive substances. Their sister, Melanie Downie, 40, spoke publicly about their deaths to highlight the "addictive and destructive" nature of the drugs. Sarah Newton the government's safeguarding minister, said the drugs "have already cost far too many lives". "I'm encouraged to see that - three months in - police are using their new powers to take dealers off our streets and that so many retailers have been denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade." "These drugs are not legal, they are not safe and we will not allow them to be sold in this country," she added.	More than 300 UK retailers are no longer selling so-called legal highs, three months after a ban was introduced, the Home Office has said.
Revenues rose 18% to £1.55bn last year, with underlying operating profit jumping 44% to £330m. But after the costs of last year's merger between Paddy Power and Betfair were taken into account the company reported a loss of £5.7m. Analysts at Liberum said the company's performance in the final quarter of 2016 had been "disappointing". "It seems likely that operational challenges will continue around the performance of cross-sell to sports customers and the investment required to stimulate growth," Liberum said in a research note. Overall, the FTSE 100 closed lower, having traded higher for much of the sessions, losing 10.75 points, or 0.15% at 7,339.37. "Markets remain becalmed for yet another day, hampered by a lack of data and a general wariness ahead of the ECB [European Central Bank] on Thursday, NFPs [US employment figures] on Friday and a Fed meeting next week," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. Shares in Direct Line fell 2.9% after the insurer reported a fall in full-year profits due to changes in the way that compensation payments are to be calculated. Pre-tax profits fell 30% to £353m, with changes to the payment formula cutting profits by £217m. In the FTSE 250, shares in Aggreko sank 11% after the temporary power provider said it expected profits to fall this year. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.29% against the US dollar to $1.2203 and was also 0.27% lower  against the euro at 1.1535 euros.	Shares in Paddy Power Betfair fell more than 5% despite the bookmaker reporting rising revenues and underlying profits.
Dead Men Risen, written by Toby Harnden and published by Quercus, took the prize at a ceremony in Westminster and was the judges' unanimous choice. It focuses on the death of Lt Colonel Rupert Thorneloe in 2009. It was published in amended form after the first print run was destroyed by the MoD. The judges said the book "takes us into the hearts and minds of the Welsh Guards in a way that is both interesting and visceral". "It challenges every citizen of this country to examine exactly what we're asking soldiers to do in Afghanistan," the panel continued. "Rather than offering easy answers it lets the soldiers speak for themselves." Other awards presented included a posthumous honour for Christopher Hitchens, whose final book, Arguably, was included on the long list for the top prize. Hitchens' widow Carol Blue accepted the award on behalf of the Vanity Fair writer. The journalism prize was awarded to Amelia Gentleman for her work in The Guardian, while the blog award went to Rangers Tax Case - an online commentary on the ongoing financial problems at the historic Scottish football club. The writers of the blog said they aimed to "provide the details of what Rangers FC have done, why it was illegal and what the implications are for one of the largest football clubs in Britain". The winners were chosen from shortlists of six books, six journalists and seven bloggers, whittled down from longlists of 17 books, 12 journalists and 18 bloggers. Each of the winners received a Â£3,000 prize.	A book about the death of a British officer in Afghanistan, once pulped by the Ministry of Defence, has won the Orwell Prize for political writing.
Sue Sim was the first woman to lead the force and led the hunt for murderer Raoul Moat in 2010. Last month Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird launched an investigation into Ms Sim over alleged rudeness to staff. Ms Sim is retiring on 3 June to spend more time with her family to "make up for the sacrifices" they made. She joined Merseyside Police in 1985, progressing through the ranks before moving to Northumbria in 2004. Ms Sim said the hunt for Moat following the murder of Christopher Brown and shooting of one of her officers, PC David Rathband, was one of the biggest challenges she faced. She said: "That was the largest manhunt the country has seen for 44 years. I spent my time out and about reassuring the public and responding to their questions. "I am immensely proud of my officers and staff who went about their roles fully aware of the threats against them, but determined to support the public." She has also overseen savings of Â£117m since 2010 and was at the helm as Northumbria Police reopened no crime rape reports following an audit. Ms Baird's office said the misconduct investigation will continue but admitted if the complaints against her were upheld, Ms Sim's retirement would mean any sanctions, such as a written warning, would have no impact. Ms Baird said: "Sue has brought passion and enthusiasm to her role and leaves at a time when Northumbria is one of the highest performing forces in the country."	The chief constable of Northumbria Police will retire after 30 years of service, it has been announced.
Historic car specialists Fiskens said they placed the car for a "short time" outside their Kensington headquarters when two traffic wardens approached. The firm said the wardens were "adamant" the 45-year-old vehicle should be given a £120 fine. Kensington and Chelsea Council said it was "issued as it would in any case". Acquisition specialist Rory Henderson said the company were always "super-careful" not to obstruct others who use the Mews when moving their vehicles around. A council spokesman said the photographer agreed to move the Ferrari but "no attempt was made" within the "statutory five-minute observation period". The car, a 1970 Ferrari 512M, is still in working condition and was recently raced at the Le Mans Classic. According to Fiskens, it has a "remarkable history" having been raced in the 1970 and 1971 Le Mans races. In 1977, it set a new record after Robert Horne drove the car 192mph over a flying mile. Fiskens call it "a superb example of one of Maranello's finest sports competition cars".	A rare Ferrari racing car worth about £10m was given a parking ticket after the owners rolled it into a Mews to take some photos.
Scottish Hydro-Electric Transmission Ltd, a division of energy giant SSE, submitted the "needs case" as part of the planning process for the cable. After assessing the case, energy regulator Ofgem has asked for further details to be submitted. The project has been hit by delays and a rise in costs to an estimated Â£780m. Islands local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, has said major renewable energy projects planned for the isles cannot go ahead without the cable. The interconnector would export electricity to the mainland for distribution. It would stretch to about 50 miles (80km) from Gravir on Lewis to Ullapool on the north-west coast of mainland Scotland. The Scottish government has been involved in talks on the project. A spokesperson said: "This is a matter for SSE and Ofgem, but we would encourage the company and regulator to move swiftly to resolve this issue. "Improved grid connections will enable the huge renewable energy resources of Scotland's islands to create jobs - up to 3,500 jobs in the Western Isles, almost 2,900 in the Shetlands and over 4,500 in the Orkney Islands by 2030. The spokesperson added: "SSE put a business case for the Western Isles link to the electricity regulator Ofgem on 14 June, and today Ofgem have responded by setting out the detailed further information they require."	Ofgem has asked for more information on why a subsea cable is needed to carry electricity generated on the Western Isles to the mainland.
It has been a busy period of transfer activity as teams look to strengthen and build on their previous campaign. With gaps to fill, many clubs have been looking outside of the Scottish border for new talent. Alongside club stalwarts and players familiar with the Scottish game, which players will help shape the season? Celtic built their title-winning side around a solid foundation at the back last season. Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer were at the heart of a defence that kept 22 clean sheets in the league. With the latter returning to parent club Manchester City, manager Ronny Deila has been quick to find a replacement. Dedryck Boyata signed a four-year contract this summer, ending a nine-year stay at Manchester City and the 24-year-old has already looked settled among his new team-mates. A goal on his competitive debut against Stjarnan, followed with the winner on Thursday, helped Celtic secure a 1-0 first leg lead over Qarabag. Celtic will be looking for this form to continue as they chase a fifth consecutive title. Last season, Aberdeen had their best league campaign since the 1993-94 season as they secured second place. This season, they will be looking to improve on the promising strides they have taken under Derek McInnes. The Dons have strength in depth in most departments, but the acquisition of goalkeeper Danny Ward from Liverpool on a season-long loan looks to have been a smart piece of business. McInnes deployed both Jamie Langfield, 35, and Scott Brown, 30, between the sticks last season, but the early indications seem to point to Ward being given the opportunity to stake a claim to be the club's number one this season. Impressive displays in the Europa League qualifiers have strengthened the 22-year-old Welshman's position and he could be a key factor if the Dons are to push Celtic all the way in this season's title race. Nadir Ciftci's £1.5m departure to Celtic this summer has left Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara with a position to fill in his forward line. McNamara will be hoping that Croatia Under-21 cap Darko Bodul will be the man to do the job. At 26, Bodul has plenty of experience throughout Europe. Beginning his career in his native Austria with First Vienna, Bodul has also had spells with Dutch sides Heerenveen, Ajax and Sparta Rotterdam, as well as stints with Nacional of Portugal, Austrians Sturm Graz and Danish outfit Odense. He left Austrian Bundesliga side Rheindorf Altach at the end of last season. Bodul made his pre-season debut in a United shirt during the 2-1 defeat by Queens Park Rangers, coming on as a second-half substitute before starting in the 1-0 friendly defeat by Watford, lasting an hour before being replaced. McNamara described his new signing as ''technically gifted, skilful and a penalty box goal scorer". With some impressive teams on his CV and a two-year contract, United will hope to see the best of Bodul in the coming season. He may have the most famous name in Scottish football, but Dutchman Rodney Sneijder wants to be his own man at Dundee United. The younger brother of Galatasaray midfielder Wesley, Rodney was signed on a two-year deal after his release by Almere City in his homeland. It marks the first time that the 24-year-old midfielder has played for a club outside of the Netherlands. Having begun his career at Ajax, Sneijder will be looking to kick-start his time in Scottish football when the season gets under way. With United looking to rebuild after the recent departures of Gary Mackay-Stevens and Stuart Armstrong to Celtic, it would appear that he will likely get the opportunity to do so. Sneijder may get his first chance on the opening weekend as his side face Aberdeen at Tannadice this Sunday. After winning the Championship last season, Hearts will be determined to re-establish themselves as a top-flight club after their season in the second tier. Robbie Neilson has conducted a squad overhaul as they look to build upon their title success. The conclusion of Genero Zeefuik's loan spell from Groningen has left a void up front that Neilson will be looking for Juanma Delgado to occupy. The 24-year-old Spaniard joins from Greek Super League outfit Kalloni on a three-year contract. At 6ft 2in, the former Levante youth player will have a presence in the forward line that Neilson will require to meet his ambitions of finishing in the top six this season. He is described by his new manager as "a good player, technically very good, great in the air and has good link-up play - and he's a great character".	The Scottish Premiership season commences this weekend and fans can expect to see a swarm of new faces run out for their side for the first time.
A referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is to be held later this year. The survey indicates that only 11% of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland support a British exit (Brexit). That compares to 30% of those surveyed in the rest of the UK. The Chamber of Commerce has about 1,200 members in Northern Ireland. About 250 of those responded to the poll. More than half of the respondents (60%) said that Prime Minister David Cameron's renegotiated EU deal is unlikely to change how they will vote. The results come on the eve of crunch Brussels talks, which are expected to result in a deal. Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed in Northern Ireland  also say that there has been no impact on their sales and orders as of yet, due to the uncertainty of Britain's future within the EU. Commenting on the results, President of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce Stephen McCully said the findings suggest that "the renegotiation is having little impact on day-to-day business - or the vote of the business community". He said that this was because many made up their minds before knowing the outcome of negotiations, effectively discounting them as irrelevant. "For businesspeople, this is a question of in or out," he said. "Those within Northern Ireland who are firmly wedded to the EU have said that Brexit will leave us stranded outside the EU, and coping with the re-emergence of a land border with the Republic of Ireland. "Emotion has a part in all decision making and it will do so here, but there is a duty to ensure decisions are as well informed as they can be." Clarification: An earlier version of this article omitted the number of respondents to the Chamber of Commerce survey.	A survey of Chamber of Commerce members in Northern Ireland suggests that 81% will vote for the UK to remain in the European Union (EU).
Media playback is not supported on this device Three people who know Armstrong well gave their thoughts. The wife of former professional road cyclist Frankie Andreu, she claimed, long before his public confession, that Armstrong took banned substances and bullied team-mates. "When the going gets tough, he turns on the charm. He thinks if he can show he's a changed man it might benefit him. The problem with that is that he has no credibility. His actions speak louder than his words." Andreu believes there should be no way back into cycling for Armstrong. "He should forget it. He's not going back into sport. He should go and enjoy something else, enjoy his family. Everyone deserves a second chance, but how many does he want? What is he? A cat." The Sunday Times journalist first raised questions about Armstrong in 1999. He wrote LA Confidential, a book containing evidence that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. "When I see an interview like he's just done with Dan Roan, I just feel this guy hasn't changed one iota. When he's saying everyone was doing it (doping), he's being so unfair to the people who rode the 1999 Tour de France and tours over the following years clean - and plenty did." Walsh believes Armstrong is struggling with being out of the limelight. "This is a guy who would get called up by he president of the United States and asked to go on a mountain bike ride, this is a guy who had direct access to people like Bill Clinton and John Kerry... Bono was a big mate of his. Now, no-one really wants to be associated with him - and that's tough if you were once in the place that Lance Armstrong was in." A former French road cyclist, his career effectively ended when he spoke out against doping in the 1990s. "The fact that he says that he doesn't regret it and that if he went back to the same time, he'd do it again... I think that shows an honesty." Bassons, who clashed with Armstrong after making his doping claims, also thinks the American has changed - or been changed. "When I saw him last year, it wasn't the Armstrong that I knew in the '90s any more. Back then, he was strong, he was hard, he would stare you in the eyes, he was brutal, he was strong and he would never make a mistake. But when I saw him last year, he was alone, he was badly dressed, he avoided eye contact, he didn't seem happy."	In an interview with BBC Sports editor Dan Roan, shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong said he should be forgiven for doping and lying - but also admitted he would probably cheat again.
The International Cycling Union (UCI) said it was "extremely unhappy" with the poster which shows a hand moving towards a girl's backside. "We have reminded the organiser of its responsibility," said a UCI statement. The poster mimics the antics of 2014 winner Peter Sagan who pinched a podium girl at the 2013 Tour of Flanders. Although the UCI press release states that organisers have agreed to remove the poster, which also carries the tagline, 'Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?', it is still being used to promote the event on social media. In 2014 UCI president Brian Cookson described a cycling team's kit as "unacceptable by any standards" after it appeared to make the female riders look naked. Photos of the Colombian team's outfit for the Giro della Toscana in Italy showed what seemed to be a skin-coloured fabric around their waist and hips and caused controversy on social media. The E3 Harelbeke, which is on 27 March this year, starts and finishes in Harelbeke and covers 210kms of the Flanders region. The race is part of the UCI World Tour and is regarded as a preparation for the  seven Spring Classics which include the Tour of Flanders..	Cycling's governing body has condemned E3 Harelbeke organisers for a controversial billboard poster that promotes this year's race in Belgium.
High housing costs and a lack of personal savings are cited by the charity as reasons for this. The online survey by pollsters YouGov in July questioned 1,581 people in working families with children. "Strong protections" are in place for "those who fall on difficult times," a government spokesman commented. The spokesman said: "We are introducing the National Living Wage, increasing the personal tax allowance and giving the next generation choice and flexibility in their savings, including the Help to Save scheme for people on low incomes. "We are continuing to spend around £90 billion a year on working age benefits to ensure a strong safety net for the most vulnerable. "And for those who do fall on difficult times, there are strong protections in place to guard against the threat of homelessness, and ensure we don't return to the bad old days when homelessness in England was nearly double what it is today." The online YouGov survey questioned 8,381 adults, including 1,581 members of working families with children. It concluded that 37% (585) of such families would be unable to cover their housing costs for more than one month with no job, while 23% (364) said they would be unable to pay their housing costs at all. Some 48% (759) of families in the survey named the cost of housing as the biggest drain on their budget, the charity reported. "These figures are a stark reminder that sky-high housing costs are leaving millions of working families stretched to breaking point, and barely scraping by from one pay cheque to the next," Shelter chief executive Campbell Robb said. What kind of life can you live on £7.20 an hour? How much of a savings buffer do people need? 'Sky-high' rental hotspots across England revealed Mr Robb said the government had a "real chance to show working families they're on their side, by protecting and improving our welfare safety net". A single mother of two children, named only as Lou, told researchers that although she was working full-time as a complex needs carer, and has moved into a small flat, she still finds keeping up with the rent every month a struggle. She said: "I'm working hard, but it still makes me feel like a failure. I recently changed jobs and hit a rough patch when I thought I wouldn't be able to pay the rent. "An employer had given me some work and didn't tell me that my hours wouldn't be guaranteed, I lost a chunk of my income all of a sudden, and very nearly lost my home. It was really scary. "There's never a cushion. You'd think if you were working you'd be able to save a little bit every month, but it's just not a possibility when just paying for the basics is so expensive."	One in three families in England could not pay their rent or mortgage for more than a month if they lost their job, a study for the charity Shelter suggests.
The deal ends months of speculation about the future of the Gulls, who were facing financial difficulties. "There is relief that the club is saved. We were looking at a serous financial situation," outgoing chairman David Phillips told BBC Sport. The deal is subject to ratification by the National League and supporters have raised concerns about GI. The group pulled out of a bid to buy the club in the summer. However, Phillips said Torquay had been close to going into administration and added: "This deal had to be done. "All of the other people that were supposedly in the background, I've spoken to Chinese, Hong Kong and American, we asked them to to put some money in to save the club and it was never forthcoming." Nobody from the new owners was at Plainmoor to talk about the deal. "I would like to take this opportunity of assuring everyone connected with, and supporting, the club that we will try our best to secure the club's long term future," said GI head Clarke Osbourne in a statement. "Our initial work is to ensure that the club is stable whilst compiling a five-year plan to secure the club's future and bring high-level football entertainment to Torbay." There has been talk of the club leaving their Plainmoor home for a new ground on the outskirts of the town, a plan which the Torquay United Supporters' Trust has questioned. "With GI, our biggest concern is that they are a property developer, they have very little interest in football apparently and they have very little connection with Torquay as a place," TUST spokesman Alan Robinson  told BBC Sport. "I totally understand the financial constraints the club is under. We understand that at this moment in time GI was the only option. "Our concern is over the last 18 months we have at least twice or three times developed the opportunity of commitment ownership."	National League club Torquay United have been taken over by Swindon-based Gaming International (GI).
The motorist was stopped on the MI8 on his way to work at about 13.30 BST, tweeted Humberside Police. The tweet said: "He wasn't late but he is now..." In a later tweet the force said the driver had not got an immediate ban but had been reported to the courts. The motorway runs from the M1 near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, to the M62 near Goole, East Yorkshire. Tougher punishments for the most serious speeding offences came into force in England and Wales in April. Under new guidelines, fines for drivers caught doing 51mph in a 30mph zone or 101mph on a motorway will start from 150% of weekly income, rather than the previous level of 100%. In 2015 244 people were killed in crashes that occurred when a driver was breaking the speed limit on Britain's roads.	A car driver has been stopped by police on the motorway after driving at speeds of up to 132mph.
At talks in Moscow, he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Russia's actions in the Middle East would always be "responsible". Mr Netanyahu is concerned by the possibility of Israeli and Russian forces inadvertently trading fire. Israel has periodically struck inside Syria against militants it says have been plotting attacks against it. It has also responded to shellfire from forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who Russia has backed throughout the four-year uprising against his rule. But in the past week, US officials have confirmed reports that the Russian military has sent warplanes, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, armoured personnel carriers and 200 marines to an airfield near Mr Assad's ancestral home in Latakia province. They believe Moscow plans to turn the airfield into a forward operating base that could allow it to send a large number of troops to Syria and launch air strikes. Israel is believed to have previously targeted Syrian and Iranian weapons convoys in Syria meant for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, though it has not officially acknowledged this. Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Moscow comes at a time of deepening Russian military involvement in Syria. The arrival of Russian fixed-wing combat aircraft at the airbase in Latakia only accentuates the questions surrounding Moscow's military presence there. According to satellite photos obtained by Stratfor - a US think-tank - the jets appear to be four Sukhoi Su-30 multi-role fighters and up to a dozen possible SU-25 ground attack aircraft. Their deployment came shortly after initial military-to-military contacts between the US and the Russians at the end of last week. The US is operating warplanes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syrian airspace and Israel too is concerned about the potential constraints on its military freedom of action over southern Syria. That's why Mr Netanyahu visited Moscow. Clearly all three countries need to have some sense of what the other might potentially be doing if a damaging incident is to be avoided - especially if Russia intends to use its aircraft to support the Assad regime. Mr Netanyahu said Iran and Syria were "trying to set up a second terrorist front on the Golan Heights", a Syrian plateau which was mostly captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel annexed the captured section in 1981, in a move not recognised internationally. Mr Putin told Mr Netanyahu that Syria had no interest in attacking Israel. "We know that the Syrian army and Syria as a whole are in such a state that they have no time for a second front. They need to save their own state," he said. Russia acknowledges supplying weapons to Syria and sending military experts to train government forces in their use, but denies they are involved in combat.	Russian President Vladimir Putin has sought to allay Israeli concerns at Russia's military build-up in Syria.
But what really strikes you, especially in those initial developmental stages, is how familiar the forms look. How like an early human foetus, they appear. "This is something you see time and time again in vertebrates, not just with mammals," says Richard Sabin, the Natural History Museum's top whale expert. "You see these similarities in the early developmental stages and it's really not until you're halfway through the gestation - which  for a humpback whale is around 11 months - that you start to see the things that make that foetus characteristically the species that it is." Richard has a remarkable sequence of seven humpback foetuses that he's going to put on display for the NHM's major summer exhibition on cetaceans. They go from what is essentially just a ball of cells that's perhaps only a few weeks old, all the way through to a specimen that appears to be a perfect humpback in miniature. This larger foetus, about half a metre in length, is probably seven to eight months into the gestation period. It has everything you would expect to see in a humpback, including those long, tell-tale pectoral flippers with their nobbly tubercles. The specimens were collected at the beginning of the 20th Century by scientists who had been sent to the Antarctic to gather data on the activities of the whaling fleets. Their role was to understand the biology, the movements, and the ecology of whales - to appreciate the status of stocks so that the commercial returns could be maximised. It's an awkward feeling knowing that these foetuses were taken from harpooned pregnant humpbacks. Somehow you have to console yourself with the recognition that the acquired data was ultimately what shut down that bloody industry. "There is a story with every specimen and it may not be a very comfortable story, but it is something we have to acknowledge," says Richard. "The thing to remember is that the data we get from these specimens we actively use for marine conservation purposes now." Just this past week, a Swiss-led team used old whaling data to show how species had shrunk in size in the 40 years prior to the stocks collapsing. This trend signal, the team said, could be used to warn of imminent disaster in other hunted wildlife groups. What have we learned from foetuses, specifically? A lot it seems about evolutionary biology. "One thing we see in these humpbacks is the development of tooth buds at around four-to-five months into gestation. They're then reabsorbed to allow the baleen to start to develop," explains Richard. The baleen are the keratin plates that hang from the upper-jaw and filter the humpbacks' prey. "So, we know from the study of these foetuses, from an evolutionary developmental perspective, that there was a time when all cetaceans were toothed and that baleen are a relatively recent development. And we've only just found the fossils that back that up." The whales exhibition is due to open on 14 July, the day after the NHM re-opens its front entrance. The Hintze Hall has been remodelled. Its emblematic diplodocus ("Dippy") dinosaur is being replaced by a blue whale skeleton that will hang from the ceiling (Plot spoiler: I've had a sneak peek already and it looks spectacular). So, it's certainly a timely moment to highlight the contribution of cetaceans to life on Earth. More than 100 specimens from the London museum's collections are being set up in the institution's Waterhouse Gallery. The exhibition will impress upon visitors the huge diversity of whales, dolphins and porpoises. It will explain their relatively short evolutionary journey, from being land animals 50 million years ago to becoming the well-adapted ocean-dwellers we know today. And it will describe how they move, how they breathe, and how some echolocate to find their prey. It still astounds me that whales can communicate over many hundreds of kilometres. "We want people to realise that as well as being mammals like us, they also have complex culture like us," says Richard. "This is a very new area of study that has accelerated in just the past 10 years through observations, through genetic information and the data coming from museum specimens."

The crackdown began last month when Turkish ISPs were told to cut off the virtual private networks people use to hide where they go. Many people are changing the way they connect to Tor to avoid the block. Activists said the block moved Turkey's net censorship policies from "moderate" to "severe". Tor, also known as The Onion Router, aims to conceal where people go online by using encryption and randomly bouncing requests for webpages through a network of different computers. The system has become popular in many nations, such as China and Turkey, where governments are known to watch what people do and say online. Now Turkey Blocks, which monitors internet censorship in the nation, said its regular monitoring of Tor showed that it was being widely blocked across the country. The organisation started to investigate after many people in Turkey reported having problems reaching the Tor network. It added that the Turkish government had put in place sophisticated systems at ISPs to spot when people were trying to connect to Tor. These inspect packets of data and can pick out the distinctive signature of those that are destined for Tor. Turkey Blocks said the Turkish government ordered firms to start blocking VPNs and Tor in early December, and has increased the pressure on firms to act by asking for weekly updates about the success of the measures. The monitoring group said that while direct access to Tor was not working well, many people were reporting that they could still access the network if they used a bridge. These are unofficial entry points to the Tor network which, because they are not listed in the software itself, can survive when blocks are imposed. Turkey has a long history of cutting off access to websites and services - particularly during periods of social unrest.	Turkey has blocked direct access to the Tor anonymous browsing network as part of a wider crackdown on the ways people circumvent internet censorship.
The money is owed by absent parents who have been referred to the Child Support Agency. Accounts prepared for Parliament by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) class £2.9bn of the £3.9bn in maintenance arrears as "uncollectable". Ministers said the focus was on debts for children still being brought up, but old debts would not be "forgotten". The Child Support Agency (CSA) was set up 21 years ago with the aim of ensuring that if a relationship broke down, a parent could not just walk off and leave an ex to pay the costs of bringing up their children. The CSA's role was to calculate maintenance - and ensure that non-resident parents paid up. But it has been dogged with problems. Computer systems did not work properly. Mistakes were made with assessments and absent parents were not tracked down. In 2012, a new child maintenance system was introduced in an effort to draw a line under the CSA's difficulties. The Child Maintenance Service, as the new system is called, does not consider recovering the historic debts on the CSA's books as a priority. Around 1.3 million single parents are owed money the CSA ruled they were entitled to - and some have been waiting years. One single parent, Marianne Miles from London, said she badly needed the money the CSA ordered her ex-partner to pay towards their son. But after nearly seven years of waiting for payment, she has all but given up. "I am not hopeful of seeing any of that money to be perfectly honest," she said. "They [the CSA] haven't made much effort to get anything - even £30 a week - so I have practically written off all of it." In 2008, Marianne Miles, from London, was made redundant from her job as a publicist. Raising her teenage son alone became a severe financial struggle. She turned to the CSA, which ordered her ex-partner to contribute. To this day, she still has not received the money owed, which has built up to a total of £12,000. "I try not to get angry about it, but it's not fair," she said. "If he owed the government council tax money, or for a parking ticket, they would pursue it and make sure it was paid. But when it's paying maintenance towards your own child, it is not deemed as important." Her son is now 20 and has left home, but Marianne is still responsible for him financially. "Just because he didn't have it before doesn't mean he doesn't need it now," she said. "It would make a huge difference. "He's a student so it could go towards his books and his food, that I have to support, and he's learning how to drive. I'm the only person around to help him." Janet Allbeson, from the single-parent charity Gingerbread, believes the government should be recovering unpaid maintenance, even in cases that have been going on for years. She said: "If they do manage to get the money, even if it is years late, it can really make a difference to a child's life. "It allows, for instance, to help with the cost of going to college, perhaps paying off a student loan, or helping a child learn to drive. "Children in some ways get more expensive as they get older and that money can make a real difference to a child's future." The government said it was prioritising cases where a child was still being brought up. Steve Webb, the minister with responsibility for child maintenance, said: "We are quite clear that just because money has been owed for a long time it does not mean it should be forgotten about. It should be paid. "Of course everything cannot be a priority. We have been quite transparent… and we have made it clear that where there is a child still at school or being brought up - that is the first priority. "But we are not writing off or ignoring old debt." But figures in DWP accounts published in December raise questions about how much of the arrears backlog is likely to be recovered. The £2.9bn listed as "uncollectable" relates to cases where either no payment has been received from the absent parent in the previous six months, or no arrears schedule has been put in place. The DWP said the definition of "uncollectable" in the accounts did not give a true picture of the level of debt that is beyond its enforcement powers - and in fact only £244m was permanently "uncollectable". This report will be broadcast on Sunday, 25 January 2015 at 11:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live. You can listen to other editions of 5 live Investigates on the BBC iPlayer.

Billions of pounds owed in child maintenance may never be recovered, government accounts show.
Meden Sports Centre in Warsop, Nottinghamshire, has faced ongoing maintenance issues with a temporary closures and Â£500,000 spent on repairs. Mansfield District Council has said it is "unsustainable" and has launched a consultation on its future. However, Warsop Parish Council said it was "essential" to the area and it would fight to keep it open. The centre, which dates from the 1960s, was closed for six months in 2014 after an inspection identified fire safety concerns. Officials have said renovation or rebuilding costs could cost between Â£1m to Â£8m. Andrew Tristram, district council portfolio holder for the environment, said: "The council has undergone a review of leisure services at Meden Sports Centre and concluded that the current operating model is not sustainable for the future. "There are increasing uncertainties about the running costs and capital investment due to the condition of the building". However, parish council chairman Andy Wetton said: "The centre is essential to the area but this administration seems hell-bent on closing it. "There was money available to replace it but this has been spent on other things. "Any attempt to close it would be a declaration of war on Warsop and we would fight it hard." The district council said no changes would be made before April 2018.	Any move to close a sports centre would be a "declaration of war" on the local community, a councillor has warned.
At least 21 people were killed by the storm, the Red Cross said, with the eastern island of Samar worst hit, but it caused far less damage than feared. Thousands of people are heading home after about a million people were evacuated from vulnerable areas. The city of Tacloban, which bore the brunt of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year, has emerged relatively unscathed. Albay province, which evacuated more than half its population, has called for those people to go home. After spending three days at a school in Polangi, families are packing into small military trucks, holding one or two plastic bags with the essentials they brought with them. They worry about the state in which they'll find their homes but many are most worried about their rice fields, their only source of income. One woman reached her house and found it flooded and uninhabitable. For her that means at least one more night in the evacuation centre. Hagupit: What did the Philippines do differently? Hagupit - pictures, tweets and videos from the Philippines In the capital, residents are preparing for heavy rain and strong winds. The typhoon is still travelling westwards across the Philippines, and has weakened into a tropical storm, according to the Philippine meteorological authorities. A government alert on Monday morning stated that residents of the capital and surrounding regions should expect winds of up to 100km/h (62mph) in the next 24 hours, and to prepare for possible flash floods, landslides, and storm surges of up to 2m. Thousands who live along the coast and riverbanks were evacuated on Monday, reports said. A total of 11.8 million people live in the national capital region. Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada said the city was "prepared and trained for this", but added: "It's the flooding that we are worried about." Financial markets closed their doors on Monday along with schools and government offices. Flights and other public transport were halted. Hagupit has been nowhere near as powerful as Typhoon Haiyan - known as Yolanda in the Philippines - which tore through the central Philippines in November 2013, leaving more than 7,000 dead or missing. In Tacloban, Hagupit blew away roofs and flooded streets, but the area has escaped the wider devastation of last year. "There were no bodies scattered on the road, no big mounds of debris," local woman Rhea Estuna told the Associated Press by phone from Tacloban. "Thanks to God this typhoon wasn't as violent." Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez told the BBC that the immediate task was assessing damage to the temporary shelters in which some people have been living. He said that the weather was good now but that high tides were making it harder for waterways to drain, despite work to clear debris. UN official Orla Fagan told Reuters that a lot of people have begun returning to their homes. "In Tacloban this morning, the sun is shining, people just started going back," she said. The storm made its fourth landfall on Monday night, hitting Batangas province some 100km (60 miles) south of Manila with winds of roughly 100km/h. At its height, as it approached land on Saturday, gusts of up to 250km/h were recorded. The authorities said they were better prepared than when Haiyan struck, and organised the largest peacetime evacuation in the history of the Philippines. Justin Morgan, Oxfam country director for the Philippines, told the BBC that a key factor was a greater focus on the dangers of storm surges, meaning people were moved away from coastal areas. Joey Salceda, governor of Albay province, told the BBC no casualties and only "negligible damage" had been reported in his province. He said the storm had been identified as a threat in late November, giving officials time to identify population at risk, evacuate them two days ahead of the storm and prepare food supplies. Known locally as Typhoon Ruby, Hagupit has nonetheless caused major damage in several towns in the east. The Philippine Red Cross said at least 21 people had died over the weekend, with 18 of those on the eastern island of Samar, where Hagupit made landfall on Saturday. The mayor of Dolores, a town on Samar, said that 80% of homes there had been destroyed. One resident reportedly died after a tree fell on him. Two more people - a one-year-old girl and a 65-year-old man - died from hypothermia in the central province of Iloilo, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said. A total of 183 flights had been cancelled and five airports closed, the agency said, and there were power outages in 16 provinces.	Tropical storm Hagupit is heading to Manila, but has been downgraded from a typhoon after crossing the country.
People will be able to subscribe to popular channels such as Discovery and Eurosport individually, without paying for a bundle of channels. Until now, Prime Video has offered only on-demand films and TV shows in the UK. But one analyst said the launch line-up of channels was "not immediately desirable" and would struggle to attract satellite TV customers. "Amazon launched a similar thing in the US, and the big selling point was that you could get HBO and Showtime programmes, all under one umbrella," said Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders. "That's not going to happen here. Sky have HBO and Showtime locked down, at least for now, and will hold on to them aggressively. "When you look at what's available in the UK, it does lack the wow factor." Discovery Communications is providing the best-known pay-TV channels to the service, offering Eurosport for £6.99 a month and Discovery Channel for £4.99 a month. Viewers must also pay for an Amazon Prime membership at £79 a year. ITV will offer an ad-free version of its streaming service and access to its free channels - such ITV 2 and ITV Be - for a monthly fee of £3.99. "This is a starting point," said Alex Green, managing director of Amazon Video. "We're offering linear TV channels where it makes sense. We have a good spread of big partners and I'm sure that will only grow." As well as the traditional television channels, viewers will be able to pay for curated "channels" of programmes to stream on-demand, such as the Yoga Anytime Channel, and Horse & Country Play, which is billed as the "home of equestrianism". "The core of the experience on Prime Video is on-demand streaming, and that will still be the core of the experience," said Mr Green. Mr Harrington said it would be difficult for streaming services to offer traditional television services at a competitive price. "In the US, YouTube, Amazon, Apple and Facebook have been vocal about getting TV bundles together, but YouTube is the only one to have done it so far," he told the BBC. "It's very hard to build from all these different suppliers and put these channels together at a price that is compatible to a cable offering." Mr Green said Amazon wanted to offer customers more flexibility, by letting them subscribe to individual channels. "Often people say they are subscribed to a big TV package but don't watch a lot of the channels," he told the BBC. "Now people can try it out, pick and choose, and cancel at any time."	Amazon has announced it will offer live television channels via its Prime Video service, for an extra fee.
The currency initially slipped against the dollar and euro, only to start recovering in mid-afternoon trading before falling again. Meanwhile, the "volatility index" - a measure of investors' uncertainty - has hit levels last seen in the 2008 financial crisis. The Leave campaign argued that the pound simply retreated to March levels. The pound was down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.4226. Against the euro, sterling was down 0.6% at â‚¬1.2605 and weakened by 1% against the Japanese yen to just over 151. Investors have been spooked by data showing the chances of a Remain vote have fallen, although markets have also been rattled by global economic worries. With 10 days to go before the referendum vote, two polls at the weekend put the Leave camp ahead, while betting firm Betfair said the implied probability of a vote to Remain had now fallen to 68.5% from almost 80% a week earlier. How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU. "We expect incoming polls to move the pound more aggressively than before," said Charalambos Pissouros, senior analyst at IronFX Global. "If new polls continue to show a tight race between the two campaigns as we approach the voting day, the outcome is likely to become even more uncertain and hence, volatility in sterling is likely to heighten further." BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said hedge funds had been placing bets - short-selling - on expectations that the value of sterling will sink further. "The bears are in town," he said. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said the markets were now on full Brexit alert. "Polls show it's now too close to call and markets are responding with some very twitchy activity. Sterling has shed more than 2% in two sessions to retrace its April lows." Worries about the economic impact of leaving the EU were also blamed for a big fall in Asian stock markets. Japan's Nikkei index closed 3.5% down, while Hong Kong's main index slid 2.5%. The reaction on London's FTSE 100 was muted initially, with the index down 0.3% in morning trading. However, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 1.1% at 6,044.9 points, with Lloyds Banking Group the biggest faller, down 4.2%. On Sunday, Leave campaigner Nigel Farage told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show that sterling had recently been strengthening. "Sterling is up since March. Since Brexit became a possibility, sterling is up and FTSE is exactly the same level it was in March," he said. He also pointed out that a weaker pound was good for UK exporters. Last week, official figures showed that the UK trade deficit narrowed in April on the back of a jump in exports.	Sterling see-sawed as investors reacted to growing uncertainty over the outcome of the UK's EU referendum.
Two men were convicted for carrying out abuse during the 1970s, 80s and 90s at the now closed Skircoat Lodge. Victim Kaz Gray said inquiries did not go far enough and some individuals were allegedly still working with children. Calderdale Council said no one involved in the historical cases still worked for the authority. In 2001, Malcom Phillips, who ran Skircoat Lodge for nearly 20 years, was jailed for seven years for repeated abuse of children in his care. A social worker there, Andrew Shadders, who abused boys, was jailed for 15 years. Another man, Terence O'Hagan, was charged with abuse but died before conviction. Ms Gray, who is leading the protest at the council's social services offices, said the scale of the abuse in care homes in Calderdale over that period of time was "rampant". She said: "When I went into care one of the first things they did was put me on the pill. "I was 14, the youngest lass I knew of at the time on the pill in Skircoat was 11 years old." Ms Gray, who has waived her right to anonymity, was abused at Skircoat and said she was trafficked to a care home in North Wales where she was raped. She said she considered there were people still working with children in the area who had been "complicit in the abuse" of youngsters decades ago. "Nothing's changed, nothing will change until everything comes out," she added. The council said it fully supported the investigation at the time. It added: This was an appalling case and we regret that children suffered when they were in the care of the local authority. "I would like to reassure people that nobody involved in the historic cases works for the council, and in the intervening years our safeguarding practices have changed beyond recognition." Chief Supt Dickie Whitehead, Calderdale District Commander, said a thorough investigation was carried out by police and the council between 1997 and 2002 following allegations against a number of employees at Skircoat Lodge Assessment Centre and Dobroyd Castle. He said: "This led to a number of arrests and prosecutions, resulting in a number of substantial prison sentences." Mr Whitehead urged victims of abuse to come forward, adding: "We can promise that reports will be investigated and victims will be treated with the utmost sensitivity."	Victims of child sex abuse in Halifax are staging a protest calling for an inquiry into historical abuse at care homes in Calderdale to be reopened.
Emily Thornberry said Labour would not "frustrate Brexit" even if it failed to amend the bill. Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote. The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading. Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was "hopelessly divided" on the issue. She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said: "We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union." Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a "meaningful vote" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as "red lines". Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was "illogical" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. "There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now," she said. "We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work." One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: "We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created hereâ€¦ it's about being part of a team. "I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go." But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had "already taken the flak on it". Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced "in the coming few days". Asked if he should be lenient, he added: "I'm a very lenient person." Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled "will have to step down".	The shadow foreign secretary has suggested Labour will continue to support legislation paving the way for Brexit as it passes through Parliament.
The steelworks has been on the market since 2014 and the sale to UK-based investment firm Greybull Capital, would involve a £400m investment package. It would secure about 4,800 jobs and thousands more in supply chains and the local economy. Tata Steel has said it plans to sell the rest of its UK steel business, putting thousands of jobs at risk. The Scunthorpe steelworks is a key part of Tata Steel's long products division, which was put up for sale in 2014. Greybull Capital has been in talks to buy the division for nine months and entered into exclusive negotiations with Tata in December. Greybull describes itself as "a family office which makes long-term investments in private companies". The London-based investment firm is run by financiers Marc and Nathaniel Meyohas and Richard Perlhagen. Greybull is backing a turnaround plan, which aims to return the loss-making business to profitability within one to two years. Greybull plans to invest £400m in the business but the plan involves significant cost savings. Staff are being asked to accept a 3% pay cut for one year and reductions to company pension contributions.  Workers are being balloted on the changes. The firm has been in discussion with the government for a loan of between £70m and £100m. Those discussions are thought to be continuing but it is understood the sale is not dependent upon the loan. The turnaround plan was drawn up by management at Scunthorpe with input from unions and refined by the management consultants McKinsey & Co. It is understood Greybull is not envisaging further restructuring beyond the 1,200 job losses announced last October. That involved the closure of one of the two coke ovens at Scunthorpe and the mothballing of three plate mills, reducing annual production capacity to 2.8m tonnes. Two of those Mills, in Lanarkshire in Scotland, have been sold to Liberty House, the commodities company which has expressed an interest in buying Tata's other UK steel operations, including the Port Talbot steelworks. The sale could also see the business rebranded as "British Steel", as it is understood Greybull is seeking to buy the brand as part of the deal. "British Steel" was the name of Britain's privatised steel industry.  It disappeared in 1999 when the industry was merged with a Dutch rival to create the Corus Group. The new business would include the Scunthorpe works, two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York and distribution facilities. About 3,400 employees are based in Scunthorpe with a further thousand spread across the other sites. The business also has a mill in northern France employing 400 workers. The business makes products for the transport and construction sectors with customers including the equipment giant Caterpillar and Network Rail. It is thought to have a 90% share of the market for new rails used across Britain's railways. The mill in northern France also produces rails for the national railway operator SNCF and for customers in Western Europe. Greybull specialises in turning around struggling firms by taking controlling stakes and backing management teams. In 2014 it rescued the holiday airline Monarch, buying a 90% stake. The airline returned to profitability the following year. Last September it bought 140 Morrisons convenience stores, rebranding them as My Local. It also owns Plessey, another name from Britain's industrial past, and is seeking to turn it into a leader in LED technology. But its purchase of Tata's loss-making long products division is its most high profile deal yet. But this sale, which could come as early as Monday, is not yet a done deal. It is expected to be subject to some outstanding conditions, thought to include financing and supplier agreements, which may mean it will not be formally completed for weeks. Greybull has made it clear that its focus at this time is on the long products purchase.

New City manager Pep Guardiola is keen to make Stones his next high-profile transfer of the summer. Stones was one of only two outfield players not to see action in England's disappointing Euro 2016 campaign. Talks have yet to take place, but the asking price would make Stones, 22, Britain's most expensive defender. Everton have no need to sell, but the possibility is growing that Stones will leave before the start of the new Premier League season. He was at the centre of a transfer battle last summer when Everton rejected a succession of bids rising up to almost £40m from Chelsea, simply refusing to sell to then manager Jose Mourinho. Guardiola has made Stones, who has 10 England caps, a priority target as he prepares to renew his rivalry with Mourinho, who is now across the city at Manchester United, and looks certain to get his man. Manchester City have already signed Ilkay Gundogan from Borussia Dortmund and completed a £13.8m deal for Spain forward Nolito from Celta Vigo after their interest in Euro 2016 was ended by Italy. Everton will give any money they get for Stones to new manager Ronald Koeman to increase his already considerable transfer fund.

Manchester City want to buy Everton defender John Stones, but would have to pay the Goodison Park club around £50m for the England international.
The message from David Cameron was clear - there needs to be "a big cultural change" towards sport in schools with a return to the "competitive ethos" in school sports. The prime minister said the problem was not money and suggested some teachers were not "playing their part" but what do those in grassroots sport believe are the key ingredients for success? Graeme Maw, director of sport at Millfield School, in Somerset, says every pupil at the school does a minimum of three hours of scheduled sport per week. However, many pupils at the private school, which has nine former and current pupils competing at the London Games - more than any other school - do up to 22 hours of training. There are also more than 30 different sports on offer. Mr Maw says the word "opportunity" is key. "Sport and physical activity are the heartbeat of our community," says Mr Maw. The Youth Sport Trust (YST) says it is important schools engage everyone, for example by involving young people in the selection and planning of sport and activities. Schools also need to broaden the range of lunchtime and after-hours clubs to increase opportunities for young people to take part, it says. It is an ethos Mr Maw agrees with. "Dance might not be an Olympic sport but it's something that young girls really enjoy - it's about finding and discovering individual talent in a child," he adds. Mr Cameron spoke on Wednesday of "some teachers not wanting to join in and play their part" when it came to school sports. But Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), says his comments were "ill informed, unfair and fail to recognise the huge contribution that many teachers make to sports in schools". "Many teachers, not just PE staff, willingly give up their time to motivate and coach young people in a wide range of sports," he says. The YST says there must be teachers and coaches on the ground ready to support young people who show an interest in sport at primary and secondary level. Mr Cameron has said the government is investing Â£1bn in school sports over the next four years, but "the problem isn't money". David Mansfield, headteacher at Coopers' Company and Coborn School, in Essex, says investment is key. The state school was named the most sports-minded school in Europe in 2005 and Mr Mansfield says it is one of few that competes with public schools in national sport. Mr Mansfield says the school's success is down to putting extra money into sports, for example, the school employs a professional hockey coach. He describes funding as "the bottom line" and says there is a "straight-line correlation between outcomes and incomes". "If schools are not on the front foot to identify talent then we're going to see a real fall away from the fantastic job that has been done (in the past)," he says. Mr Trobe is critical of the removal of funding for the Schools Sports Partnership (SSP), a network of sports colleges in England - including the Coopers' school - that put specialist PE teachers to work with primary school pupils, linked schools with local sports clubs, brought high quality coaches into schools and promoted competitive matches. Experts say it is too early to say how this will affect school sport participation. But Mr Trobe says: "If the prime minister is serious about wanting to enhance sport in schools the funding will need to be put in place to support those very willing teachers and coaches to deliver a lasting sporting legacy." The Fields in Trust (FIT), a UK charity that protects recreational spaces, says funding is essential - but it is important not to forget about the fields themselves. "It is important to look beyond the funding when considering sporting legacy for a golden future," said Alison Moore-Gwyn, chief executive. "David Cameron has initiated this process but it is vital that other elements which nurture sporting ability are not overlooked. A fundamental one is the provision of space for people to discover and hone their talent." The charity's Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge focuses on this, says Ms Moore-Gwyn. The scheme works with landowners to protect their outdoor recreational spaces, aiming for 2,012 of them by the end of this year. The YTS says school and council facilities should also be opened up after hours. On Tuesday, it was revealed that Education Secretary Michael Gove has approved the sale of more than 20 school sports fields in the past two years. But FIT said more concerning was the situation for academies and new free schools, which are exempt from government regulations that govern mainstream schools' freedom to sell off their playing fields. There could be an unknown number of other sports pitches that have been lost, it said. "This could have serious implications for our sporting legacy," a spokeswoman said. The prime minister has called for a return to the "competitive ethos" and "getting rid of the idea all must win prizes and you can't have competitive sports days". But British Olympic Association chairman Colin Moynihan says many children do not want to play competitive sport, nor should they have to. "The key thing is to make sure that where they do want to there's the facility and the opportunity for them to do so and that's our emphasis and has been our emphasis throughout," he says. The YST adds that the first experience young people have of sport needs to be as positive as possible to encourage them to go further. This week a survey of 2,000 people by Freeview found that seven out of 10 thought Team GB athletes had replaced music stars and footballers as role models. During the Games so far many stars have served to inspire young athletes. Alan Davis, head coach at the Maindy Flyers club in Cardiff, where gold medal-winning cyclist Geraint Thomas trained until he was 16, said Thomas was "the perfect role model". "He's humble and takes his success and occasional setbacks equally well. What better example to give nine-year-old kids," he said. While Jessica Ennis's former PE teacher has said she is inspiring a new generation of athletes. Chris Eccles, who taught Miss Ennis at King Ecgbert School, Sheffield, said: "They are inspired by her because they can see someone from their own town being so successful." They have been on show throughout the Games, none more so than Chad Le Clos's father Bert who paid tribute to his "beautiful boy" after winning a swimming gold, but parents are often key to many Olympic successes. John Steele, chief executive officer at the YST, says: "For every gold medal and Olympic athlete we have had the pleasure to watch performing at the Games, there is a teacher, coach or parent that inspired them to start the journey to be their personal best." The YST says parents should encourage their children to lead active lifestyles and get them involved in sport, but parents themselves also need to be encouraged into volunteering roles in sports clubs and school sports activity. Mr Maw says it is important to find ways to celebrate sport and make it fun. Last year 2,000 of Millfield's pupils and 450 members of staff ran a total of 2,755 miles, raising Â£21,000 for Sport Relief. He says it is about "everybody having fun in the name of sport".	With Team GB celebrating their most successful Olympics for 100 years, a debate is growing about how best to build on the legacy and inspire the next generation into sport.
"This is where it all happens," says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's a pristine room, free of clutter and distractions, except for a PlayStation 4 and several years' worth of Fifa games. On the mixing desk sits a book on Frank Gehry's architecture, while the far corner is dominated by a gargantuan bean bag, apparently fashioned from the skin of a dead muppet. Outside the sliding glass doors, Tinie has a child-sized Lamborghini, which he's planning to use in an upcoming video. "Jake Bugg has been here," he says. "MNEK's been here. Sinead Harnett was here the other day. "Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal." The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years. The record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots. "I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out," he says. "I've been in my own world and my own head. "My engineer Ritchie said, 'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.' "But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened. "That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends." You can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a "personality". On Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings. "It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started," he says. "People were like, 'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.' "Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level." Tinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate. But by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead. Patrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV. Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears. Soon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche. "I got so many clothes I keep 'em in my aunt's house," he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out. He acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. "Eight years sitting on top/Hip-hop, grime, then I went pop." Yet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. "I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music," he says. What impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels. "Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label," marvels the rapper. Tinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone. Grime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it "was almost like the uninvited genre". He says: "People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side. "I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else." He addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: "Black boys getting white paper/From the underground, now we're in the skyscraper." Reconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying. "A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three," he reflects. "It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like, 'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or, 'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking, 'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.' "But equally, they can tell you, 'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like, 'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.' "But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense. "So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the art comes before pretty much everything else." Tinie Tempah's album Youth is out on 14 April.

Unknown hackers carried out a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Ukrposhta's website. The attack began on Monday morning, but ended shortly after 21:00 local time (1900 BST). However, Ukrposhta reported on Facebook that the DDoS attack continued again on Tuesday. "Friends, we've been DDoSed," the company in a post on Tuesday. "During the first wave of the attack, which began yesterday in the morning, our IT services could normalise the situation, and after 17:00, all the services on the site worked properly. "But today, hackers are at it again. Due to their actions, both the website and services are working, but slowly and with interruptions." DDoS attacks occur when hackers flood a website's servers with a huge amount of web traffic, with the intent of taking the website offline. Attackers do this by secretly infecting computers, routers and Internet of Things-enabled devices, such as thermostats, washing machines and other home appliances, with malware and then roping the zombie computers into a botnet. "With critical systems exposed to the internet and inadequate protection, denial of service attacks can have an impact way beyond taking a website down or preventing online transactions from taking place," Sean Newman, director of Corero Network Security, told the BBC. "In this case, it was a service that was reportedly brought to its knees, but outcomes for other organisations could include manufacturing processes being interrupted or halted, potentially impacting productivity, quality and even safety. "This serves to highlight how any organisation, including those which don't transact directly with consumers, can be seriously impacted by denial of service attacks. With the level of sophistication of today's attackers, and without the latest generation of always-on, real-time automatic DDoS protection, all organisations are vulnerable to DDoS attacks of all sizes and durations." This is not the first time that Ukraine's postal service has been targeted this year - in June, Ukrposhta was hit by the NotPetya ransomware attacks, as part of a wider national attack on Ukrainian banks, the state power provider, television stations and public transport services.	Ukraine's national postal service has been hit by a two-day-long cyber-attack targeting its online system that tracks parcels.
It is hoped it will help recognise the "vital role" of those educating and caring for children aged up to seven. Education Minister Huw Lewis said the Welsh government's draft 10-year plan would help support "raise the status" of early years carers. Since 2008 children aged between three and seven have been educated through the play-based Foundation Phase. Reports into the effectiveness of the programme in May said that while it was having a positive impact on how children learned, it varied between schools and raised concerns about how well children were being prepared for exams later on in their education. The draft plan will go out to public consultation until 15 December and should be published next April. It would cover everyone who works with children in both state-run schools and nurseries and private childcare settings. The plan wants to see staff highly skilled and "highly regarded" in their career, who understand children's development, help all children to meet their potential and are bilingual. Mr Lewis is visiting a staff training session at Herbert Thompson Primary School in Cardiff to unveil the plan. He said: "The ages of 0-7 are a crucial time in every child's development. "It's important, therefore, that individuals like those I will meet today, that play such a key role in supporting children during these important years, receive the right level of support, are highly motivated and skilled and feel that they are valued. "We're determined to raise the status of careers in early years, childcare and play to a level which better reflects the vital role these practitioners play in supporting children's development." Some of the proposals include: Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said: "We owe it to our future generations to get this right. "If we reach our goals we will improve the lives of young children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds."	Plans to develop a highly-skilled workforce to improve early years education are to be unveiled.
Chris Packham, who is in Malta, said rare species were being targeted, and hunters were even shooting Montagu's harrier birds on the ground at night. "It's a desperate situation," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A Maltese wildlife official insisted that patrols to stop illegal hunting had been stepped up. Malta has an exemption from the EU Birds Directive, allowing its hunters to shoot turtle doves and quail during the spring migration, a crucial stage in the birds' life cycle. But according to Mr Packham, turtle doves were vulnerable, with their numbers down by 95% in the UK. Malta is the only EU country to have a recreational spring hunting season allowing birds to be shot. Mr Packham, a presenter of TV documentaries on wildlife, said Maltese hunters were ignoring restrictions under the exemption, or "derogation" in EU jargon. He said they were killing many other birds which are supposed to be protected. He is in Malta with the conservation group Birdlife Malta to draw attention to the annual spring shoot, which has been criticised by environmentalists for years. "Yesterday I'm afraid to say I had a dead swift in my hand that had been illegally shot and also a dead little bittern," Mr Packham told Today. Sergei Golovkin, head of Malta's Wild Birds Regulation Unit, insisted that the authorities were controlling the hunters. He said enforcement of the restrictions had "improved dramatically in the last few years". Malta has "the highest ratio in Europe" of enforcement staff deployed against illegal hunting, he told Today. Thirty-three MEPs have jointly lobbied the European Commission to put pressure on Malta over the hunting exemption. A British Liberal Democrat MEP, Catherine Bearder, says the EU must "stop Malta from breaking EU rules, by systematically failing to apply the derogation correctly".	A leading British naturalist has accused the Maltese authorities of failing to prevent large-scale illegal shooting of migratory birds by hunters.
More than 60,000 vials, said to contain anabolic steroids, were recovered in an operation by Garda (Irish police), customs and a medicine watchdog. Human growth hormones and erectile dysfunction pills were also found during Thursday's raids in Muff and Lifford. A man in his 30s was arrested, but later released without charge. The Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Republic's medicine watchdog, said evidence of an illegal manufacturing operation had been found. The PSNI had carried out further searches in Northern Ireland, it said.	Steroids and medicines with an estimated street value of some 2m euros (Â£1.7m) have been seized in Donegal.
2 October 2015 Last updated at 18:13 BST Speaking in an interview with BBC Newsnight's diplomatic and defence editor Mark Urban, he said UK policy in Syria had been hampered by "wishful thinking" - and officials underestimated the staying power of President Bashar al-Assad. More on this story from Mark Urban on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 BST BBC Two on Friday 2 October, and afterwards on iPlayer	Russian's intervention in Syria is "hugely significant" says the UK's former senior military adviser in the Middle East Lt Gen Sir Simon Mayall.
Mike Peters, lead singer of The Alarm, is encouraging US congressmen and senators to 'Get On The List' on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Three-time cancer survivor Mr Peters co-founded the Love Hope Strength Foundation in 2007 to encourage more people to sign up as potential lifesavers. The US visit follows a similar recruitment drive in Westminster. Ahead of the event, Mr Peters encouraged people in the USA to write to their local representative asking them to attend the donor drive at Capitol Visitor Centre. Potential donors fill out a consent form and have their cheeks swabbed. Their details are then stored anonymously on an international bone marrow registry until they are 61-years-old. It is hoped the event will grow the number of US donors and improve the chances of finding matches for patients suffering from a blood borne cancer or illness. Mr Peters said the foundation has been campaigning for this day for many years. "It is so exciting to feel that all the hard work and effort, made possible with the support of DKMS - We Delete Blood Cancer, and so many others, is finally coming to fruition," he said. "People are realising that one day it could be someone that they know who needs a bone marrow donor, and the more people that are on the list, the better everyone's chances of finding an unrelated donor area." The event in the House of Commons in 2013 registered more than 100 MPs and staff members, and MP John Glen became a lifesaving match a few months later.	A Welsh rock star has taken his bone marrow donor drive to Washington DC.
He told the United Nations General Assembly that world leaders, notably Germany and Canada, have vowed to double the number from last year. "We are facing a crisis of epic proportion," Mr Obama said. About 21 million refugees have been forced to flee their countries due to conflict or persecution, the UN says. Nine million people alone have been displaced by the six-year conflict in Syria while more than four million others have fled the war-torn country. "We cannot avert our eyes or turn our backs. To slam the door in the face of these families would betray our deepest values," he added. The US has agreed to take in 110,000 new refugees in the 2017 fiscal year - which begins on 1 October- compared with the 85,000 refugees it expects by the end of September. The president's remarks come a day after a US and Russia-brokered ceasefire unravelled, partly due to a US-led air strike over the weekend that mistakenly killed Syrian soldiers. Tensions continued on Monday when a strike, which witnesses say came from the air, hit an aid convoy at Urum al-Kubra, destroying 18 UN lorries and killing about 20 civilians. The UN has since suspended all aid convoys to Syria in response. Both Russia and Syria have insisted their forces were not behind the strike. The president's announcement also included a pledge by countries to increase financial contributions to UN appeals and humanitarian groups by about $4.5b (Â£3.5b) over 2015 levels. Participating countries have vowed to help fund schools for a million refugee children as well as assist in helping one million refugees work legally. Mr Obama used his eighth and final UN address as president to call for a "course correction" to ensure that extremism and violence does not drive countries into a more divided world. "Together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home," he said. Though he made no direct mention of the US, Mr Obama said wealthy countries with the resources should do more to help. In what appeared to be a dig at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, he added: "The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies." Hours earlier, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also expressed concern over the conflict in Syria, saying there was "no military solution". "Gulfs of mistrust divide citizens from their leaders. Extremists push people into camps of 'us' and 'them'," Mr Ban said, taking the world stage for the last time as secretary general. "The Earth assails us with rising seas, record heat and extreme storms. And danger defines the days of many."	US President Barack Obama has announced a pledge by 50 nations to take in 360,000 refugees from war-torn countries this year.
The Ports occupy bottom spot and they are 11 points adrift of Carrick Rangers with four games left. "We look forward to it and we'll have a good chance against Ballinamallard," said Ports boss Niall Currie. Ballinamallard are 11 points clear of Rangers, who sit in the relegation play-off place, so they will retain their Premiership status with a win. Carrick are not in action until Saturday, when they take on Ards, but their destiny may already have been decided by events at Shamrock Park. Portadown came from behind to beat Carrick 2-1 last weekend and Currie is hoping for a repeat display. "We've a lot of kids playing at the minute and if they play like they did against Carrick then we have every confidence for this game," he added. Media playback is not supported on this device "All our remaining matches are ones we can really challenge for." Ballinamallard will be without the suspended Ryan McConnell but Stuart Hutchinson is set to return. "It will be a massive challenge as they are fighting for their lives - it's going be a tough game," said Mallards manager Gavin Dykes.	Anything less than victory against the Mallards will see Portadown relegated from the Irish Premiership.
The plane came down en route to Russia from the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. A group linked to so-called Islamic State (IS) said it bombed the plane. Nearly all the victims were Russians. Russia has said a bomb brought down the Metrojet Airbus, after finding what it said were "traces of foreign explosives" on the debris. It has vowed to "find and punish" the perpetrators. In response to Monday's findings, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov re-iterated that "our experts concluded this was a terrorist attack". Russian plane crash: What we know Russia suspended all flights to Egypt in the wake of the attack, with the UK also suspending flights to and from Sharm el-Sheikh. However, the head of the Egyptian committee investigating the crash, Ayman al-Muqaddim, was quoted by state TV on Monday as saying there was "no evidence that there is an act of terror or illegal intervention". IS-affiliate Sinai Province said it had destroyed the plane because of Russian air strikes on Syria. Last month IS's magazine published a photo of what it claimed was the improvised bomb that brought down the airliner. The picture in Dabiq showed a Schweppes Gold soda can and what appears to be a detonator and a switch. The crash has dealt another blow to Egypt's vital tourism industry, already struggling after years of unrest. Egypt's tourism minister told Reuters earlier this month that tourism revenues for 2015 will be at least 10% below last year's.	Egyptian investigators say they have so far found no evidence that terrorism caused a Russian jet to crash in the Sinai in October, killing 224 people.
Former justice minister David Ford is among a cross-community group of politicians and human-rights activists involved in the bid. Their lawyers have written to Prime Minister Theresa May urging her to consider the NI peace process before formally triggering Brexit. A majority in Northern Ireland backed Remain in the June referendum. Solicitors have threatened to take a judicial review before the High Court in Belfast - and ultimately to Europe's highest court - unless Mrs May addresses legal obligations which, they say, she must meet, including gaining the consent of the Stormont Assembly. The prime minister and Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire have been asked to reply within two weeks. Can the law stop Brexit? Others supporting the warning letter include: Green Party leader Steven Agnew; Social Democratic and Labour Party leader Colum Eastwood; senior Sinn FÃ©in Stormont Assembly member John O'Dowd; former head of the Progressive Unionist Party Dawn Purvis; ex-Equality Commission member and disability rights activist Monica Wilson OBE and the the Committee on the Administration of Justice human-rights group. A legal challenge over the UK leaving the EU will be heard by the High Court in London in October, two judges have decided. Government lawyers are expected to argue that the prime minister can use historic Royal Prerogative powers to start the process of withdrawing from the EU, a course the challengers say is unlawful. They say Parliament must give its authorisation.	A legal challenge over the UK leaving the European Union (EU) is to be launched in Northern Ireland.
Midfielder Jeff Hendrick has been ruled out because of a shoulder problem and has returned to his club Derby County. Harry Arter will miss the Dublin games because of an Achilles injury. The Bournemouth player, who has only one Republic cap, has returned to his club for treatment. Stoke City forward Walters sat out training sessions in Dublin over recent days. "Jeff has got a shoulder injury that he has had to deal with for quite a number of weeks now so we thought it best going back and getting is sorted a club level," said Republic manager Martin O'Neill. "Jon, I think he will be fit for Tuesday, he just thought he might be best to go home for a day or two. He should be back on Friday night to watch the game. He will definitely play on Tuesday. "Robbie Keane sat out training again on Wednesday but there is no real problem. He will be okay and will be available for any of the two games."

The former UKIP leader will provide political analysis for the main channel, and the Fox Business Network's daytime and primetime programmes. Mr Farage has been one of the UK's most prominent supporters of US President Donald Trump and appeared alongside him during his election campaign. He was the first UK politician to meet Mr Trump after his win in November. It comes shortly after he was given his own nightly show on UK radio station LBC. Mr Farage travelled to Washington for Mr Trump's inauguration on Friday. After the ceremony he tweeted his approval saying: "A very strong speech by @POTUS. He means it." He also appeared on Fox Business to comment on the inauguration. He said: "Listening to the speech today, this is a political revolution and it's very exciting." Mr Farage has said he wants to be a "bridge" between the UK and Donald Trump's US administration. The US president tweeted in November that Mr Farage would make a good British ambassador to the US but Downing Street rejected the suggestion, saying there was "no vacancy".	Nigel Farage has been hired as a commentator for American TV network Fox News, the broadcaster has announced.
These are the close-up views provided by academics from Mosul, who have maintained covert contacts linking the city with the outside world. They claim that foreign fighters, once visible in Mosul, have disappeared from the city. "The frontline foreign fighters are rarely there. They've vanished. The houses they occupied are vacant," said one source, speaking anonymously. "They're leaving it to the local fighters, who will become the scapegoats." The IS leadership in the city is also described as "melting away". "It's a lost cause. It's the end of days for them," says one of the scholars from Mosul, who have been supported by the New York-based Institute of International Education, which once rescued academics in Europe from the Nazis. They also talk of "changed tactics", with IS fighters trimming their beards and changing the way they dress to look more like the civilian population - with Mosul residents assuming this is to make them less distinguishable if the city is overrun. Cars in the city have been forced to switch to Islamic State number plates, says one of the academics. The fear from civilians is that this could make all cars vulnerable to an air strike or put them at risk of being attacked in the battle for the city. So far, air strikes have been carefully targeted at government buildings and military sites, according to this view from the city. Another says that this accuracy might seem "impossible" but so far the attacks have been on "confirmed" targets. Mosul University, once one of the biggest universities in the Middle East, had been kept open by the IS authorities when they seized the city in 2014. It had raised questions about whether its laboratories were being used to develop weapons, including for chemical warfare, which could be used in battle or against civilians. But sources now say that this is "no longer an issue" as the university has been pulverised by air strikes. "The university is completely inoperative and air strikes have made it a difficult place to go. Most of the buildings have been brought down, it's virtually gone. The laboratories are destroyed." It is expected there will be "chlorine rockets", but doubts about anything more sophisticated. Another source says that "Daesh used the university to store some weapons" and had blocked access to some sections of laboratories. "It is believed that they used laboratories for terrorist purposes, but it is almost impossible to confirm such claims." But it's assumed that the laboratories would have had chemicals - and that the IS forces might have carried out experiments, such as adding chemicals to explosives. But the destruction of the university is claimed to have stopped any further weapons development. Although there is a claim that "Daesh insurgents are still inside the university to 'protect' it from any emergency situation". As the Iraqi government forces, militias and Kurdish Peshmerga close in on the city, there are signs of deepening tensions between the IS regime and the local population, according to sources. The city's people are said to be in a "state of fear and terror". As IS has been targeted by the coalition forces, they in turn have "put their anger on the people" claiming that Mosul's residents are communicating with "hostile parties to Daesh". At Friday prayers last week, a pro-IS preacher talked of how local people were "hypocrites" who had let down the "caliphate". The religious police are also trying to assert their authority and show that nothing has changed in their control - and there have been more gruesome public executions of people claimed to be opponents or informants. "They are trying to show they are in control of everything." There is a culture of "false accusations" and another Mosul academic says: "Daesh continues to hunt 'offenders' and punish them heavily," which often means the death penalty. The IS authorities have tried to clamp down on communications - but this doesn't seem to be effective. There had been highly-monitored public points for internet access, but these too have been shut down. But as the Iraqi forces advance on the city, internet providers have been boosting access in Mosul. It means that in some parts of the city it has been possible to make contact, but this is being carried out in elaborate and extremely cautious ways to keep such links secret. Such communication is described as being immensely dangerous, but there is a great hunger for news. A source says there is a "great risk of punishment", which would be execution. There is said to be a huge amount of excitement about the approaching forces. "People in Mosul are jubilant at the prospect of the city being liberated," says another local source. This optimism, at the early stages of the battle, is said to outweigh fears of the loss of civilian lives and the destruction of buildings. Tactics being used by the IS forces, such as digging tunnels, are seen as likely to be ineffective - and there is an expectation that they will be defeated. Then there will be questions about reconstruction and rebuilding - and there are questions about whether professionals who have fled the city will really want to come back. There are deep concerns about how the battle for Mosul might become a proxy for other sectarian disputes and score-settling, with so many opposing forces under the banner of the coalition attacking IS. There are also fears that politicians, with their own militias, could exploit the battle for their own advantage. Arguments also exist that this is a city exhausted by bloodshed and desperate for peace and moderation. For two years of the IS occupation and for a decade before, there has been so much conflict, destruction and extremism. Mosul has been "saturated with violence" and this long "trauma" must end.	The forces of so-called Islamic State, now besieged in Mosul, are in a state of "frenzy" inside the city, increasingly blaming and terrorising the local population and preparing to conceal themselves if defeated.
The 66-year-old, of Ballybinaby, Hackballscross, County Louth, faces nine tax charges at the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court. Prosecutors claim he had significant dealings in cattle and land and received farming grants but failed to submit tax returns for nine years. Mr Murphy denies the offences. His defence lawyers claim that their client's brother, Patrick Murphy, managed his cattle herd and farming activities. The prosecution at the three-judge, non-jury court was brought after an investigation by the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB). One of the judges indicated that the verdict may be delivered next Thursday, 17 December, but added it is "by no means certain". Mr Murphy was remanded on continuing bail until 17 December.	The trial of the prominent republican Thomas "Slab" Murphy for alleged tax evasion has heard the court may deliver judgement on the case next week.
He carded a six-under-par round of 64 to finish 21 under, one shot ahead of American Ollie Schniederjans. Former world number one Stenson hit eight birdies in his closing round, including three in a row from the 15th. Schniederjans also shot 64, while compatriot Webb Simpson finished four shots back in third place. American Davis Love, at 53 seeking to become the oldest winner in US PGA Tour history, finished eight shots adrift in a tie for 10th. Stenson, 41, said: "I don't know how many times I'm going to get as close to playing as well as I did at Troon. "I'm just very pleased with how I closed out this week."	Sweden's Henrik Stenson won the Wyndham Championship to claim his first title since The Open at Royal Troon last year.
The Nepal Scotland Association said many of its members lost friends and loved ones in the devastating earthquake last weekend. The event was held outside the City Chambers on the Royal Mile. It was organised by Mercy Corps with help from the Nepal Scotland Association and the city council. A charity concert to raise money for the relief effort was also held in the city. The Singing Bowl Concert, considered to be the ancient sound of Nepal, was held at St Giles' Cathedral.	A candlelit vigil has been held in Edinburgh to show support for the people of Nepal.
Researchers at the University of Sheffield said the tumours were effectively "fertilising" the bone to help themselves grow. The study, in the journal Nature, said it may be possible to protect bone from a tumour's nefarious influence and consequently stop the cancer's spread. Cancer charities said this opened up "a whole new avenue for research". Around 85% of breast cancers that spread around the body end up in bone, at which point the cancer is difficult to treat and more deadly. The scientists, in Sheffield and the University of Copenhagen, discovered patients with secondary cancers had higher levels of an enzyme called LOX being produced by their tumours and released into the blood. Bone is constantly being broken down and rebuilt. But in a series of experiments on mice, the research team showed LOX was disrupting the process and leaving lesions and holes in the bone. Using drugs to block LOX prevented the cancer from spreading. Dr Alison Gartland, a reader in bone and cancer biology at the university, told the BBC News website: "We think it's a significant breakthrough in trying to prevent metastases (secondary tumours) in breast cancer. "The cancer cells in the primary tumour are actually fertilising the soil for the future growth of itself, LOX is changing the environment in bone to make it better to grow." The animal tests also showed that a set of osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates could prevent the spread of cancer. Bisphosphonates also interfere with the way bone is recycled in order to strengthen it. They are already given to some cancer patients, but the Sheffield team believe they could have a much larger role. The effect was discovered only in oestrogen-negative breast cancers. They account for around a third of cases, but are far more deadly. Katherine Woods, from Breast Cancer Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "By unveiling the role that the protein LOX is playing, these results open up a whole new avenue for research and treatments that could stop breast cancer spreading to the bone. "The research also adds weight to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bisphosphonates in stopping secondary breast cancer in its tracks. "The reality of living with secondary breast cancer in the bone is a stark one, which leaves many women with bone pain and fractures that need extensive surgery just when they need to be making the most of the time they have left with friends and family." The findings may also apply in colon cancer.	Breast cancers can manipulate the structure of bone to make it easier to spread there, a study has found.
After centuries as a powerful medieval kingdom, Hungary was part of the Ottoman and then Habsburg empires from the 16th century onwards, emerging as an independent country again after World War I. The Hungarian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric family and is one of the handful of languages spoken within the European Union that are not of Indo-European origin. A landlocked country, Hungary is home to Lake Balaton, the largest in central Europe, and to a large number of spa towns and hot springs. Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring It has especially rich traditions in folk and classical music and was the birthplace of numerous outstanding performers and composers, including Franz Liszt, Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly. Hungary became co-equal partner with Austria in a dual monarchy in the mid-19th century after an unsuccessful revolt against the Habsburgs in 1848. After a period of turmoil following World War I, an independent kingdom of Hungary was established under the authoritarian regency of Admiral Miklos Horthy. The redrawing of European borders that took place after World War I left about five million ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. Their status remains a sensitive issue and has complicated Hungary's relations with its neighbours. Following World War II, in which Admiral Horthy had allied himself with Germany, Hungary fell under communist rule. An uprising in 1956 was crushed by Red Army forces, but Hungary did later become the first Eastern European country to gain some economic freedom. Hungary played an important part in accelerating the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe when it opened its border with Austria in 1989, allowing thousands of East Germans to escape to the West. Just a few months later the Berlin Wall was history. Hungary's post-communist economic transition was achieved relatively smoothly. Within four years of the collapse of communism nearly half of the country's economic enterprises had been transferred to the private sector, and by 1998 Hungary was attracting nearly half of all foreign direct investment in Central Europe. Ten years later, the picture looked rather less rosy. A high level of both private and state borrowing left the country particularly vulnerable to the credit crunch of 2008, and in October of that year the government was forced to appeal to the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank for massive loans in a bid to stave off economic collapse. Dissatisfaction with the centre-left coalition government's handling of the economy from 2002 to 2010 coincided with the rise of the right-wing nationalist party Jobbik, known for its anti-Semitic and anti-Gypsy rhetoric, and a move to the authoritarian right by the Fidesz party, which won parliamentary elections in 2010 and 2014. The two-thirds parliamentary majority gained by Fidesz in 2010 allowed it to throw out the comparatively liberal post-communist constitution and replace it with a constitution that critics say cements the governing party's hold on power and removes checks and balances essential for the healthy functioning of a democracy. Fidesz insists that the constitutional change was necessary in order to complete the work of eradicating the legacy of communism. Fidesz scored another comfortable victory in the 2014 election, albeit with a reduced majority. Jobbik increased its share of the vote, becoming the second-largest political party in the country.	Hungary traces its history back to the Magyars, an alliance of semi-nomadic tribes from southern Russia and the Black Sea coast that arrived in the region in the ninth century.
The Transport for London (TfL) trial follows the success of its "Baby on board" badge for pregnant women. TfL is recruiting 1,000 people to start wearing the blue badges from 12 September. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he hoped they would "give confidence" to people who find standing difficult. Some travellers, such as James McNaught who is joining the trial, had already started making their own badges to alert fellow passengers to their condition. The 45-year-old designed "Cancer on board" badges after travelling on the Tube between Kentish Town and University College Hospital for chemotherapy. Radiotherapy on his throat left him unable to speak to ask for a seat, and the morphine made him appear drunk. "I'm really pleased TfL is doing this trial," he said. "A badge and card could help make a real difference to the lives of people undergoing drug treatment or with longer term conditions or disabilities." TfL will use social media and customer information to encourage other passengers to look out for the badges. "This small act of consideration from Londoners could make a huge difference to disabled people getting around the city and being fully involved in all London has to offer," said Alice Mitchell-Pye of charity Leonard Cheshire Disability. The six-week trial is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe.	People with hidden health conditions are being offered "Please offer me a seat" badges in a bid to help ease their suffering on London transport.
Abdulmalik Adua, 17, of Woolwich and Rezwan Islam, 19, of Gloucester, were both sentenced to a minimum of 16 years in prison. Paul Pass, 49, was stabbed in his flat in Gloucester last October by the pair, who used it as a drug-dealing base. Adua and Islam were found guilty of murder at an earlier hearing. Islam was also found guilty of kidnap. Bristol Crown Court heard Mr Pass was hit over the head with a guitar and stabbed in the leg, which caused his death. Bilal Ebrahim Moosajee, 19, of Gloucester was jailed for nine years after admitting manslaughter and kidnap at an earlier hearing. He will serve half his sentence before being considered for release on parole. The court was told the men were all part of a drug-dealing gang from outside the county who were trying to establish themselves in the city. They offered Mr Pass free drugs in exchange for using his flat as a base. The gang took revenge by attacking Mr Pass after his friends had broken into the flat and stolen their drugs. Mr Pass's mother Josephine said: "I feel both angry towards the men who took Paul from me and great sadness for their mothers. "They have not only taken Paul's life, they have taken mine away as well because I feel like I have died."	Two teenage drug dealers who murdered a man in a revenge attack have been jailed.
Just as the fighting for Mosul moved from east to west over the course of many months, the Iraqi military is now moving westwards towards the Syrian border. Although much smaller in size, Tal Afar has been a so-called Islamic State (IS) stronghold that the jihadist group has used as a strategic "base" since 2014. And Tal Afar has had ruthless rulers before - between late 2004 and early 2006, the city was controlled by al-Qaeda in Iraq, a precursor to IS. Before it fell to IS, the city's population of 200,000 was predominantly ethnic Turkmen, a Turkic people who have their own language and customs. The majority were also Sunni Muslims. Tal Afar's residents are not viewed as helpless victims by many in the region; for a relatively small population, security sources say a disproportionate number of men from the city filled the ranks of IS as commanders, judges and members of their vicious religious police. The battle for Tal Afar could also escalate tensions between Iraq, its ethnic Kurdish minority, Turkey and Syria. Turkey refuses to close or move its military base near Mosul, claiming it could be needed to protect Iraqi Turkmen as well as the Turkish border. The mere idea of Turkish military action on Iraqi soil has been enough to cause many, from Washington to Baghdad, to lose sleep. Kurdish leaders in Irbil are also keeping their eyes wide open as well - juggling the real or perceived threats from Sunni Arab insurgents, Turkish forces and an ever-growing number of Shia Arab militiamen. Tal Afar is a two hour drive from the Turkish border, and the main road from Mosul to Syria runs through the city. It is, in many ways, the perfect location - and the right time - for a perfect storm. The military assault on Tal Afar might seem clear cut, but the combination of forces involved invites complications on the ground. Approximately 40,000 troops are taking part in the fighting - three Iraqi Army divisions, Iraqi and US-led coalition special forces personnel, as well as "government-backed" paramilitary fighters from the Popular Mobilisation (Hashd al-Shaabi). The Popular Mobilisation is an umbrella organisation under whose banner are militias like Kataib Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades), Moqtada al-Sadr's Saraya al-Salam - the current incarnation of the Mehdi Army - and the Badr Organisation. The Popular Mobilisation's ranks also include fighters from Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a group trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force that has been accused of a number of kidnappings and attacks in Iraq. The factions in the Popular Mobilisation are predominantly Shia and many are backed and funded by Iran. When you speak to them, many of their fighters do not try to hide their deep-seated disdain for Iraqi's Sunni population. Regardless of fears, internally and internationally, about the size and ultimate intentions of the Popular Mobilisation, it is not going away any time soon. It is needed, many argue. Once Tal Afar has been recaptured, this menagerie of forces will face a tougher operation on a wider scale that could last for months. A case can be made that the number of ground troops available to take part in it will be as important as their weaponry and air support. About 290km (180 miles) south-west of Mosul, IS also holds a string of towns along the Iraqi part of the River Euphrates in Anbar province. These villages are known collectively as "al-Qaim", and they are connected by the Euphrates to the last IS stronghold in Syria - Deir al-Zour province. Deir al-Zour is now the heart of the "caliphate" proclaimed by IS three years ago. Accurate figures are hard to come by, but there are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 IS fighters on the Iraqi and Syrian sides of the Euphrates valley. Simply pushing the IS extremists over the Syrian border from Iraq will not be enough - and is likely to add to the problem of IS in Syria - but there is little more than inaudible rumblings about how Iraqi forces will maintain security once they have retaken al-Qaim. One solution may be to leave the Popular Mobilisation in the area as a substitute police force, because it has enough manpower and will need a new task, and also because Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has spoken out against disbanding them. In this scenario, Iraqi border security would be handled by forces that are heavily involved with Iran, yet backed by the government in Baghdad - which in turn, is backed by the US government and other powers. Iraqi regular forces, as they work their way back to Baghdad, will have another problem to deal with; a large pocket of IS territory in the middle of the country that has been contained primarily for three years by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The fight for the city of Hawija may be as deadly as any so far, as it is a cut-off viper's nest. The IS fighters holding it truly have nowhere to run, should they try. The minute the smoke clears from Hawija, the Iraqi military will be looking across the battlefield at the Peshmerga. They distrust each other with equal fervour, and the only thing they have agreed on is need to the defeat IS.	Tal Afar, about 55km (35 miles) to the west of Mosul, was always going to be next on the "to do" list for Iraqi forces.
The device was stolen during the band's concert at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on 25 May. Northumbria Police found the phones at a house in Whitley Bay hours later after using a GPS locator app to find it. A 25-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of theft. Det Insp Dave Swinburn said the force advised concert goers to be "extra vigilant" and recommended smartphone owners install tracking software on their devices.	An iPhone stolen at a Foo Fighters gig led to the discovery of more than 30 missing mobiles after police used a tracker app to locate it.
Governor Rick Scott issued the executive order in four counties after samples taken from the St Lucie River tested positive for toxins. The green slime appeared when polluted water was discharged from Lake Okeechobee to prevent flooding. The toxic algae can be harmful to plants, animals and humans. The US Army Corps of Engineers began discharging freshwater from the lake more than two weeks ago. Lake Okeechobee, the largest freshwater body in the state, is contaminated with runoff that includes human waste, animal feed and fertiliser. The process sent millions of gallons of the nutrient-heavy water into the river and triggered the growth of blue-green algae on some of Florida's southern rivers and beaches. Samples taken in the river near Palm City and Stuart tested positive for hazardous levels of toxins. If ingested, the toxic algae could cause nausea and vomiting and rash or hay fever if touched or inhaled. Beaches along Florida's Treasure Coast were closed last week in response to the expansion of the green sludge. Though many of the beaches have reopened, officials recommend that people stay away from the hazardous waterways. Governor Scott blamed the polluted waters on water storage limitations and the federal government. "Florida's waterways, wildlife and families have been severely impacted by the inaction and negligence of the federal government not making the needed repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike and Florida can no longer afford to wait," Scott said. Florida Senator Marco Rubio on Friday called on President Barack Obama to declare a federal state of emergency and to release funds to help businesses affected by the algae. Mr Rubio and Senator Bill Nelson have also urged the US Army Corps of Engineers to stop the flow of water between the river and Lake Okeechobee. The Army Corps began reducing the flow on Friday, focusing on the Caloosahatchee Estuary and the St Lucie Estuary.	Swathes of thick, algae blooms have plagued miles of Florida coastline, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency.
Scottish Labour will lay a motion at Holyrood calling for "full transparency" on the issue. Last month an official surveillance watchdog said two un-named UK forces undertook such activities. The regulator has not identified the forces but it has been claimed that Police Scotland is one of them. The Sunday Herald newspaper claimed the force's Counter Corruption Unit used spying powers to uncover a journalist's sources without getting judicial approval. The Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office said it was investigating possible breaches of the code of practice at two forces but would not name them while its inquiry was ongoing. Police Scotland has refused to confirm or deny it is under investigation. The Scottish government says obtaining communications data is a matter reserved to the UK government. But a motion from Scottish Labour calls for "full transparency" from Scottish ministers over what they knew about the allegations. Labour's justice spokesman Hugh Henry told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: "We are asking the Scottish government what they know. We are asking Police Scotland what they know. "If it's true, we cannot have a police force breaking the rules yet no-one is told and no-one can hold them to account. "Let's get the facts on the table. Either tell us they did it or tell us they didn't." Mr Henry said some requests for police surveillance did come before Scottish ministers for approval. "I remember that when I was justice minister requests for phone tapping regularly came to the justice minister and sometimes to the first minister. So it can happen. "That's not the point. If Police Scotland has been breaking the rules, then Police Scotland is responsible to the Scottish government and the Scottish Parliament." Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote to David Cameron seeking assurances that the UK's intelligence agencies were not spying on MSPs. It followed reports that a ban on the tapping of politicians' phones by GCHQ was no longer being applied to members of the devolved parliaments.	Scottish ministers are being asked to clarify whether Police Scotland "spied" on journalists and their sources.
Media playback is not supported on this device Bottom side United's first win in Perth in four years, and Kilmarnock's draw away to Partick Thistle, means the gap between them is down to five points. "It was a wonderful effort. With 10 men, that spirit and character was there again," said the Finn. "I can't praise the boys enough. They've got real mental toughness." Media playback is not supported on this device Ryan Dow had put United into a deserved lead midway through the first half. However, Saints came back into the match and when Coll Donaldson was sent off for denying Chris Kane an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the visiting fans may have feared another damaging day in their bid to avoid automatic relegation. St Johnstone midfielder Murray Davidson hit the crossbar as the home side pressed for an equaliser but United held firm. "We still have a long way to go but that was a small step towards it," continued Paatelainen. "The mood is positive. Killie will pick up points so we need to be strong. They have a quality manager, they have fantastic players in every department, but days like this will help our chances of survival and that's what we hang on to. "I'm really pleased with everybody's effort." Saints manager Tommy Wright was frustrated at his team's lack of bite in the first quarter of the match. "Up until they scored we didn't compete well enough, didn't make enough tackles, didn't win enough first headers or second headers," he lamented. "I thought we got a slap in the face with the goal and we were much better after that. Probably they've defended well enough overall to win the game. "When you give a team something to hold on to, even with 10 men, it makes it really difficult." Alan Mannus had made two impressive saves prior to the United goal but he will have been disappointed to have allowed Dow's shot past him. "I think in the build-up to the goal we should have done better," said Wright. "We dropped too deep and we should have dealt with the cross better. He got a free contact inside the box. "Because Alan was on the move, it hit the underside of his body and squirmed over the line."	Mixu Paatelainen praised his Dundee United players' resolve as they beat St Johnstone 1-0, despite being reduced to 10 men for the last 30 minutes.
15 September 2016 Last updated at 12:38 BST The facility, inside the old Granada studios building, is being used by a new generation of musicians to make music videos for the internet. The studio was formerly used by bands to record tracks they could mime to on television, with the theme tune for the Brideshead Revisited series among the pieces recorded there. Clare Fallon reports for BBC North West Tonight.	A former Manchester recording studio once used by bands including Joy Division and the Sex Pistols has been brought back into use.
Mr Evans joined the civil service in 2010 and is currently deputy permanent secretary to the Welsh Government. He will succeed Ian Jones in the role from October. S4C's chairman Huw Jones said Mr Evans was a "highly respected leader". Mr Evans was educated at Ysgol Penweddig, Aberystwyth. He graduated in economics at Swansea University. He was director of Business in the Community Wales, from 2008 and 2010, and a member of the Welsh Language Board from 2005 and 2010.	Owen Evans has been appointed as the new chief executive of Welsh language television broadcaster S4C.
Reyaad Khan, 21, died in an RAF drone strike targeting Islamic State militants in Syria last August. David Cameron told MPs on Tuesday the attack was "necessary and proportionate" to protect the UK. Ms Harman said such action outside a war zone was a "new departure" and needed to be "properly accountable". In September, the prime minister announced that Khan and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen, had been killed by a UK drone strike in Syria. MPs have since voted to authorise UK air strikes in the war-torn country. Questioned by MPs on the Commons Liaison committee on Tuesday, Mr Cameron defended the drone attack which killed Khan and Amin as "necessary and proportionate". He said the UK was currently engaged in an operation against a terrorist group that intends to "blow up, kill and maim our citizens". Ms Harman, a member of the committee, told BBC Radio Wales on Wednesday she was concerned at the lack of oversight of the operation. "If you're a member of the armed forces, you kill somebody in a military situation, that is legal and defensible and because you're in an armed conflict situation," she said. "But where we were in Syria, where Reyaad Khan was targeted and killed, we were not actually in a war conflict situation there. "It was just a targeted, what's called extra-judicial killing." She added: "The idea of killing somebody in an area where the security services have targeted them and military carries out the killing, that is a new departure. "The Americans have done it for quite a long time but we've not done it before. "If the police kill somebody in the line of duty, here in this country, it's automatically referred to the independent police and crime commissioner, not because there's an automatic assumption they've done something wrong. "With the taking of a life you must make absolutely sure that it was the right person, that the evidence was sufficient, that they did it in such a way that it didn't kill innocent bystanders and that has to be looked at afterwards."	Labour's former acting leader Harriet Harman has questioned whether the "extra-judicial killing" of a Cardiff jihadist can be properly justified.
The 27-year-old dominated from the start, flooring his opponent in the 10th round and winning 120-108, 119-108 and 117-110 on the judges' scorecards. The belt could only be won by Yafai after the Panamanian was stripped of it when he failed to make the weight. Unbeaten in 21 professional fights, Yafai previously held the Commonwealth and British super-flyweight belts. The Birmingham fighter also won a silver medal at the 2010 European Championships during his amateur career. "It's unbelievable, it's going to take a while to sink in," he said. "I knew I was going to do it, it was just a matter of how. I just did what I needed to do. "I can't wait to headline in Birmingham as a world champion. My hands are a bit sore so I might be out for a little bit, but the second I can get in the gym I will be back working and getting ready to defend this belt." The fight was part of a packed undercard as Britain's Anthony Joshua retained his IBF world heavyweight championship by knocking out American Eric Molina. Bury's Scott Quigg won his first fight since losing to Carl Frampton in February, and his first as a featherweight, outpointing Mexico's Jose Cayetano. Former super-bantamweight world champion Quigg, 28, had his jaw broken by Frampton but showed no signs of frailty on his return to the ring. Cayetano, himself fighting at 126lb for the first time, was unmoved by most of his opponent's punches until the end of the eighth round, when he began to wilt. And Quigg finished his rival off with a flashing left-right combination at close quarters, the referee calling a halt to proceedings with Cayetano on the deck. Quigg has plenty of options at featherweight. Frampton moved up and claimed the WBA featherweight title in July, Welshman Lee Selby is the IBF title-holder and Leeds' Josh Warrington is also in the hunt for a world title. Liverpool's Callum Smith stayed on course for a world title shot with a brutal 10th-round knockout of game Lancastrian Luke Blackledge. Referee Steve Gray could have stopped the fight earlier but allowed the one-sided battering to continue until Blackledge was knocked unconscious. There were an anxious few minutes as a prone Blackledge was administered oxygen before he gingerly, and mercifully, made it back to his feet. Smith, 26, successfully defended his British title for the first time and remained unbeaten in 22 pro fights, with 17 knockouts. He is ranked number one by the WBC but Sweden's Badou Jack is defending that belt against Britain's IBF champion James DeGale in January. In a thrilling light-heavyweight contest, Frank Buglioni stopped Hosea Burton in the 12th and final round to secure the British title. Manchester's Burton, 28, built an early lead behind his jab and some ramrod right hands, and the challenger's face was a bloody mess by the middle rounds. However, the Londoner's punches started to have an effect down the stretch and Burton went down under a barrage in the 11th. Midway through the 12th, Burton was stunned by a right to the temple before going down again. He clambered to his feet but the referee called things off after another assault by Buglioni, with a minute and four seconds remaining. Buglioni, 27, improves to 19 wins (15 KOs) and two defeats from 22 pro fights and could be rewarded with a second shot at a world title. Welterweight Conor Benn, son of British legend Nigel, made it six wins out of six with a first-round knockout of Manchester's Steven Backhouse. Find out how to get into boxing with our special guide.	Britain's Kal Yafai won the WBA super-flyweight title with a unanimous decision over Luis Concepcion.
Four women were celebrating on the River Dart, Devon, on Saturday when the vessel became stuck in mud as the tide went out. An RNLI spokesperson said the party were were travelling to Dartmouth when they got into difficulty. The spokesman said the group were "cold but otherwise unhurt". Posting on the Dart RNLI Lifeboat Facebook page the crew said: "They came back to the lifeboat station for a warm drink and to meet and thank the lifeboat crew. "The girls were on a hen party and the irony is that the bride to be had requested a 'no-fuss and low-key day'. "The hens who had arranged the day thought an afternoon afloat on the beautiful River Dart would set the mood for dinner in Dartmouth in the evening. "Best laid plans and all of that. I don't think they will ever forget the hen party."	A bride-to-be who wanted a "no-fuss and low-key" hen party had to be rescued by the RNLI after their hire boat ran aground in a river.
K Prithika Yashini, who was born male but underwent gender reassignment surgery, applied to become a police sub-inspector in the southern state. But the state police board did not recognise a third gender, leading her to pursue a legal case against it. A court in Chennai (Madras) has now ruled in her favour. "I'm excited," Prithika was quoted as saying by India's NDTV network. "It's a new beginning for the entire transgender community." A ruling by two judges in Chennai's high court said: "The social impact of such recruitment cannot be lost sight of, as it would give strength to the case of transgenders. "Yashini must reach the finish line, and not be stopped and disqualified in the middle." India's supreme court recognised transgender people as a third gender last April, five years after the electoral commission added the category to ballot forms. The ruling meant the government had to provide transgender people with quotas in jobs and education in line with other minorities, as well as key amenities. There are an estimated two million transgender people in India. While the Times of India reports that Tamil Nadu police already have three transgender constables on their books, reports in other Indian media said Prithika will become the first officer in the country. Prithika was born Pradeep Kumar and left her parents' home before completing a computer studies course and undergoing surgery. She had wanted to be a police officer since being a child, Indian media said. The court also ruled that the result of a police physical test, which Prithika failed after being a second late in a 100-metre dash, was not valid.	The Indian state of Tamil Nadu is to hire the country's first transgender police officer after a court cleared hurdles that faced one applicant.
A university researcher sent 1,500 identical CVs to German firms - except that some bore the name Meryem Ozturk and others the name Sandra Bauer. In 18.8% of cases Sandra Bauer was invited for interview, whereas the figure for Meryem was just 13.5%. When the photo of Meryem showed her in a headscarf only 4.2% invited her. The study was published by the Institute for the Study of Labour, in Bonn. The researcher was Doris Weichselbaumer from the University of Linz, in Austria. The findings are especially significant in light of Germany's current efforts to integrate record numbers of Muslim migrants, many of them refugees from the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. More than a million asylum seekers reached Germany last year, and there has been a backlash from nationalist groups, especially Pegida and Alternative for Germany (AfD). With an estimated three million people of Turkish origin, Germany is home to the largest Turkish diaspora. In her study, Ms Weichselbaumer said that "a very modern binding of the headscarf was chosen to signal that the applicant was a young, modern woman who could easily fit into a secular environment". It is normal in Germany to attach a photo to a job application, she pointed out. The result of the experiment "implies that the candidate with the headscarf had to send 4.5 times as many applications as an identical applicant with a German name and no headscarf to receive the same number of callbacks for interview", she said. Discrimination appeared to intensify when the job required a higher skill level. When Ms Ozturk in a headscarf was applying for a secretarial job she had to send off 3.5 times more applications than Ms Bauer. For the post of chief accountant Ms Ozturk had to make 7.6 times more applications. Ms Weichselbaumer has found similar levels of discrimination in Austria. A female Nigerian job applicant was only half as successful as an Austrian woman in getting invitations to interview, her research showed in 2013. German restaurant in Islamic veil row Restaurant 'turns away Muslim women'	An experiment in Germany has found evidence of job discrimination against women with Turkish names - and even more if they wear an Islamic headscarf.
It has announced changes to the heavily criticised and regularly overspent Cancer Drugs Fund, which pays for drugs the NHS has deemed unaffordable. The new system will start in July 2016 and have a fixed budget of Â£340m. No patients receiving drugs on the old Cancer Drugs Fund will have their medication stopped. At present, the CDF can choose to pay for innovative drugs the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has rejected for widespread use on the NHS. But under the new system, NICE will make all the decisions. By the time a drug comes on to the market, NICE will give it a yes, no or maybe rating. Those given the go-ahead will be routinely offered across the NHS while those given a maybe rating can be considered for the CDF. However, there will be "clear entry and exit criteria" to ensure money is spent on only the best breakthrough drugs. Bruce Keogh, medical director at NHS England, said: "Improving cancer care is an absolute priority for NHS England... that is dependent on access to treatments. "[The CDF] will provide faster access for patients, I think that's really important, and I think it will bring clarity to which drugs are the most effective sooner than we know at the moment." The fund, which was established in 2011 and covers England, has seen its costs rise to Â£340m in 2015-16 from an initial annual budget of Â£200m. An NHS official said: "Drug companies will need to price their drugs responsibly, and we make no apology for maintaining the pressure on this point on behalf of the public. "Companies keen to work with the NHS for patients will get a new fast-track route to NHS funding for promising new drugs, backed by a speeded up and more transparent NICE assessment process." Dr Paul Catchpole, from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: "If cancer medicines go through more or less exactly the same NICE appraisal process that was in place five years ago - which necessitated the setting up of the CDF in the first place - we will largely get the same answers as before - the majority of medicines will be turned down. "Without substantial changes the ABPI estimates that under the proposals two thirds of existing CDF medicines are likely to no longer be available to NHS patients by the end of the year." Target Ovarian Cancer chief executive Annwen Jones said: "Important questions remain unanswered with this proposal. "The Cancer Drugs Fund must retain the power to make a real difference to people's lives in the face of budget cuts." Follow James on Twitter.	Cancer patients have been promised faster access to innovative medicines by NHS England.
HM Revenue and Customs said there were 13m new accounts opened in 2014-15, down from 13.5m the year before. The figure, the lowest since 2004-05, will be disappointing for the Treasury, which is trying to encourage more people to save. It comes in spite of an increase in the amount savers can put in to an Isa. In July last year the maximum subscription amount was increased to £15,000 for both cash and stocks-and-shares Isas. The current limit is £15,240. The accounts are free of both Income and Capital Gains Tax. One reason for the fall may be that savings rates have been so low that being tax-free offers little extra advantage. Indeed, a typical one year fixed-rate cash Isa offers a 1.75% return, while some one year savings bonds offer as much as 2%. However Junior Isas, for those under 18, did prove more popular. In 2014-15 there were 510,000 new accounts opened, up from 432,000 the year before. Of savings already in Isas, 80% is held in cash, and 20% is in stocks and shares, according to the HM Revenue and Customs. The average investment is £6,064.	The number of adults taking out Individual Savings Accounts (Isa) has fallen to its lowest level for ten years, according to official figures.
The former England captain was appointed until the end of the season in April but failed to pick up a point. Granada will finish bottom of La Liga and Adams said: "This season has been a disaster, we must not make the same mistakes. "The main error has been signings. The owner is aware that he has made many mistakes, but this is a long project." Adams' immediate future is unclear. He has insisted that he will not stay on as coach but has been working at the Spanish club as a consultant since November and is vice-president of the company owned by Granada's club president. Granada scored three goals in his seven-match reign. At the top of the table, Real Madrid are three points ahead of nearest rivals Barcelona. Real travel to 11th-placed Malaga while Barca are at home to ninth-placed Eibar in Sunday's final games of the season. Match ends, Granada CF 1, Espanyol 2.

In there, they can read books, watch television and play computer games. They have a kettle, a sink, a safe and most have a toilet. The restriction of their liberty is the punishment for their crimes - not their lifestyle inside prison, according to residential officer Kerry Payne. "Prison isn't a place for punishment anymore," she says. "It's for somebody who's done something wrong to give them that time out to change their life because they don't get that stop-gap. "Everything just keeps going till it ends up a bigger and bigger problem." Here, some prisoners describe their life behind bars. James, 27, has been in and out of prison since he was 18 - he's served time in Polmont, Barlinnie and Kilmarnock, as well as Dumfries. Outside, he is a joiner. While he is inside, he is a "hall passman" - responsible for cleaning part of the prison and for which he is paid Â£10 a week. His cell is a cramped space with room for little more than a bed, a sink and a toilet. Prisoners are also provided with a safe with a lock that staff can override during inspections. James's room is decorated with posters; he has a stereo and he pays Â£1 a week for a television. "It's tiny, but it's mine," he says. Jason is just over half way through a 13-month sentence at HMP Dumfries. The 38-year-old has lost count of the number of times he has been locked up since he was remanded for a week when he was 14 years old. "It's become a bit of a revolving door for me," he says. Does prison help him? "No, no. I think you've got to help yourself. Prison doesn't help me, no. "I suppose over all the years, I've started to think a lot more. I'm getting older now so I'm starting to think a lot more about changing or certainly not doing the same things over and over again but that's taken a long time." So will this be his last prison sentence?  "That's my idea, yeah." He is taking art lessons in prison - he enjoys it but he is unlikely to continue his hobby on the outside. "There's a lot of things I need to address first," he says. Does he enjoy being in prison? "No, definitely not." He'd rather have his freedom? "Yeah, absolutely." Ryan, a former police officer, has 12 weeks left to serve of his sentence. He served the first three weeks of his sentence at HMP Addiewell in West Lothian - the local prison for the 29-year-old from Lanarkshire. "I was kept in isolation from the general population just because of the fact that everyone in the prison would have known me because I probably put a few of them in there," he says. He was "terrified" of moving to Dumfries, away from his family, but he says staff "couldn't have been more helpful". During his sentence he has trained as an industrial cleaner. "I really enjoy the cleaning, to be fair. You're always kept busy, there's always something to do. And I take pride in it. I like to make sure the place is clean and it is presentable." He added: "It's funny. I wouldn't say anyone enjoys being in here, that would be sort of masochistic. But I think having something to do, having a purpose, having something to work at does sort of make the days go quicker. "But to the same effect, getting my visits at the weekend, it makes it a lot better."	Prisoners spend up to 15 hours a day locked in their cells at HMP Dumfries.
The Northern Irish racer posted a lap of 123.650mph on his Classic Suzuki XR69 - in the best conditions of the week so far. Michael Rutter, Ivan Lintin and Dean Harrison and James Hillier all posted laps in excess of 122mph. Practice will continue on Thursday, with the start of racing on Saturday. Bruce Anstey completed his first practice lap of the week (113.776mph) in the Lightweight class to sit just one second off Ian Lougher's fastest lap. Following a red flag incident at Creg ny Baa and a short delay, Conor Cummins posted the quickest lap of the Classic TT session (107.199mph). Dunlop also topped the Junior Classic timesheets with a lap of 102.082mph. Isle of Man rider Andrew Dudgeon continued to set the pace in Manx Grand Prix qualification, the Ramsey man posting a time of 117.824mph on the GSX-R Suzuki he will ride in both the Junior and Senior MGP races. Fellow Manx rider Michael Evans topped the MGP Newcomers A leaderboard with 112.591mph. Due to a lack of practice time, Manx Grand Prix competitors will have practice on Thursday.

Jamie Spendiff's attack on Craig Logie, who was out with friends on a stag night, was captured on CCTV. Spendiff took part in a further assault on other men with a co-accused after killing the married 36-year-old last August. Spendiff, 26, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing in July. In CCTV footage shown to the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr Logie could be seen lying motionless on the ground after the assault. Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court: "Witnesses speak to hearing the sound of a crack as the deceased's head hit the ground and he did not move thereafter." The construction manager suffered a brain injury and fracture to the back of his head following the attack at Friars Street on 7 August. Spendiff, of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, admitted assaulting and killing Mr Logie by punching him on the head causing him to fall to the ground where he struck his head. He also pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace along with Shaun McCarthy by conducting themselves in a disorderly manner and fighting with others. Both also pled guilty to assaulting Paul Stubberfield and Stuart McKee in a taxi in Friars Street. The court heard that Spendiff and McCarthy had gone out drinking for the evening after working together as technicians on wind turbines. Mr Brown said that everyone appeared to be in good spirits, but a member of the stag party and another drinker then became involved in a heated argument. After patrons left the pub, a general melee broke out which ended with the fatal blow to Mr Logie. Mr Brown said: "Spendiff punched the deceased, who again had his arms up and out to the side, once on the face with force causing him to collapse to the ground. "He swung another punch at the deceased as he fell but missed. "With the deceased now on the ground Spendiff initially moved away before returning and danced round the deceased, at all times being moved away by the accused McCarthy and at one stage a female passer-by." Mark Stewart QC, for Spendiff, said the killer had expressed his sorrow for the victim and his family. Judge Lady Stacey remanded both accused in custody, saying the culpable homicide charge had "led to tragic consequences and a man has lost his life".	A man danced around his fallen victim after delivering a fatal blow during a street attack in Stirling, a court heard.
The 27-year-old Scot, who is back at number four in the world after dropping down the rankings following back surgery, is to marry girlfriend Kim Sears in April. Murray is as relaxed about that as he has been this week at the ATP event in Indian Wells, where he has progressed to the quarter-finals. He loosened up in more ways than one as he chatted to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller and BBC Scotland's Kheredine Idessane in the commentary box... "It is three weeks on Saturday, that's all I know. Tennis players aren't normally very good with dates. "We just know it is the Indian Wells week or the Monte Carlo week or whatever. So I know it is the weekend before Monte Carlo and the weekend after Miami. "We will probably do the honeymoon later in the year, probably in the off-season. I am not sure where we're going to go yet, but there's a few ideas. "I am actually not nervous about getting married because we've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well. "So I don't think a whole lot's going to change. I kind of feel like we have been married already in terms of the way we spend our lives together and live together. "I think I will be more nervous about starting a family because that would be more life-changing, in a good way." "My brother Jamie's one. Ross Hutchins is also going to be a best man and hopefully a good friend in Barcelona [Peruvian Carlos Mier, who was Murray's room-mate at the Sanchez-Casal Academy]. "But I'm not sure yet if he [Mier] is going to be able to come. He's in Singapore just now and I'm going to try to get him over. "Kim has four bridesmaids and no maid of honour and I was saying, 'imagine you had to pick one of your four best friends you've had since you were at school'. "It is very, very difficult to choose one. She was like 'go on, pick one', but I said no. "I didn't spend a lot of time with my brother when we were 15 to 20 really, because he was training in France and I was training in Spain. "Carlos, he was my best friend during that time, which were very important years in my life, when I moved away from my family and friends. "He was the guy who was always there for me. I feel like he knows me extremely well. "My brother obviously knows me from a child - and Ross over the last six or seven years. We've become extremely close and been through a lot together as well. "Picking one was a very difficult thing to do because I had three guys that were clearly my three best friends and I would like all them to be involved in some way." "It looks a lot easier from up here, that's for sure. It's extremely simple. Every shot looks easy when you're watching from the commentary box, but it certainly isn't. "The one thing I think I would do as a commentator is give more credit to the players, because I have a good idea how tricky the conditions are here. But I don't think I have the voice to be a good broadcaster."	It is a big year for Andy Murray - and not only because he is looking to add to his two Grand Slam titles.
Defending champion Spieth, 22, had a quadruple-bogey seven on the par-three 12th as Danny Willett became the first Englishman since Faldo in 1996 to win. The American had become the first man to lead the Masters for seven straight rounds going into the final day. "This will scar him. This will damage him for a while," said Faldo, who also won three Open Championships. "We're all in shock with what happened to Jordan," added Faldo, who won his third and final Green Jacket in similar circumstances to Willett when Greg Norman blew a six-shot lead in 1996. "In '96 you got the sense that Greg was struggling, but it was bit by bit. What happened to Jordan was so sudden, just bam. It was 10 minutes of golf. That's the harshness of it." Spieth, who had carded four successive birdies to open a five-shot lead with nine holes to play, has said he hopes he "never again experiences" a similar collapse of form.	Jordan Spieth will be "scarred" by his capitulation at the Masters on Sunday, says three-time winner Sir Nick Faldo.
Tries from Dan Leavy and Luke McGrath - either side of a brilliant breakaway by the Blues' Tomos Williams - put the hosts 14-7 ahead at half-time. The visitors fought back to lead 21-17 after counter-attacking scores from Williams and Sion Bennett. But Ross Molony plunged over from close to give Leinster a seventh successive league win. Leo Cullen's men are now six points clear at the Pro12 summit, with second-placed Ospreys away against Treviso later on Saturday. Defeat for the Blues, meanwhile, sees them stay in eighth place. Media playback is not supported on this device Glorious sunshine and a pristine pitch made for perfect conditions at the RDS, encouraging both teams to play adventurous, running rugby. Leinster led after just four minutes as flanker Leavy collected a neat grubber kick from centre Noel Reid to touch down in the corner. Their lead did not last long as the visitors counter-attacked at pace, with captain Blaine Scully and Rey Lee-Lo offloading sharply before Williams cantered over. The Blues were threatening whenever their backs got their hands on the ball but their pack struggled against the ballast of Leinster's forwards, whose powerful carries paved the way for scrum-half McGrath to dive through a crowd of bodies and touch down. The visitors fought back in spectacular fashion, with Williams finishing after a fine run from hooker Kristian Dacey, before replacement back-rower Bennett showed a similarly impressive turn of pace to run in from 40 yards and put the Blues 21-17 ahead. It was the Leinster pack, however, who had the final say, with lock Molony emerging at the bottom of a pile of bodies to score the decisive try.

Media playback is not supported on this device With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters. Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality. Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 to win the Masters and don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit. In a documentary - When Danny Won The Masters, to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National. Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course. The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee... Danny: We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan. Jonny: We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: "We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters." We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in. Danny: I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par. Danny: Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead. The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said, 'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner. Jonny: Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week. Danny: I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10. Danny: I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11. Jonny: It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us. Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5 Danny: The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us. Jonny: Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous. Danny: I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said 'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery. Media playback is not supported on this device Jonny: I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard. Danny: It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one. Jonny: That's when things got a little bit more interesting. Danny: I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying 'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking 'this is what you practise for'. I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead. Jonny: There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot. Media playback is not supported on this device Danny: I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet. Jonny: I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny 'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused. Danny: We rolled in our birdie putt. Jonny: The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt. Danny: Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers. Jonny: On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row. Danny: I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip. Jonny: I was thinking 'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought 'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought 'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot! Danny: I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is. Danny: We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood. Jonny: My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green. Danny: He said: 'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.' Jonny: Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand. Danny: There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees. Jonny: That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger. Danny: I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable. Jonny: There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him: 'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.' Danny: I'd done 80% of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before. Jonny: The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying 'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more. Danny: It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny: The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters. Danny: My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting. Jonny: I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off. Danny: We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does. Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny: You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny: I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him. Danny: I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true. Danny: Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now. Jonny: We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny: When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really.	We've all done it.
It's also making an impact on education, with plans to put 3D printers into schools in the United Kingdom and the United States. These technologies hold massive potential for young people both in and out of school. Schools are getting interested in this "rapid prototyping" technology. But there are still the usual barriers - access, funding, teacher awareness and confidence. However, many learners are getting 3D design whether or not their schools are ready. One of the most illuminating advocates is a 14-year-old schoolgirl from Manchester in the UK. Amy Mather won the European Commission's first European Digital Girl of the Year Award last year. The schoolgirl has presented her ideas in front of expert audiences, including Campus Party at London's O2 Arena, Wired Next Generation and the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts (RSA). Amy got involved in coding and later 3D design after attending the Manchester Science Festival when she was 11. But the key inspiration for her work has been what is loosely termed the "digital maker" movement, a global drive to encourage young people to be creative with technology. This includes support from Fab Lab in Manchester. "Fab lab" stands for a "fabrication laboratory", where digital ideas are turned into products and prototypes. The Fab Lab holds open days for the public and these allowed Amy to use software and hardware not available in her school, such as 3D printers and laser cutters. She uses 3D design and manufacturing techniques for her school GCSE product design coursework. "There are people always on hand with experience, people who live and breathe it," she says. "And there is a great community spirit so it's really, really easy to learn there and to go at your own pace and experiment." Manchester's Fab Lab was the first of nine in the UK, with the number expected to rise to 30 within three years. They are part of a global project which started in the US, growing from a university course, "How To Make (Almost) Anything", created by Professor Neil Gershenfeld, director of the Centre for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US. Within eight years of publishing his seminal book, Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop - from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication, there are now around 200 Fab Labs in more than 40 countries. Prof Gershenfeld's view is that the digital revolution has already happened and that we are in process of seeing it put into practice. The challenge for Fab Labs, he says, is to harness the "inventive power of the world" and to apply it to "design and produce solutions to local problems". The Fab Labs serve both education and business as places where interested parties can come together to work with the technology. And Prof Gershenfeld is vocal in resisting the media's hyping of 3D printing. Amy Mather reflects that "get on with it" attitude. It's also a phrase that comes up regularly in conversation with her. She's also not the kind of person to wait until she can get her hands on the most up-to-date technology. Why wait for access to a 3D printer if you can use other methods for construction? She describes how she used 3D design software to make her own flat-pack version of a stool - and then used a machine to cut out the pieces so that she could assemble the final product. She has used laser cutter technology to make cases for the computers she uses for her projects and has even used a 3D printer to design a vacuum-formed chocolate mould for a friend's birthday party. Unfortunately the edges were too sharp, she concedes. "But I will try again with thicker, food-safe plastic." "What I really like is that you can make very intricate designs," she adds. "Most of the software is very easy to use, very intuitive. With just a couple of online tutorials, it's really easy to learn how to get around it." There are free, open-source systems which allow pupils to cut from a flat sheet and then assemble a 3D model. This improved ease of use and lower pricing are also highlighted by Martin Stevens and his partner Trupti Patel whose company, It Is 3D, has pioneered work with schools in the UK. Entry-level printers have moved on from the kits that have been adopted by more confident teachers with advanced students, he says. And there are now plug-and-play machines that work "out of the box", with the kind of reliability and robustness that schools need. Experience has made Martin Stevens wary of government schemes that often get hardware into schools where it remains unused, so his priority has been to create a full range of online video support materials to familiarise learners and teachers. Some students are showing extraordinary independence. Pieter Scholtz and Gerhard de Clercq, 15-year-old students at Menlopark High School in Pretoria, South Africa, built their own 3D printer with a mobile phone app. It is their contribution to making rapid prototyping mobile for African schools where PCs are in short supply. "We can recycle cola and soft drinks bottles to make 3D printing filament as our raw material for our machine," they say. "We can even use that material to 3D print a prosthetic arm." Amy Mather is keeping a close eye on new developments. She's currently taken with the notion of freehand 3D printing being offered by a new invention, the 3Doodler, which is described as "the world's first 3D printing pen". It doesn't need a computer or printer. "You put plastic rods in it and it works a bit like a glue gun," she says. "It heats up the plastic and extrudes it through its nib and you can draw 3D items with it. You can either draw it first on a flat surface and then assemble it, or you can draw straight up into the air. "It's good for quickly prototyping ideas and being creative but it's nowhere near as expensive as a 3D printer and you don't have to have the knowledge of any CAD [computer aided design] software. "You can just get on with it and do what you like, swap and change colours and things. I think that's a very useful tool." Her next ambition is trying to set up her own "Mini Maker Faire", in this case a Mini Mini Maker Faire. "We would invite under-18s and have mentors who can show them how to use technology like laser cutters, CAD software and CAM [computer aided manufacturing) machinery. "You get them to create whatever they want and at the end they put on an exhibition, showing their work to the public and how proud they are of it."	There have been dramatic headlines about 3D technology, encompassing ideas to use 3D printers to make clothes, food, firearms and the parts of a house.
Tunisia's former president Moncef Marzouki is among the campaigners. The activists said they wanted to draw attention to the blockade, which Israel says is a necessary security measure. Israel says it acted in international waters to prevent the "intended breach of the maritime blockade" imposed since 2009 against the Hamas-run territory. There was no violence as the navy searched the boat, Israel says. The activists said the vessel was carrying humanitarian aid, including medicine and solar panels. The boat intercepted on Monday is believed to be Marianne - the lead vessel of a four-strong flotilla. "In accordance with international law, the Israeli Navy advised the vessel several times to change course," the military said in a statement, the AFP news agency reports. "Following their refusal the Navy visited and searched the vessel in international waters in order to prevent their intended breach of the maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip." The vessel is currently being escorted to the port of Ashdod. The flotilla is the latest in a number of protest voyages against Israel's maritime blockade. In 2010, nine Turkish activists were killed aboard another vessel amid clashes as Israeli commandos boarded the boat. Ten Israeli soldiers were injured in the incident on the Turkish-owned ship Mavi Marmara as it attempted to breach the blockade. It caused a deep rift between Israel and Turkey, who were former allies.	The Israeli Navy has intercepted a Gaza-bound vessel sailed by pro-Palestinian activists and diverted it to an Israeli port, the military says.
An emotional Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland left the talks in Brussels, saying the EU was "not capable" of signing a trade agreement. Belgium, the only country blocking accord, needed consent from the regional parliament of Wallonia. The wide-ranging deal, seven years in the making, was to be signed next week. Speaking outside the seat of the Walloon government, Ms Freeland told reporters:  "It seems evident for me and for Canada that the European Union is not now capable of having an international accord even with a country that has values as European as Canada." She added: "Canada is disappointed, but I think it is impossible." It was unclear whether the EU would keep negotiating with Wallonia in coming days to solve the impasse. European Parliament briefing on Ceta The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, was expected to boost bilateral trade, but Wallonia sees the accord as a threat to farmers and welfare standards. The region has a strong socialist tradition. Its fears echo those of anti-globalisation activists, who say Ceta and deals like it give too much power to multinationals - power even to intimidate governments. There have also been big demonstrations in several EU countries against Ceta and the TTIP trade talks with the US. The Canada-EU trade deal was seven years in the making but it took far less time to unravel. Canada has been scrambling to keep Ceta together after the Walloon regional assembly in Belgium voted last week to reject it. The deal was completed under Canada's former Conservative government but is a major priority for the Liberals, who are under pressure to boost the country's economy. They dispatched special envoy Pierre Pettigrew, a former cabinet minister with a wealth of experience on the international trade file, to help save the flagging agreement. Federal trade minister Chrystia Freeland has met repeatedly over the past months with European leaders to shepherd it through, but with no luck. The failure to clinch the EU-Canada Ceta deal is an embarrassment for the EU. Wallonia, a region of just 3.6 million people, has all but scuppered a trade deal affecting 508 million Europeans and 36.3 million Canadians. The European Commission says this blow does not mean that Ceta is over, but it also refuses to unpick the massive text that was agreed with Canada in 2014. Any EU free trade deals with the US, China or India now look remote. Anti-globalisation groups, anxious to protect Europe's welfare and environmental standards, may feel they are winning the argument. For now, any Ceta boost for small businesses and jobs has been postponed. The failure gives us a sense of how tough the Brexit talks will be, despite the UK's current alignment with its EU partners. One very obvious lesson from this impasse is that it is going to be difficult for the European Union to implement trade and investment deals, perhaps with anyone. For the UK post-Brexit it suggests two contrasting implications. Negotiating a trade agreement that gives British exporters barrier free access to the EU's single market could be a huge challenge. For sure, there will be some important differences. For the EU, Britain is a more important export market than Canada, so some EU states will have a good deal to lose from failing to agree. But securing the agreement of all of them is unlikely to be straightforward. On the other hand, negotiating an agreement with other countries outside the EU should become easier. To put it bluntly, the British government won't need to care what the Walloon parliament, for example, thinks.	A trade deal between the EU and Canada is on the brink of collapse because a Belgian region with a population of just 3.6 million objects.
Social media videos shot in the Plaza Major showed injured fans and officers in body armour wielding batons. BBC journalist Phil Mackie confirmed police used baton charges to clear parts of the square. Earlier, Spanish police said eight Leicester fans were arrested for "causing a mess" on Tuesday night. Footage posted online showed a group of officers being targeted with missiles and fans chanting "Gibraltar is ours" in the Plaza Major, where Leicester's fans were told they could congregate. A witness told BBC 5 live: "There were a couple of people who probably antagonised the police, but then they took it out all these people here. "There were people with children, they came in with batons and there was a 70-year-old man and the kids [in the way]." Owynn Palmer-Atkin, reporting for BBC Radio Leicester, said: "There was a couple of flares that went off - blue smoke, then a bang, and that is when you heard the tone of the chanting change. "The noise of the crowd seem to quieten and then become more of a panic. "There was another bang and that is when the riot vans started charging across the square. I find it incredible a police van would travel that fast in a crowded square." BBC presenter Gary Lineker, a Leicester City fan and former Foxes player, tweeted: "Just saw the footage of some Leicester fans behaving despicably in Madrid. The few idiots ruin it for the decent majority. Sickening.." On Tuesday night, Phil Mackie said he witnessed what appeared to be an unprovoked attack on supporters. He reported seeing police charging a group of Leicester fans walking in the city centre before three were pushed to the ground, hit with batons and bundled into the back of vans. Police said six officers were also attacked in the overnight disturbances. The eight fans arrested remain in custody and will appear in court on Thursday.	Leicester City fans were involved in further clashes with Spanish police ahead of their Champions League tie against Atletico Madrid.
The doctors' union said patient care was undermined when GPs were forced to see as many as 60 patients a day. It called for more funding to allow GPs to spend at least 15 minutes with each patient. NHS England said consultation lengths were up to doctors and there were no national limits suggesting 10 minutes. However, the NHS Choices website does state that "GPs spend an average of 8-10 minutes with each patient" and advises patients to "plan ahead to make sure you cover everything you want to discuss". The BMA, which published a report on "safe working in general practice" earlier this month, called for a reorganisation and warned that GPs faced "unsustainable pressure" from increasing workload and staff shortages. The report said it was intended to "stimulate discussion" and put forward a model that could be used across the UK. Dr Nicola Hulme, a GP in Cheshire, said she found NHS England's comment about there being no national limit on appointment times "insulting". "With the high levels of demand, we have to run 10-minute appointments," she said. "To offer longer with the same number of appointments would extend our day to beyond the 12 hours we currently routinely work. "I often run late so I can deal thoroughly with my patients' issues. "Paperwork gets started routinely after 7pm. I rarely get home before 8pm, having started generally at 7.30am. "Nobody goes into medicine for an easy ride, we are all hard workers, but the intensity and the demand are now at unsafe levels." Dr Ali Alibhai, who works in central London, said GPs now had to manage so many chronic diseases such as diabetes that a consultation as short as eight minutes was "not appropriate any more for safe patient care". Dr Brian Balmer, of the BMA's GPs' committee, said that, in an ageing population, many patients had complex multiple conditions that needed longer to treat. He warned that many GPs were being forced to truncate care and deliver an "unsafe number of consultations". He said consultations should be limited to 25 a day, about the same number recommended in many other EU countries. Dr Balmer added: "We need a new approach that shakes up the way patients get their care from their local GP practice. "The consultation time needs to increase to 15 minutes with the government providing on its promised funding to make this work." Health think tank the King's Fund said its analysis showed GPs were under "huge pressure due to an increase in workload which has not been matched by a growth in funding or the workforce". It also found the average length of consultations had increased due to the rising number of older patients with more complex conditions. King's Fund chief executive Chris Ham said general practice needed "new investment to stop it falling apart", but GPs must also embrace new methods such as giving more advice by phone and email. NHS England said the length of appointments was "at the discretion of individual GP practices, based on patient need, and there are no national limits suggesting 10 minutes should be the norm". It accepted that GPs were "under pressure", and said it was "substantially increasing investment and reforming care to free up GPs to spend more time with patients". In 2013, a rule saying GP appointment slots in England must be for a minimum of 10 minutes was scrapped. One patient, John White, from Somerset, said: "I think those who get a 10-minute consultation with their GPs are lucky. "At my doctors' surgery I cannot even book an appointment to see my GP. All we are offered is to book a 'telephone triage consultation' where your doctor will call you by telephone and decide whether a face-to-face appointment is warranted. "I have had to wait in excess of two weeks for the telephone appointment." Another patient, Maggy Jackson, said: "I have a brilliant GP who sees me for as long as I need. He always runs on time too. "All I can say is if it wasn't for this practice I would be dead. They diagnosed a gangrenous hernia two years ago when I presented with horrendous pain and no appointment. I was given a full examination, morphine and was in hospital an hour later after their intervention." Nurse Liz Wright said appointment length was also an issue in nursing. "In years gone by, I had either 15 or 20-minute appointments to see my patients," she said. "This has now been cut to 10 minutes, in which to carry out triage, cervical smears, dressings, injections, contraceptive discussions and issuing of prescriptions and a whole range of ailments. "This means that in a typical 7.5-hour shift, I see up to 42 patients, well above the recommended daily amount. "In my opinion this is unsafe practice and I have decided to take early retirement."	Patients are being put at risk by GPs being forced to carry out complex consultations in 10 minutes or under, the British Medical Association says.
Matt Wilmot, 40, was found by police after reports of concern for the welfare of a man.  He was pronounced dead at the scene, in Devon Road, Luton. Affinity Water confirmed "the body of a man was found at the bottom of one of our excavations". Bedfordshire Police said Mr Wilmot's death, at about 07:15 BST on Sunday, was not being treated as suspicious. The force said it was not possible to speculate on how he died until the coroner's full report had been released. More news from Bedfordshire It is understood Mr Wilmot, a father-of-two, had been walking home from Dunstable, where he had been watching the FA Cup Final on Saturday afternoon. Mr Wilmot's partner of 24 years, Tania Banks, said: "I just can't believe that he's gone and the circumstances [in which] he's gone. "We're just angry at the situation... and how something like this could happen." The Health and Safety Executive has been informed about the incident, police said.	The body of a man has been found at the bottom of a hole dug by a water firm.
The incident at Neil McEvoy's office took place on Thursday morning. The AM said no valuables were taken but files had been "gone through". He said metal bars had been cut to access the property at Cowbridge Road East. South Wales Police said an investigation had been launched. "For a long period, there has been a concerted campaign of political harassment against me," the South Wales Central AM claimed. He said that less than 12 months ago his home had been "ransacked", with paperwork taken. Mr McEvoy said that in the early hours of Thursday "the criminals involved went through two outside doors, down a lane, removed a screwed in hard wood cover on the back window, cut through a PVC window frame and cut through metal bars to get in the window". "Once again, valuables were ignored in the office, but drawers were broken into and files gone through in the back office which wasn't alarmed. "Thankfully, they couldn't gain access to the main part of the office without tripping the alarm." "I put in place new safety procedures for staff at the end of last term, because I am aware of serious cages being rattled," he said. "Some people would like to silence us, but this intimidation has just added to our motivation." A South Wales Police spokesman said that the break-in was reported after 09:00 GMT on Thursday. He said that investigations were ongoing and that no arrests had been made. A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: "Neil McEvoy has now been the subject of two break-ins, one at home and one at his office. "Plaid Cymru is supporting him and his staff at this time and is keen that the police establish whether these intrusions are linked. "All elected representatives and their staff deserve to operate in a democratic way without fear of harassment or intimidation. "The National Assembly is working with Neil and his staff to ensure their safety and security, and we strongly urge that this continues."â€Ž	A Plaid Cymru AM has claimed he has been a victim of "political harassment" after a break-in at his constituency office in Cardiff.
Leading F1 commercial figure Zak Brown has been contacted by McLaren as the company seeks a replacement. Dennis has been told by the two parties that own 75% of McLaren Group that his contract will not be renewed for 2017. But Brown, a 44-year-old American, is also considered a potential chief commercial officer for F1's new owners. The US media group Liberty is in the process of buying a controlling interest in the sport's commercial arm from investment group CVC Capital Partners. The deal is expected to be completed early next year. Brown is of particular interest to McLaren because of his success in finding new sponsors for a number of teams on the grid in his former role as boss of the marketing agency JMI, from which he resigned in September. McLaren have not had a title sponsor since parting company with mobile phone company Vodafone at the end of 2013. Ironically, McLaren have had a major success in recent weeks in securing a new partnership deal for BP/Castrol to become their fuel and lubricant supplier. The deal has been signed but has not yet been announced. The company will replace Exxon Mobil, which has been poached by Red Bull for next season after 21 years with McLaren. That deal is expected to be announced imminently. The three names revealed by BBC Sport over the US Grand Prix weekend - ex-F1 team bosses Ross Brawn, Martin Whitmarsh and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King - remain of interest to McLaren and have been contacted by the team. But all three are now considered unlikely to take on the position. They may be unwilling to put themselves forward or it may be decided they are not the best person for the role. It is also possible Dennis, who is chairman and chief executive officer and has been in charge at McLaren for 35 years, would be replaced by two different people, as would be a more conventional company structure. Brown is friendly with all the main shareholders at McLaren, including Dennis. But BBC Sport understands that the Bahrainis and Ojjeh are now reaching out to him as they seek a new man to run the company. If McLaren can persuade him to take the role, it would be something of a coup for the team, since it has long been known that Brown has been favourite for the commercial head of F1 job at Liberty Media. Despite the ultimatum by his fellow shareholders, Dennis has been telling friends and confidants that he will decide when or if he will step down, not anyone else. But it is far from clear that he is in a position to make that decision. If his contract is not renewed, he would remain a 25% shareholder but would probably have no active role or power in running the company. Dennis will fight hard to retain his position as the head of McLaren, despite the fracturing of relationships between him on the one hand and Ojjeh and the Bahrainis on the other. He has run the company since 1981 and has become synonymous with McLaren, which he has built up into one of the sport's most successful teams, as well as launching a road-car company that sells high-end supercars. Dennis had been trying to find investment to enable him to buy a controlling shareholding in McLaren Group. He did have an agreement with Ojjeh and Mumtalakat that he could buy sufficient shares to take him over over 50% were he to find that investment. Dennis found two separate Chinese groups of investors. One was on the verge of completing a deal with Dennis before a weakening of the Chinese economy caused the arrangement to collapse. He then sourced a second group of Chinese investors and took them to Ojjeh and Mumtalkat, who refused to sell their shares because they did not want to grant Dennis so much power in the company.	A surprise new name has emerged as a potential successor to long-standing McLaren boss Ron Dennis, whose position as chairman is under threat.
Police Scotland said two men broke into the farm house near to Corsock, Castle Douglas, between 23:30 on Thursday and 01:00 on Friday. They stole items including a number of war medals, gold watches and antiques. Officers have appealed for information and said the robbers may have been "casing" the property before the raid. Det Sgt Graeme Robertson said: "I believe that whoever broke into this house knew what they were looking for - that is the medals, watches and antiques. "Thankfully the householder, a woman, who was in the house at the time, was not injured but she is very upset by what has happened." The men were described as being well spoken, with Scottish accents, of average height and build and wearing dark clothing. One of the men was wearing a balaclava and gloves. "Due to the rural location of the house and the items taken, we believe that the two men would have had to have the use of a car. "It is also entirely possible that they may have been in the area before the break in 'casing' the house so I would ask anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious behaviour around the area during this time, or anyone who may have been offered these items for sale, to contact police."	A woman has been left uninjured but very upset after two men forced their way into her home and stole valuables believed to be worth thousands.
The tourists face three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches after a 4-0 Test series defeat. The batting line-up for Sunday's first ODI in Pune is expected to be Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler. "There's a couple of wickets there for the spinners," said Swann. "We play spin horrifically on the whole." The tourists, who are without a one-day international series victory in India since 1984, have won one and lost one of their warm-up matches against India A - the defeat coming after they slipped from 116-1 to 165-6 when batting first in Mumbai. Bairstow top-scored with 64 in that second match and he disputes Swann's assertion that England will struggle with the bat. "Everyone has different methods for batting against seam and spin," said the Yorkshire wicketkeeper. "We scored a lot of runs in the Test series - posting 500 once and 400 twice. "And in these warm-ups we've scored around 300 in both matches despite the collapses, so I don't think we're far off to be honest." Swann, speaking to BBC Test Match Special, did exempt Bairstow and Root from his criticism while conceding that a limited-overs tour of India is one of the hardest assignments in world cricket. "It's not a very pleasant experience," said the 37-year-old. "I don't think I ever won there. "The teams I played in were clueless in how to cope with the noise, the intensity, the armed guards. "I remember being on the tour that ended because of the attacks in Mumbai. In a weird way, it was a relief that we could go home - we were getting hammered left, right and centre. "The crowds definitely play a part - you can't hear yourself think for three and a half hours. It envelops you. "When you get back into the changing room - it's like a day spa. There's total silence." India will be led by star batsman Virat Kohli, who replaces World Cup-winning captain MS Dhoni, in the three-match ODI series which also includes matches in Cuttack (19 January) and Kolkata (22 January). Dhoni will, however, remain in the team as a wicketkeeper-batsman, with the 35-year-old warming up for the challenge with an unbeaten 68 off 40 balls for India A in England's first warm-up game earlier in the week. Only Dhoni's fellow Indians Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh and Australia's Dean Jones have a better one-day average in home conditions against England than him. "You could sense experience dripping off MS Dhoni," said Swann. "He'd never panic, even when the required rate reached eight or nine an over. "He'd just smack 20 off an over without breaking sweat. "Over there, the grounds are tiny and the outfields are rapid. What we construed as being a big score - 270 or 280 - they'd just knock off in no time whatsoever. "Virat Kohli was born to play ODI cricket and MS Dhoni is the best finisher I've ever seen." While Swann is fearful of another series defeat for England, he is glad to see the fresh outlook that has been adopted under captain Morgan. Swann, who played at the 2011 World Cup, says he belonged to a "dinosaur" age of one-day cricket in England and says the team were "backward in their thinking" and "arrogant". It is only since a chastening early exit at the 2015 World Cup that England have adopted a more positive gameplan that has seen them twice pass 400 in 50 overs. "They've finally got all the youngsters playing who think nothing is impossible," said Swann. "The likes of Ben Stokes, Jason Roy and Alex Hales have never thought 280 was a good score. They happily think 400 is gettable. "They also have a coach who encourages aggressive cricket."	England's batsmen will continue to fail in India if they persist in playing slow bowling "horrifically", says their former off-spinner Graeme Swann.
Areas in Counties Londonderry, Antrim and Down were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland Electricity said was an equipment fault was detected at 21.40 BST.

Mooboo Bubble Tea - which sells the Taiwanese drink topped with tapioca balls - was attacked on social media and by campaign groups. A petition to demand it pay staff properly collected more than 40,000 signatures. In a statement, Mooboo said trainees would now be paid "company set levels". Emails outlining the original terms were leaked to campaign organisation 38 Degrees. Gordon Maloney from the group said it was an "outrageous way for MooBoo Bubble Tea to exploit people looking for work". He welcomed the "turnaround" but said it was "very important to us that people who have worked for the chain for free under this policy should also be recompensed". The company has branches in London, Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry, Gateshead, Hatfield, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow. Successful interview applicants were offered 40 hours training, but warned this did not guarantee a job. Mooboo said in a statement: "In view of the recent feedbacks, we are prepared to implement a new training process which all trainees will be paid according to our company set levels once the trainee has entered into our training contract." It later confirmed to campaign group Betterthanzero that all staff would be paid at least the minimum wage from "the first hour". The furore over the training contract led to other cafes being confused with the firm. Bubble Boba in Coventry "suffered vandalism to our shop, slander and abuse to our staff", it said. Directors Neil and Kristin McCoy-Ward said it was now "Mooboo's duty to set the example and follow UK regulations and pay bubble tea artists correctly for their work".	A cafe criticised for making trainees work unpaid for 40 hours, without a guaranteed job, has given in to public pressure.

Now a group of walkers is re-tracing his steps. They set off from Shrewsbury Abbey on 18 June, ending up at St Winefride's Well a week later. The walk is part of a week of events to commemorate the historic royal visit and which, it is hoped, will boost the profile of the town. "Holywell has an incredible, unique history," said Rob Owen, one of the organisers of the town's upcoming medieval festival. "Castles are ten a penny in Wales,  but there's only one St Winefride's Well." Mrs Owen is rightly proud of her town's famous landmark - St Winefride's Well has been a place of pilgrimage for more than 1,300 years and is the oldest continually venerated shrine of any British saint. According to legend, Winefride was the daughter of a 7th Century nobleman, who shunned the amorous advances of a local prince named Caradog. Furious at her rejection, Caradog beheaded her as she ran towards the safety of her uncle's church. Her severed head rolled down the hill and a powerful spring burst up from the earth at the place it came to rest. But all was not lost for Winefride - her uncle, St Beuno, placed her head back on her body and prayed and miraculously, she was restored to life. Caradog, meanwhile, met a sticky end:  cursed by St Beuno, his body melted and was swallowed up by the earth. Winefride became a nun and later, Abbess of Gwytherin in Conwy, where she died and was buried. The healing waters of her well are said to bring forth miraculous cures; believers still bathe there today and Holywell has become known as the "Lourdes of Wales". In 1138, Prior Robert of Shrewsbury moved the saint's remains to his abbey, later writing a "Life" - or biography - of Winefride, which was to prove instrumental in spreading her popularity. In medieval times, she became the saintly equivalent of a superstar. "Winefride, or Gwenfrewy as she is known in Welsh, is the only native female saint from Wales to have a substantial hagiographical dossier," says Prof Jane Cartwright, from the University of Wales Trinity St David. "She was effectively a Welsh super saint whose cult extended beyond the Welsh border, since her relics were translated to Shrewsbury. "She had two 12th Century Latin Lives and a 15th Century Welsh Life and she is one of the very few Welsh saints to make it into the Roman Martyrology. Prof Cartwright, who is editing the medieval Welsh life of St Winefride for the Cult of Saints in Wales project, which aims to publish a digital edition of some 100 medieval Welsh-language texts on saints, adds: "In a sense her cult united England and Wales and she was deemed suitable to be venerated by royalty," At least six royal visitors - including Richard I, Edward IV and James II - have come to Holywell over the centuries. By far the most famous visit was by Henry V in 1416, who, having placed himself under the spiritual protection of St Winefride before the previous year's Battle of Agincourt - where his 6,000 men faced a French army six times the size - walked from Shrewsbury to the shrine to thank her for his victory. The precise date and route of the pilgrimage is unknown; in fact the only written record of it is in Latin, in the Chronicle of Adam of Usk so re-enacting the walk to commemorate its 600th anniversary has presented a challenge. "There have been many attempts to work out the route," says walk organiser Ron Williams, from the Holywell Walkers are Welcome group. "But when you think about it, there is only one way Henry V would have come. "There weren't any roads except those the Romans had left and the Roman road comes to Llangollen from Shrewsbury, so that is most likely how he would have started off. "On top of that he would have known that there was a Cistercian Abbey at Valle Crucis, so it's logical that he came there and if you look at a map, there's a direct line between Llangollen and Holywell so all we've done is put a walking route as near to that as possible. "Of course we can't know it for sure but we think our route is more logical than those which have been put forward before. "We have a good number of people walking the whole thing but we also want people to join in for the day so we've tried to make the walks easy to start and finish," adds Mr Williams. The walkers - including one dressed as Henry V - will be welcomed into Holywell on 24 June. The following day, the "King" will immerse himself in St Winefride's well. An interdenominational service, an afternoon of talks on St Winefride and a medieval festival - complete with storytellers, jesters, archery and combat displays - are also part of the anniversary celebrations. It is hoped the events will provide what festival organiser Mrs Owen claims is a "much-needed" boost for the Flintshire town. "Holywell has been neglected," she said. "It's like an unpolished diamond, a bit rough around the edges and it needs lots of little improvements. "We want to get a much higher profile for the town with this - we want to really put it on the map." Kerry Feather, project director of  St Winefride's Well, agreed: "We want the town and the well to benefit from the attention. "We currently have around 35,000 visitors every year and we really would like to boost that number. "Some people come here for healing but others just find it a place of peace and sanctuary, somewhere to spend time, whether it's in prayer or thought, in an oasis of calm in the middle of a very busy world." The organisers of this year's pilgrimage re-enactment also want it to have a lasting legacy - they have applied for Lottery funding for the creation of a new pilgrim's trail from Shrewsbury to Holywell, complete with waymarkers. "Walking a pilgrim's trail is not just a walk, it's a different experience altogether," said Mr Williams. "I'm not religious but you're walking in places where people have walked for centuries and it gets to you. "You think, 'Why were they here, how did they get here, how did they feel?' "It's quite an emotional experience and you get a real sense of connection to the history of the places along the route."	Six centuries ago Henry V walked from Shrewsbury to Holywell in Flintshire, to give thanks for his famous victory over the French at Agincourt.
It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: "Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. "As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish." Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities. Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed. A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment. Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: "The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades. "This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government." A Scottish government spokesman said: "Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets. "The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts."	Scotland's criminal justice system punishes poorer people and makes it difficult for them to escape poverty, according to an academic study.

The characters have been revived for their first feature film in 35 years, by the creator Charles Schulz's son and grandson. Other familiar characters are also back including Charlie Brown's friend the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Snoopy's nemesis the Red Baron. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock and Lucy all spoke to entertainment reporter Genevieve Hassan.	Charles Schulz's characters, Charlie Brown and Snoopy have been talking about the secret of their strong friendships.
But the scandal rocking Germany's political establishment isn't about sleaze or corruption but rather whether a little-known website can publish documents already publicly discussed. What started off as an obscure case has turned into a fiery national debate about the freedom of the press and the influence of government ministers over the courts. Earlier this year, Andre Meister and Markus Beckedahl published classified documents on the digital rights website Netzpolitik, indicating that Germany's intelligence service was planning to expand online surveillance to combat terrorism, and that a special unit could be set up to monitor social media. Last week the journalists announced that they were being investigated for treason. If the state prosecutor had his way, wrote Andre Meister on Netzpolitik: "Markus and I will soon be sitting in jail for two years." There was a national outcry. Headlines screamed that freedom of the press was under attack and thousands took to the streets of Berlin in support of Netzpolitik. In Britain, headlines are made when parliamentary officials are caught, quite literally, with their pants down - ideally, for maximum effect, with the involvement of drugs and prostitutes. In Germany it is data protection that gets people worked up. That seems less surprising when you remember Germany's painful experience of totalitarianism during the 20th Century. Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, and communist East Germany's Stasi agents spied extensively on their own citizens and severely controlled the press. So privacy rights and the role of the media are not simply matters of academic debate. People here are all too aware of the dangers when a state gets too powerful. This historical legacy helps explain why the allegations of American spying in Germany have caused such uproar. And why Edward Snowden, who leaked the information of American spying activities, is viewed as something approaching a national hero here, particularly by left-wing Germans - many of whom are possibly unaware of Mr Snowden's own right-wing views when it comes to the role of the state and social welfare. The treason investigation into the journalists at Netzpolitik has been so controversial that it was only a matter of time before heads started to roll. Within days government leaders, including the interior minister, the minister of justice and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, all publicly withdrew their support for the chief prosecutor Harald Range, who had launched the investigation. And on Tuesday it was announced that Mr Range would be dismissed - the first time that a German government has fired a chief prosecutor. But the scandal is far from over. Opposition politicians are calling for a full inquiry into why the justice minister and the interior minister let the journalists be investigated for treason in the first place. And Mr Meister and Mr Beckedahl are demanding answers over whether they have been spied on by the authorities. "For us, as journalists, who believe in the rule of law, it feels like we've landed in a nightmare, in a repressive state, in which it's possible to spy on investigative journalists," Mr Beckedahl told German television station ARD. "I could never have imagined that." The treason investigation has now been suspended. But chief prosecutor Range has accused the government of interfering in legal proceedings. It was not acceptable, he said, for politicians "to influence an investigation because its possible findings may not be politically expedient". Instead of clarifying the situation of what journalists can and can't publish, the case appears to be throwing up even more questions. What is a state secret? What is a journalist allowed to publish? And in the days of online media and social media, what is the definition of a journalist anyway? The fact that the investigation was launched, and then stopped when things got sticky politically, hasn't solved any of these issues - meaning, warn critics, that it's only a matter of time before another similar scandal blows up.	Journalists have been accused of treason; a chief prosecutor fired; and we have witnessed the unedifying spectacle of government ministers scrambling to get out of the firing line after popular outrage.
Kerry Foods confirmed the redundancies, which were initially announced in February. The company said a consultation process "had failed to secure a strategy which would ensure the sustainability of production at the site". The firm said it was retaining the factory on the town's Europarc industrial estate and was looking at "future possibilities for the site". Kerry Foods said employees were given confirmation of the plant's closure on Wednesday following a 90-day consultation period. A company spokesman said: "We are doing everything we can to assist employees in securing new employment."	A Grimsby frozen food factory has closed with the loss of 337 jobs.
Despite taking an early lead the Teessiders were 3-2 down at half-time. "You can't question the attitude, commitment and effort, it was first class," Agnew told BBC Tees. "But we were a bit naive at times defensively, not just the back four, as a team. So we all take responsibility for that and look forward to Burnley." England defender Ben Gibson was culpable for the first two goals having failed to clear, while Hull's fourth goal came as Harry Maguire was unchallenged in the penalty area. The defeat left Boro in 19th place after 30 games, seven points behind Hull, who are one place above the relegation zone. Middlesbrough welcome Burnley to the Riverside on Saturday.	Middlesbrough's defensive "naivety" cost them in Wednesday's 4-2 Premier League defeat by Hull City, says head coach Steve Agnew.
It said lack of awareness and a shortage of trainees meant police often ended up questioning adults with mental illness or learning issues without one. Home Secretary Theresa May said the situation was "not acceptable". Appropriate adults are trained volunteers who help with communication during police interviews. They are supposed to ensure mentally vulnerable people who are arrested or questioned understand what is happening, and that their legal rights and welfare are safeguarded. They were introduced in the 1980s following miscarriages of justice involving vulnerable people. Local authorities are required to provide appropriate adults whenever children are in contact with police and there is no parent or guardian present, but there is no duty to do the same in respect of vulnerable adults. In some areas, no organised scheme for adults exists. Researchers analysed police data and found appropriate adults were used in about 45,000 of the 1.4m detentions and voluntary interviews of adults each year. It is estimated that 280,000 of those detentions involves a person who is "mentally vulnerable". What does an appropriate adult do? Appropriate adults do not provide legal advice, but assist with rights and broader welfare. Nuala Chapman, an appropriate adult, told BBC Radio 5 live that she would be called after a medical practitioner had decided someone in custody needed support. "We then go to the station, we go through all the processes with them, we make sure they understand what is going on, we go through interview with them and... facilitate communication between all the people in the interview," she said. "Our role ends once they have either been charged or bailed." The report, entitled There to Help, found police were least likely to identify vulnerability in areas which did not have an organised appropriate adult scheme. Custody officers reported spending hours trying to find a suitable appropriate adult. They admitted to sometimes asking random members of the public, or proceeding without one. Chris Bath, chief executive of the National Appropriate Adult Network, the charity which led the study, said: "People with learning disabilities, mental ill health, traumatic brain injuries or autistic spectrum disorders are some of the most vulnerable citizens, and state detention is perhaps the most vulnerable situation. "We have a moral and a legal duty to ensure appropriate adults are available wherever people live." The report's recommendations include: The home secretary said appropriate adults "provide vital support and help to demystify what can be a confusing, sometimes frightening, experience in police custody". Mrs May added: "The status quo is not acceptable and I am concerned that vulnerable adults are not always receiving the support of an appropriate adult. "We are currently examining the recommendations and implementation options to ensure that vulnerable people are provided with the support they are entitled to." Avtar Bhatoa, from the Law Society, said appropriate adults were needed to ensure "fair justice for all". "With the right support, mentally vulnerable people are less likely to suffer an injustice or to waive their right to free legal advice through fear and misunderstanding, which can compound their disadvantage in the justice system, " he said.	Up to a quarter of a million vulnerable people are not being supported by an "appropriate adult" while in police custody, a Home Office report suggests.
A pre-inquest review was due to take place on Monday, but has now been postponed until March. West Sussex County Council said the full inquest was now likely to be held late 2017, but was "very dependent" on the police investigation. A lawyer representing some of the victims' families described "a measure of frustration" at the news. A vintage hawker hunter jet crashed on to the A27 during an aerobatic stunt at the Shoreham show in August 2015, killing 11 men. The pilot, Andrew Hill, 51, survived the crash and is being investigated for manslaughter. Plans were put in place for the inquest to begin in March, but neither the police investigation nor the full Air Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) report have yet been published. Specialist aviation lawyer James Healey Pratt said the victims' families had full confidence in the coroner and the investigation. He said the pre-inquest hearing was being delayed until March as a decision by the CPS on whether to bring charges was due then. He also revealed the families had been invited to a meeting in Farnborough on 19 December, at which they would be told the results of the AAIB investigation. Sussex Police's report is not expected until the new year at the earliest. West Sussex Senior Coroner Penelope Schofield said the decision to postpone the pre-inquest review was "not taken lightly", particularly as she was anxious to ensure the inquests were dealt with in a timely manner. But it was anticipated little progress could be made with the police and AAIB report still outstanding, she added.	An inquest into the deaths of 11 men at the Shoreham Airshow is not likely for another year, the BBC can reveal.
The move comes a day after a federal appeals court in San Francisco lifted a ban that had been in place since 2008. Many Californian gay couples then rushed to get married. But the opponents say the appeals court acted prematurely because by law they had more time to appeal before the ban can be lifted. Friday's decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals court followed a ruling by the US Supreme Court against supporters of the California ban on gay marriage. On Saturday the Alliance Defending Freedom, which supports the ban, filed the petition asking the Supreme Court to overrule the order by appeals court. The group argued that by law it had 25 days to challenge the Supreme Court ruling, and therefore that the ban should not have been lifted. The Alliance Defending Freedom described the appeals court order as "the latest in a long line of judicial irregularities". The gay marriage ban - known as Proposition 8 - was approved by voters in 2008, months after California's supreme court decided such unions were legal. The two couples then launched the legal challenge. As the state of California refused to defend the proposition, the group that sponsored it stepped up to do so. But on Wednesday the Supreme Court ruled that a private party could not challenge the earlier lower court ruling, as it could not demonstrate it would suffer injury if same-sex marriages were allowed.	Opponents of same-sex marriage in California have filed an emergency petition to the US Supreme Court to try to halt gay weddings in the state.
About 2,000 pieces dating back more than 1,000 years were spotted on the seabed by members of a diving club, the Israeli Antiquities Authority said. At first the group thought the coins were toys, but quickly realised the significance of their discovery. The Antiquities Authority said the find was "so valuable that it's priceless". Divers were exploring an ancient harbour in Caesarea when they came across the gold. They collected several coins and quickly returned to the shore to inform the director of the club. Experts from the authority called to the site uncovered "almost 2,000 gold coins in different denominations" circulated by the Fatimid Caliphate, which ruled much of the Middle East and North Africa from 909 to 1171. Kobi Sharvit, director of the marine archaeology unit at the Israel Antiquities Authority, said excavations would be carried out in the hope of shedding more light on the origin of the treasure. He added: "There is probably a shipwreck there of an official treasury boat which was on its way to the central government in Egypt with taxes that had been collected. "Perhaps the treasure of coins was meant to pay the salaries of the Fatimid military garrison which was stationed in Caesarea and protected the city." He said another theory was that the treasure belonged to a large merchant ship that traded with the coastal cities and the port on the Mediterranean Sea. The haul, which weighs 9kg (20lb), is believed to have been exposed as a result of winter storms. It is now the property of the state and there was no finders' fee.	Scuba divers have inadvertently discovered the largest trove of gold coins ever found off Israel's Mediterranean coast.
The party secured about 19% of the vote, unofficial tallies show. But it is not clear if it will meet the 25% voting threshold to enter Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo in the 9 July presidential election by itself. The official election results will be announced in May. Some 19,000 seats were contested across Indonesia in Wednesday's polls, including the 560 seats in the national parliament. A poll by Jakarta think tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), put the opposition Golkar party in second place with 14% of the vote, followed by the Great Indonesia Movement Party with 12%. Islamic parties also appeared to have performed better than expected, together grabbing about a third of the national vote. Support for the ruling Democratic Party of Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono - who cannot serve a third term as president - fell by half. His party came in fourth with 10% of the vote. Mr Yudhoyono told reporters that he respected the early results. "Let's honour the result of this election and be ready to accept new national leadership that will lead the nation to be better," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying. CSIS political analyst Philips Vermonte told Reuters news agency: "Parliament is likely to be very fragmented because many parties have gotten a relatively big share of votes." The parliamentary polls are key to deciding which parties can field presidential candidates. Parties must either secure 25% of the total vote or 20% of the seats in parliament. Candidates whose parties fail to meet these thresholds must form or enter a coalition before they can run for president. Indonesian stocks fell over 3% on Thursday, after expectations PDI-P would secure enough votes to put Mr Widodo, the Jakarta governor, straight through to presidential polls were dashed. "We see the possible formation of a weak government with limited ability to push through necessary reforms and policies ahead," Bahana Securities research head Harry Su told Reuters news agency. Mr Widodo is seen by many as Indonesia's next president. He told reporters on Wednesday that his party was "widely open" to a coalition. "It is not possible for PDI-P to work alone. We have to co-operate with those having the same platform," he said.	Indonesia's opposition Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) leads parliamentary polls but its star candidate may face a tougher path to the presidency, early election results indicate.
Media playback is not supported on this device Fifteen of those won gold. How many of them will be back to defend their titles in 2016 at the Rio Olympic Games, and who else might come through the ranks to join them? A week is a long time in sport, never mind four years. But here, BBC Sport takes an early look at some names in the frame for future Olympic fame. Media playback is not supported on this device Six of the 12 British Olympians who won more than one medal at London 2012 were younger than 26. Laura Trott, 20, and boyfriend Jason Kenny, 24, were both double Olympic champions in the velodrome, Andy Murray, 25,took tennis gold and silver, gymnasts Louis Smith, 23,and Max Whitlock, 19,both picked up two medals, and Rebecca Adlington, 23,won double bronze in freestyle swimming. It would be risky to bet against any of them returning for Rio. Trott, in particular, has the chance to establish a legacy to match Sir Chris Hoy's record medal haul over the next decade, having dominated her team pursuit and omnium events in recent years. Adlington has some thinking to do after losing both of her Olympic titles, particularly following the stunning performance of American 15-year-old Katie Ledecky over her favoured 800m distance. Smith has suggested younger gymnasts may prove better all-rounders and push him out of the 2016 gymnastics team. But you can expect Whitlock to be a bedrock of that squad if he maintains his progress, while Trott and Kenny should have at least two more Olympic outings left in them, if not more. Murray will certainly hope to defend his singles title in Rio. Of course, 25 is something of an arbitrary barrier. In many sports, you can just as easily win a medal in your 40s or 50s as your teens. Many of GB's gold medallists can be expected to fight for their place, if not retain their title, in four years' time - think of the likes of Jess Ennis, 26,and Mo Farah, 29, plus many of the GB rowing team. To take an example from the opposite end of the spectrum: Nick Skelton is 54, has come back from a broken neck and a hip replacement, and now needs work on his back - but the team showjumping champion plans to return. Media playback is not supported on this device Plenty of likely candidates for Rio 2016 have already broken into the team at London 2012, even if they didn't grab the headlines. The most obvious of these is Adam Gemili, the world junior champion over 100m, whose time of 10.06 seconds in the Olympic semi-finals saw him narrowly miss out on a place in the final alongside the likes of Jamaican winner Usain Bolt and his team-mate Yohan Blake. Gemili, still only 18, has already been hailed by US rival Tyson Gay as a man with the potential to become one of the greatest in history. By Rio, we will know a lot more about what the former footballer can achieve on the track. Nineteen-year-old Katarina Johnson-Thompson (heptathlon or long jump) and 20-year-old hurdler Andrew Pozzi are others whose names were lower down the 2012 card but could top the billing in Rio. Andrew Osagie, the 800m runner, finished last in his final as David Rudisha stormed home in a new world record, but the Briton ran a personal best that would have won gold at any of the three previous Olympics. He will be 28 in 2016. In contrast Olympic triathlon champion Alistair Brownlee occupied every headline going with his stunning win but will face renewed pressure from younger brother Jonny in Rio. The two look set to dominate their sport for years to come, but 22-year-old Jonny may yet have it in him to surpass his 24-year-old sibling in time for Rio, having taken bronze behind Alistair in Hyde Park. In gymnastics, Rebecca Tunney made her Olympic debut as the youngest member of Team GB at the age of 15, looking assured and unfazed in the women's all-around final. She will spend the next four years increasing the difficulty of her routines although, in a sport with a phenomenally high turnover rate as new gymnasts come on the scene, she already faces a battle to keep her place in the British team. Fencer James Davis impressed as Britain valiantly scrapped to a narrow defeat by world number ones Italy in the men's team foil event, and he could be joined by world junior epee champion Philip Marsh in Rio. Teenager Harry Martin somehow managed to have a decent game for the GB men's hockey team as they were drubbed 9-2 by the Netherlands in their semi-final and is one to watch, while rowing trio Constantine Louloudis, George Nash and Will Satch all picked up bronze at Eton Dorney and will look to upgrade that in Brazil. Swimming was a disappointment for Britain at their home Games, and now the search is on for future stars. Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, the 16-year-old breaststroke swimmer from Bath, may be one of them if she can improve her race strategy. Diver Jack Laugher struggled in his 3m competition and finished 27th but he will only be 21 by the time of Rio; Tom Daley, of course, will be just 22 himself. Some of the GB stars at Rio 2016 could be in sports entirely new to the Games. British teams will fancy their chances at medals in rugby sevens, introduced to the Olympic programme for the first time, with Michaela Staniford a name to remember as the 25-year-old captain of the current England women's team. Kiteboarding replaces windsurfing for Rio and Steph Bridge, a four-time world champion in the sport for Britain, has already seen her profile rise as a result. If windsurfing wins its appeal against losing its place, Izzy Hamilton could benefit. The pro windsurfer is also taking up kiteboarding with a view to reaching Rio, no matter which of the two is included. Elsewhere in sailing, 22-year-old Katrina Hughes - who lost her battle for a place in the women's 470 boat to Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark, this time - will be back and raring to go alongside partner Penny Clark for 2016. A crop of gymnasts are preparing to emerge from the increasingly successful British junior production line. European junior champions Frank Baines and Nile Wilson are two leading lights on the men's side while Youth Olympic trampolinist Nathan Bailey is hoping to star at 2016. Ellie Downie, younger sister of 2008 Olympic gymnast Becky, is just 12 years old now but will be 16 and could have reached her peak by the time of the next Games. Cycling has a seemingly endless conveyor belt of talent to raid for 2016. Names like Lucy Garner and Simon Yates, both already junior world champions in their short careers, could be firmly established in senior circles well before then. Other names waiting in the wings for Rio include boxer Chantelle Cameron, eventer Laura Collett and modern pentathletes Freyja Prentice and Jamie Cooke, the latter tipped by his coaches as a future world champion. Rowers Pat Lapage and Mike Evans, and Michael Eilberg with Woodlander Farouche in dressage, will also hope to be in Rio.	More than 30 of the Britons who won medals at London 2012 were aged 25 or under.
Borthwick, 36, left his role at the Championship side after only 43 days. The former England captain arrived at Bristol several weeks into the season having helped Eddie Jones coach Japan. "It's kicked us quite hard because this has been about planning and waiting for Steve to arrive," said Robinson. Borthwick was named forwards coach with Jones' new-look England in acrimonious circumstances last week, with Bristol owner Steve Lansdown describing the Rugby Football Union as "unprofessional" in their handling of the appointment. Robinson was forwards coach during England's World Cup-winning era under Sir Clive Woodward before taking over as England head coach himself from 2004-06. And, while he is unimpressed by the manner of Borthwick's exit, he is certain England have made an astute appointment. "I was delighted to have signed Steve and I certainly hoped he would be here for longer than 43 days," Robinson told BBC Radio Bristol. "He is a quality coach and he will be a quality coach for England and I wish him all the best. I know the England team will enjoy working with him. "I'm disappointed in the circumstance of how it's happened and why it's happened but legally I can't say too much and we have to move forward." Robinson, who has also coached Scotland, says he will not rush into appointing a replacement and has urged his forwards to handle the responsibility of Borthwick's departure. "It's down to the players to step up collectively over the next four months for us to achieve what we want to achieve," he said. "We have to focus on the next couple of weeks, with tough games coming up against London Welsh and Nottingham. There is a lot to be done over the next few weeks."	Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson says the club have been hit hard by the departure of forwards coach Steve Borthwick, who he believes will be successful with England.
Research suggests Oxford may be affected the most by public sector cuts Oxford among worst GCSE results Chairman of Oxfordshire Economic Partnership Frank Nigriello said small firms would not have jobs available. It comes as research suggests Oxford has one of the highest number of employees in vulnerable sectors. The BBC-commissioned study, carried out by Experian, ranks the resilience of council areas to economic shocks. In the research, Oxford was rated the third highest in England for the number of employees working in vulnerable sectors. Figures from the government estimate 48% of jobs in Oxford East are in the public sector. Mr Nigriello said Oxfordshire had very few large companies, with many people employed in the county's pioneering health services, as well as research and development, including Oxford University. He added: "If there are massive cuts in the public sector, then Oxfordshire's private sector won't have the resilience. "Small businesses don't have the opportunities or availability of jobs." A special BBC News season examining the approaching cuts to public sector spending The Spending Review: Making It Clear The Oxfordshire Economic Partnership (OEP) is a company formed by a number of business people in the county to help promote enterprise. The research also suggests Oxford has few self employed people, but that the working-age population were highly skilled. In South Oxfordshire, according to the Experian research, the situation was different, with the 11th highest proportion of those self employed in England. Mr Nigriello, who works for Unipart in Cowley, suggested the private sector should be willing to assist the public sector in making changes to their organisation. He said: "Private sector companies would be foolish not to help. "While we may be the engine that creates the wealth, we recognise that we need the services to create the community we want to live in". Oxfordshire County Council is currently looking to make more than Â£200m of cuts by 2015. The figure may be adjusted after the government's spending review next month. Meanwhile, the research also revealed Oxford is in the bottom five regions of the UK for GCSE results. South Today will be debating the issues raised in the spending review tonight at 2235 BST. BBC Oxford 95.2FM will be discussing the research from 0700 BST.	Private companies in Oxfordshire may not have enough capacity to employ people who lose their public sector jobs, an economics expert has warned.

BP described the withdrawal as a "precautionary measure", adding that it would monitor the security situation. The Foreign Office withdrew British embassy staff from the capital, Tripoli, last week. Gunmen have besieged the justice and foreign ministries recently, demanding that Gaddafi-era officials be expelled. The gunmen blocked the buildings two weeks ago, parking pick-up trucks with anti-aircraft guns outside. The siege was lifted by Sunday and employees at both ministries were back at work. Parliament passed a law last week barring Gaddafi-era officials from political office. BP said in a statement: "Following FCO advice given to us by the British Embassy in Tripoli, and purely as a precautionary measure, we have brought non-essential overseas staff out of Libya for the time being in a phased reduction of numbers. "Our Libyan staff remain and the office continues to operate. Fewer than a dozen people are affected. "We will continue to monitor the security situation and move people back in to Libya when it is considered safe to do so." On Friday, the Foreign Office said some embassy staff in Libya had been withdrawn in response to "ongoing political uncertainty". It said it was temporarily withdrawing a "small number" who work with Libyan ministries, while the UK embassy remains "open as usual", including for consular and visa services. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential travel to Tripoli and against all travel to other parts of Libya, such as the eastern city of Benghazi.	Oil giant BP has withdrawn some non-essential staff from operations in Libya following UK government advice about uncertainty in the country.
The union Unite organised the rally at the firm's headquarters in Derbyshire. The union has called for an end to "Victorian working practices" and demanded staff get a living wage of Â£7.85 an hour. Sports Direct said casual workers receive holiday and sick pay, and are included in incentive schemes. The protest at the company headquarters was one of about 40 being held on Wednesday, with Sports Direct shops across the country also being targeted. A Sports Direct spokeswoman said: "Much of the comment around the group's use of zero hours has been unfounded and inaccurate. "The group complies fully with all legal requirements which relate to casual workers, including holiday and sick pay and freedom to gain other employment. "Casual workers also benefit from general incentive schemes." Unite said an estimated 3,000 workers are on zero-hour contracts at Sports Direct's Shirebrook headquarters. A further 75% of staff across its UK stores are also on zero-hour contracts, with Sports Direct accounting for a fifth of all such contracts in the retail sector, according to Unite. One institutional investor, Royal London Asset Management, earlier called for the resignation of Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley citing anger on his failure to attend four board meetings. Ashley Hamilton Claxton from Royal London Asset Management, said: "We have lost confidence in the board and are very concerned about the long list of corporate governance failings that have not been addressed." But both Mr Ashley and Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell were re-elected to the board at the meeting. Unite representative Cheryl Pidgeon said: "We want an end to zero-hour contracts - because young people cannot stand 'forever and a day' to be on zero-hour contracts. "We think Sports Direct makes enough money to ensure that their workers have to dignity, respect and fair wages."	A Dickensian-style protest has been held to oppose Sports Direct's use of zero-hour contracts at the company's annual general meeting.
"And on the Monday there was no one there. There was a complete hush, it was extraordinary," says Mr Haynes who used to work on the floor of the London Stock Exchange, and is now chief executive of the trading venue Aquis Exchange. The Monday he's referring to was 30 years ago. It was the day of the Big Bang - when, in one fell swoop, the City of London was deregulated, revolutionising its fortunes and turning it into a financial capital to rival New York. London's switch in 1986 from traditional face-to-face share dealing to electronic trading helped it outpace its European competitors and became a magnet for international banks. Even if London now loses access to the single market, many believe the Big Bang's legacy is a financial infrastructure with foundations too deep to be moved. But many also say it sowed the seeds of the 2008 financial crisis. There were three key elements to the Big Bang revolution: By ending fixed commissions Big Bang allowed more competition; by ending the separation of dealers and advisors it allowed mergers and take-overs; and by allowing in foreign owners it opened London's market to international banks. Coupled with the new magic of electronic trading - the City jumped from the 19th Century to the threshold of the 21st. It is generally thought that Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister drove through Big Bang as part of a programme of deregulation, but there were already powerful forces at work. By the early 1980s the competition authorities were threatening to take the stock exchange to the Restrictive Practices Court. Nicholas Goodison, then chairman of the Stock Exchange, believed it would be better to pre-empt the lawyers and avoid being forced to tear up its rule book. In any case the world was already changing. The US had abolished fixed commissions in 1974, and in 1979 the Conservative government abolished exchange controls - triggering for many the UK's financial and economic rebirth. "And there were other developments," says David Buik, now a market commentator at Panmure Gordon. "You have to remember that LIFFE (the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange) had started up in 1982 and already attracted the big American and Japanese banks - not to mention the privatisations of British Gas, British Airways and so on." In the end it was Mr Goodison, Trade and Industry Secretary Cecil Parkinson, and Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who persuaded Mrs Thatcher to back the reforms that changed the City for ever. City traders were then strictly divided into two; jobbers and brokers. Brokers liaised with clients and then gave their orders to jobbers who did the actual trading, face-to-face in "open outcry", on the exchange floor. Up until 1967 trading was done at the old Capel Court exchange, known as The House, where "waiters" would water the floors with watering cans to keep down the dust. Nowadays the pre-Big Bang City has a bowler hat image, where a good lunch and long friendships were more important than profit. But it wasn't all like that, according to Brian Winterflood, later the founder of Winterflood Securities, who had been a jobber at Greener Dreyfus since the 1950s. "We had lunch but we never stopped trading," he said in a 1990 interview. "If we were too busy for lunch we wouldn't go to lunch, and you'd snatch a half an hour now and again." Crucially for the subsequent development of London as an international financial centre, the Big Bang produced a free-for-all, as brokers, jobbers and the City's traditional merchant banks merged. Some were bought by UK clearing banks but many more were snapped up by much bigger US, European and Japanese banks. The 300 member firms of the stock exchange had all been domestic - but within a year 75 were foreign-owned. With this came electronic trading, cutting costs as the competition increased. The jobbers vanished and the trading floor became deserted. All this meant that the volume of trade that flooded through the new terminals soared, averaging more than $7.4bn a week after Big Bang compared with $4.5bn a week beforehand. And costs also came down. "When I started out it cost a fortune to trade, the spreads between buying and selling were huge. Now you can trade on your mobile phone for a fiver," says Mr Haynes. It is said that Big Bang created 1,500 millionaires. Some 95% of the firms had been owned by partnerships, and dazzled by the massive sums on offer many sold up and retired. It also changed the geography of London. Until then the Bank of England had insisted that all of London's banks had to be within 10 minutes' walking distance of the governor's office so, it was said, in a crisis he could summon the lords of finance to his parlour with half an hour's notice. But the Securities and Investments Board (later the Financial Services Authority) replaced the Bank's regulatory role. On the day of Big Bang an advertisement in the Financial Times promised a new financial centre, three miles to the east of the City at Canary Wharf, which would "feel like Venice and work like New York". Yet not everything went to plan. In the short term there was a problem of massive overcapacity. The banks found they had overspent. The following years saw them closing down venerable firms like Vickers da Costa, Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee, Fielding Newson-Smith, Wood Mackenzie; names that now appear only in history books and at the bottom of senior financiers' resumes. By 1992 Canary Wharf was forced into bankruptcy as it struggled to find tenants. But in the 1990s and 2000s, profits, salaries and bonuses boomed. Even Canary Wharf recovered and thrived. The result was a financial sector many believe is Brexit-proof. "The banks built a huge infrastructure in technology, transport, education and telecoms, and that infrastructure is unique," says Mr Haynes. "People who say we are going to move off to Paris or Frankfurt don't understand you can't build an infrastructure like that overnight. It can't be rebuilt quickly just anywhere in the world." But with the wealth came something more ambiguous, and dangerous - a change of attitude.  "It became much more of a dog-eat-dog environment," says David Buik. "In the old days you would have been very careful to look after your client, you had a relationship. But it became a competition on rate and pricing. And the earnings became colossal." Much of this was based around a bonus culture which rewarded the best deal, while short-term trumped long-term. Some people understood better than others what was happening. David Willetts, who was then working in the No 10 policy unit but went on to be a Conservative minister, co-authored a paper for Mrs Thatcher on the likely impact of the Big Bang. He expressed concern about "unethical behaviour" and that financial deregulation could lead to "boom and bust" But he concluded while there might be "individual financial failures" he did not expect "a systemic problem". On this he was wrong. The 2008 financial collapse was systemic. It prompted a new wave a regulation, trimming some of the City's freedoms. However, no one, save perhaps the odd elderly broker, dozing now in his Surrey mansion, would dream of returning to the days of bowler hats when the waiters watered the floors in Capel Court.	"I was used to the hustle and bustle, the crowd on the floor," says Alasdair Haynes.
His lawyer Brian Webber told the AFP news agency that a decision over his early release has been referred back to the parole board. The Paralympic star was jailed for five years in 2014 for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp. He has been fighting a lengthy battle to be released early from jail. Pistorius was due to be released in August, but remained in prison after Justice Minister Michael Masutha made a last-minute intervention blocking it. The parole review board - the final recourse for parole disputes - met on Monday to decide if the star, 28, should be allowed out on house arrest. A definitive parole ruling is now unlikely to be made before the athlete in a separate legal process appeals against his conviction on 3 November in Bloemfontein. This ruling could result in him receiving a longer prison term. Mr Webber explained that the parole review board decided to refer the matter back to the original parole panel - the body accused by Mr Masutha of "prematurely" wanting to release him in August. There will not be much sympathy for Pistorius because many people felt that the judge erred by acquitting him of murder. The double amputee will have to remain behind bars because while his case joins the lengthy queue of other parole hearings that need to be heard, and there is no indication when this will happen. Legal experts say the decision by the justice minister Michael Masutha to intervene was correct in terms of the law. At the time of his intervention, Pistorius had been granted parole only six months into his five-year sentence. The law states clearly that an offender can only be considered for parole after serving one-sixth of his sentence, in this case 10 months. But because he has now served one-sixth of his sentence, he probably should be released by now. Prosecutors argue that the judge who presided over his trial did not apply the law correctly by acquitting him of murder. The judge instead found him guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide - equivalent to manslaughter. Reeva Steenkamp's parents are strongly against Pistorius' possible release, telling an Australian TV channel in August that the Paralympian has ruined their lives. "He killed her. He admits he killed her. She's dead. Why didn't he just let her walk away? Why?" Reeva's mother June Steenkamp asked in the interview.	Oscar Pistorius must remain in jail and not be transferred to house arrest after a decision to grant him parole was again delayed.

He had trained with Olympic silver medallist Louis Smith at Huntingdon Gym, but believes returning home will improve his Olympic prospects. "It will open a lot of doors for me," the former British senior squad member told BBC Look East. MacKenzie is a European junior team gold medallist with Britain and finished second in the vault and sixth in the all-around at last year's national championships. He has also represented the senior squad at national level, but the prospect of competing for Team GB at major international events was being restricted by the country's world-class roster, with Smith, Max Whitlock, Sam Oldham, Kristian Thomas and Dan Keatings all rivals for selection. "I would say I feel more South African than British," said MacKenzie, who was born in the coastal town of Jeffreys Bay. "I won a competition for GB in South Africa in 2010. I remember standing up there on the podium with the British anthem playing and thought it didn't quite feel right. "I've been here 11 years. I have a British passport, but I can't really forget I was born in Africa and my parents were. I can't forget my heritage that quickly." MacKenzie has already made an impact on South African gymnastics, winning a Commonwealth Games qualifier in October to secure his place at Glasgow this summer and, under the British flag, finished highest at the 2013 national championships. And he will compete in the Africa championships at the end of March, in the hope of making the qualifying scores needed to become the first South African artistic gymnast to go to the Olympics since 1956. MacKenzie, who is now based at the Centurion Gymnastics Centre, intends to continue working with his Huntingdon coach Paul Hall and will send videos of his progress to receive tuition. "I can really make a difference to gymnastics as a whole there and maybe kickstart something," he said. "I can see what Louis Smith has done for the sport in this country and he's a great role model. I think it's definitely an achievable ambition to win the African champs, but there will be stiff competition."	British gymnast Cameron MacKenzie has chosen to represent South Africa in a bid to qualify for Rio 2016.
The route between Edinburgh and Tweedbank had been hit by delays and cancellations. ScotRail apologised for the problems and said buses had been organised to supplement the trains that could run.

Officials said the attack happened at the Europa shopping centre in the capital Minsk. Eyewitnesses spoke of a masked man chasing terrified shoppers on Saturday evening. Police later arrested the 18-year-old suspect. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. "When he took out a chainsaw, shoppers first thought it was some kind of game," police spokesman Alexander Lastovsky told Reuters. "Then he cut one woman badly with the chainsaw and hit her with a hammer. She died. He also attacked others." The injured woman was taken to a local hospital. The attacker had brought the chainsaw and the axe to the shopping centre in a guitar case.	A young man has attacked people with a chainsaw and an axe at a shopping centre in Belarus, killing one woman and injuring another.
European Space Propulsion (ESP) Limited blamed disappointing sales for going into liquidation. Formed by Aerojet Rocketdyne in 2012, it operated from missile maker Thales UK's factory in Castlereagh. Its offices were opened by the former First Minister Peter Robinson. He had expressed delight the US company had selected Belfast as its European sales base. But it never got near its projected Â£13m annual turnover. A spokesman for the firm said: "We had high hopes, just like the Northern Ireland ministers did. "We thank them for their support but unfortunately expected sales just never materialised." As recently as December, then Economy Minister Jonathan Bell talked of ESP as having "brought significant benefits to Northern Ireland". Employee numbers never got above eight.	An American-owned aerospace firm attracted to Belfast by Invest NI and backed by the  Northern Ireland Executive is ending its local operation.

The crash happened outside Castle Bytham, south of Grantham, on Wednesday afternoon. The 73-year-old pilot, from Thurnby, Leicestershire, is being treated for back and leg injuries. A 52-year-old tanker driver was treated for minor injuries and the 61-year-old occupant of the property was unhurt. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has said it is aware of the incident and is making inquiries. Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue said the man who lives in the bungalow was in the garden and pushed the tanker driver out of the way, to prevent them both being hit. The pilot became stuck in the plane, which was embedded in the building, and the aircraft's landing gear broke off and landed on a bed. A police guard remains in place at the bungalow while recovery work is carried out. Pete Wiles, from the fire service, said: "If they hadn't moved... they would have been hit. "It's a fairly miraculous escape... there's an overhead power line nearby which it missed as well."	An investigation into how a small plane narrowly avoided two men and then struck a bungalow on a farm in Lincolnshire is continuing.

Highways England say the Â£6m layout changes on the Posthouse roundabout proved more difficult than anticipated. Work began last summer and was expected to finish by March but it has now been pushed back to 28 June. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas said the route was vital to the region's economy. "Deadlines were set, missed, then extended, not once but again and again - and the level of information given to motorists has been very poor indeed," he said. New Chester MP Chris Matheson added: "The chaos these works have caused has been a real issue for Chester for months." A Highways England spokesperson said: "We are doing everything we can to complete the A55/A483 scheme as quickly as possible. "We have rescheduled the street lighting installation work to take place overnight in July, so that we are able to fully open the roundabout and start operating the traffic lights from Monday 29 June."	MPs are demanding highways officials explain why roadworks on the A55 and A483 on the Chester-Wrexham border have over-run, causing months of frustration and long hold-ups for motorists.
Parents of brides cannot invite more than 500 guests, and the number has been limited to 400 for grooms. The government also said that no more than seven main dishes can be served to "ensure that there is no wastage of any food items". An MP has also proposed a bill to impose a similar ban on expensive weddings across India. Weddings are expensive in Kashmir, and the traditional feast, locally called Wazwan, includes a range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The state government said the order, which comes into effect from 1 April, was issued in response to public complaints about extravagance, waste and intrusive noise. The state had imposed a similar ban in 1984, but it was revoked after protests. Marriages are costly in other parts of India as well, and many people spend lavishly on food, clothes and entertainment. In November, the five-day wedding of businessman and former Karnataka state minister G Janardhana Reddy's daughter, Brahmani, with an estimated cost of about 5bn rupees ($74m; £59m), prompted outrage as millions of Indians struggled with a cash flow crisis. Among the extravagances were gold-plated invitation cards fitted with LCD screens, costing 10m rupees. Here are a few of the world's most expensive weddings:	The government in Indian-administered Kashmir has put curbs on excessively lavish weddings.
Another six people died when a minibus was hit elsewhere in Donetsk. No children were apparently hurt when the school playground was shelled but a biology teacher and a parent were among the dead, witnesses told Reuters. The school is 4km (2.5 miles) from Donetsk airport, where rebels have clashed with Ukrainian troops. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in eastern Ukraine since 5 September but the truce has frequently been violated. Both sides blamed the other for Wednesday's attacks. The Kiev-controlled regional administration said rebels from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) had opened fire with a multiple-launch rocket system. But DPR deputy leader Andrei Purgin told Russian TV that Ukrainian rocket launchers had targeted residential areas from as far as 40km (25 miles) away. Pro-Russian separatists control of much of Donetsk and have launched several attempts to capture the airport to the north-west of the city in recent weeks. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told reporters the airport was still under government control but rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko told news agencies it would be fully captured in two to three days. Open conflict began in the east in April, after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists then declared independence in the two eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Pupils in Donetsk only returned to school on Wednesday after the start of the school year was postponed by a month because of the fighting. Many children had been moved to safer areas while the fighting was at its heaviest, but although clashes have continued since the ceasefire was declared, the violence has been less widespread. Well over 200 people were at school number 57 in the Kievsky district when the playground was shelled, including 70 children. Although the school's windows shattered, none of the children was reported hurt. Another shell hit a minibus at a bus stop a few streets away from the school and a Reuters reporter described seeing six bodies inside the vehicle. The BBC's James Coomarasamy, visiting another school in Donetsk, says far fewer pupils than normal were present for the first day of the year, with the constant echo of artillery in the distance. "The first thing we should teach our pupils is to love their country and the city they live in and that they should respect the people around them," an English teacher said. On his first day as Nato Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg described the crisis in Ukraine as a major challenge to security and reiterated his predecessor's strong stance towards Russia. The Kremlin has denied sending heavy weapons and soldiers to help the rebels but admits that "volunteers" have gone to fight in eastern Ukraine. "We have to see that Russia changes its behaviour and its actions and returns to compliance with international law and its obligations," he said. Only a strong Nato could build a constructive relationship with Russia, he added. The European Commission has written a letter warning Russian President Vladimir Putin not to impose new trade barriers on Ukraine. As part of a compromise agreed earlier this month, the government in Moscow agreed it would not change its trade provisions with Ukraine if an EU-Ukraine trade accord was put on hold for 15 months. Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso says a recently adopted Russian decree contravenes that compromise.	A shell has killed four people at a school in the rebel-held east Ukrainian city of Donetsk, on the first day of classes, officials and witnesses say.
The Briton finished more than two minutes ahead of Poland's Anna Harkowska in Nottwil, Switzerland. Storey can win a 17th title when she rides in Saturday's road race. "It's a massive relief to win," said the 37-year-old, who is targeting further Paralympic success at next year's Games in Rio de Janeiro. Storey is Britain's most decorated female Paralympian with 22 medals. She has won 11 gold, eight silver and three bronze medals in both cycling and swimming across six Paralympics. She won four golds at the 2012 Games in London and has now won 21 world titles across both sports. Storey began her sporting career in the pool, winning six medals at the 1992 Paralympics before switching to cycling in 2005.	Dame Sarah Storey claimed the 16th world title of her cycling career with gold in the time trial at the Para-cycling Road World Championships.
Legally, it needs at least 5% of local electors for a referendum to go ahead. Those behind the petition say a mayor would offer more dynamic leadership and "rise above party politics". Council leader Tim Warren said it felt "unnecessary" so soon after the elections. If successful, a directly elected mayor would replace him. The council announced on Monday that it had received 6,818 valid signatures. A further 2,789 signatures were ruled to be invalid. Directly elected mayors were created by the Local Government Act 2000 as one option for local government, as long as the idea was backed in a referendum. Bath & North East Somerset Council said the threshold set out under the 2000 Act had been reached and "it is anticipated that the referendum will be held early next year". In Bath, the council is run by a leader and cabinet system. Philip Raby, one of the team working for a referendum, said they favoured holding it on 5 May 2016, the day of the police and crime commissioner elections. He felt a directly elected mayor would offer "visible and accountable leadership" for the wider area - something he felt the current system did not offer. Mr Warren said there were "challenging budgetary issues" to concentrate on and questioned whether there was much public appetite for a referendum. Local petitions sparked referendums which resulted in elected mayors in Salford, Greater Manchester in 2012 and in Copeland, Cumbria in 2015. The Localism Act 2011 allowed central government to trigger referendums for elected mayors - but of the ten held in May 2012, only Bristol voted in favour of getting a mayor.	A referendum on an elected mayor for Bath and North East Somerset will be held in 2016, after a petition reached the threshold of 6,437 votes.
At one point in his final round of 67, Ramsay looked like he might take his challenge to the wire, closing to within a single shot of the eventual champion, Alex Noren, following a run of four straight birdies  in his opening six holes. He said he stood on the 10th tee believing for the first time in his life that he could win a title that he says would mean almost as much to him as a major championship. Not enough putts dropped on the back nine - he gave himself multiple opportunities - and he had to settle for the consolation prize of a slot in The Open. Ramsay asked about Andy Murray in the aftermath and called the now two-time Wimbledon champion an inspiration. "Watching Andy play at Wimbledon this week, watching Jamie play, those guys are huge inspirations for Scottish people," he said. "To win Wimbledon is a massive achievement and I think sometimes we take that for granted, we forget how good he is. "It's great watching him, because he's Scottish and because he's got that grit and fire. I love that attitude. For me, every week is about trying to be the best I can be. "When I'm 60, I want to sit in my chair watching the golf and be able to say that I won X number of tour titles and that I couldn't squeeze any more out of the talent I had. Talent is great, but if you don't have that hard work ethic, you're not to get anywhere." Ramsay has won three times on tour, the most recent of them being the Trophee Hassan in March last year. He's played in The Open five times, missing the cut on three occasions. His best finish was 58th at Muirfield in 2013. He was tied for 68th at St Andrews last year. His performance here rather came out of the blue. Ramsay finished sixth in China in May, but his form since then has been poor, his best finish a 43rd. His season had been a grind up until Castle Stuart. "I just loved it out there," he said. "I didn't come out with a tentative attitude, which has sometimes been my fault in the past. I hit some great shots. "I knew, standing on that 10th tee, that I could win the tournament and that's a great feeling. I just have to take that into the next year and see if I can get this title in the bag one of these years. "From a confidence point of view, I will think to myself that I had a chance to win a huge tournament. You're halfway there when you believe you can do it. I know I have a lot more in the tank." Castle Stuart didn't get the champion it wanted, with due credit to the excellent Noren, but it was a terrific host venue. The troubling aspect - and it's reflective of golf's serious problem - was the size of the crowd on each of the four days. The total attendance for Thursday-Sunday was 41,809. The final round brought the smallest number of fans - 8,733 - of the week. There was a Murray effect there for sure. But it's a much wider issue than that. Last year at Gullane, the Scottish brought in a total crowd of 63,000, which was, in turn, less than the 65,833 that attended the year before at Royal Aberdeen. The small numbers this time are partly on account of geography but also to do with golf's diminishing attraction as a spectator sport. None of that bothered Noren, of course. Nor Ramsay. If there was a competition to find the widest smile at Castle Stuart last night, the two of them would have been locked in a dead heat.	Richie Ramsay didn't win the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart, but he wore a contented smile none the less having played himself into the top-six and securing himself a place in The Open Championship at Royal Troon later this week.
Reports of a "mass murder" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out. But this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare. In these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time. The statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse. Murder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer. What drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions. In contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom. No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent. Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know. "It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message. "Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable." Despite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression. German newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a "personal life crisis". In reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action. Alcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part. Mental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language. They say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: "There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever. "We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised." Charities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences. Dr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened. "Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context." But he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it. It is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness. In the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men. Lubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them. This illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions. But, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.	The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?
The 22-year-old was an unused squad member during the 2017 Six Nations, as well as the 2016 autumn internationals. "It's been building as I've been in a few camps now, but to finally get my name called out on that team sheet was an awesome feeling," he said. "I've been champing at the bit these last few camps, training hard." The Ospreys player comes in to replace Cory Hill, who was called up by the British and Irish Lions following Wales' 24-6 win over Tonga.

"But Test rugby is a completely different animal, so I'm really looking forward to the challenge on Friday against a strong Samoan team. "Like every young Welsh boy I want to play for Wales, but when it actually comes round you get that sensation of pride." Thornton is part of an inexperienced Wales side, with the forwards having won just 31 caps between them. "Samoa have a big experienced pack and we have a couple of young guys here looking to blood themselves on the international stage, so I think it'll be a good challenge overall," Thornton added.

Bath and North East Somerset (Banes) Council said a pay dispute between the Unite union and the contractor Kier was over following successful talks. The council said a backlog of waste would be cleared by the weekend. Only half of scheduled collections have taken place recently due to industrial action over what Unite called a "glaring pay inequality".	Further planned strikes by waste collection workers around Bath have been called off.
These are two of the questions up for debate at a new exhibition at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. From ancient Brythonic warlord to mythical chivalric king with a court anywhere from Wales to Glastonbury or as far north as Scotland - it is hard to separate myth, legend and fact. According to curator Dr Maredudd ap Huw, these unknowns lie at the heart of King Arthur's enduring appeal. "The beauty of Arthur is that he was - indeed, according to some 'is' - whoever you want him to be," said Dr ap Huw. "There is some early evidence to suggest that there was an Arthur in the 4th or 5th Centuries. "Though in all likelihood he was very far removed from the romantic depictions of (writers) Thomas Malory and Alfred, Lord Tennyson." However, just how Welsh he would have been is a "moot point", Dr ap Huw added. Before the Saxons drove the Brythonic people (Celtic Britons) west and north, there was no recognised entity of an independent Wales, making his nationality hard to ascertain. The exhibition brings together all the crucial texts which have informed our perception of Arthur for more than a millennium. One of the exhibits is the 13th Century Book of Aneirin, which includes a 6th Century poem describing a battle near what is now Catterick in North Yorkshire. Dr ap Huw said one reference in it is extremely telling. A young Brythonic hero called Gwawrddur is described as fighting valiantly against the Saxons "although he was no Arthur". "It is possible to infer (from this) that the legend of Arthur as a fearsome warlord was already well-established by the 6th Century," Dr ap Huw added. But the man who drew all the threads together and introduced Arthur's wife Guinevere, his sword Excalibur and the Knights of the Round Table was Geoffrey of Monmouth. Dr ap Huw describes the 12th Century writer as "the most influential author in the history of Wales". "Forget Dylan Thomas, what Geoffrey wrote had a far more profound impact on world thinking and the perception of Arthur as a Welsh hero," he said. "Writing in Latin, his ideas rapidly spread throughout Europe, and via Chretien De Troyes, fed into the French-Norman ideals of chivalric kingship. "Geoffrey claimed as his source an ancient Welsh manuscript which was then lost, never to be found.  Read into that what you will, but what is certainly true to say is that it is still essentially Geoffrey's version of King Arthur which we are taught as children, right up to the present day." Arthur's castle Camelot and other characters such as the wizard Merlin are then referenced in the 13th Century Black Book of Carmarthen. There he is described as "a war veteran who has lost his wits in battle in Scotland, and has developed the gift of being able to talk to animals". But it was not until the 15th and 16th Century that "Arthur Mania" reached its heights after William Caxton published Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. While Geoffrey of Monmouth set Camelot in the former Roman stronghold of Caerleon, near Newport, Malory anchored it as a thoroughly English tale. So much so that King Henry VII named his eldest son Arthur in honour of the legend. By 1534, Polydore Vergil's Anglica Historia had debunked much of Geoffrey of Monmouth's work, and cast doubt on the very existence of a historical Arthur at all. "Virgil's account wasn't wholly accepted. John Prise - a lawyer for Thomas Cromwell - published a rebuttal in defence of Arthur, but by then the historiographic interest in Arthur was already fatally damaged. "That's not to say we'd forgotten about him altogether. Edmund Spencer's Faerie Queene drew heavily on Arthurian tradition and, when it was presented to Queen Elizabeth I in 1590, she was so delighted that she awarded him a pension of Â£50 a year for life," Dr ap Huw said. "But by then Arthur had become a Britannia or Gloriana-type figurehead for a nation. "The historical Arthur was deadâ€¦though there are some who say he never died, and is simply waiting to wake again when his country needs him."	Who was King Arthur and how Welsh was he?
Seven-year-old Yamato Tanooka was found in a military training base near Shikabe in Hokkaido, just a few kilometres from where he was left. His parents initially said he had got lost, but eventually admitted briefly abandoning him for being naughty. His father has apologised to his son and rescuers, saying "we went too far". How did Yamato survive? The lost boy and Japanâ€™s parenting debate World media draw lessons "My excessive act forced my son to have a painful time," Takayuki Tanooka said in an emotional news briefing outside Hakodate hospital, 30km (19 miles) south, where the boy was taken for checks. "I deeply apologise to people at his school, people in the rescue operation, and everybody for causing them trouble," he said. "I have poured all my love into my son, but from now on, I would want to do more, together with him. I would like to protect him while he grows up. Thank you very much." Search teams including the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) have been combing the remote area, home to brown bears, for nearly a week. They had found no trace of Yamato and hopes were fading. But shortly before 08:00 on Friday morning (23:00 GMT on Thursday) he was found inside a building at the SDF base about 4km (2.5 miles) from where he was left. "One of our soldiers was preparing for drills this morning and opened the door of a building on the base, and there he was," an SDF member told NHK. "When he asked 'are you Yamato?' the boy said, 'Yes'. Then he said he was hungry, so the soldier gave him some water, bread and rice balls." It appears rescuers came tantalisingly close to finding him four days ago. The SDF said the base had been searched on Monday but no trace was seen of the boy, who says he reached the hut on Saturday. The soldier who found him was not part of the search team. NHK said Yamato had told rescuers he "walked through the mountains" until he found the shelter. He was taken to hospital by a medical helicopter. A doctor later said he was in very good condition, despite only having had water during his six-day ordeal. At Yamato's school in Hokuto, near Hakodate, his fellow pupils shouted for joy when it was announced at assembly that he was safe, the Japan Times reports. Yamato's parents initially said he got lost while they were foraging for vegetables, along with their daughter.  But they later admitted they had driven off, briefly leaving him alone on a mountain road as a punishment for throwing stones earlier. When they returned to collect him shortly afterwards, he had disappeared, they said. He was wearing jeans and a t-shirt at the time, Reuters news agency reported. Police have said the parents could face charges for negligence. The case has gripped Japan, sparking discussions about acceptable levels of discipline for children.	A boy missing in remote woods in Japan since Saturday after being left alone by his parents as punishment has been found alive and well.
Media playback is not supported on this device A report into claims of bullying said British Cycling "lacked good governance" at board level. Cookson, who led the organisation for 17 years before becoming UCI president, said: "If there was a lacking, I think we all share in that responsibility." He added British Cycling had been scrutinised by UK Sport. Asked if he was "pinning the blame" on the funding agency, he said: "As I understand it, they were closely involved in how things were managed and monitored. "I'm not trying to dodge any of my responsibility. What I'm saying is there were other people with responsibilities as well." The Phelps report into the culture of Britain's cycling team criticised former technical director Shane Sutton and UK Sport, and noted a "culture of fear" existed within the team, according to many staff members. "I don't accept there was a culture of fear and I spent a lot of time at the National Cycling Centre," said Cookson, who is seeking re-election after joining the UCI in 2013. However, he said Sutton should have been moved following recommendations from the King Review in 2012. "One of the recommendations was that Shane be moved out of direct coaching with athletes," he said. "As far as I understood in the first half of 2013, that was one of those action-plan elements that was implemented and it was after that in the middle of 2013 I became a candidate and then was elected to the UCI presidency." Australian Sutton stayed on before resigning last year amid claims of sexism and was later found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish, though he was cleared of eight of the nine charges against him. Media playback is not supported on this device Cookson defended his record at British Cycling, saying: "I'm not making any excuses for my behaviour. I think we made incredible progress and some great achievements. "The idea we had no respect for athlete welfare is wrong. The relationship between athletes and coaches was something we were concerned about from time to time. Action was taken." And he disagrees with MP Damian Collins, who has called for board members from the period covered in the investigation to resign. "My former colleagues at British Cycling have been committed to their sport over many years. Many of them are good people who have worked very hard," Cookson said. UK Anti-Doping is also investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Team Sky and British Cycling, which both deny. "The reputational problems that have been around that team in the past few months have not been helpful. I want to wait for the outcome of UK Anti-Doping's enquiries," he said. Cookson said cycling had made significant progress in the battle against cheating during his tenure at the UCI. "We were previously considered pariahs in the anti-doping world. Now we have one of he best reputations in sport, I believe," he added. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Brian Cookson wants to be re-elected later this year for a second term as president of cycling's world governing body, and sees a fresh mandate as his future. However, his past is catching up with him. After a 17-year period as the president of British Cycling many believe it's under his tenure that the rot set in within the organisation, a fact addressed and criticised in the recent Phelps review. Cookson doesn't shirk responsibility for some of the major welfare issues that have occurred within British Cycling. But what is striking is that he refuses to accept wholesale blame. In my interview with him, he points the finger firmly at UK Sport, saying one of their officials was embedded within the world-class cycling programme at the Manchester velodrome and was involved in management and monitoring. Any "lacking" must be shared, he believes. His message is, in effect: 'Why should the blame fall only on my shoulders?' Shane Sutton, according to the 2012 King report, should have been moved away from direct coaching with athletes. We now know he referred to disabled cyclists as "gimps and wobblies" in addition to his role in Jess Varnish's departure from the British team. But Cookson points to the fact he moved in 2013 to be president of the UCI and, in his absence, Sutton carried on working with cyclists unimpeded and with serious consequences. Again, Cookson's overarching message is clear: nothing to do with me, guv.	Brian Cookson, the head of cycling's world governing body, says blame for British Cycling's failings should not rest solely with him.
Hillingdon Council's leader said it would provide funding to challenge it for "however long it takes to win this battle". Wandsworth, Richmond and Hillingdon councils spent £300,000 from their general funds on legal action. Windsor and Maidenhead Council spent £50,000 from its development fund. The details were obtained using Freedom of Information laws. Council general funds are where money for most council services is drawn, with funds raised from council tax and central government grants. The four councils failed in an attempt to challenge the decision to build the runway at the High Court in January. London Councils, the body that represents London local authorities, says that by 2020 there will be a budget gap of around £2bn in London local government, which council budgets will have to accommodate. Hillingdon Council has set aside a contingency budget of £200,000 for possible future legal action against the third runway, while Wandsworth has budgeted £25,000. The case against the runway brought by the councils was struck out by Mr Justice Cranston in January on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the claim, but further legal action against the runway may take place. John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, questioned whether the councils were making the right spending decisions. "Those are huge sums of taxpayers' money spent on legal fees which could have otherwise gone towards road maintenance or adult social care," he said. "Given that Hillingdon residents have seen their council tax rise by over 45% in real terms over the last 20 years, the decision to allocate so much money for further action raises serious questions over the council's priorities. "Many residents may well oppose the third runway, but they are free to form groups to launch legal action themselves." Stan Woods, a resident of Longford, which will be demolished to make room for the third runway, feels there is little the councils can do to affect the outcome. "I worked at Heathrow for 38 years, so can see the reason for expansion, but equally wish I could keep my home," he said. "I guess the councils feel they are acting on behalf of their communities, but to be honest this decision will be taken higher up the political ladder." Councillor Raymond Puddifoot, leader of Hillingdon Council, said it was time the government stopped "wasting time and money" and turned its attention to finding a "workable alternative" to Heathrow. "The government spent more than £3.8 million of taxpayers' money on the expansion of Heathrow Airport in the 18 months between July 2015 and December 2016, and this figure has risen dramatically over the last few months and will continue to do so," he said. "We will continue provide both the funding and the integrity necessary to both defend and represent our residents for however long it takes to win this battle."	Four councils under Heathrow Airport's flight path spent £350,000 on legal fees challenging the planned third runway, the BBC has learnt.

Cardiff-based SA Brain bought the chain Coffee #1 last year. It comes as new figures show Brains' sales are up nearly 4% in its pubs. Brains believes there is potential in the coffee market and plans a chain of about 50 outlets over the next three years in south Wales and the south west of England. The family-run brewery employs about 2,000 people. Last year's profits are up 6% against what the company described as "a tough economic backdrop". In autumn 2011, Brains bought Coffee #1, which comprised 15 high street shops in south Wales and the south west of England, and since then, it has opened three more. Brains chief executive Scott Waddington said: "The research suggests that the coffee market is going to continue to grow at 5, 6, 7% for the next five years, which is pretty much what it's been doing for the last five years. "Coffee in the UK, despite more and more places opening, still has a long way to go to catch up with more developed markets, like the US." Equity analyst Sam Hart said Brains' decision to diversify into coffee shops was "probably partly a reflection of very tough conditions in the on-trade [bar and pub sales] beer market". "The on-trade is under pressure from a combination of pressure on consumers' disposable incomes, rising alcohol duties and the increased availability of relatively cheap beer at the supermarket chains," he added. Mr Hart said the growth in the coffee shop culture in the UK could be viewed as Americanisation. "Obviously coffee has been ingrained in culture in the US for many years and this appears to be spreading to the UK and other developed markets," he said. "Many people view coffee as an affordable luxury on which they are prepared to spend, despite pressures on their disposable incomes."	Wales' largest independent brewer is planning to open about 30 coffee shops over three years as it diversifies from its traditional pub business.
They said they had received an anonymous threat, two days after the killing of five police officers. A nearby parking lot was searched for a "suspicious person" but no-one was found. SWAT officers were earlier deployed at the main building. On Thursday, five white police officers were shot dead by a black man, Micah Johnson, during a protest rally. The march was against the killing of black men by police. Two deaths this week have led to nationwide protests. Dallas police said its officers - using dogs - searched the parking lot but the hunt turned up nothing. In a statement earlier on Saturday, the police said: "The Dallas Police Department received an anonymous threat against law enforcement across the city and has taken precautionary measures to heighten security." An armoured vehicle was moved close to the main HQ in central Dallas and heavily armed officers were seen nearby, according to the Associated Press news agency. But it added that members of the public were still able to walk about freely around the building. The police asked media to stop all live feeds around HQ "for the safety of our officers", the BBC's James Cook reports. The shooting happened late on Thursday during the protest march. Johnson, who was himself killed during the assault, supported black militant groups who encouraged violence against police. Dallas police chief David Brown said Johnson had told a negotiator that he had wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers, because he was angry about the recent shootings of black men by police. The attack came after the police killings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana. Earlier on Saturday, President Barack Obama said the US was "not as divided as some have suggested" in the wake of the shootings involving African-Americans. He said Americans of "all races, all backgrounds", including many of those who were protesting, were outraged by the Dallas killings. As well as the five police officers killed, another seven were injured on Thursday. Two civilians were also hurt. Johnson, 25, who officials say acted alone, was killed by remotely detonated explosives that were sent into a car park where he had taken refuge after the shootings. He was a member of the US Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015 who had served in Afghanistan. Bomb-making material, rifles and a combat journal were found in his home in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite. A number of gun attacks involving police officers and civilians have occurred in other parts of the US in the aftermath of the deaths in Minnesota and Louisiana. Leaders of the Black Lives Matter organisation have condemned the Dallas killings but say planned marches, including a "Weekend of Rage" in Philadelphia, will go ahead.	Dallas police have given the all clear, hours after security levels were raised at their headquarters in the city.

Corrie Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in the town 11 days ago. Suffolk Police said the three young people aged between 16 and 18 were seen at Short Brackland at 04:20 BST on 24 September. They could be "potential witnesses", the force said. For updates on this story, visit BBC Suffolk Live Acting Supt Kim Warner appealed to the trio: "We appreciate that getting in touch with police may be intimidating but we do need to speak to you. "At this stage in the investigation we just need to talk to anyone who may have seen Corrie during his night out so we can build a picture." One of the teenagers is described as a white female, of quite slim build, wearing either a dark green or navy blue jumper-style top. The other two were both males, one wearing a hooded top. They were seen towards the back of Cornhill Walk shopping centre, police said. Acting Supt Warner added: "We need to find Corrie and a number of inquiries are being carried out to do this. "We know from CCTV images that we have already viewed that he engaged with a number of people during his evening out. "We have had several calls but still need to talk to anyone who may have seen him or spoken to him during the early hours." Mr Mckeague was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating fast food in Bury St Edmunds at 03:20 on 24 September. It is thought he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.	Police searching for a missing RAF serviceman want to trace three teenagers spotted in Bury St Edmunds on the day of his disappearance.
The men were believed to have been working on the northbound carriageway of the A361 at Gornhay Cross, Tiverton, when they were hit. One was flown to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, while a second Devon Air Ambulance flew the other man to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. The van driver has been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving. The condition of the two injured men, who are both in their 40s, is not known. Devon and Cornwall Police said a third man was hurt in the incident, but he is described as the "walking wounded". The Barnstaple-bound carriageway is expected to remain closed for several hours and diversions have been put in place.	Two road workers have been seriously hurt in an accident involving a van in mid Devon.
More than 20 people are being treated in hospital with burns and other injuries after the incident in the village of Hitrino, local media say. The authorities ordered an evacuation as firefighters battled the blaze. At least 20 buildings were damaged in the derailment and explosion, spokesperson Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's Nova television. Two tanks hit an electricity line and exploded when the train derailed near the village station at about 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT), according to several reports. "Two blasts have caused a serious fire and ruined at least 20 buildings," Interior Ministry Chief Secretary Georgi Kostov told Reuters news agency. "There are many people injured... many with burns." Hitrino, a town of around 800 people, is located in Bulgaria's north-eastern Shumen province, about 60 miles (100km) from the Black Sea. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov said he was travelling to the village. In a post on social media, he said the regional hospital needed blood supplies to cope with the causalities, and appealed to people in the region to donate blood. Transport Minister Ivalyo Moskovski also said he was travelling to the village. In a brief statement, he said he had ordered both the head of the railway accident investigation task force and a representative of the rail infrastructure company to attend the scene.	A train carrying liquid petroleum gas has derailed and exploded in Bulgaria, killing at least four people.
The 24-year-old, who played 16 games on loan at Kilmarnock last season, will compete with James Tavernier. Hodson started his career at Watford and played 51 games in three seasons at MK Dons after a loan at Brentford. He joins new faces Matt Gilks, Clint Hill, Joey Barton, Niko Kranjcar, Jordan Rossiter, Matt Crooks and Josh Windass at Ibrox. Rangers paid an undisclosed fee for Hodson, who was part of Northern Ireland's squad at Euro 2016, but did not feature in any of their four matches.	Rangers have made right-back Lee Hodson their eighth summer signing on a three-year deal from MK Dons.
The first Championships took place in 1877 at the All England Club in London, where it's still held today. Wimbledon takes place over two weeks and it's the only major championship still played on grass. Here's your guide to the tournament... There are 128 places available in the draw for both men and women. Out of these 32 are ranked or seeded for the purposes of a draw. These seeded players are seen as the best players in the draw and they're kept apart so that they don't meet until later in the competition. In addition there are 16 qualifiers and eight wild cards, players who are given a chance to play even though their world rankings are low. The match is divided up into sets. In men's tennis you have to get three sets to win. For women it's two. To win a set you have to win six games - but you also have to get two more games than your opponent. So you can take the set 6-4, but not 6-5. In that case, you'd continue until someone won 7-5. If you get to 6-6 first, you play a tiebreak. The first person to get to seven points or more by two clear points wins the tiebreak and the set. To win a game you need to win four points. But rather than going up from one to four they go in this order: fifteen, thirty, forty, game. If you are tied on forty-all this is called deuce, and then you have to win by two clear points. The first Ladies' Championship was held in 1884, before that women weren't allowed to take part in Wimbledon. In 2007 women were granted the same amount of prize money as men. The Gentlemen's and Ladies' Singles Champions each receive Â£1.88m in 2015. Now, the only division between men's and women's tennis is the number of sets you have to get to win. Tennis was first played in France about 900 years ago - with people using the palms of their hands. No one really knows how the scoring started, but "deuce" is based on the French word "deux", meaning two, when two people are on the same points. 54,250 tennis balls are used during the Championships period. Yellow tennis balls were used for the first time in 1986. Traditionally Wimbledon fans eat strawberries and cream throughout the competition. A whopping 28,000 kg of strawberries and 7,000 litres of cream are supplied for each Wimbledon Championship. The fastest Wimbledon serve of all time was delivered by Taylor Dent in 2010 - it clocked an amazing 148mph! Seeds - The people expected to do well in a tournament. Set - The main sections of a tennis match (see how to score, above). Straight sets - When someone wins a match without losing a set, eg winning three sets to love. Love - A tennis word for zero. Forehand - When you hit with the palm of your hand facing to the front. Backhand - A shot with the  back of your hand facing front. Deuce - This is another way of saying forty-all. It comes from the French word "deux", meaning two, when two people are on the same point. Baseline - This is the line at the far end of the court. Cyclops - The machine that goes beep to tell if the ball has hit the net on a serve (which means the serve has to be taken again). Serve - When the player hits the ball over the net to start the game. Let - Play the point again. Tiebreak - When the set is drawn at six-all (see how to score, above). Ace - When a player wins a point after serving an unstoppable shot. Smash - A very fast shot hit by a player. Volley - Hitting the ball before it bounces. Double fault - Serving twice out of the court and losing the point. Umpire - The person who decides, like a referee. Spin - Hitting the ball so it spins and bounces so it's hard for the other player to hit (as in 'top spin', 'back spin').	The professional tennis season comprises of hundreds of tournaments around the world and one of the most prestigious is Wimbledon.
Both Jenny Rathbone and Mike Hedges are applying separately to take part in a ballot which, if they win, will allow them to propose a bill to ban the fees. Mr Hedges said the fees were a "tax" on some of society's poorest with students among the biggest hit. But one letting agent said a ban could hit efforts to professionalise the sector. The Welsh Government said it was happy to consider how such legislation might work. The charges have already been banned in Scotland, while the UK government is planning to consult on doing the same in England. There are currently no firm plans to do the same in Wales, although the Welsh Government has said it was "actively considering" the move. Ministers have faced criticism for not acting sooner. AMs from all of the assembly's opposition parties have supported a ban. Assembly members can propose bills - proposals for new laws which when passed by the assembly become acts - from outside the government through a random ballot process. Mr Hedges said: "They are a tax on some of the poorest people in society who are engaged in private rented accommodation." The Swansea East AM said it was a big problem in university cities and a "big problem anywhere where there is more demand for housing then there is housing". Mr Hedges believes that about 20 AMs may apply to take part in the ballot - although only Mr Hedges and Ms Rathbone are currently known to be proposing banning the fees. Cardiff Council AM Jenny Rathbone said Mr Hedges' attempt "doubles the chances of one of us being picked". Catherine Iannucci, 21, originally from Barry and studying her third year of history and politics at Cardiff University, lives in a house with six other tenants. She said they have had to pay Â£80 each to take the home off the market - amounting to a fee of Â£560 for the agency. Ms Iannucci, who is a part of the group Labour Students and has conducted research on agency fees for Ms Rathbone, said: "It's a significant amount of money. "We don't really know what they're for and we don't know what that's gone towards." She also had to pay a deposit of a month's rent, plus Â£50. "In the middle of term, because we look around February time - nobody has that money to just throw away easily. It does put you under a lot pressure for the rest of the term," she said. She said she would be in favour of a ban as long as it meant that rents did not go up as a result. Douglas Haig is the director for Wales and vice-chairman of the Residential Landlords Association - which also owns Cardiff property management company James Douglas Sales and Lettings. He said his firm does charge fees, adding: "There are fees that go to landlord, there are fees that go to the tenant." Mr Haig said he did not condone "sharp practices" in the sector but warned that banning fees may make it harder to professionalise the industry. "If we just outright ban fees, then we're going to have a number of consequences," he said. "The most important is around the professionalisation of the sector... If you are taking away money from the sector, that's going to be very difficult to continue providing quality. "I don't think the vast majority of agents out there are actually profiteering. "There are costs in running these businesses that people are unaware of and as increased state regulation comes in, those costs continue to rise." A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are happy to consider how legislation on this might work. "We want to look at the evidence from Scotland and see wider consultation to ensure that a ban on fees does not push rental costs up." The next scheduled ballot for backbench bills is on 25 January.	Letting agents' fees for tenants could be banned in Wales under proposals from two backbench Labour AMs.
Mrs Morgan has launched a consultation to replace a system she says is "outdated, inefficient and unfair". The funding shake-up will also remove local authorities from the process, with cash going directly to heads. Labour has accused the government of "dodging difficult questions" about who will lose funding in the changes. Mrs Morgan says schools need funding that "genuinely matches their need". She says the plans will ensure money goes "straight to the frontline", but it will mark a further reduction in the link between local authorities and schools. On Monday the education secretary has taken the next step towards introducing a new school funding formula in 2017-18, after complaints about local anomalies and spending gaps. For example, pupils in Rotherham each receive £500 per year more in funding than those in Plymouth, even though they have similar levels of disadvantage. In December, MPs led by former Education Select Committee chairman Graham Stuart presented a petition calling for change, saying the best-funded areas received up to £6,300 per pupil per year, while the worst-funded received £4,200. The government has a manifesto pledge to create a more consistent way to distribute more than £40bn per year of the core schools budget - and says it wants to end funding rates based on "oddities of history". Further details were announced in the Chancellor's Autumn Statement, with the promise of a national rate for each pupil, with extra funding for those with additional needs. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, backed the principle of a fairer redistribution of funding. He also supported a "big shift" in more money going directly to schools. But he warned that there would be both "winners and losers" under a new funding regime and there was still "scant detail" about how this would be decided. There have been warnings that some schools will lose out, particularly in inner London. Christine Blower, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said the proposals would "impose huge funding cuts on many schools unless additional funding is made available. Schools are already suffering real terms cuts to per pupil funding". Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the ASCL head teachers' union, backed the principle of a change to funding arrangements. "However simply redistributing the current pot of money is not enough on its own to address the significant real-terms cuts currently hitting school budgets. Greater investment is needed," said Mr Trobe. The Department for Education says the current system is out of date and no longer reflect levels of need. It says that in the past 10 years, the proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals has doubled in Lincolnshire and nearly halved in Southwark. The education department says that for the new funding formula there will be a basic level of per pupil funding, with extra support allocated depending on need, such as high levels of deprivation or for schools in high-cost areas. For local authority schools, including the majority of primary schools, there will be a two year transition period, in which funding will cease to be distributed through councils. Councils will have a funding role in areas with "high-level special educational needs", but will no longer be involved as a channel for basic funding for schools. Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said:  "Councils know their areas best, and currently work in partnership with head teachers and governors to set local funding formula which allows local needs and priorities to be addressed. "We'd want to see this local conversation continue, rather than having all school budgets set in Whitehall." Academy schools and trusts already receive funding through the government's Education Funding Agency. Labour's shadow education secretary Lucy Powell says that for a national funding formula "the devil will be in the detail" and claimed that the government was stalling on revealing where schools would have reduced levels of funding. She also warned that the overall schools budget would see a real-terms spending cut, which would have a "huge impact". But Mrs Morgan said the changes would provide a fairer allocation of resources. "We want every school in England to get the funding it deserves, so that all children - whatever their background and wherever they live in the country - get a great education."	Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is pushing ahead with a "national funding formula" for schools, to tackle uneven levels of funding across England.
Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane. About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's roster of 3,500 possible trips. The firm's boss, Justin Francis, took the decision after watching a BBC TV programme "Should we close our zoos?" "Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant," he told the BBC. "They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up." Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity. Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK. The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad. It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago. It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species. Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays. Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer. The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation. "[Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments," said the president of Born Free, Will Travers. "A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide," he added. Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision. "They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree", he said.	A leading marketer of "responsible tourism" has decided to stop selling tours that include visits to zoos.
The 32-year-old was released by the Paisley club after making more than 330 appearances over two stints. "He's played at the highest level in Scotland and is top flight quality," manager Ian Murray told the club website. "A player of his calibre opting to join us is a very good sign." A League Cup winner with the Buddies in 2013, Van Zanten, who also had spells at Hibs, Morton and Hamilton, made 18 appearances last season. Van Zanten is the Championship club's second summer signing, following Scott Taggart's move from Morton.	Former St Mirren full-back David van Zanten has joined Dumbarton on a one-year deal, with the option of staying for a further 12 months.
Scotland Yard said the 37-year-old was held at his home address under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Officers from the Metropolitan Police are searching the property. He has been taken to a south London police station and is being questioned by officers from the counter terrorism command unit.	A man has been arrested in north-west London on suspicion of involvement in production of improvised explosive devices in Iraq in 2007.
Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found dead on a beach on the island of Koh Tao on Monday. British brothers Christopher and James Ware were questioned but police now say there is no evidence against them. Officers had said there was "strong evidence" against Burmese suspects, but now say there are no DNA matches. Forensic tests carried out on Ms Witheridge's body revealed traces of semen from two different men, neither of which matched DNA from Mr Miller, the Ware brothers or 11 Burmese people they have been questioning. Meanwhile, Thailand's prime minister has apologised after he appeared to suggest beautiful women in bikinis could not be safe. BBC south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head said police have admitted they "really don't know where to look now". He said investigators had several problems, including that the crime scene was not sealed off and people were not stopped from leaving Koh Tao after the killings. "The impression we got from a police press conference [on Thursday] was they haven't really made much progress at all," he added. He said police were looking for a group of men who were heard singing "Western pop songs" near the crime scene. Post-mortem examinations showed Ms Witheridge, from Hemsby in Norfolk, died from head wounds and Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from severe blows to the head and drowning. Police said Mr Miller also suffered wounds on his hands, which indicated a struggle had taken place. Their bodies were found close to the beach-side bungalows where they had been staying. A garden hoe believed to have been used in the attack was found nearby. Members of Ms Witheridge's family have arrived in Bangkok and had a meeting with Thailand's deputy police chief. British consul Michael Hancock said they were "deeply distressed" and it was "very important for the family" to speak directly to a senior police officer. Thailand's paradise island murder mystery The Ware brothers, believed to be from Jersey, were stopped at Bangkok International Airport as they prepared to leave the country. Police earlier said they were "possible suspects" but did not arrest them. Formally making people suspects is an official judicial process in Thailand. The BBC understands they have now been told they can leave Thailand. British freelance journalist Andrew Drummond, who lives in Bangkok, said the investigation seemed to have followed the "same pattern" as those into previous killings of Britons in Thailand, such as the unsolved murder of Kirsty Jones in 2000. "Police initially seem to always seek the foreigners or the immigrants as the main suspects and that certainly happened in this case," he said. "We've had a week of toing and froing between British suspects and Burmese immigrant suspects and now we find out that... the DNA doesn't match anybody." Speaking earlier this week, Thailand's prime minister appeared to suggest attractive women put themselves in danger by wearing certain clothes. "Can they be safe in bikinis... unless they are not beautiful?" he said. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a military coup in May, has since said: "I'm sorry that it [the comment] hurt people." Ms Witheridge's family described her as "a beautiful, intelligent, loving young woman who poured joy into the lives of all who knew her". In a statement, Mr Miller's family said he was "hard-working, bright and conscientious, with everything to look forward to".	Thai police admit they are struggling to find the killers of two British tourists, after it emerged crime scene DNA did not match that of any suspect.
They are the stars of a new South Korean apocalyptic thriller terrorising audiences and breaking box office records at home and set to open in cinemas across Asia this week. Director Yeon Sang-ho's adrenaline-filled Train to Busan premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. Blood, brains and mayhem all feature prominently as hordes of zombies devour unfortunate passengers trapped on board a bullet train from Seoul. Train to Busan is South Korea's first home-grown zombie offering and has already achieved local box office success, taking a record $5.76m (Â£4.33m) on its opening day in July. The movie starts off with an innocent enough train journey, until a viral outbreak outside starts to infect passengers on board, turning them into the undead. The Korean government eventually declares a state of emergency and martial law. At the heart of the chaos is actor Gong Yoo, a typically-workaholic South Korean businessman travelling with his estranged daughter, oblivious to the unfolding apocalypse. The monsters are fast, really fast, and their attacks lightning speed, putting their Hollywood counterparts from World War Z to shame. Equally terrifying is the infection and the rate at which it spreads rapidly between those unlucky enough to be trapped onboard as the high-speed train races to its final destination. To young Koreans like student Hahn Kwan-woo, 23, it is the film they have been waiting for. "Western films featuring zombies have always been huge hits in our country and there was not a single Korean zombie movie until 'Train to Busan' came out," he said. "Many of my favourite actors also star in the movie." It may have all the predictable elements of a zombie story, but aficionados have also praised the film's uniquely South Korean take on the genre. "With a Mers epidemic [Middle East respiratory syndrome] sweeping South Korea in 2015 and soaring discontent with corruption and economic disparity, a zombie apocalypse serves as a potent allegory for the dog-eat-dog world," film critic Maggie Lee explained in one review. Stunning visual and special effects and "lean, gritty" screenplay also could not have hurt its chances of domestic success. Other critics praised the "brilliant" choice of setting on a Korean bullet train. "I even have a friend who loved it because she takes the same train every time she goes home," said Mr Hahn. But timing was also key, due to the appetite for summertime horror movies, said Jean Lee, a journalist and Wilson Center Global Fellow who also teaches Korean culture and film courses. "South Korean horror films really took off in the late 1990s and 'Train to Busan' is a new twist on the horror genre," she told BBC News from Seoul. "Most horror movies here are released in the summer, when the heat and humidity send people into air-conditioned theatres for movies that quite literally send a chill up their spines." Of course the best part about zombie movies is getting to see the best and worst of humanity, as the world comes to an end. "'Train to Busan': Best zombie scare ever. This is coming from someone who can't even watch 'The Walking Dead'," wrote one fan on Twitter, referencing the popular US drama series. Some even proclaimed it the "best zombie movie" they have ever seen. Fans like 24-year-old Oh Won-heo hope the movie will propel home-grown horror films to an international audience. "When people mention Asian horror, they think of Japan. But Korean horror tales are truly frightening and I hope 'Train to Busan' will make the world realise that our local movies are just as scary - or even better." However, he added: "For my sake, I hope Hollywood will not ruin it with a remake." On that point he may be out of luck - European and US film studios are already reported to be vying to make their own version.	Snakes on planes are old hat - it's zombies on trains you need to worry about this year.
Mr Johnson, who returned to the Commons at the election, told LBC he would be best placed to continue to fight expansion by staying in Parliament. The Conservative manifesto said the party would "take account" of the Davies Commission into runway options. The report, which has two Heathrow and one Gatwick options, is due next month. Mr Johnson has been an outspoken opponent of further expansion at Heathrow. He told LBC that if it did go ahead there would have to be a new congestion charge zone around it to tackle the traffic and pollution caused. Fellow Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith has pledged to quit the party and force a by-election if the Conservatives - who scrapped Labour plans for a third runway in 2010 - complete a U-turn on the issue of Heathrow expansion. 'Filed vertically' In his acceptance speech on being elected MP for Uxbridge, Mr Johnson said he would lie down "in front of those bulldozers and stop the building, stop the construction of that third runway" at Heathrow. Asked on his regular radio phone-in show if he would resign, Mr Johnson pointed out he did not have a government job to resign from - on Monday he was named as someone who would attend the Conservatives' political cabinet in Downing Street while concentrating on his final year as London mayor and being an MP. He was then asked by Nick Ferrari if he would force a by-election. Mr Johnson said he thought he "would be best off staying in Parliament to fight the case". He added that he thought Heathrow was "undeliverable" and that if the Davies Commission did choose a new runway there as its preferred option, he hoped it would be "filed vertically [shelved]" as a series of other reviews in past decades had been.	London Mayor Boris Johnson has said he would not quit as an MP if a Conservative government approved a third runway at Heathrow.
Media playback is not supported on this device Eighth-tier Taunton were playing their ninth game in this season's competition and were the lowest-ranked side left after Westfields' exit on Monday. Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams. But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13. Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession. Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over. But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards. Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner. But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Media playback is not supported on this device The 23-year-old earned GB's second medal of the Hong Kong championships following Elinor Barker's silver medal in the women's scratch on Wednesday. Latham emerged from the pack to take bronze as he chased down Adrian Teklinski of Poland, who won gold, and Lucass Liss of Germany, who got silver. In the men's team pursuit, GB were beaten to the bronze medal by Italy. Media playback is not supported on this device "I am really happy to come away with a medal, finally," Latham told the BBC. "I wasn't sure that Teklinski was going to hold on there. "I was in a decent position most of the time. I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out." Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go. And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride. Olympic gold medallist Chris Boardman "Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there. "We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him. "But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there. "More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that." Six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy "I don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in. "But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race. "He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team." Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson. The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress. She told the BBC: "It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting. "The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in. "Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds." Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: "Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal. "Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them." Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round. The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong. The former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday. Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin. "I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected," she said. "I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great. "I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo."

Giving evidence for the ex-Sunderland winger at Bradford Crown Court, Stacey Flounders said she did not see a future in their relationship. The 26-year-old is the mother of Mr Johnson's one-year-old daughter. Mr Johnson, 28, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child. In the witness box, Miss Flounders described how he had told her "everything" about kissing a 15-year-old girl when he returned from a police station after his arrest in March last year. Asked if he talked about other things, she said: "The other women that he cheated on me with." Miss Flounders was asked by Orlando Pownall QC, defending, how many there were and she said: "Quite a few." When questioned about about the future of her relationship with Mr Johnson, she replied: "We're just going to remain friends." She told the jury she had stayed with him after his arrest "because he was honest with me and I knew he was telling the truth". "We'd just had a daughter. I wanted us to be a family. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what was going on." Mr Pownall finished his questions by asking Miss Flounders if she saw any future in "the relationship that you had". She replied: "Do you mean now? Not at the minute, I don't. No." She was asked about messages she exchanged with Mr Johnson on the day of the incident with the girl, and she admitted she suspected him of being unfaithful but had no "hard and fast evidence". She said he first told her he was going to plead guilty around September last year. Miss Flounders said she had previously exchanged messages with the teenager involved after she recognised her as one of the fans who waited for Mr Johnson after home matches. She said she even wished the girl happy birthday in 2014. She added that after his arrest, Mr Johnson told her the girl was aged 16. Kate Blackwell, QC, prosecuting, went through some of the details of the teenager's account of the incident and asked Miss Flounders whether her partner had told her about each. Miss Blackwell asked her if he told her the pair had kissed with tongues and about various messages Mr Johnson had exchanged with the girl. Miss Flounders agreed that he had not told her, although she said he had mentioned he asked for a "thank you kiss". Earlier, Miss Flounders was asked a series of questions about her partner's pubic hair and was asked to examine a photograph. The teenager involved in the incident has told the jury Mr Johnson was shaved in that area. Miss Flounders said he would trim the area with scissors, but would not shave. Mr Johnson began his football career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland in 2012. He has previously pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.  These relate to him kissing the girl in his Range Rover after exchanging messages with her on social media. But he denies two further charges of sexual activity with a child relating to the same incident.	The ex-girlfriend of former England footballer Adam Johnson has told a jury they split up after he admitted cheating on her with "quite a few" women.

In its annual report, the charity said its local workers carried out a total of 349 counselling sessions with children at risk of suicide in 2015/16. The callers considered most at risk were aged between 12 and 15. Across the UK as whole, the number of calls from suicidal children almost doubled from the total five years ago. The figure show that youngsters plagued by suicidal thoughts contacted Childline 19,481 times throughout the UK last year - an average of one call every 30 minutes. The charity also said girls were more likely to seek its help than boys. Geraldine McConaghy, a senior supervisor with Childline Northern Ireland, said suicidal thoughts were a result of the "pressures that young people are under". "They might have poor mental health, they might be feeling pressure from school, pressure within the family," she said. "When they come to us, what we've noticed is that, on average, one child in Northern Ireland contacts Childline each day who is feeling suicidal." One 17-year-old girl who contacted the charity last year said she was having difficulties coping at college and finding the lessons "a struggle". "In the past, I've had to take some time off because I've been suffering with mental health problems," the caller told Childline staff. "Sometimes I feel so stressed and useless; I just have to walk out. "I sometimes feel like I want to die." Childline Northern Ireland's service manager, Mairead Monds, said: "We need to understand that there are children and young people living in Northern Ireland that are experiencing significant mental health problems, self-esteem issues, isolation and feelings of worthlessness. "These are children who have very little support and who very often feel that life is simply not worth living."	Childline received a call from children experiencing suicidal thoughts in Northern Ireland almost every day over the course of last year.
In an even first leg of few chances, Walsh's quality hit from range with 16 minutes remaining gave the English league champions the edge. City should have gone ahead through Scotland's Jane Ross, but she hesitated after rounding the Brondby goalkeeper. The Danish side host the second leg on Wednesday, 16 November. Facing an organised Brondby outfit who have reached the semi-finals on three occasions, City struggled to create chances in the first half but right-back Lucy Bronze did force a good low save from visiting keeper Katrine Abel. The hosts could have gone behind, but England stopper Karen Bardsley was alert to produce a low, one-handed save to deny Nanna Christiansen. After half-time the energetic Ross raced clear and calmly rounded Abel, but, with the goal gaping, defender Simone Sorensen had time to recover and intercept the danger. As City began to dominate, England Under-19 international Walsh produced the game's finest moment, finding the far corner with a crisp effort from outside the area which capped another excellent individual performance in the holding role. City, who won a domestic double in 2016 by adding the Continental Cup to their maiden league title, have now kept 20 clean sheets in 26 matches in all competitions this year. Brondby pushed for an away goal late on but Bardsley tipped away Veje Katrine's curling effort in the closing stages - a save which could prove crucial. City manager Nick Cushing was full of praise for young star Walsh after the game, hailing her as one of the best midfielders in the FA Women's Super League. "I'm glad she scored because I think her performances have been up there with the best, if not the best, players in the league," he told BBC Sport. "She's been one of our key performers consistently. "Her main attribute is her game intelligence. She's bright, she understands the game and technically her passing range is really good. "We haven't even seen the best of her yet, she's got real potential." Manchester City: Bardsley, Bronze, Stokes, Beattie, Houghton (capt).

Former Pompey shot stopper Carson brilliantly prevented Michael Smith's powerful header and Michael Doyle's 20-yard pile driver, He then blocked a Conor Chaplin header in stoppage time as the hosts missed out on the opportunity to put more pressure on the top three. Pompey, unchanged for a fourth successive game, looked the more likely to score throughout, Gary Roberts the first to put pressure on the Pools goal as he won the ball on the touchline before dragging wide on the edge of the box. Winger Kyle Bennett was next in the queue to see a sight of Carson's goal, his give-and-go with Smith was excellent but he hooked his finish past the post, and then Gareth Evans and Roberts both had further first-half efforts. Hartlepool had shipped 11 in their last three matches in all competitions and not scored in seven fixtures against Pompey, and hardly threatened on this occasion. Carl Baker twisted and turned himself into a shooting position for the hosts after the break but his chance was deflected over, before substitute Chaplin air kicked at Kal Naismith's cross.

Research shows Europeans are a mixture of three major ancestral populations - indigenous hunters, Middle Eastern farmers and a population that arrived from the east in the Bronze Age. DNA from ancient remains in the Caucasus has now revealed a fourth population that fed into the mix. Details are published in Nature Communications. Scientific advances in recent years have allowed researchers to retrieve and analyse genomes from ancient burials. The genome is the genetic blueprint for a human, contained within the nucleus of every cell. This deluge of data has transformed our understanding of the modern human genetic landscape. It has also shown that present-day genetic patterns are poor guides to ancient ones. The first layer of European ancestry, the indigenous hunter-gatherers, entered Europe before the Ice Age 40,000 years ago. But 7,000 years ago, they were swept up in a migration of people from the Middle East, who introduced farming to Europe. About 5,000 years ago, herders called the Yamnaya entered Europe from the eastern Steppe region - in present day Ukraine and Russia. These horse riding metal workers may have brought Indo-European languages with them; today this language family comprises most of the tongues spoken in Europe. The discovery of plague DNA in Yamnaya burials and a population decline in Europe around the same time has led some researchers to wonder if their passage west was facilitated by the spread of disease. The Yamnaya transformed the gene pools of northern and central Europe, such that some populations, like Norwegians, owe around 50% of their ancestry to these Steppe pastoralists. But the Yamnaya were themselves a mixed population. Around half of their ancestry came from a sister group to the hunter-gatherers who inhabited Europe before farming, while the other half appears to be from a population related to - but noticeably different from - the Middle Eastern migrants who introduced farming. Researchers have now analysed genomes from two hunter-gatherers from Georgia that are 13,300 and 9,700 years old. The results show that these Caucasus hunters were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamnaya. The Caucasus hunter-gatherer genomes show a continued mixture with their Middle Eastern cousins to the south, who would go on to invent farming 10,000 years ago. However, this mixing ended about 25,000 years ago - just before the time of the last glacial maximum, or peak of the Ice Age. At this point, populations shrank - as shown by their genes homogenising, a sign of breeding between those with increasingly similar DNA. Once the ice retreated, the Caucasus groups came into contact with a different group of hunter-gatherers living on the Steppe and mixed with them, laying the genetic foundations of the Yamnaya people. "The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now," said co-author Dr Andrea Manica, from the University of Cambridge. "We can now answer that as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation." The researchers also suggest that the Caucasus hunter-gatherers influenced populations further east, particularly in South Asia. They suggest that this strand of ancestry may also have been associated with the spread of Indo-European languages to the region.	Geneticists have detected a fourth ancestral "tribe" which contributed to the modern European gene pool.
Nuclear war, global warming and genetically-engineered viruses are among the scenarios he singles out. And he says that further progress in science and technology will create "new ways things can go wrong". Prof Hawking is giving this year's BBC Reith Lectures, which explore research into black holes, and his warning came in answer to audience questions. He says that assuming humanity eventually establishes colonies on other worlds, it will be able to survive. "Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years. "By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race. "However, we will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period." Prof Hawking's first Reith Lecture will be broadcast on 26 January and on 2 February at 9am on BBC Radio 4. BBC World Service listeners can tune in on 26 January at 15:06 GMT and 2 February at 15:06 GMT or catch up online via www.bbc.com/worldserviceradio BBC News online will be publishing the text of Prof Hawking's lectures with accompanying notes by our science editor, David Shukman. iWonder: A brief history of Stephen Hawking It is ironic that such a prominent figure in science identifies scientific progress itself as the major source of new threats. On previous occasions, he has highlighted the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming powerful enough to cause the extinction of the human race. But he insists that ways will be found to cope. "We are not going to stop making progress, or reverse it, so we have to recognise the dangers and control them. I'm an optimist, and I believe we can." Asked for advice for young scientists, Prof Hawking said they should retain a sense of wonder about "our vast and complex" Universe. "From my own perspective, it has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoretical physics. There is nothing like the Eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before." But he also said that future generations of researchers should be aware of how scientific and technological progress is changing the world, and to help the wider public understand it. "It's important to ensure that these changes are heading in the right directions. In a democratic society, this means that everyone needs to have a basic understanding of science to make informed decisions about the future. "So communicate plainly what you are trying to do in science, and who knows, you might even end up understanding it yourself." Since his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, Prof Hawking's determination to overcome the immense physical challenges of his disability has been a source of worldwide admiration and fascination. His daughter Lucy, a journalist and writer, who has co-written children's science books with Prof Hawking, was asked to explain his drive. "I think he's enormously stubborn and has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going," she said. "But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival, but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work, writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities, and being a family man, a friend and a colleague to so many people and keeping up with friends across the world."

The Sri Lankan shared a second-wicket stand of 187 with opener Rory Burns (80) as Surrey reached 394-5 at stumps. Sangakkara was dropped at first slip by Craig Overton on nine but went on to hit 24 fours and four sixes to register his 56th first-class century. Jason Roy hit an attacking 85 before he was out lbw to seamer Lewis Gregory in the final over of the day. Sangakkara passed 1,000 first-class runs for Surrey in just his 22nd innings before he was out caught at deep cover by Overton off Tim Groenewald. Zafar Ansari, making his return from a dislocated thumb sustained against Lancashire late last season, struck five fours in an unbeaten 28 before play ended. Media playback is not supported on this device Surrey batsman Kumar Sangakkara told BBC Radio London: "I think after the Nottingham game it was important we got off to a good start in the first game at home. "They way everyone went about their batting, the application and the intent they showed, was very good. "Burnsy and Jason were outstanding. It was very easy to bat with them because they kept putting pressure on the bowlers and putting the bad balls away. "It made my batting a lot easier for me because I saw a positive intent all the time from the other end."	Kumar Sangakkara hit a superb 171 as Surrey's batsman dominated the opening day against Somerset at The Oval.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Gunners had two penalty claims denied and had chances to win the game through Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck. Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic made a string of saves, most notably touching Joel Campbell's free-kick on to a post. The Tigers created little, but defended admirably to frustrate Arsene Wenger in his 100th FA Cup game as Arsenal boss. The two sides made a total of 19 changes between them from their previous games - nine for Arsenal and 10 for Hull. But Steve Bruce's Tigers not only ended a 14-game winning run in the FA Cup for the Gunners, they also prevented a repeat of their defeats by the Londoners in the 2014 final and last season's third round. Relive Arsenal's draw with Hull Media playback is not supported on this device Arsenal's priorities undoubtedly lie elsewhere, with Wenger's side only two points off the top of the Premier League and a visit of Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie coming up on Tuesday. Europe is particularly pressing for the Gunners, who have failed to go past the last 16 in any of the past five seasons, which meant there was no place for key man Mesut Ozil in the squad, while Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez were restricted to contributions from the bench. Despite the team bearing little resemblance to the XI that started in the 2-1 win over Leicester City last week, the Gunners were good enough to control the game from start to finish and created enough chances to have secured a comfortable victory. However, the draw means Arsenal are still in with a chance of becoming the first team to win three consecutive FA Cups since Blackburn Rovers accomplished the feat 130 years ago. It is not only Arsenal who have distractions away from the FA Cup this term, as Hull continue their bid to return to the Premier League after last season's relegation. Only Curtis Davies remained in the side from last week's draw with Brighton, and the former Aston Villa defender blocked, headed and tracked runners enthusiastically alongside Alex Bruce and Harry Maguire in a defensive three. Hull boss Bruce could be forgiven for the pragmatism in his team selection, as his men are in the midst of a run of 10 games in 35 days, which will now become even more congested thanks to the replay. And while his team's resilience with have pleased the former Birmingham City manager, he will also have been delighted by the performance of 16-year-old Josh Tymon, who looked confident and composed at left full-back. Arsenal's only issue came in front of goal, as they moved the ball around with precision to carve out 24 shots - 11 on target - compared to the six shots mustered by Hull. But they could not find a way past Jakupovic, who allowed himself a self-congratulatory moment after taking time out to watch a replay of one of his saves on the big screen at the Emirates. January signing Elneny, making only his second start for the Gunners, put in a standout performance for the home side. The Egypt international was always available for the ball in midfield and dictated the pace for Arsenal from the middle of the park. And there were promising signs from 19-year-old Nigerian Iwobi, who found plenty of space behind striker Theo Walcott to attempt through balls into a congested Hull penalty area, only for the hosts to draw a blank every time. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "The replay is not especially good news but Hull defended very well. "We were not incisive or accurate enough in our passing in the final third. As long as they did not concede, they maintained with how they played. We had 20 shots, 70% possession, but no goals. "I cannot influence the referee's decisions, only the technical quality of my team. If we have no injuries, we can cope with the fixtures. "I think FA Cup replays is a particularity of the English rules and you have to respect that." Media playback is not supported on this device Hull manager Steve Bruce: "I don't know when we're going to play the replay. That's added to the fixture pile-up we've got. "We made 10 changes and we rode our luck a bit, but the team deserved it for the spirit and the 100% effort they gave. "It bodes well when I see the strength in depth we've got, because we're going to need it. "Josh Tymon didn't look out of his depth and it's great to see someone from the academy, from Hull, come in and wear the shirt." Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic: "My little daughter, my father, everybody is here. We knew it would be a difficult game and would be defend all game. We got a 0-0 and I hope the replay will be the same." Arsenal have the small matter of the visit of five-time European champions Barcelona on Tuesday, for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.

Following the announcement of the new global calendar in March, Premiership Rugby confirmed the 2019-20 domestic season will start in early September and finish at the end of June. Leicester's Tom Youngs had said the proposal "fills players with dread". The RPA has now said a shortened two-month off-season will be "seriously detrimental to player welfare". Premiership Rugby has previously said the 10-month campaign will allow clubs to become "more sophisticated" in their management of players, with chief executive Mark McCafferty insisting player welfare remains the priority. But an RPA statement on Monday read: "The Premiership season is already longer than comparable contact sports, including Super League, NFL and AFL. "Extending an already arduous season from nine months to 10 has serious implications for players, given the potential increase to the game, training and psychological loads they face. "The physical and mental strain placed on participants of professional contact sport cannot be underestimated." England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland will all be playing international matches in June this summer, while the British and Irish Lions are also touring New Zealand. The RPA has concerns that an extended season could overwork any players involved in future international summer tours - a worry shared by Tigers captain Youngs. "Perhaps most worryingly is the incredible strain these proposals would place on international players," the statement continued. "If the Premiership season retains its current start date, the addition of a July tour schedule will lead to an 11-month season for these players. "This cannot be avoided unless these players start their domestic season later, which brings into question the need for the season extension."	The Rugby Players' Association has "unanimously rejected" proposals for an extended 10-month Premiership season.
We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia. What we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin. We travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages. What we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people. We met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast. Let's call him Kamrul Rahman. He appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up. As the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked. He said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them. It seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost. He said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about Â£1,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand. I was amazed. "So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?" I asked. "Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger", he told me, without any sign of emotion. "If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour." We spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh. They all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made. What this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party. The so-called "ransoms" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey. Take a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys. They are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp. Stina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into. If you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers. The migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like. Meanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid. The model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier. It seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand. But other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty. We were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (Â£260/$400) back to his family each month. But many, many migrants don't make it. Within minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters). Some said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family. According to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia. Many die before they even reach the camps, he told me. "Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food. "All people have to die", he said, "that is fate."	Over the last couple of weeks, the world has woken up to the horrific trade in human beings being conducted in the seas of South East Asia.
Choupo-Moting, 28, is their fourth signing of the summer after Darren Fletcher, Kurt Zouma and Josh Tymon. "Eric has been on our radar for several years and we actually tried to bring him to the club four years ago," chief executive Tony Scholes said. Stoke open their Premier League season with a trip to Everton on Saturday. Choupo-Moting, who has also played for Hamburg and Mainz, has made 200 Bundesliga appearances and played in the Champions League with Schalke. A former Germany youth international, he switched international allegiance to Cameroon in 2010. He represented the Indomitable Lions at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and has won 48 caps, scoring 13 goals. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Stoke City have signed Cameroon winger Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a three-year deal after his contract ran out at German club Schalke.
He says that he's found the engines from the Apollo 11 space rocket - the craft that carried the first men to the moon in 1969. The five engines broke off from the spaceship after blast off and crashed somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. He's now planning on trying to bring one of them to the surface. Mr Bezos paid for a team to use advanced sonar scanning equipment to track down the lost F-1 engines. They were found 4,300 metres below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, but he hasn't said exactly where they were spotted. In a blog post about the discovery he wrote: "I was five years old when I watched Apollo 11 unfold on television, and without any doubt it was a big contributor to my passions for science, engineering, and exploration." He said he was going to ask Nasa, which owns the rockets, for permission to display one of the engines in the Museum of Flight in his home city of Seattle.	Internet giant Amazon's owner Jeff Bezos has made an amazing underwater discovery.
Mark Jones, 43, who had been in hospital since the incident on 26 July, died on Saturday. Two men have been charged with attempted murder and having a shotgun following the shooting on New Road, Mountain Ash. South Wales Police said a review of those charges would now take place. Edward Bennett, 47, from Mountain Ash, and Stephen Bennett, 52, from Pontypridd, were both remanded in custody after appearing at Cardiff Crown Court in August. Det Ch Insp Ceri Hughes said: "Our thoughts are with Mark's family who are being supported by a family liaison officer at this difficult time. "A review of charges in relation to the two men in custody will now take place."	A man who was in a critical condition after a shooting in Rhondda Cynon Taff two months ago has now died, police said.
Jean-Yves Le Drian, who is visiting Mali, said a force of 1,000 would be left in place. France intervened militarily in January to oust Islamist militants who had taken over the north of the country. A UN force in Mali, Minusma, was due to number 12,000 by now - but is still less than half of that. At the height of the crisis, France had a force of about 4,500 in its former colony. In July, France handed over responsibility for security to Minusma - which has incorporated West African troops who backed the French offensive. But France's timetable to withdraw most of its forces by the end of the year has slipped. The 1,000 French soldiers left in Mali are intended to help fight the al-Qaeda-linked groups still targeting the vast desert northern region. "We will remain by the side of the Malian army, and also Minusma, for as long as it takes," AFP news agency quotes Mr Le Drian as saying. On Monday, UN peacekeepers found a large cache of explosives while on patrol near the northern town of Kidal. UN spokesman Olivier Salgado said the quantity of ammonium nitrate found could be used to make between 20 to 25 car bombs, the Associated Press news agency reports.	France is to reduce the number of its troops in Mali over the next three months by 60%, the French defence minister has said.
The 53-year-old man, identified as Ramu Chavan, was accosted by traffic police after they received multiple calls from people who saw him. Police told BBC Hindi that Mr Chavan had confessed to beheading his wife but did not divulge a motive. Police suspect he is mentally unstable and are seeking more information. He worked as a watchman at a building currently under construction, police said. Videos and images of Mr Chavan walking around the city with the severed head are being circulated on Indian social media. Police told BBC Hindi that he appeared to be walking towards the police station even before he was accosted by officers. Meanwhile the relatives of the murdered woman, identified as Sonubai, have arrived in the city, and police are trying to get more information about Chavan from them.	A man in the western Indian city of Pune has been held after carrying his wife's severed head down a busy road, police say.
Moments after Chris Evans announced he was stepping down as a presenter on Top Gear, Twitter users took to social media to comment about the number of recent high-profile resignations in politics and sport. The writer Will Black started the hashtag #SuggestAJobForFarage after Nigel Farage stepped down as UKIP leader on Monday morning. So it was probably inevitable that the Top Gear presenter's vacancy was among the job opportunities suggested on social media for Mr Farage. Others thought another political figure should be considered for the post, although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is not considering any new career opportunities. As social media bets were placed on who should take up Evans's now vacant post, some Twitter users suggested Boris Johnson as a possible replacement. While others thought there was only one man for the job. @RobertRobmurphy tweeted: "Bring back Jeremy Clarkson." Another Twitter user suggested Matt Le Blanc's co-star in Friends should join him on the show. @_EveStarks posted: "Really hope they replace Chris Evans with Matthew Perry so the Friends bromance can continue." Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow threw his hat into the ring. And there were some rank outsiders for the position.

The neighbours entered the burning property in Milford Drive, on Sunday afternoon in an attempt to rescue two cats, police said. The occupants were not home at the time. The women had inhaled smoke and were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. The cats were unharmed. Fire destroyed the front door and caused heavy smoke damage to the house. Dorset Police said it believed the fire had been started deliberately through the cat flap in the front door of the property at about 15:00 BST. Officers are appealing for witnesses or anyone with CCTV to get in touch. Det Con Luke Davis said: "I am appealing to anyone who saw suspicious activity near to the property during that afternoon, particularly anyone seen in the garden or the front drive of the property just before 3pm, to please contact me. "If you have any information about the cause or motive of the fire, please contact Dorset Police or call Crimestoppers anonymously."	Two women have been rescued following a suspected arson attack on a house in Bournemouth.
They started arriving at Poldhu Cove on the Lizard on Sunday, and National Trust volunteers have been clearing them away as they are said to pose a risk to wildlife. The bottles are sealed, but witnesses say some have leaked. The National Trust said it believed a container had gone overboard from a ship, during the stormy weather. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "While it is fact that the MV Blue Ocean lost a container containing bottles of 'Vanish', there is no currently available evidence that the bottles washed up on the Cornish coast are from this container; all evidence is currently circumstantial." It is thought the vessel lost the container near Land's End in May. The BBC has contacted Vanish, but the company is yet to comment. Other nearby coves including Gunwalloe, Polurrian, Church Cove and Marazion have also been affected, conservationists said. Cornwall Wildlife Trust said it was "highly concerned" about the impact on "sensitive marine life". Justin Whitehouse, from the National Trust, said: "The main worry is all that detergent going into our beautiful marine environment, but thankfully most are full. "We think it's a container that has gone overboard from a container ship, during stormy seas." Cornwall Council said the authority and partners, including the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Natural England, would be monitoring beaches in the area. It said: "The National Trust who own the beach at Poldhu have arranged for the bottles to be cleared away. "In the meantime the public are advised to keep children and dogs at a safe distance from the bottles should any more be washed up. "No attempt should be made to recover the bottles."	Thousands of bright pink plastic detergent bottles have washed up on beaches in Cornwall.
The 28-year-old left Rovers after their National League promotion final defeat by Grimsby earlier this month. He made 33 league appearances this season, scoring six goals from defence, and has previously played for the likes of Cambridge and Mansfield. "I spoke to Gary last week and was delighted to join a great club, moving in the right direction," he said. "There was interest elsewhere but when I had a good couple of hour chat with Gary last week and was happy with his vision."

Police said the 41-year-old former Strictly Come Dancing contestant, from Virginia Water in Surrey, was arrested in Eton, Berkshire, on Saturday. Ms Gallacher, who works for Sky Sports, has been bailed to appear at Slough Magistrates' Court on 4 September. Thames Valley Police said she was charged with one count of "driving a motor vehicle when alcohol level was above the legal limit".	Television presenter Kirsty Gallacher has been charged with drink-driving.
Wolves started brightly and Nouha Dicko gave them the lead, beating Rob Green with a low first-time shot on the run. Leeds turned up the pressure after the break, but Andy Lonergan saved from Souleymane Doukara and Kortney Hause cleared off the line to keep it 1-0. Fulham's 3-1 win over Aston Villa and Sheffield Wednesday's 2-1 victory at QPR sees Leeds drop into seventh place. Despite losing their past two Championship matches, Wolves dominated the opening exchanges, with Green having to come out quickly and make a low save one-on-one from Andreas Weimann. Dave Edwards forced another Green stop and Dicko went close, cutting inside and firing narrowly wide before the goal their pressure deserved finally came. The 24-year-old striker latched onto Ben Marshall's clever through-ball behind the defence and found the bottom corner before Green could set himself. Leeds rallied, but Pontus Jansson could not hit the target with a free header and Lonergan produced a reflex save to keep out Doukara's header from Kemar Roofe's cutback. Wolves sat back and invited pressure, with Hause clearing Roofe's looping header off the line from a corner and Chris Wood heading over late on, but the away side hung on to claim the points. The win secures Wolves' Championship status for another season on 54 points, while Leeds' third loss in five games puts them out of the play-offs on goal difference with three matches remaining. Leeds manager Garry Monk: "We're disappointed with that result. "We didn't want that to happen at this stage of the season but we've had the mentality for so long where we've been in the play-offs quite comfortably and have kind of been in that protective mode of trying to stay in there. "Now we have to change that mentality to be a team that goes on the hunt and lets it all go. "It's still a really good situation for us. We've got no time to feel sorry for ourselves, that doesn't get you anywhere." Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "We were excellent and should have been two or three up in the first half. "We were strong defensively in the second half and a threat on the break." Match ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1. Second Half ends, Leeds United 0, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1.

They show that there has been an overall increase of 53% in the number of women being treated for the disease in the last 20 years. The rise was described as dramatic by Royal Victoria Hospital statisticians. Dr Anna Gavin, who led the research, said the health system needs to prepare itself as the figures are set to climb. "I think the services need to gear themselves up because we have done some work looking at past trends," Dr Gavin said. "We see that, in total, the cancer number is expected to increase by two thirds again, about 65% in 20 years. "The service needs to be aware of that. We need to be thinking of ways to cope because it is largely driven by the aging population." Meanwhile, one woman who is living with the disease is calling for greater awareness of inflammatory breast cancer. Lynette McHendry, from County Antrim, is due to have both breasts removed next week. The 37-year-old patient said she believed some inflammatory breast cancer cases are being misdiagnosed. The mother of two is appealing to clinicians to become more aware of the symptoms surrounding this aggressive disease, after her cancer went undetected for over a month. "The symptoms I had were a pain in my left breast - it was hard, tender and heavy," Mrs McHendry said. "It started to swell up and ended up twice the size. It also became red, inflamed and the skin became dimply. And there was no lump." She is in the unusual position of having invasive or regular cancer in one breast and inflammatory cancer in the other. The latter went undetected because, in cases of inflammatory breast cancer, a lump does not appear in the mammogram. Mrs McHendry is one of the almost 2,800 women who were referred last year to the Belfast Cancer centre. Ninety-three percent of those cases were not malignant - but hers was. Mrs McHendry said that although women are better educated about breast cancer, there is little or no public information about inflammatory breast cancer. "I had to join a support group online based in England," she said. "By talking to those women, including one woman from Larne, I discovered so many weren't diagnosed until much later in their cancer journey, which can make a difference between being diagnosed at stage 3 or stage 4."	New figures from the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry show there has been a dramatic rise in the numbers of women being diagnosed with breast cancer.
Two special concerts at the Royal Albert Hall will see pupils perform their own response to 10 pieces of classic music. The Ten Pieces project was announced last year as part of an initiative to inspire primary school children to learn more about classical music. Each Prom will feature pupils playing music, as well as dance, film and animation. The schoolchildren's work will run alongside the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, which will play the original 10 pieces of music, which include Mozart, Handel and Holst. Blue Peter's Barney Harwood and children's TV presenters Dick and Dom will host the concerts on 18 and 19 July, the opening weekend of this year's Proms. The Saturday concert will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 3, while the Sunday concert will be recorded for future broadcast on BBC Radio 2. Last June, the BBC announced ten pieces of classical music aimed at inspiring schoolchildren to create their own works. Since October 2014, some 8,500 primary school pupils have signed up to take part in the scheme, which offers musical workshops from local arts organisations as well as an online film about classical music, which has been seen by more than 120,000 children so far. The schoolchildren are being invited to submit their "creative responses" to the music to the Ten Pieces website, as either films, audio recordings or images, by the end of March. The full 2015 BBC Proms season will be announced in April.

Cook made an unbeaten half-century against the tourists for South Africa A in a warm-up match before the series. The 33-year-old is the son of former Proteas Test batsman Jimmy Cook. England have already won the four-match series and lead it 2-0 after beating South Africa by seven wickets in Johannesburg on Saturday. "Stephen has been in excellent form this season and gives us another option at the top of the order," said chief selector Linda Zondi. He looks set to replace the out-of-form Stiaan van Zyl, who has made just 69 runs in five innings at the top of the order. Cook has scored two centuries and a 76 in his past three matches for the Highveld Lions. Dale Steyn retains his place in a 17-man squad for the match, but is thought to be struggling with the shoulder injury that has kept him out of the past two Tests. Quinton de Kock is also set to return as wicketkeeper. He was ruled out of the third Test after injuring his knee while walking his dogs, but his replacement Dane Vilas has not been included this time. South Africa squad: AB de Villiers (c), Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Stephen Cook, Quinton de Kock (wkt), JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl, Hardus Viljoen.	Uncapped opener Stephen Cook has been added to the South Africa squad for the final Test against England, which starts in Pretoria on Friday.
A trailer was taken from Burton's Foods Ltd on Ty Coch Way, Cwmbran, Torfaen on 17 June. The two men, from Liverpool and Cheshire, had been charged with theft. A hearing at Newport Magistrates' Court heard a third man will appear in court in relation to the alleged theft on Friday.	The case against two men accused of stealing £20,000 of biscuits from the makers of Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels has been dropped.
Until mid-July, her main worry was getting the right grades for medical school. Now Chilla and her fellow pupils are faced with Turkish accusations that their school has links to a terrorist organisation. Kharisma Bangsa school is one of hundreds across the world that Turkey wants to shut down because they have links to a US-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen. The cleric is held responsible by the Ankara government for the failed July coup in which more than 270 people died. And Turkey argues the schools are part of a strategy to undermine the state. But pupils, teachers and parents interviewed in several countries say they have no links to suspicious activities. Turkey looks to close Gulen schools Who are the Gulenists? Who is Fethullah Gulen? Turkey coup: Who was behind Turkey coup attempt? Kharisma Bangsa is one of nine Indonesian schools Ankara says should be shut down because of their alleged ties to Fethullah Gulen. Turkey says the schools are part of a vast and secretive network which the Gulen movement has used to build a powerbase and infiltrate state institutions. Accusations have been levelled against schools with Turkish connections in more than a dozen countries, from Germany to Afghanistan, leaving thousands of children facing uncertainty over their education. Supporters of the schools say they are no more than a loose affiliation of institutions that share common values and are committed to academic excellence. From extensive interviews with BBC World Service across 10 countries in three continents, it is clear that the schools have much in common but operate quite differently. But all are feeling the pressure. There is no common brand name for the schools. In Pakistan they are called "Pak-Turk Lycees", in Kyrgyzstan they are known as "Sebat" (Persistence) schools, and in Kenya, "Light Academies". Most were set up as partnerships between Turkish and local businesses and organisations, but in many countries like Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan, the Turkish partners are no longer directly involved. Local and Turkish partners say they're admirers of Fethullah Gulen, but not connected to him formally. "A Gulen school, business or newspaper is generally unofficially labelled as such, because the owner or manager considers Fethullah Gulen as a spiritual leader or source of inspiration," says Turkish academic Bayram Balci. Alp Aslandogan, who speaks on behalf of Gulen-associated schools in the United States, says there are numerous social networks within the movement. "The schools which are seen as affiliated with the movement were started by people who belong to these networks." Followers of Fethullah Gulen often refer to their movement by the name Hizmet (service), and the schools all share the same ethics. "The teachers put emphasis on character-building, morals, and discipline," says Rosi, the mother of a pupil at Kharisma Bangsa. There's also a strong focus on teaching science. From Nairobi to Kandahar, school websites show pupils in smart uniforms, studying in well-equipped science labs or computer rooms. "The children study every day until 3pm, then they have additional classes, activity clubs, and homework," says Baktigul, whose daughter attends a Turkish school in Kyrgyzstan. "At 9pm they all sit down to have tea, and at 10pm it's bedtime." For Maxim Urazaev, who graduated from a Turkish lycee in the Russian city of Kazan in 2009 the experience was "tougher than being in the army". Head teachers have told the BBC the schools are not part of a formal structure. The head of Kyrgyzstan's 21 Sebat schools, Nurlan Kudaberdiev, says they are all connected to Fethullah Gulen informally because the schools were his idea. "But there's no direct influence or financing from his side any more," he insists. Long before the Turkish government tried to shut the schools down, other countries took action of their own amid suspicion of the network's foreign links. In 2000, Uzbekistan shut down all Gulen-associated schools operating there, and similar steps were taken in Russia, where only seven remain of the 50 schools that used to operate until 2008. All are now firmly under Education Ministry supervision in the Turkic-speaking Muslim region of Tatarstan. The schools describe themselves as secular, promoting tolerance and interfaith dialogue. "In my five years at the school I never once saw a Koran or a Bible," says Maxim Urazaev, from Kazan. But in Russia and elsewhere schools have been accused of running extra-curricular and secret, religious study groups. Many former Soviet countries are deeply suspicious of religious activity beyond state control. A former teacher in Tatarstan rejected the idea of "secret gatherings" but told the BBC that pupils who wanted to could pray with their teachers and talk to them about religion. In Kenya, former students and teachers showed us books by Fethullah Gulen that they had been given. In Kyrgyzstan, 15-year-old Zainal said pupils were sometimes shown videos about Islam. But her mother, Bakhtigul, said she was satisfied it was not a problem. "I even checked the books in their library to see if they had any Gulen literature or suspicious books, but there was nothing." Gulen-affiliated schools have existed in Turkey since the 1970s and only expanded into a truly global phenomenon in the past 20 years. That expansion came as Fethullah Gulen grew closer to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Islamist-rooted AK Party swept to victory in 2002. By teaching Turkish and promoting Turkish culture the schools helped to reinforce Turkey's position and influence across the former Soviet Union, the Far East and into Africa. In 2015 Turkey invested $6.2bn (Â£4.7bn; â‚¬5.5bn) across Africa. Somalia became a flagship for Turkish aid and investment, with three Gulen-linked schools catering for more than 1,000 children. Although the schools are fee-paying and attract the children of the elite, they also offer scholarships to poorer families. In Pakistan up to a quarter of children are on scholarships, in Afghanistan it is nearly 30%. Quite apart from the lure of a good education, the schools also offer an opportunity to travel by way of inter-school competitions known as "Olympiads". Star pupils from Kabul have competed in maths and Turkish-language competitions in Uganda, while children from Mogadishu have tested their skills in Kazakhstan. The schools say the competitions are a way of making a global network of friends. But Turkey argues they enable a movement responsible for a deadly coup attempt to continue recruiting new members worldwide. Thousands of children and their families have been left feeling vulnerable, and for many their future at the Gulen schools is unclear. "I've been here for eleven years," says Musukan, a sixth former at the Pak-Turk school in Islamabad. "This was the best time of my life. We love it here." "If Turkey really has problems, don't involve us," says Salwa, an Indonesian sixth former. "We're only here to study and to pursue our dreams."

Media playback is not supported on this device Rachel Morris led GB's rowing success with arms-shoulders single sculls gold. Lauren Rowles and Laurence Whiteley won the trunk-and-arms mixed double sculls and the mixed coxed four added a third gold for ParalympicsGB. In track cycling, Lora Turnham won the B 3km individual pursuit and the men's C1-5 team claimed sprint gold in a world record time. Compatriot Neil Fachie won cycling B 1km time trial silver, with Sophie Thornhill, gold medallist in the 1km time trial on Friday, and her pilot Helen Scott taking bronze in the B 3km pursuit. There were British triathlon silvers for Lauren Steadman in the PT4 and Alison Patrick in the PT5, with Melissa Reid taking bronze in the same event. GB's Tom Aggar won bronze in the men's arms-shoulders single sculls. The four rowing medals were won within an hour on the Lagoa water in Rio and Great Britain have now claimed 20 gold medals and 46 overall to sit second in the medal table behind China. Morris, who had both legs amputated because of complex regional pain syndrome, finished ahead of China's Lili Wang, while Israel's Moran Samuel took bronze. The Welsh competitor switched to rowing in 2013 and now has three Paralympic medals across two sports, adding to the hand-cycling time trial gold she won in Beijing in 2008 and bronze at London 2012. "That was the hardest thing I've ever done," she said. "It just goes to show if you have stuff drilled into you every day by the coaches and you do it you can win." The pairing of Whiteley and Rowles was only created last year, when 18-year-old Rowles switched from wheelchair racing to rowing. The duo won silver at last year's World Championships and in Rio beat the silver medal-winning pair from China and the third-placed French team to add a Paralympic title to their collection. James Fox, Pam Relph, Dan Brown and Grace Clough, along with cox Oliver James, defended Great Britain's gold from London 2012 in the mixed coxed four, finishing ahead of the USA and Canada. GB have dominated this event in recent years, taking gold at the past three World Championships - although only Relph, 26, remains from the boat that prevailed in London four years ago. "It feels amazing. Coming through that last 250 metres I knew that we had won it," said Relph. "We knew we were fitter, stronger and faster than our rivals but we still had to deliver." Media playback is not supported on this device Turnham, 26, who has a hereditary sight-loss condition, teamed up with her pilot Corrine Hall to beat New Zealand's Emma Foy to improve on her fourth place at London 2012 and bronze at the World Championships. Jody Cundy, who won gold in the 1,000m time trial on Friday, Jon-Allan Butterworth and Louis Rolfe, bronze medallist in the C2 3,000m pursuit, beat their own world record, set in qualifying, to take team sprint gold. The trio clocked a winning time of 48.635 seconds to beat China by 1.279secs. It was Cundy's seventh Paralympic title across both swimming and Para-cycling and his second in Rio following his disastrous disqualification in the time trial at London 2012. "After four years ago and being the lowest I've ever been this is probably the highest I've ever been," said the 37-year-old. "I was properly nervous for the kilo, I didn't really enjoy it that much. But this one, with these two guys, and the way they have been riding in the last couple of months, it's a pleasure to get up there and perform." London 2012 gold medallist Fachie, who has a congenital eye condition, and his pilot Pete Mitchell finished 0.419 seconds behind gold medallist Tristan Bangma of the Netherlands in the B 1km time trial. Britain had high hopes of bolstering their gold tally in the Para-triathlon, with the event included at a Games for the first time. But Andy Lewis' PT2 gold on Saturday will be GB's only gold, although the women added two silvers and a bronze. Steadman, who was born without a lower right arm, had been favourite to add a Paralympic title to her 2013 and 2014 world crowns. But the 23-year-old former swimmer from Peterborough lost out to the USA's Grace Norman by one minute and four seconds. In the PT5 classification for visually impaired athletes, world champion Patrick, with her guide Hazel Smith, and world bronze medallist Reid, with her guide Nicole Walters, finished second and third respectively behind Katie Kelly of Australia. Britain's Bethany Firth and Jessica-Jane Applegate will take their 200m freestyle S14 rivalry into Sunday's final (22:37 BST). Defending champion Applegate set a new Paralympic record of two minutes 7.95 seconds in her heat, only for Firth, already 100m backstroke gold medallist, to beat that time by 1.99secs. Tom Hamer set a Paralympic record of 1:57.31 in the 200m freestyle S14 heats and Rebecca Redfearn followed suit in the 100m breaststroke SB13 with a time of 1:17.08. Their finals are at 22:29 BST and the 22:09 BST respectively on Sunday. GB's men's wheelchair basketball team made it three wins from three in their group to qualify for the quarter-finals. They beat Germany 66-52 on Friday and will face London 2012 bronze medallists USA on Monday to decide who will be the Group B winners. There is the prospect of double gold in table tennis for Britain, after Will Bayley and Rob Davies progressed to their finals. Bayley, who was born with the muscle-shortening illness arthrogryposis and was a silver medallist four years ago, beat Spain's Jordi Morales 3-1 in the class seven to set up a gold-medal match with Israel Stroh of Brazil on Monday. Davies, who uses a wheelchair after breaking his neck playing rugby, overcame Endre Major of Hungary 3-1 in his semi-final and will meet south Korean Young Dae Joo in the class 1 final on Tuesday.	Britain claimed five more gold medals at the Rio Paralympics, including a best-ever tally of three in the rowing.
Roedd y Farwnes Eluned Morgan, AC dros Ganolbarth a Gorllewin Cymru, yn siarad wedi i Nicola Sturgeon gadarnhau y byddai'n ceisio am ail refferendwm ar annibyniaeth i'r Alban. Dywedodd arweinydd Plaid Cymru, Leanne Wood, bod "angen i Gymru benderfynu ar ei dyfodol" yn dilyn cyhoeddiad Ms Sturgeon. Yn ôl y Farwnes Morgan nid oes "awch o gwbl am annibyniaeth yng Nghymru", gan ychwanegu na fyddai Cymru yn le cyfforddus petai'r Alban yn gadael y DU. Gwrthod hynny wnaeth AC Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, gan ddweud bod "awch ar lawr gwlad i gymryd rheolaeth o ffawd, tynged a dyfodol eu hunain". Yn siarad ar raglen Taro'r Post, dywedodd y Farwnes Morgan bod pobl sy'n "poeni am yr economi, gwasanaethau cyhoeddus" yn "gwybod nad ydi hi'n bosib i Gymru fod yn annibynnol fel gwald ar hyn o bryd. Hyd yn oed ar ôl Brexit". Dywedodd bod Cymru yn derbyn rhwng £500-600m y flwyddyn gan yr Undeb Ewropeaidd, ond bod £14bn yn dod o Loegr. "Os fydde Cymru yn mynd yn annibynnol fydd 'na ddim arian i dalu am bensiynau, neb ar y dôl yn cael arian, neb sy'n sâl a methu gweithio yn cael arian," meddai. "Yn economaidd dyw e ddim yn bosib. Mae angen i'r breuddwydio dwl 'ma stopio." Ychwanegodd na fyddai Cymru yn "le cyfforddus" pe bai'r Alban yn gadael y DU, a bod angen cofio am newidiadau posib yng Ngogledd Iwerddon hefyd. Dywedodd: "Dwi'n wirioneddol gobeithio na fydd Yr Alban yn mynd yn wlad annibynnol am y bydd yn galed ofnadwy i Gymru fel gwlad. "Ond 'chydig iawn allwn ni wneud. Pobl Yr Alban sydd efo'r penderfyniad." Yn ymateb ar y rhaglen, dywedodd AC Plaid Cymru dros Ddwyrain Caerfyrddin a Dinefwr, Adam Price, bod ei blaid yn gweithio ar strategaeth economaidd i sicrhau nad yw Cymru'n ddibynnol. Soniodd hefyd bod pryder y gallai'r DU ddod i ben o fewn y blynyddoedd nesaf, a phetai hynny'n digwydd yna byddai angen i bobl Cymru drafod pwnc mor bwysig. "Mae angen cymryd rheolaeth 'nôl. Dyna sy'n gyrru ardaloedd difreintiedig, y teimlad o gael eu hesgeuluso," meddai. "Mae 'na awch ar lawr gwlad i gymryd rheolaeth o ffawd, tynged a dyfodol eu hunain." Ychwanegodd: "Os ydi Cymru am aros ar ei thraed ei hun rhaid gofyn sut? Cau'r ffyniant presennol, a hyn drwy'r strategaeth economaidd."	Mae angen stopio'r "breuddwydio dwl" am annibyniaeth i Gymru yn ôl AC Llafur, sy'n dweud nad yw'n bosib yn economaidd.
The parishioners at St Paul's, Shipley, posted the video on Facebook in February after a traditional advert failed to attract any applicants. It was viewed more than 30,000 times and attracted media coverage across the UK. The new vicar, Henriette Howarth, will take up the post next week. The song, written by the children with the help of the church's musical director Rachel Hesselwood, listed the qualities the new vicar needed. It begins with the lines: "If you want this choice position have a cheery disposition. Make us laugh, smile lots, play games, tell jokes." Other requirements included "You must be kind, you must be fair. Bible stories you will share. "Boy or girl it doesn't matter - but you must enjoy Harry Potter!" It ends with a promise by the children to keep the church tidy and not to "talk in your sermons, we'll be good you'll see".	A church in West Yorkshire has recruited a new vicar following a video job advertisement sung by a choir of children.
In fact, the Swedish star has already lost five months to making her third album... and it's still not finished. "I've been really geeking out," she giggles down the phone. "Almost to a point where it's mathematical, trying to find the balance between all the elements". When inspiration pounces, she can lose "hours, days and weeks" in the studio, "just bending different sentences and rhymes to find the best fit, to find the missing piece of the puzzle". Pop, in particular, puts "so much focus on what you say," she adds. "You have to be really neat and concise. It's important you get it right. "So it's about puzzling together a song, a good pop song, that makes sense. It really is a brain game." The first result of all this effort is Say My Name, a gigantic pop fizzbomb that's primed to explode all over the charts this month. It's a deceptively simple song built around a quirky ukulele riff, but the chorus sticks like Velcro. "Say my name," sings the star, "wear it out like a sweater that you love, cause I can't get enough when you... say my name". "I really love that chorus," she says. "It was such a good feeling when we nailed that one. Like, 'Yes!'" Her painstaking perfectionism reaches a pinnacle in the vocals. Tove is understated and conversational, making you lean in to the song's coquettish flirtation, where most pop divas would have belted out the melody in one take and gone home for a sandwich. "I don't understand how people do that," she protests. "I feel like the vocals are such a huge part of the production. Like, how do I sing this line? How much strength do I put into it? How can I make this melody as interesting as possible? How can I communicate this feeling even more." "And it's the best feeling when you find that missing piece. It's like, 'Arrroooggahh!' Amazing." And if inspiration dries up? "I play solitaire on my phone," laughs the singer. "I have the song on in the background, and I play solitaire so I'm not concentrating so hard. "It's a good way to make sure you don't overthink it. If you force the brain into shutting off then, suddenly, something will just come out of your mouth that fits." Tove Anna LinnÃ©a Ã–stman Styrke was born and raised in Umea, an unassuming university town near the edge of the Arctic Circle, whose most famous former inhabitant is Stieg Larsson, the author of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Her mother was a ballet teacher; while her father was a musician, whose band Max Fenders scored a number one hit in 1975 with the song Vindens Melodi (Wind Melody), and who set Tove on the path to musical stardom when he gave her her first synthesiser. At the age of 16, she entered the TV talent show Swedish Idol, finishing in third place. It delivered her a solid fanbase, but she's not particularly enamoured of the experience. "Its really hard to talk about music and a thing like Swedish Idol at the same time," she once said, "because they have nothing to do with each other". "A competition like that, on TV, that's entertainment, that's a popularity competition... And afterwards, that's when you start making music." Post-Idol, Tove released a rushed, self-titled album which went platinum in Sweden. But she was unhappy with the way she was being presented, and took a three-year break, moving back home to immerse herself in music and work out who she wanted to be. The result was Kiddo, her second album, written from the perspective of a young woman finding her voice in a world that constantly tries to undermine and break women down. It featured pop's best put-down since You're So Vain ("I bet you hit the ground hard when you fell for yourself") and flicked two fingers at the men who tried to turn her into a flesh-baring pop zombie. "Hot glam seems far away from where I am / I can neither understand it nor demand it," she stated on a track called Number One. Strident, sassy and self-confident, it's no surprise that the album was named after Uma Thurman's character in Kill Bill, Beatrix Kiddo. Time Magazine called it a "feminist pop triumph", while it made several critics' end-of-year lists in 2015. Although Kiddo didn't sell in the quantities expected of a mainstream pop record, it won the singer recognition from tastemakers on Radio 1, Billboard Magazine and Rolling Stone; while a tour with pop band Years & Years gained her some real world fans. "Being the support act can be a tough job but I couldn't have chosen a better audience if I'd hand-picked them myself," she marvels. "I noticed they had fans who come back to see multiple shows and, after a while, they were all as excited to see me as they were to see Years and Years. "Just walking up on that stage and singing to that audience was amazing. That was the best thing." The 24-year-old hopes to capitalise on all this goodwill with her new single - which has just been made track of the week by Radio 1's Greg James. It sees the singer turn her keen lyrical eye towards love for the first time, a move which was prompted not by romance, but politics. "Everybody here [in Sweden] was depressed when Trump won, and you can definitely [see] negative political trends happening in Europe, as well. "With everything being kind of heavy, I'm writing more as a way to escape the world. I want to be able to zone out for a minute and have a good time." Say My Name will undoubtedly be seen as a litmus test for Tove's new material at a time when similarly-tipped female pop acts like MÃ˜, Bebe Rexha and Dua Lipa have struggled to gain a foothold. But the singer is undaunted, saying she has a secret stash of hit singles hidden back in Sweden. "I'm going to sound so full of myself but, whatever, I'm a pop princess," she laughs. "I really feel like every song I've done so far is single material. I don't want to see any of them as 'just an album track.'" In common with Calvin Harris, who has reportedly abandoned albums altogether, she is considering releasing music in a more ad hoc nature, either as a series of standalone singles or themed EPs. "I really appreciate the album format sometimes," she explains. "Like, Beyonce's Lemonade album wouldn't work as a collection of singles. "But a lot of people, at least in my audience, just pick their favourite songs and add them to a playlist. "That means there's a lot of songs I spend time on that people don't discover. I just think it's a shame when all of the songs are really good!" Tove Styrke's single, Say My Name, is out now on RCA Records.

The UK could also be allowed to keep many of its trade terms with the EU so as to avoid disruption, Moody's said. The report shows economic warnings from pro-EU groups have been "baseless scaremongering", Vote Leave said. But the Britain Stronger in Europe group said it was further evidence that leaving would damage the economy. The Moody's report comes after the CBI warned a British exit from the EU - known as a "Brexit" - could cost the UK economy Â£100bn and nearly one million jobs. A vote to leave in the 23 June referendum would create significant uncertainty that would hamper economic growth, according to Moody's. But the ratings agency said this would be partly offset by a decline in the pound - making UK exports more competitive - and by companies having time to adjust during UK-EU negotiations that it expects to last for at least two years. "Our central view is that the negative economic impact of Brexit would be relatively small," the credit agency said. As a result, Moody's would "not expect to see significant increases in unemployment or [interest] rates, or substantial declines in property prices across the UK as a whole". Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said of the report: "The UK will not face trade barriers after we Vote Leave, jobs will be safe and our credit rating will not be affected." However, Lucy Thomas, deputy director of Stronger In Europe, said: "By leaving, we would unavoidably end up with worse trade terms. That would hit British industries such as car makers and financial services, putting jobs, low prices and financial security at risk for British people. "Until the Leave campaigns can specify exactly how they would avoid that, going out on our own is a risk we can't afford to take." No trade deal would be as good as the one the UK currently has, she added. Moody's said: "We expect that, over time, the UK and EU would come to an arrangement to preserve most - but probably not all - of the current trading relationships, thereby limiting the impact on UK exporters and supply chains of UK importers." This is because both the UK and EU would want to avoid large-scale disruption, it said. The ratings agency also pointed to HSBC's recent decision to keep its headquarters in London as evidence the capital would still be an attractive home for financial services firms. "Although there are clear downside risks to the City of London's standing as a global financial centre, in our central scenario we do not see Brexit materially damaging its strong position," it said. Gas, electricity, water and broadband networks would see "little" impact from a Leave vote, despite the UK having to replace existing EU regulations. The agency looked at 200 UK companies for the report, finding that the risks of a "Brexit" would mainly centre around: additional trade barriers; investment decisions; regulatory changes; and curbs on migration.	The UK economy would be hit by leaving the EU, but the impact would be "small" and unlikely to lead to big job losses, according to credit agency Moody's.
Mr Hammond dismissed reports of angry rows between the two as "tittle tattle" although he jokingly acknowledged he occasionally swore. Mrs May said she was "focused on 8 June". Mr Hammond and Mrs May were speaking at a press conference they arranged to attack Labour's election manifesto. Taking questions from journalists after claiming Labour's pledges created a multibillion pound "black hole", they were asked about reports of a rift between their offices since the U-turn over National Insurance in March's Budget. Asked by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg whether they would "still be neighbours" after the general election - the chancellor's official residence is 11 Downing Street - Mrs May said: "I think it's true to say that the chancellor and I and every other member of my team are focused on 8 June." She was also pressed to give an endorsement of her chancellor, replying that she was "very happy to do so". "As Philip says, we have worked together for many years," she said. "Longer than we would care to identify - that's an age-related comment, nothing else." Mr Hammond said he and Mrs May worked "very closely together". He added: "What I candidly admitted - and my family will confirm this - is I do occasionally swear." This morning the chancellor's admission that he sometimes swears, as he sought to play down reports of rows with Team May, won't have helped. Nor will the PM twice refusing to say he would still be her chancellor if she is elected. She did, at the third time of asking give him her endorsement. And moving him after the election if the Tories win would be a dramatic and risky move. But this morning's excursion won't have helped relations between the two addresses. Read Laura's blog	Prime Minister Theresa May has laughed off questions about whether Chancellor Philip Hammond would still be in place after the general election.
Four masked men forced their way into the house in Dunraven Avenue around 22:15 BST on Friday. Two remained with the man while the other two searched the house. The gang left a short time later without taking anything from the property. Police have appealed for anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity to contact them.	A man in his 70s has been left shaken but uninjured after a burglary at his home in east Belfast.
26 January 2015 Last updated at 09:11 GMT The trees were part of an area known as 'Doggerland' which formed part of a much bigger area before it was flooded by the North Sea. It was once so big that hunter-gatherers who lived in the area could have walked to Germany, in Europe, across its land. The underwater forest was discovered by Dawn Watson and Rob Spray from Sea Search on a diving trip to study marine life. The prehistoric forest lay undiscovered until it was exposed by the extreme storms along the east of England coast in December 2013. Check out this underwater footage of the forest which experts believe could date back more than 10,000 years. Underwater diving footage is copyright and courtesy of Rob Spray and Dawn Watson.	Nature experts have discovered an amazing underwater forest thousands of years old under the sea close to the Norfolk coast in England.
The annual Roald Dahl Funny Prize is to be relaunched in 2016 as part of the author's centenary celebrations. Set up by former children's laureate Michael Rosen in 2008, the prize is intended to reward authors and artists of humorous children's books. A spokesman for the Dahl Literary Estate said they looked forward to making the prize "even more impactful". The prize was created as a joint enterprise between book charity Booktrust, the Roald Dahl literary estate and Rosen. 'Robust future' "We are delighted with the success that the Roald Dahl Funny Prize has achieved in a fairly short amount of time," said Luke Kelly of Dahl & Dahl. "The Prize has paid tribute to many fantastically talented, inventive and mischievous storytellers." Booktrust boss Viv Bird said the prize had been a "phenomenal triumph" but she wanted to ensure "a robust future for this unique celebration of funny books". Last year's winners, Simon Rickerty (Monkey Nut) and Jim Smith (I Am Not A Loser), received Â£2,500 each.	A children's book prize inspired by Matilda author Roald Dahl has been put on hold for two years.
The Buglife conservation charity says the recent period of damp weather has seen the numbers of bees, wasps, moths and butterflies shrink in 2012. Its chief executive Matt Shardlow said that if the country keeps on having periods of damp weather, then it could prove dangerous for some rare species. "They might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction," he said. This year saw the wettest April-June quarter on record and further heavy rain in July. Mr Shardlow said the damp conditions have resulted in fewer aphids for wasps to feed on, which has reduced their numbers. It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover, he added. He also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the UK need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen. "We are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on." Buglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers, but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect "massive year-on-year variation" which they have reported this year. However, some data is collated on butterfly numbers, and Mr Shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the UK. Moths, too, are being seen in fewer numbers, he said. However, the wet weather has been good news for some insects, such as the crane fly, drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails, which all thrive in the damp conditions. "This means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year," Mr Shardlow said. "We've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails." But Richard Ridler, chairman of Essex Beekeepers' Association, says this year's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees, just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens. "The problem was that we had an appalling start to the year, which meant the bees stayed at home. Instead of going out, they stayed in their hives and ate their honey. I've had 25% of the honey yield that I would have expected this year. "So the public saw a lot less of them. I haven't had beekeepers telling me that they've lost more bees than usual. "This has been the most unusual, bizarre beekeeping year because of the weather. Most beekeepers I've spoken to have written this year off as an interesting experience, and one they hope not to have again for a while."	Some species of insects are at "very low numbers" in the UK after months of wet and cool weather, experts say.
11 May 2016 Last updated at 08:17 BST Matthew Oliver paid more than one thousand pounds for the seed which came from the current world record holder grown in Switzerland. The winning pumpkin weighs 165 stone, so Matthew's would need to weigh-in at more than a tonne to beat that.

The Nobel committee praised him for a peace deal signed with Farc rebels, but rejected by Colombians in a vote. Mr Santos said he dedicated the award to "all the victims of the conflict", and the Farc leader congratulated him. About 260,000 people have been killed and more than six million internally displaced in Colombia. The award did not include Farc leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, who also signed the accord. The head of the Nobel commitee said the award recognised the president's "resolute efforts" to end the conflict. "The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the  parties who have contributed to the peace process," Kaci Kullman Five added. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency Mr Santos said on Twitter: "This honourable distinction is not for me, it's for all the victims of the conflict. Together we'll win the most important award of them all: peace." The peace deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters who went to the polls on 2 October. The committee acknowledged the result, saying: "What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement." It also said that finding a balance between the need for reconciliation and ensuring justice for the victims would be a difficult challenge. Also on Twitter, Farc leader Timochenko said: "I congratulate President Juan Manuel Santos, Cuba and Norway, who sponsored the process, and Venezuela and Chile, who assisted it, without them, peace would be impossible." Earlier, he had written: "The only prize we aspire to is peace with social justice for Colombia, without (right-wing) paramilitary groups, without retaliation or lies. Peace in the streets." This was a Peace Prize for a peace deal that wasn't. President Santos joins a long line of Nobel Peace Prize winners who have been rewarded for effort as much as achievement. But it is too easy to be cynical. The Nobel Peace Prize has often been controversial. In recent years a variety of international bureaucracies have won - the EU, the IAEA and the OPCW. Why, some have argued, should people get a prize for simply doing their job? What, others ask, had US President Barack Obama actually done to merit the prize in 2009, other than be elected? But the Nobel has often gone to extraordinary individuals who really have gone above and beyond to bring peace - in Northern Ireland and East Timor to name just two examples. Maybe the award to President Santos may yet galvanise public opinion in Colombia to think again about the deal. Critics, led by former president Alvaro Uribe, said the deal was too lenient to the rebels. Under the agreement, special courts would have been created to try crimes committed during the conflict. Those who confessed would have received lighter sentences and avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. The Farc would also have been guaranteed 10 seats in the Colombian Congress in the 2018 and 2022 elections. Despite the rejection by voters, Mr Santos vowed to continue with talks with the rebels. Government negotiators have already returned to the Cuban capital Havana for further discussions with Farc leaders. Kaci Kullman Five, from the Nobel committee, said the award was also meant as "encouragement" to the rebels. "Giving the prize to Santos is not a belittlement to any of the other parties. "The Farc is obviously a very important part of this process.'' 1964: Set up as armed wing of Communist Party 2002: At its height, it had an army of 20,000 fighters controlling up to a third of the country.

The government has been accused of failing to do more to help 2.6 million women born in the 1950s who have lost out because of changes to pension law. The SNP's Mhairi Black said it was "laughable" the problem could not be fixed when the government had found £1bn to fund its deal with the DUP. Minister Guy Opperman said he would look at cases of financial hardship. But he faced shouts of "shame on you" when he said the government was "actually doing a significant amount" to address the individual difficulties of older workers trying to enter the labour market - including by offering them apprenticeships. Mr Opperman, setting out the government's work on "lifelong learning" said: "The reality is over 200,000 people over 60 have entered further education since 2014/15. "We have also extended apprenticeship opportunities as one of the best routes to skilled employment for people of all ages and gender. "Such apprenticeships in England, for example, in 2014/15... 12% of the starting apprenticeships were for those aged 45." Mr Opperman was heckled by MPs as he outlined the details. Labour's Graham Jones, raising a point of order, said: "I'm struggling to hear the debate, did the minister just say that women aged 64 could go on an apprenticeship course?" The debate centred on the plight of the so-called Waspi women - Women Against State Pension Inequality - whose aim is to achieve fair transitional arrangements for women born in the 1950s, for whom the state pension age is being raised from 60 to 66 by 2020. Ms Black said she had been contacted by a woman who said her friend had committed suicide after the general election result "because she could not face what was going to happen to her". "Citizens committing suicide over an issue that could be solved like that - an issue the government could do a U-turn on at any given moment," she said. Ms Black said it was "an absolute disgrace" that a debate on the issue was having to be held again. Turning to Mr Opperman, a pensions minister, she said it was "laughable" that the government "can find a billion pounds for a deal to cling on to power, but we cannot find the money to give women the pensions that they are due". "The only other two things they are guilty of is being born in the 50s and the fact they are women." Labour's Carolyn Harris said the government "has betrayed these women - they've stolen their security and they've shattered their dreams without time to prepare and make the necessary alternative arrangements".	A minister has been heckled by MPs for suggesting women over 60 facing poverty could start an apprenticeship.
Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week. And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture. "He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in," McCarthy told BBC Scotland. "Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner. "He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good. "Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now." As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic. Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble. "I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong," McCarthy said. "It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money." Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons. He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013. There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers. Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old. "He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years," he added. "The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season." And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees. "Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example," McCarthy added. "He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence."	Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.
It was delivered by a politician with "big ambitions". George Osborne's stated aim was to create what he called a "new settlement". That's politician's code for re-writing the rules of politics to suit your side. So it is that he did something rather surprising - slowing and softening spending and welfare cuts now having promised faster and deeper cuts in the run up to the election. So it is that he adopted a series of Labour policies - a higher re-badged minimum wage, a levy on firms to pay for apprentices, an assault on the tax privilege of so-called non doms. This in addition to delivering Tory promises to cut income tax, corporation tax and inheritance tax. But hold on - below those headlines are some potentially eye-watering cuts to benefits - the cuts to tax credits for families will dwarf the pay rise many will get. There are cuts too to Whitehall budgets on the same scale as seen over the past five years - though where they'll hit is as yet unspelt out. And there are tax rises - on buying insurance, on buying a car, on pensions - which dwarf the headline tax cuts. So, yes, it was a "big Budget" - whether it's a big game-changer, a big mess or a big outrage is a judgement for you.	It was indeed a "big" Budget - just as the chancellor said it would be.
The women, aged between 18 and 29, have been recruited on social media. Five of them are now living with IS militants in the conflict zones, according to a special investigation by Victoria Police. Concern has been rising since mid-2014 about Australians going to the Middle East to fight for IS. The government will soon introduce legislation allowing it to strip dual citizens fighting in Iraq or Syria of their Australian citizenship. People working in Australia to support militant groups will also be targeted by the changes. Task Force Pax was established in April to monitor Victorians believed to be involved with insurgents. Officials from the task force told local media on Friday that another four Melbourne women made it as far as Turkey before being turned back by authorities. One other was stopped by customs officers in Australia while two remain unaccounted for. The young women are all from Melbourne's northern and south-eastern suburbs. Assistant Commissioner Tracy Linford said two forensic psychologists had been embedded in the task force to help investigators understand why the young women were trying to join IS. "The use of psychologists provides us with a far more comprehensive risk assessment and also assists in identifying early intervention opportunities," she said. "This gives us the chance to focus on identifying those youths most at risk of radicalisation and to engage with them or their families directly." Local media reported that one of the women was 21-year-old Zehra Duman, who allegedly travelled overseas in December to join Mahmoud Abullatif, a Melbourne man believed to be a Islamic extremist. She travelled to Syria without her parent's knowledge, The Age newspaper reported. It is believed Abullatif was killed while fighting with IS in January but Ms Duman has yet to return home. Police said the young women were being sold a romantic view of life with IS, and had lied to their families about their travel plans. Authorities were warning parents and friends of young women about the lure of IS, saying the women could end up in arranged marriages, or forced into sexual servitude in the Middle East. "Our intelligence tells us these women are going over there to meet their partners, to marry somebody in an arranged marriage or be pushed into sexual servitude," Assistant Commissioner Linford told reporters. The Herald Sun newspaper said mother Dullel Kassab was another of the women identified by police. The Australian government believes at least 100 Australians are fighting with militant groups in the Middle East. Another 150 people in Australia are known to be supporting such groups, while Australia's intelligence agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), is investigating about 400 high-priority terrorist cases.	As many as 12 young women have tried to leave Melbourne to join the Islamic State (IS) militant group, according to Australian police.
The 33-year-old, who is the younger brother of Harlequins number eight Nick, joined Sale in 2011 after six years at Northampton. Easter won the European Challenge Cup and reached the Champions Cup final at Saints after joining from Nottingham. "I've enjoyed my time at Sale, I didn't really want to go anywhere else," said the back-row forward. "It was the right time to leave on my own terms, which not many people do. "I've had the chance for these last few games just to enjoy and savour them and I've been really lucky." He will now take up his teaching position at Wrekin College in Shropshire after the final game of the season at Newcastle on Saturday. "The last few years, I've been tailoring my career towards teaching, so taking a few courses, getting into schools, teaching and coaching," he added. "The opportunity just came up at the right time. It felt like the right time for me and my family."	Sale Sharks forward Mark Easter has announced he will retire at the end of the season to take up a teaching role.
A statement from Greaves's family said the 75-year-old, who had a minor stroke in 2012, had been taken ill on Sunday. Greaves scored 44 goals in 57 England games and a club-record 220 league goals for Tottenham having started his career at Chelsea. "His wife Irene and four children have asked for privacy during what is a worrying time," added the statement. "Jimmy had a minor stroke in 2012, but appeared to have made a full recovery. "He was due to be inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame on 13 May at a sell-out ceremony at White Hart Lane." Greaves is fourth on the list of all-time England goalscorers, behind Sir Bobby Charlton, Gary Lineker and Wayne Rooney. He was part of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad but originally missed out on a medal because he was injured during the tournament's group stage. At the time, only the 11 winning players on the pitch at the end of the final received the award, although football's governing body Fifa changed that practice in 2007. The World Cup squad players and the families of team manager Sir Alf Ramsey and other backroom staff were finally presented with medals in 2009. Tottenham posted a message of support on their official Twitter feed shortly after the news of Greaves's stroke emerged. "Everyone at the club wishes Jimmy Greaves a speedy recovery after he suffered a stroke yesterday," the message read. "Our thoughts are with Jimmy and his family at this difficult time." Greaves scored 124 league goals for Chelsea, then a club record, between 1957 and 1961. Chelsea tweeted: "All at Chelsea are thinking of former Blue Jimmy Greaves and his family at this time. We wish him a full and swift recovery." England World Cup winner Sir Geoff Hurst, who scored a hat-trick in the 1966 final, said on Twitter: "Thinking of my friend and one of our greats this morning. Wishing him all the best and hoping for a speedy recovery." Hurst replaced Greaves in the England team in 1966 after he injured a shin against France during the group stages. Greaves helped Tottenham win the FA Cup in 1962 and 1967, while his career also included spells at AC Milan and West Ham United. In the 1980s he forged a new career as a football pundit on ITV, most notably alongside former Liverpool striker Ian St John on 'Saint and Greavsie', which ran from 1985 to 1992. Former Tottenham striker and BBC Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: "Choked to read that Jimmy Greaves has had a severe stroke. One of my absolute heroes. Thoughts are with him and his family. Get well, Jimmy."	Former England and Tottenham striker Jimmy Greaves is in intensive care after suffering a severe stroke.
Zhou Youguang helped invent Pinyin, a writing system that turns Chinese characters into words using letters from the Roman alphabet. This makes it easier to learn how to pronounce Chinese words, and is credited with helping raise literacy rates in China. Despite his achievements, Mr Zhou remains largely unknown in his home country. Perhaps that is because the 106-year-old is a defiant character, refusing to take much credit for his work or pander to the Chinese Communist Party. He is critical of the party that governs China - and old enough not to care who is listening to what he has to say. "What are they going to do, come and take me away?" he said in an interview with the BBC in his sparsely furnished Beijing home. Positive outlook Mr Zhou's life has coincided with most of the momentous events of China's recent history, as it has moved from imperial dynasty to peoples' republic to capitalist powerhouse. He was born in 1906 into a wealthy family that managed to lose its money three times: first in the Qing dynasty, then during World War II and finally during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign launched by Mao Zedong. Nevertheless, he managed to get a good education, studying economics at St John's University, one of the best educational institutions in Shanghai in the 1920s when he was there. Several years of his early life were spent working in the US for a Chinese bank. "It was at No 1 Wall Street - the centre of imperialism," he said, laughing. Mr Zhou laughs a lot, a result of an optimistic outlook. "There are good aspects to even bad things," he said. That does not mean everything in the centenarian's life has gone his way. His daughter died of appendicitis just before her sixth birthday and, like many intellectuals, he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. A common form of punishment at the time - in the late 1960s - was to send educated city professionals to the countryside to "learn from the masses". Mr Zhou spent several years working in the fields of Ningxia, a poor region in western China. "It was a waste of time and stopped me doing other things," he said, unable to stop himself laughing again. Despite hardships, Mr Zhou did have one enormous stroke of luck. When the Communist Party took over in China in 1949, he was in the US. He decided to return, along with many others, to build a new country. He initially become an economics professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, but in 1955 was invited to join a committee in Beijing looking at simplifying the Chinese language. At first he resisted, saying he had no professional experience in this field. He was finally persuaded to join the project by a friend. It was a decision that probably saved his life. A few years later, Chairman Mao launched one of his first purges, and many of those caught in the mayhem were those who had gone back to China from abroad. "All university professors who'd returned from the US were labelled 'Rightists'. Many committed suicide, including some good friends. I luckily missed it," he said. It was one of the few moments that Mr Zhou did not laugh. Dark future? The work he did on the committee not only saved him, it allowed him to make a major contribution to the Chinese language. When he started work on developing Pinyin, 85% of Chinese people could not read or write. Now, that is just a few percent. There had been previous attempts to Romanise Chinese characters, but the system developed by Mr Zhou and his colleagues is the one that most people now use, and is recognised internationally. "We spent three years developing pinyin. People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters," he said. Having lived so long and done such high-profile work, the linguist has met more than his fair share of historical characters. One of his favourite stories is about Puyi, China's last emperor, who became an ordinary citizen under Chairman Mao. Mr Zhou once belonged to a Chinese body that advises the government, work that allowed him to dine at the organisation's canteen in Beijing. During one of the country's periodic food shortages, he ate there daily, taking his wife along too. This meant more food at home for Mr Zhou's relatives. "Everyday when I went to eat, there was an old man sitting next to me. He was also there with his wife," he said. "It was Puyi - the last emperor. Imagine, even the emperor had to eat there because he didn't have enough food." Mr Zhou's age has also given him a long view of history. He believes the Chinese Communist Party will not always rule the country. "China will have to release itself from communism. The future will be dark if it doesn't," said Mr Zhou, who retired at 85, but is still writing books. It is a damning comment from a man who came back to China because he believed the Communist Party when its leaders said they were democratic. Does he ever regret that decision? "We believed Mao's words. We didn't know that when he got into power he would become the worst kind of dictator," said Mr Zhou. "But I don't regret coming back - there's no point," he added, laughing again.	Students struggling to learn Chinese might not know it, but their task has been made easier because of the work of one man.
Reports in France suggest the Borussia Monchengladbach winger will stand by his decision at the 2015 Nations Cup to take a break from internationals. The 27-year-old made the announcement after a quarter-final loss to Ghana. "The time has come for me to reconsider my international career in order to focus on my club," he said. Guinea coach Luis Fernandez, who only took charge of the Syli Nationale in April, has named Traore in a 23-man squad for the 6 September fixture. But veteran defender Kamil Zayatte, who has been overlooked by Fernandez, has admitted that his playing days are truly over after the latest omission. "No, it's fine. All is well," Zayatte told French radio station RFI. "It is the choice of the coach and I respect him. It's time for me now to move on. Good luck Syli ". Trabzonspor's Kevin Constante and Spain-based Alhassane Bangoura are also in the squad. But there is no room for Bouna Sarr, who turned down the chance to play for Guinea at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea and against Swaziland in June. Tiny Swaziland stunned Guinea 2-1 in a horror debut for former France World Cup star Fernandez as qualification for the Nations Cup in Gabon began in June. Diminutive attacker Tony Tsabedze scored both goals in the Group L clash, hosted in Morocco because Guinea are banned from staging international matches following the Ebola outbreak in the country.	Ibrahima Traore looks set to reject a call-up to the Guinea squad for September's 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Zimbabwe.

Donald Swanson was born at Geise, near Thurso, and went on to become one of Britain's best Victorian detectives. Here, historian Alan McIvor, author Adam Wood, who is writing a book about Mr Swanson, and Mr Swanson's family reveal details of his early life and his work in tackling some of the 1800s most shocking crimes. Donald Swanson was born at Geise Distillery, about two miles from Thurso, on 12 August 1848. He was the youngest child of brewer John Swanson and his wife Mary. The distillery, which closed in 1851, is now long gone and ruined buildings now mark the spot. Mr Swanson was still a boy when his family left Geise and moved to a home in Thurso's Durness Street. He attended Robert Meikle's Parish School in Thurso's Market Place, before going to the Miller Institution. After leaving school, Mr Swanson was a teacher for a time at the Miller Institution, which is today a public library. In 1867, Mr Swanson left on a horse-drawn stagecoach with the aim of getting himself to London. His 83-year-old granddaughter Mary Berkin said: "When you are 20 the world is your oyster and I suppose he thought 'if I get on that stagecoach I will get to London eventually and make my fortune'." In 1868, the young man joined the Metropolitan Police. Mr Swanson rose through the ranks and earned promotions to sergeant, detective inspector and detective chief inspector in 1888 - the year of Jack the Ripper's murder of five women in the Whitechapel area. In 1896 he was made superintendent of the force's criminal investigation department. During his long career in the police, Mr Swanson handled investigations into some of the worst crimes of the Victorian age. He was involved in the arrest of murderer Percy Lefroy Mapleton in 1881. Mapleton planned a robbery on a train from London to Brighton. He targeted a former stockbroker, killing the man by throwing him out of a carriage after unsuccessfully shooting at him with a revolver. Mr Swanson was involved in two other major investigations that same year. One led to the recovery of jewellery worth Â£250,000 stolen from a Lady Alice Bective. Later, Mr Swanson found himself back in Scotland tasked with hunting down a gang of grave robbers who stole the body of an aristocrat and demanded a ransom for its return. A stone cross still marks the spot where the Earl of Crawford's body was found unceremoniously buried in woods near Dunecht in Aberdeenshire. In 1884, the detective helped in the hunt for those responsible for a prolonged bombing campaign, and four years later tackled his most gruesome case. Jack the Ripper murdered five women in the Whitechapel area of London. In private notes, Mr Swanson named "Kosminski" as the killer. In more modern times, writers have named Polish-born Aaron Kosminski as a suspect. Mr Kosminski, a hairdresser who arrived in England in 1882, had a history of mental illness. He was allegedly spotted at the scene of the murder of Elizabeth Stride, believed to be the Ripper's third victim. Mr Wood said: "According to Swanson's annotations, Kosminski was a prime suspect. "He went insane and was committed to an asylum where he died shortly afterwards." In 1903, the Scottish detective, who frequently returned to Thurso for holidays, retired on a pension of Â£280-a-year. He died in Surrey on 24 November 1924 and was buried at Kingston cemetery. Mr Swanson's police rattle was brought to the unveiling ceremony in Thurso by his family. Rattles were carried by Metropolitan Police officers until the 1880s as a means of raising an alarm. Whistles replaced rattles because the sound from a whistle travelled further. "The things that he and the other police at the time had to look at, probe at and find out about - I wonder how they could stomach that," said Mrs Berkin, who unveiled the new memorial outside Thurso Police Station earlier this week with the policeman's great grandson Nevill Swanson. Historian Mr McIvor added: "He was something else. The career he had was incredible. The fact he came from Thurso is absolutely fantastic."	A memorial has been unveiled in a Scottish town in honour of a teacher-turned-police officer who investigated the murders of Jack the Ripper.
Johnson scored 15 goals in 41 games for the Heed this season, having signed in July 2015 following his release by Championship side Cardiff City. The 23-year-old has also previously had spells with Stevenage and Tranmere. "If you have someone who is capable of scoring goals, then it's important that you re-sign him," manager Neil Aspin told the club website. "At the age he is, I believe he can get better, too." Gateshead finished ninth in the National League, 13 points outside the play-off places.	Gateshead striker Danny Johnson has signed a two-year contract extension with the National League club.
Chelsea, the reigning Premier League champions, losing at home to Burnley (that's Burnley, the team that won once away in the whole of 2016-17) on the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It is, of course, very early days. But should Antonio Conte be worried? History suggests he should. It's been eight years since a side staged a successful defence of the Premier League title, Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2008-09. And going back even further, since 2006-07 the Scot is one of only two managers - along with Manchester City's Manuel Pellegrini - to win the title and still be in his job come the end of the following May. Carlo Ancelotti (Chelsea, 2009-10), Roberto Mancini (Manchester City, 2011-12), Jose Mourinho (Chelsea, 2014-15) and Claudio Ranieri (Leicester, 2015-16) were all gone 12 months after winning English top flight's biggest prize. That's four of the six title-winning managers before Conte. There's also David Moyes, who took over a side just crowned champions under the retiring Ferguson but who failed to make it to the end of his first season in charge. And if that's not enough to worry Chelsea's Italian manager, what about these stats? Chelsea are only the second reigning Premier League champions to lose the opening game of the following campaign (after Leicester last season). They are also the first title holders to concede three goals in the opening game of the next season, and the first side to pick up two red cards on day one. Worrying times. At least, not in August. There's probably not a single person in your office who did not have Harry Kane in their Fantasy Football team, and why not? The Tottenham striker was the Premier League's top scorer last season with 29 goals. However, there's a strange statistic about the deadly finisher - he has not scored a single goal in August in 11 Premier League appearances.  Not one. With six efforts against Newcastle, no-one had more shots on goal this weekend than Kane. The ball just would not go in the net. Spend that Fantasy Football cash elsewhere... Conte might have had a nightmare on Saturday but one manager certain to have slept soundly was David Wagner. The Huddersfield boss led the Premier League new boys to a stunning 3-0 win at Crystal Palace, a result which meant the Terriers spent a night as the leaders of England's top flight for the first time since 18 August 1970. Only a last-minute goal by Paul Pogba for Manchester United against the Hammers on Sunday denied the Terriers top spot heading into the second round of fixtures. But we're sure Huddersfield fans will get over that disappointment when they read this statistic - of the 14 previous teams to win their Premier League opener following promotion, only four have gone on to be relegated. If you watched Match of the Day on Saturday then you might have been scratching your head at the addition of a new statistic on the end-of-match stats - expected goals. The metric is designed to assess every chance and determine how many goals a team should score in a game. Still confused? Head here to read more. This weekend marked the first time "expected goals" had been rolled out for the Premier League, so what did it tell us? What stands out from the table below is that Burnley and Huddersfield were clinical. Very clinical. They both scored three goals in their respective games, despite their xG value being low. In fact, they are the only two teams to win their games despite having a lower xG value than their opponent. What does that mean? Well, if your cup is half full it bodes well as they were clinical when they had half-chances. But if you're of a slightly more pessimistic persuasion, it also suggests they conceded the kind of chances that, ordinarily, other teams will capitalise on. It also shows that Southampton should have beaten Swansea comfortably but wasteful finishing let them down. Speaking of taking your chances, Huddersfield's record signing - Steve Mounie - had a debut that will live long in his memory. The Benin international, signed from Montpellier in the summer for a club-record £12m, scored two goals from his first two shots in English football. Talk about a way to make an impression. There was also double delight for Romelu Lukaku on his Manchester United debut. The Belgium international made an instant impression at Old Trafford by getting two  goals in Sunday's 4-0 win against West Ham. Lukaku now has 11 goals against the Hammers, more than against any other English side. Is it rare to score more than one goal on your Premier League debut? Forty-three players have bagged a double in their first appearance but only one has managed a hat-trick - Fabrizio Ravanelli for Middlesbrough in 1996. The first debutant to score this weekend was Alexandre Lacazette. Arsenal's record signing did so with his first shot, and his second touch, as a Premier League player; just one minute and 34 seconds into Friday's 4-3 win at Leicester. Unfortunately for Frank de Boer, his Premier League debut was not one he'll want to remember for long. The former Netherlands international was appointed Crystal Palace boss in the summer but the Eagles' surprise defeat by Huddersfield at Selhurst Park makes it one of the worst home debuts for a manager in Premier League history. Alan Smith will have sympathy, although probably not much. His Palace home debut in August 1994 ended with a 6-1 loss to Liverpool. Everton boss Ronald Koeman said Wayne Rooney was "still one of the best in his position" after he scored the only goal in his team's win over Stoke. Rooney himself said it was a "special moment" full of relief and emotion". It also set a new Premier League record for the longest gap between goals for the same team. His last league strike for the club he supported as a boy was in a 1-1 draw against Leeds on 13 April 2004. A few months later he was starring for England at Euro 2004 - before moving to Manchester United shortly before the transfer window closed. His winner on Saturday came 4,869 days after his goal at Elland Road. His header also means that he has now been involved in 300 Premier League goals - scoring 199 of them with a further 101 assists. Only Alan Shearer has been involved in more - with 324. There was no Rooney at Old Trafford on Sunday, of course, but that did not affect Manchester United's incredible opening-day pedigree. The Red Devils' 4-0 thumping of West Ham was their 17th round-one win in 26 Premier League seasons. Conversely, no top-flight team has lost more season openers than the Hammers (11). The victory was also Jose Mourinho's biggest as Manchester United manager and his biggest home win in the Premier League since Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 in March 2014. It's a bit of a familiar sight for Newcastle fans - seeing one of their players sent off. Jonjo Shelvey's second-half dismissal against Tottenham was the fourth time a Magpies player has been sent off in their Premier League opener. Only Arsenal (six) and Charlton (five) have had more opening-day red cards. In total there were three reds shown at the weekend, with the remaining two coming at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea's Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas were sent off. That's quite a lot to kick the season off with, but not the most in Premier League history. The most red cards on an opening weekend is four, an unwanted record set in the 1994-95 and 2003-04 seasons. Back when the Premier League was launched in 1992, Eric Cantona was the first, and only, French player involved. Since then, 199 players have made the short trip across the Channel to play in English football's top flight, with Newcastle's Florian Lejeune becoming the latest on Sunday. The defender was also the 27th Frenchman to play for the Magpies in the Premier League. Follow Match of the Day on Instagram for the best photos from the world of football.	No-one saw it coming.

Injured possums, koalas, kangaroos and wallabies have been arriving at animal rescue centres almost every day. A charity called IFAW appealed for the public to sew tiny mittens, to help protect koalas that had burned paws. So many people sent in mittens, they received enough to last them for a year. Now the charity has asked people to sew comfy pouches help the injured baby kangaroos, called joeys, recover. The pouches help keep the babies warm but have to be changed after every feed, so up to six pouches are needed for each animal every day. The animals are being looked after by keepers at Adelaide Zoo. Once they're better they will be released back to the wild.	Wildlife sanctuaries across southern Australia have been helping injured animals - by asking the public to sew mittens and pouches!
The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that 2,500 homes were repossessed in April, May and June, down from 3,000 in the previous quarter. This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year. Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise. "This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular," said CML director general Paul Smee. "As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening." Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home. Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than Â£1.3 trillion. The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year. The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said. Some 100,700 owner-occupiers, and 5,700 landlords, had arrears of more than 2.5% of the mortgage balance. Ministry of Justice figures, also published on Thursday, show that the number of homeowners in England and Wales facing court action at the earliest stage of the repossession process fell during the second quarter of the year. However, the number of tenants evicted by landlords in the second quarter of the year rose by 4% compared with the same period last year, to 10,361. Seasonally adjusted figures show a 1% decrease compared to the first three months of the year. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: "These figures are a stark warning that relentless rent rises and welfare cuts have contributed to thousands of hard-pressed families losing their home."	The number of homes repossessed in the UK fell again in the second quarter of the year as fewer owners fell behind on mortgage repayments.
Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a "landmark" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply. Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths. Ministers said young people who took them were "taking exceptional risks with their health". A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech. Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto. The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to "any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect", the government said. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws. The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or "hippy crack" - for human use. What are legal highs? The government said the "legitimate sale" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected. Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would "fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances". They would end the "game of cat and mouse" whereby new drugs appeared on the market more quickly than the government could identify and ban them, he said. He added: "The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach." Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed. The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles. Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible. Commander Simon Bray, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: "A blanket ban on new psychoactive substances will make it simpler for law enforcement to deal with those drugs which are potentially unsafe but which may not yet be controlled."	A new "blanket ban" on so-called legal highs will carry prison sentences of up to seven years, the government says.
Australia's foreign minister said these were "not the actions of a friend". The UK took similar action in March, after concluding that Israel was responsible for the use of forged UK passports in the plot. The Israeli foreign ministry said Australia's decision was disappointing. Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said it was "not in line with the importance and the quality of the relationship between our countries". At least four forged Australian passports were used in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January. The originals belonged to Australians living in Israel. The Australian government said a police investigation had left it in no doubt that the Israeli authorities were behind "the abuse and counterfeiting of the passports". As a result Foreign Minister Stephen Smith asked Israel to withdraw a diplomat, whom he did not identify "The decision to ask Israel to remove from Australia one of its officers at the Israeli embassy in Canberra is not something which fills the Australian government with any joy," he said. "On the contrary, the decision was made much more in sorrow than in anger." Passports from France, Ireland, Germany and Britain were used in the operation, and in March, the British government expelled an Israeli diplomat from London. The Israeli government has said there is no proof that it was behind the killing, although Dubai officials have said they are 99.9% sure that agents from Mossad were responsible.	Australia has expelled an Israeli diplomat saying Israel was behind the forging of Australian passports linked to the murder of a Hamas operative in Dubai.
Jak Trueman, 15, was suffering from a rare form of blood cancer called gamma delta T-cell lymphoma. On Saturday he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour. His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: "Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven." She added: "God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx." The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media. Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd. The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond. The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell. On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell. Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson. The teenager wrote on his page: "I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. "I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving. "Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile." At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity. The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months. He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked. Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school. On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment. At the time, Jak wrote: "This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have. "I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it. "I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me." In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike. More money is expected to be raised for charity on Sunday at a special football match being held at the Energy Assets Arena, home of Livingston FC.	A terminally ill schoolboy whose inspirational story helped to raise more than £35,000 for charity in the past week has died.
Sir Christopher Pitchford, the inquiry's chairman, said he recognised the public interest in proceedings being "as open as possible". The senior judge said he would assess each anonymity request individually. The Metropolitan Police has already asked for large parts of the investigation to be in private. Campaigners who say they were wronged during operations dating back decades are calling for maximum disclosure. They include women who did not realise their partners were undercover officers, and a long list of social justice campaigners who are trying to establish whether they were unfairly monitored. The preliminary ruling means that there will be no blanket restrictions on material relating to undercover operations being disclosed if Sir Christopher rules the public interest lies in disclosing them. Some 33 individuals, nine of them former undercover police officers, have already asked for anonymity. Scotland Yard, backed by the government, has also argued it should not be forced to admit to the existence of some operations. Undercover Inquiry: Why it matters - what's at stake? Deceived women: Who has received an apology from the police? In an 85-page ruling, Sir Christopher says that the inquiry will have to grapple with seemingly "irreconcilable" arguments over whether the public interest lies in keeping sensitive police information secret and protecting the true identities of former undercover officers - or in disclosing past events because of public concerns. "The starting point is that no restriction order will be made, in the public interest of openness in the Inquiry and its proceedings, unless it is necessary in the countervailing public interest of the protection of individuals from harm and/or effective policing," says the ruling. "It is not possible to state at the level of principle or generality where the public interest balance will rest. "The Chairman will approach evaluation on a case-by-case basis according to the nature and quality of evidence received in support of the application." One woman who was deceived into an undercover relationship, known only as "Lisa", said she was not optimistic that the ruling would lead to the truth coming out - saying she feared the inquiry had failed to recognise there was a duty to reveal the truth to people who had been victims. "I'm glad that they have not been allowed to have blanket anonymity," she told the BBC. "But my biggest fear is that the police will be able to drag this out. "They won't give up a single piece of information without applying for restriction orders. "It took four-and-a-half years for me to get an apology in my case." The ruling stresses that police officers who want to remain anonymous will have to provide evidence of the possible harm they could be exposed to, if named in public. This would have to include evidence about the nature or gravity of the risk an individual would face and complex arguments about whether naming someone would breach their human rights. Similarly, forces will have to show how disclosure of operational details would cause damage to undercover policing. The Metropolitan Police, backed by other police chiefs and government, had argued that it should be allowed simply to "neither confirm nor deny" details of operations. Sir Christopher must now start assessing the 33 current applications for publicity restrictions and whether any of them need to be backed up by further evidence. In June, Sir Christopher will also begin considering if the state must be forced to tell parents of dead children that their child's identity was used to create fake personas for undercover officers.	Undercover police officers facing claims of wrongdoing will not automatically get anonymity at a forthcoming major public inquiry.
Media playback is not supported on this device Emotion. Drama. Excitement. Brilliant football. Noise. Colour. And all this even before Liverpool's Dejan Lovren rose high at the far post in front of The Kop in injury time to secure a 4-3 victory that will rank alongside the great dramas staged at this sporting theatre. It was played out to the backdrop of Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's almost crazed touchline demeanour and the young coach who succeeded him at Borussia Dortmund, the gifted and wonderfully dignified Thomas Tuchel. Liverpool moved a step closer to earning a place in the Champions League by winning what some regard as Europe's second-rate pot - not a label anyone was attaching to it after this classic. Liverpool into last four after Euro thriller Istanbul 2005 win inspired Reds - Klopp Liverpool fan to name newborn son Dejan When Klopp was introduced as Liverpool manager as successor to sacked Brendan Rodgers in October, he revealed one of his priorities was to "turn doubters into believers". And it was the transition from doubt to belief that was at the core of this remarkable Liverpool victory, both on the pitch and in the stands. If there was a trace of doubt this result would not have happened. In nine blistering minutes from the first whistle, this wonderful Borussia Dortmund side simply tore Liverpool apart, with two goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - it was a time for doubts but Klopp delivered inspiration. Liverpool needed three goals, leaving Klopp to invoke the spirit of Istanbul and the Champions League Final won from 3-0 down at half-time against AC Milan in 2005, saying: "Even if it is not likely it is possible, so we should try." And yet this was a mountain Liverpool had to try to climb twice, Divock Origi opened the door but Marco Reus shut it again to leave three goals needed in 33 minutes. It was time for believers, time for that notion Klopp talked about within minutes of walking into Anfield to be acted upon. And it was as Liverpool completed a turnaround that will become a touchstone for the Klopp era with goals from Philippe Coutinho, Mamadou Sakho and the late drama from Lovren. Borussia Dortmund possessed class in abundance and that opening phase was jaw-dropping - but Liverpool simply broke them by sheer force of will and a refusal to give up. It takes us back to more words from Klopp. After Liverpool lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace at Anfield in November he was taken aback at supporters leaving early, saying it made him feel alone and adding: "We decide when it's over." This was a phrase that could have been stamped on the foreheads of Liverpool's players on Thursday - a symbol of the Klopp approach that will be at the heart of everything they do. If anyone entered Anfield as a doubter they will have been a confirmed and committed believer by the time they left. This night had a special feel even in the hours before kick-off as Anfield was splashed in colour, the yellow and black flags of Borussia Dortmund facing off against the red and white of Liverpool on The Kop. Before the teams emerged, Anfield was serenaded by arguably the longest version of "You'll Never Walk Alone" ever heard at the stadium, Gerry Marsden's voice turned off and Liverpool's supporters taking over, the old anthem returning several times after a brief silence. A minute's silence to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 supporters died was perfectly observed, Anfield a cauldron of emotions. It was Liverpool who looked the more nervous side in the opening stages, cut to pieces by high-class opponents who were not intimidated by the searing atmosphere. Slowly, after a brief and shocked lull caused by a 2-0 deficit, the sound came back to deafening volume and Borussia were unnerved to the point where their resolve was broken. Klopp was a man possessed on the touchline, waving his arms to demand greater encouragement for his players, pointing at his mouth while facing the fans to demand even more noise. It ended up providing a soundtrack to a momentous night. Tuchel said: "When Liverpool equalised you noticed the change. There was belief in the stadium and a feeling it was meant to be. Both sets of fans were fantastic and that was one of the best atmospheres ever at a football match." Klopp added: "It was brilliant, outstanding, emotional, everything. I will not forget it because it was special. I know this is a place for big football moments. We didn't start these stories but it is now our responsibility to try and write some more nice stories." There was certainly a new, unlikely chapter written at Anfield last night. In the afterglow of such sporting brilliance, there was little time for analysis of the nuts and bolts of Liverpool's performance. It was a time to simply reflect on the wonder of what we had witnessed. And yet, when there is time for reflection, it will reveal much of what is good - and still bad - about Liverpool. Divock Origi's goal, his fourth in his past three games, was a piece of composure that confirmed his growing stature and that qualities that persuaded Klopp to pick the 20-year-old ahead of Daniel Sturridge. Even as Liverpool battled Dortmund's supremacy, Origi showed power, pace and a willingness to fight. Very much the Klopp template, recalling the words of his manager after his first game in charge at Tottenham six months ago: "We're going to have a lot of fun with this player." Media playback is not supported on this device Emre Can has had a mixed season but was outstanding before picking up an injury, while Coutinho sprinkles the stardust on this Liverpool team. It seems like splitting hairs after such a glorious spectacle, but Liverpool still have a vulnerability at the back that will surely be addressed by Klopp in the summer. Alberto Moreno is a weak link at left-back and while Sakho may be a popular figure with supporters, talking of "a win for the Liverpool country" and taking selfies on the pitch with Origi, close inspection suggests his positional play was something of an adventure for Dortmund's goals. One thing is clear, however, and qualifies as the biggest plus of all - in the space of six months Klopp has imprinted his identity on his new players and Liverpool's fans. The evidence was all over Anfield. Most definitely - indeed many felt the winner of this tie would go on to claim the trophy. It was not a notion welcomed or encouraged by Klopp. Sevilla, winners for the last two seasons, still lurk after beating Athletic Bilbao on penalties while another Spanish side Villarreal and Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine make up a high-powered last four. But there is almost the spirit of Champions League 2005 about Liverpool's run in the Europa League. Back then Liverpool moved along with no great expectation to not only find themselves in the final but winning it. Klopp will guard against any complacency but the way in which Liverpool pulled off an extraordinary feat on Thursday will give them growing confidence that no task is too onerous for them at Anfield in the semi-finals. The Europa League is not the only prize within reach - a return to the Champions League via victory in this tournament is now tantalisingly coming into view. The famous "This Is Anfield" sign has greeted players on the path to the pitch for decades - many touch it for luck and Klopp even did so himself on a visit to the stadium for a friendly when coach of Borussia Dortmund. It carries an aura but Klopp has put a banning order on his players, saying: "I've told my players you need to win something before you touch the 'This Is Anfield'. It's a sign of respect. You don't do it - it is too big." Klopp has delivered another incentive to his Liverpool charges.	Liverpool won a game that will be talked about for generations - a Europa League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund that will live forever in the memory of all at Anfield.
He was appointed by Nigel Farage in 2014. Nevertheless, he still thinks he enjoys the support of the majority of UKIP members. Now he must convince party members in north Wales to put him on top of their list of candidates for May's assembly election. In each of the assembly's five regions, UKIP's candidates will be ranked in a ballot of party members. Mr Gill says he fought for that ballot inside the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). Some were worried about candidates imposed on them from outside Wales - candidates like former Tory MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton. Mr Gill won't be drawn on individuals. It's up to members to decide, he says. But some say Mr Gill didn't do enough - that the entire selection process should have been handled in Wales and that Mr Gill should stand down "I've worked in Wales for UKIP for 11 years. I know the vast majority of members. I've canvassed with people all over Wales in every single area," he says. "I know the quality of the people that we've got, the passionate membership, the capability that we have. And I've stood up for them. "And maybe some of the members haven't seen that because it's happened behind closed doors. But I've stood up for Wales." Critics in other parties, who dismiss UKIP as anti-Welsh, will raise an eyebrow at that statement. But the critics in his own party are the bigger problem. And because the decisions on how candidates are selected were taken in three private NEC meetings, unless those critics were in the room they have to take Mr Gill at his word. "There are people obviously who don't like me. There are people who do like me. But I think the people who back me by far outweigh those who don't." Some of those speaking out are motivated by "personal reasons", he thinks, having changed their minds about standing as candidates. And those who say he fails to represent the rank-and-file are talking "nonsense". Compared to the other parties, UKIP's selection procedure has been messy. But UKIP sells itself as the antidote to other parties. Despite being an MEP, Mr Gill doesn't see himself as part of a political class. Perhaps that's not surprising in a climate where politicians are routinely traduced. Who would identify themselves as members of the political class? I met him his at his home - a family-run bed and breakfast on Anglesey where he and his wife Jana are raising their five children. Does part of him think he could do without the flack from those who want him to quit? "Part of me does think that of course, I'm human. I've got a beautiful family. I've got a life outside politics." So why carry on? "Because we have the most important election in Wales for us in five years. We must get UKIP representation in that assembly. "And also, very likely in five or six months time we will have the whole raison d'etre of UKIP. "The whole reason why I joined UKIP is that referendum whether or not Britain should be a member of European Union. "Whether we should be governed by Brussels or whether we think we're big enough to make our own laws. "That is why I joined the party. I can't give up at the last hurdle."	Unlike the other four main party leaders in Wales, Nathan Gill wasn't elected by his party members.
However, she said there were "many, many other questions" about Brexit and there was "still a lot to do". The UK proposal was unveiled by Prime Minister Theresa May at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday. It would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years a new "UK settled status". That would allow them to stay in the country and access health, education and other benefits. The plan would affect 3.2 million EU citizens now living in the UK. Their rights - and the rights of UK citizens living in the rest of the EU - are among the thorny issues that have to be resolved early on in Brexit talks, along with the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. "Theresa May made clear today that EU citizens who have been in Great Britain for five years can keep their full rights. That's a good start," said Mrs Merkel at the end of Thursday's talks. "But of course there are many, many other questions about Brexit - about finances, about the relationship with Ireland - which means we still have a lot to do until October." She insisted that Brexit was not the focus of the summit - the UK's split from the EU is being negotiated separately. "For me the shaping of the future of the 27 is a priority coming before the issue of the negotiations with Britain on the exit," she added. Before Mrs May's offer, the EU proposed that EU citizens in the UK and the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in EU countries should continue enjoying the same rights, enforceable by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). At the summit, the PM sought to reassure the 27 other EU states, saying the UK "does not want anyone here to have to leave, nor does it want families to be split up". "No-one will face a cliff edge," she said. The UK stunned the EU when it voted to end its membership in a referendum a year ago on Friday. The exit deadline is 30 March 2019. The summit's final day is to focus on migration, security and economic issues. Counter-terrorism has been a key issue at the summit which comes in the wake of an attack in Brussels on Tuesday. Several EU states have been attacked in recent weeks, including the UK, France and Sweden, and Mrs May said that an attack against any member state was an attack on all. Both sides would like to get the issue of citizens' rights wrapped up as soon as possible - it would be good for morale to get an early win, and they have more difficult issues to tackle. But while there is a sense that progress can be made, there are still some tricky technical questions to deal with. Which rights will be extended to immediate family members living elsewhere - to children in particular? And who will guarantee citizens' rights in the event of any legal dispute? The EU has already insisted that the European Court of Justice should be involved; the UK insists that British courts should uphold the deal. It is also not clear what the cut-off date should be for citizens to qualify for any offer that is agreed. The UK proposal suggests a date between March 2017 and March 2019 - although it is highly unlikely that the EU would be willing to accept a date that has already passed. From an EU perspective, what we've heard so far from the UK side remains rather vague. EU negotiators will want to see the details of this proposal which are only due to be made public next Monday.	German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described UK plans to ensure the rights of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit as "a good start".
Ivan Cameron, who had cerebral palsy and epilepsy, died in hospital aged six in February 2009. Mrs Cameron told the Times: "Ive dying is such a massive thing that everything else is irrelevant." She also said it changed her husband's outlook. "I think it changed Dave's politics. It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective." David Cameron had been an MP for less than a year when Ivan was born in 2002, and became prime minister the year after Ivan died. Mrs Cameron said: "From the moment he is born, you are living in a situation that is quite surreal and difficult to deal with. "It is intense every day, in and out of hospitals... in a way, that prepared me for Dave being prime minister, because I was used to living and operating in a way that's not normal." When Ivan died, she said, the outside world "became meaningless". "Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice." The Camerons have three other children; Nancy, born in 2004; Arthur, born in 2006; and Florence, born in 2010. Mrs Cameron also spoke about her family's life in Downing Street. "We tried to make the flat feel like a home. "Dave would be combing the children's hair for nits before giving a speech in the evening." They got their groceries delivered because there was no supermarket nearby - and if she forgot butter, she would have to go to a shop in Trafalgar Square. "So I did plan quite carefully." She also said she dreaded the official holiday photograph. "At the last minute we would panic and think, 'Oh God, it's the holiday photo... "I hated the holding-hands thing because it looked too romantic, so we overdid the cups-of-coffee-looking-wistful pose." Mrs Cameron was speaking to the Times Magazine to promote her clothing brand Cefinn. Before her husband became Prime Minister, she was creative director for Smythson, which makes luxury leather goods.	Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former Prime Minister, has said their son's death "overshadowed everything".
The victim was taken to hospital from Crown Street, Acton, on Friday but died from his injuries. A 16-year-old suspect was arrested and remains in custody in South London, police said. Officers are continuing to question a 17-year-old arrested near the scene on suspicion of murder, the Met said. Police believe they know the identity of the dead youth but it has yet to be formally confirmed. Det Ch Insp Rebecca Reeves said the street would have been busy at the time of the stabbing and asked for anyone with information to come forward. She added: "We are particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw or heard an argument outside a cafe on Crown Street."	A second teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a west London street.
A total of 387 people were arrested between February 2016 and February 2017 - up from 255 the previous year. Meanwhile more than half of cabin crew who responded to a survey said they had witnessed disruptive drunken passenger behaviour at UK airports. The Home Office is "considering" calls for tougher rules on alcohol. The arrest figures obtained by Panorama came from 18 out of the 20 police forces with a major airport in their area. Trade body Airlines UK said it should be made illegal for people to drink their own alcohol on board a plane. A total of 19,000 of the Unite union's cabin crew members were surveyed and 4,000 responded, with one in five saying they had suffered physical abuse. A former cabin crew manager with Virgin, Ally Murphy, quit her job last October after 14 years and told Panorama: "People just see us as barmaids in the sky. "They would touch your breasts, or they'd touch your bum or your legs. I've had hands going up my skirt before." In July 2016 the aviation industry introduced a voluntary code of conduct on disruptive passengers, which most of the big airlines and airports signed up to. The code's advice included asking retailers to warn passengers not to consume duty-free purchases on the plane, while staff are also asked not to sell alcohol to passengers who appear drunk. Panorama found more than a quarter of cabin crew surveyed were unaware of the code of practice and, of those who had heard of it, only 23% thought it was working. One anonymous crew member told Panorama: "The code of conduct isn't working… We're seeing these incidents on a daily, a weekly, a monthly basis. It's the alcohol mainly in the duty free that is the significant problem." Sources: Airlines UK* and UK Travel Retail Forum** Manchester Airport is one of the signatories but when Panorama's undercover reporter asked at World Duty Free whether she could open alcohol bought at a duty-free shop to consume on the plane, she was told "officially probably not, unofficially I think you'll get away with it". Another shop in the airport did give the right advice. World Duty Free said it was committed to dealing with the issue and that it displays "clear advisory notices at till points, on till receipts and on carrier bags that remind customers that alcohol purchases cannot be opened until their final destination is reached". Airlines UK, which represents carriers such as Virgin, British Airways and EasyJet, wants the government to amend the law to make consumption of a passenger's own alcohol on board an aircraft a criminal offence. Airlines can limit the amount of alcohol sold to passengers on board flights. Low-cost airline Jet2 has already banned alcohol sales on flights before 08:00 and managing director Phil Ward agreed further action was needed. "I think they [airports] could do more. I think the retailers could do more as well. "Two litre steins of beer in bars, mixes and miniatures in duty free shops, which can only be there for one reason - you know, they're items that are not sold on the high street. "We can't allow it not to change." A House of Lords committee report earlier this year called for tougher rules on the sale of alcohol at airports. Committee chair Baroness McIntosh of Pickering said: "We didn't hear one shred of evidence to show the voluntary code was either working now or had any possible vestige of success in working any time soon." The Home Office said it was considering the report's recommendations, which include revoking the airports' exemption from the Licensing Act, "and will respond in due course". Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said: "I don't accept that the airports don't sell alcohol responsibly. The sale of alcohol per se is not a problem. It's the misuse of it and drinking to excess and then behaving badly." She said they were working with retailers and staff to make sure they understand the rules.	Arrests of passengers suspected of being drunk at UK airports and on flights have risen by 50% in a year, a Panorama investigation has revealed.
More than 700,000 employees face unpaid leave due to the shutdown which was triggered after the two houses of Congress did not agree on a new budget. Hyundai said affected employees who currently own its vehicles will be given a payment relief "for as long as they are out of work". Employees looking to buy a new car will be given a 90-day payment deferral. "We recognize the impact on family budgets that the furlough will drive," John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said in a statement. Hyundai had offered a similar scheme, the Hyundai Assurance programme, during the peak of the global financial crisis four years ago to help consumers who had lost their jobs. Many analysts have said that the move had helped the South Korean firm win customer loyalty and boosted its sales in recent years. The company said that its latest offer to help the federal employees was an addition to that programme and aimed at "helping workers at a time when they most need it". "Like we did almost four years ago when we launched Hyundai Assurance, this is our way of saying 'We've got your back' during this uncertain time," Mr Krafcik said. Under the latest offer, Hyundai will extend all auto loan and lease payments during the shutdown for current Hyundai owners who are put on unpaid leave. The programme is available to all customers who have financed their purchase or lease through Hyundai Finance America.	Hyundai Motor will defer payments due from US federal employees affected by the partial government shutdown.
Leg-spinner Mason Crane, called into the England Test squad earlier in the day, took 3-21 as the hosts restricted Glamorgan to 118-6 on a slow pitch. Captain James Vince (60 not out) saw Hampshire home with six overs to spare. Meanwhile, Middlesex prevailed in a tight finish at Lord's as Sussex, who needed five runs from the last over for victory, could only manage two. Middlesex posted 147-6 thanks to Stevie Eskinazi's 57 not out from 44 balls and Paul Stirling's 40 from 31, as England seamer Chris Jordan (2-29) impressed. Sussex began their chase well thanks to Chris Nash (64), but only he and Stiaan van Zyl (34) reached double figures as they slumped from 125-4 in the 17th over to 140-7 - with eight runs needed from the final nine balls of the innings. That meant a nervy last over, bowled by seamer Tom Helm - but he began with two dot balls, had Jofra Archer caught off the third, and David Wiese could only manage a two off the fifth ball as Helm held his nerve and Middlesex sneaked home by two runs. It leaves both South Group sides in mid-table on 10 points from 11 games. Meanwhile, Hampshire's spin-heavy tactics were clear from the start with Crane, fellow leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and slow left-armer Liam Dawson taking a combined 6-52 from their 12 overs of spin. Dawson - left out of the Test squad in favour of Crane - took the new ball and made an immediate impact, bowling Aneurin Donald with the third ball of the match. Glamorgan's top order could not get going and only a stand of 53 in the final 6.3 overs between Andrew Salter (37 not out) and Graham Wagg (15 not out) gave them any respectability. But despite losing debutant wicketkeeper Calvin Dickinson in the first over, Hampshire always looked in control of an easy run chase. Vince's unbeaten 60 came off just 41 balls and featured 10 fours, while he was ably assisted by Tom Alsop (28 from 19) and George Bailey (25 not out). It helped Hampshire move to within a point of Glamorgan at the top with two games left. Gloucestershire who have a game in hand, and Somerset occupy the other quarter-final berths, two points ahead of Sussex, Middlesex and Surrey. Who will qualify from the T20 Blast South Group?	Hampshire spun their way to an eight-wicket victory over T20 Blast South Group leaders Glamorgan at Southampton.
Shares in Barclays fell 0.9% after the US Department of Justice sued the bank for alleged mortgage securities fraud. It says Barclays misled investors about the quality of loans backing securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Barclays has rejected the claims Data showed the UK economy grew faster than estimated in the third quarter. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy grew by 0.6% in the July-to-September quarter, compared with the previous estimate of 0.5%. However, the ONS also trimmed its growth estimates for the first and second quarters of the year. On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2258, and slid 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.1725.	UK shares edged higher in the final trading session before Christmas, with the FTSE 100 ending a shortened session up 4.49 points at 7,068.17.
The International Football Association Board (IFAB), the body which oversees the rules of the game, passed the law at a meeting in Zurich. It will come in to force on 1 June, in time for the World Cup in Brazil. The new law was proposed by the Football Association and will apply to domestic and international football. FA general secretary Alex Horne said: "The idea is to get some consistency. The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed." From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous "Why Always Me?" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction. Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: "It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup." Law 4 of the game, which relates to players' equipment, will be amended. It states: "Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo. "A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa." Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called "triple punishment" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored. It was agreed that a pilot project carried out by the FA and Scottish Football Association relating to revolving substitutes in amateur football will continue, as will a Uefa experiment into the use of a sin bin in recreational football. The IFAB also discussed the potential use of video replays for match officials but remains of the view that technology should be allowed only for goal-line incidents because "it is a clear yes or no decision". An IFAB statement read: "Concerns were raised about video replays slowing the game down and increasing the number of stoppages."	Players who display messages on T-shirts worn underneath their strips will face punishment after new proposals were agreed.
The Accounts Commission said there was a risk services could not be maintained without improvements in the way the council was run. But the report recognised that the council delivered good services at the moment. The authority needs to save Â£22.3m - 10% of its budget - by 2017/18. On top of that, council reserves are low and are projected to fall further, the report said. The Accounts Commission is the public spending watchdog for local government in Scotland. In its report, the commission said the council urgently needed "clearer priorities" in its transformation programme to ensure key projects were completed and savings made. The report recognised the council's "commitment to improvement", but added that it was concerned about the pace of those improvements. Deficiencies highlighted by the commission included financial control and management of resources. The chairman of the commission, Douglas Sinclair, said: "There is a gap between the council's ambition and seeing evidence of that on the ground. This is what East Dunbartonshire needs to address if it is to continue to deliver good quality services in the future."	A public spending watchdog has published "serious concerns" over the financial control of East Dunbartonshire Council.
Two shots were fire through windows of the house in Moneyleck Park at about 22:20 GMT on Monday. The man, who was in the house at the time, received hospital treatment for his injuries. He has since been discharged from hospital.	A man has sustained minor injuries in a gun attack at a house in Rasharkin, County Antrim.
They had no phone signal so were only able to contact the emergency services by using Facebook. The coastguard received the alert just before 23:00 GMT on Saturday and said they found the women from the pictures they sent. A police helicopter took them to hospital for treatment. Dawn Petrie, from the coastguard, said weather conditions at the time were not favourable. "Whenever we got the photograph through, there had been heavy rain, it was misty, it was cold, it was damp," she said. "Fortunately that cloud actually cleared to allow the police helicopter to attempt to attend should the ambulance not have been able to reach them."	Two women, one with a suspected broken leg, have been rescued from Divis Mountain in Belfast.
The 17-year-old boy was arrested at an address in Netherton, West Midlands Police said, and remains in custody. A 65-year-old man was attacked at 18:15 GMT in Owen Street, Kates Hill, Dudley, suffering serious stab wounds to his head, shoulder, chest and back. Police said he was now in a stable condition in hospital. Det Insp Greg Evans said: "Thankfully, the man is... recovering well in hospital. "We are still working to establish a motive for the attack and we are currently questioning a teenage boy, who was arrested yesterday afternoon."	A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on his doorstep in the West Midlands on Tuesday.
League of Gentleman star Steve Pemberton will adapt EF Benson's novels about two ladies who vie for social prestige in small-town England. The characters were previously played by Prunella Scales and Geraldine McEwan in a Channel 4 series in 1985. Richardson, who will play Elizabeth Mapp, said: "I cannot wait to get my teeth into Mapp, and of course, Lucia." "I am so looking forward to a summer of hard work and I hope, great fun," said the Parade's End star. Chancellor - whose recent TV credits include Fleming and The Hour - said she was "thrilled to be playing the glorious Lucia". "I hope I can do justice to EF Benson's wonderful creations," she added The comic drama, set in the 1930s, focuses on the snobberies and pretensions of life in the quaint English town of Tilling - and the rivalry which ensues between the visiting Mrs Emmeline Lucas (Lucia) and Tilling socialite Elizabeth Mapp. "I feel sure viewers will relish their time in Tilling, and will enjoy watching the slyly scheming Mapp take on the gloriously haughty Lucia in a dizzying round of bitter bridge parties, devious dinners and malicious musical evenings," said screenwriter Pemberton. Pemberton - who is currently starring in BBC One drama Happy Valley - described himself as a "long-time fan" of Benson's six "deplorably funny novels". "But be warned," he added "this is no jolly period romp. This is a series about a war. May the worst-behaved woman win." Mark Gatiss, Pemberton's League of Gentleman co-star, will join the cast as Major Benjy in the three hour-long films. No transmission date has been announced.	Miranda Richardson and Anna Chancellor will take the lead roles in a new BBC One adaptation of Mapp And Lucia.
It happened at the Mill Street level crossing in Leominster, Herefordshire, at 05:50 GMT on Friday. The nearby A44 is likely to be closed all day, Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue service said.

Defence ministry spokesman Lt Gen Sergei Rudskoi said the Syrian army was poised to defeat IS militants there. But US officials said Russia staged no air strikes in Syria in the past week. The strikes come days after President Vladimir Putin ordered the withdrawal of most Russian forces from Syria. IS militants captured the ancient city of Palmyra last May. Since then it has blown up monumental temples, arches and statues in the Unesco World Heritage site, bringing global condemnation. Meanwhile, IS claimed on Friday it had killed five Russian soldiers in fighting around Palmyra in recent days. Russia has not commented on the claim and there is no independent verification. In recent months, IS has been losing ground to President Bashar al-Assad's forces, rebel groups, and Kurdish militia fighters. Gen Rudskoi told reporters in Moscow that the Syrian army had also seized key hilltop areas near the city of Aleppo and cut supply routes leading to the IS-held city. US Central Command spokesman Patrick Ryder said there had been some bombardments in the Palmyra region but that they were thought to be made by Russian artillery. Russia had withdrawn most if not all of its strike aircraft and there had been little movement of its ground forces, Col Ryder said. Indirect peace talks aimed at resolving the Syrian conflict have been taking place in Geneva for the past week, but so far shown no progress.	Russia says its warplanes are carrying out up to 25 air strikes a day around the Syrian city of Palmyra in support of Syrian forces trying to oust so-called Islamic State (IS).
Ricky Miller ended a run of two games without a goal with a penalty in the 26th minute, sending Liam Roberts the wrong way after his own trickery in the box drew the foul from Chester's Matthew Waters. James Alabi was a constant threat for Chester and he showed great strength with his back to goal to spin and lash home an equaliser on the half-hour mark. Miller then raced clear of the visitors' backline and finished his 29th goal of the season after 49 minutes, before Joe Healy completed the scoring with a superb volley from the edge of the box nine minutes later.

Shami Chakrabarti's inquiry reported in June that the party was not "overrun" by anti-Semitism. Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said her report's credibility "lies in tatters" after she accepted the peerage. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn praised her "legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained." Ms Chakrabarti said she was "honoured to accept Jeremy Corbyn's challenge". The former director of civil liberties group Liberty said it was an "opportunity to help hold the government to account". She also said: "This is a dangerous moment for our country and we share vital human rights values that need defending more than ever before in my lifetime." Who is Shami Chakrabarti She was the Labour leader's only nomination as part of David Cameron's resignation honours list. Ms Chakrabarti was appointed to lead an independent inquiry into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone. The review found there was evidence of "ignorant attitudes" but said the "Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism". In a statement posted on Twitter, the Chief Rabbi said: "Shami Chakrabarti has a proud record of public service, but in accepting this peerage, the credibility of her report lies in tatters and the Labour Party's stated intention, to unequivocally tackle anti-Semitism, remains woefully unrealised." Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said: "Shami Chakrabarti will bring great experience to Lords. But let's not pretend that a Labour peerage in these circumstances doesn't stink." Marie van der Zyl, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said it was "beyond disappointing" that she had been offered a peerage by Labour "following her so-called independent inquiry". And a statement from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: "If anybody still took Shami Chakrabarti's report on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party or Jeremy Corbyn's declared opposition to anti-Semitism seriously, this must be the final straw... "Having promised to never send anyone to the House of Lords, that is exactly what Jeremy Corbyn has done in return for a clean bill of health." But a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: "Shami Chakrabarti shares Jeremy's ambition for reform of the House of Lords. "Her career has been one of public service and human rights advocacy. "Her legal and campaigning skills, and the trust that she has gained from many ordinary Britons, will be a considerable asset to the House of Lords. "Brexit will put many hard-fought rights at risk, so it is crucial that those equipped with the right skills are given the opportunity to hold this government to account." Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson had called on the party to boycott the honours process amid criticism of David Cameron's use of his resignation list to recognise former Downing Street staff, Conservative donors and Remain campaign officials. Before the official list was published on Thursday, Mr Watson told the Evening Standard: "Labour cannot legitimise this process by co-operating. Labour requires working peers, as do the other opposition parties, but we cannot allow an outrageous abuse of a prime minister's discretionary power to go unchallenged." Several Conservative MPs have expressed reservations about some of the 46 names on the list - which were all approved by a committee independent of government. Tim Loughton tweeted: "To have your resignation honours list leaked is unfortunate. "To go ahead with it after such a public outcry about cronyism, chumocracy and bringing whole honours system into disrepute stinks, not least for those on list who actually deserve to be and previous worthy recipients." But a former leader of the House of Lords has defended the decision to also create 13 new Conservative peers, saying an unprecedented number of Conservative members of the unelected chamber had retired since 2010, including 13 in the past year. "150 peers departed since 2010 (43 Tories). Highest rate of exits since hereditary 'cull' because possible for peers to retire," Baroness Stowell tweeted. She added: "It is a privileged opportunity to do, not a reward for having done. Look forward to welcoming new colleagues". The new appointments mean the Conservatives will have one more life peer than Labour - 207 to 206 - but are still well short of an overall majority, partly due to the large number of crossbench members.	Jewish community leaders have criticised Jeremy Corbyn's decision to nominate the head of Labour's anti-Semitism inquiry for a peerage.
"The truth is that Taylor Swift and I are together, and we're very happy," the actor told the Hollywood Reporter. "That's the truth," he continued. "It's not a publicity stunt." Hiddleston has been speaking about his first Emmy nomination for The Night Manager, saying it was "fantastic" to to be up for outstanding lead actor. Hiddleston played concierge-turned-spy Jonathan Pine in the BBC's adaptation of John le Carre's novel. He was nominated on Thursday for the prize for lead actor in a miniseries or movie, alongside fellow Brits Benedict Cumberbatch and Idris Elba, and US stars Bryan Cranston, Cuba Gooding Jr and Courtney B Vance. But it is speculation about his relationship with Swift that has been rife in the press since they were snapped embracing near Swift's home in Rhode Island last month. The images went viral online. Hiddleston, 35, who is in Australia shooting reprising his Loki role in the latest Thor film, had previously refused to discuss the relationship with the press. There had been reports that they could have been filming a music video together. "I'd rather just talk about my work if that's all right," he told one reporter in Queensland earlier this week. But when asked by the Hollywood Reporter how he would "respond to people who claim that you're involved in some sort of publicity stunt", the British actor rejected the "notion". The magazine reported that he laughed at the question and thanked them for asking it. Swift was previously in a relationship with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, who 'unfollowed' her on Twitter after images of the singer kissing Hiddleston appeared online.

The holders won eight straight races to triumph 9-8 after being docked two points for cheating in the build-up. Oracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010. The Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew. The British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence. "It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege," said Ainslie. Ainslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history. "To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb," Ainslie added. "We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that. "The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. " The New Zealanders, with impressive early pace upwind and slicker boat handling, opened up a seven-point lead (six to minus one) as Oracle's crew and equipment changes took effect. Media playback is not supported on this device But the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the "Auld Mug". The Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed. In the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg. After briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win. I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed "What a race," said Spithill, 34, after only the third winner-takes-all final in the event's history. "It had everything. Man, these guys just showed so much heart. "On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day." Barker, 41, said: "It's obviously very hard to fathom. We went out there to give it our absolute best shot. We felt we didn't leave anything on the table. It's very hard to swallow. The gains they've made are phenomenal. "I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand." As winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup. The US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling. Ellison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition. They opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph. Races were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers. But the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors. Oracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus. Critics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle. Artemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final. But despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.	Sir Ben Ainslie's Oracle Team USA sealed one of sport's greatest comebacks when they overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in the America's Cup decider in San Francisco.
His first spell at the club saw him win the Premier League twice, the FA Cup, the League Cup twice and the Community Shield. He was one of the most colourful characters in the British game and has since enjoyed success at Inter Milan and Real Madrid before returning to London. BBC Sport looks at some of Mourinho's best quotes and controversies. On becoming Chelsea manager for the first time: "I have top players and I'm sorry, we have a top manager. Please do not call me arrogant because what I say is true. I'm European champion, I'm not one out of the bottle, I think I'm a special one." On bird flu: "I'm feeling a lot of pressure with the swan in Scotland. It's not far and I'm more scared of the swan than of football. What's football compared to life? A swan with bird flu, for me that's a drama." On drinking wine with then-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: "After the game, after the press conference, we were together in my office. The wine we were drinking was very bad and he was complaining. When we go to Old Trafford it's my birthday and I will go with a beautiful bottle of Portuguese wine." Media playback is not supported on this device On eggs: "Omelettes, eggs. No eggs, no omelettes. And it depends on the quality of the eggs in the supermarket. They are class one, two or three and some are more expensive than others and some give you better omelettes. When the class one eggs are not available you have a problem." On being sacked: "If the club decide to sack me because of bad results that's part of the game. If it happens I will be a millionaire and get another club a couple of months later." On Chelsea's pitch: "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. From the top it's a disgrace but the ball rolls at normal speed." On playing Chelsea, while manager of Real Madrid: "If I play them in the Champions League, I want to go there and kill them - that's my message," Then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez: "If Chelsea are naive and pure then I'm Little Red Riding Hood." Then-Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock: "My wife will be glad about Mourinho coming to Bramall Lane because he's a good looking swine, isn't he?" Career record up to 1 June 2013 Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen: "When Mourinho says training will last one-and-a-half hours it will never last a second longer." Then-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba's reaction to Mourinho leaving the London club: "I find Jose's 'eviction' hard to take. I could not see the blow coming so brutally. "It changes an awful lot of things. I am in the sort of nervous state I've never dreamed about before. Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager. Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation." Ian Holloway on Mourinho's sacking by Chelsea: "Football has gone mad. He is one of the best managers in the world. I'm devastated. I was learning from him from afar. He makes you feel 25-foot tall and I'm going to sorely miss him." Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi on Mourinho's return to Chelsea: "It is not good for English football. If Mourinho behaves like he did in Spain it will only be an unhappy relationship. In his three years in Spain he only created disagreements and arguments. I am happy he is leaving and so is everyone in Spanish football." February 2005: After Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 clash, Mourinho wrongly accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of visiting referee Anders Frisk at half-time. Mourinho is fined £8,900, given a two-match touchline ban and called an "enemy of football" by the head of Uefa's referees committee Volker Roth. March 2005: Mourinho is fined £5,000 after he alleged Manchester United players were guilty of "fault and fault and cheat and cheat" during a Carling Cup semi-final clash. June 2005: Mourinho is fined £200,000, which is reduced to £75,000 on appeal, for meeting then-Arsenal player Ashley Cole, without his club's consent. January to March 2010: While manager of Inter Milan, Mourinho is fined three times in as many months by the Italian Football Federation. December 2010: Mourinho is banned for one Champions League match after being found guilty of improper conduct. It follows the dismissal of Real Madrid players Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during a Champions League game against Ajax. August 2011: Mourinho, now in charge of Real Madrid, pokes Barcelona's then-assistant manager Tito Vilanova in the eye during touchline exchanges after a stormy Spanish Super Cup tie. January 2013: After dropping club captain Iker Casillas before the mid-winter break, reports emerge in the Spanish press of disagreements between Mourinho and some of his senior players. Stories continue to appear throughout the rest of the season about disharmony in the squad, with centre-back Pepe the latest to fall foul of Mourinho last month. May 2013: In a bad-tempered Copa del Rey final defeat by neighbours Atletico Madrid, Mourinho is sent from the bench for furiously protesting a decision from the referee. He was jeered by sections of the Real support during his final game in charge against Osasuna.	Jose Mourinho is back as manager of Chelsea after leaving Stamford Bridge in September 2007.
They say the lengths of tiny pieces of DNA called telomeres indicate whether a young creature is likely to live long into old age. But before you rush out to get your telomeres stretched - were such a process possible - it is worth pointing out that the creatures they have been working with are not humans but altogether shorter-lived zebra finches. Everything that is made up of living cells contains chromosomes: the genetic code that makes us what we are. At the ends of each chromosome lie the telomeres. They have been likened to the caps on the ends of shoelaces - they stop things from unravelling. Over time they wear down - and when they do, the DNA they protect is compromised and the cell can malfunction or die. This is where the zebra finches came in: how early and accurately could longer telomeres predict a longer life? To find out, the Glasgow researchers collaborated with colleagues at Exeter University, with Glasgow's Prof Pat Monaghan leading the team. Tiny blood samples were taken from a group of 99 zebra finches and the lengths of their telomeres measured. They were tested again throughout their lifetimes. To find out how long the birds lived, the researchers had to wait until they died.  The first turned up its claws in just over six months.  But the last hardy specimen kept them waiting almost nine years. In every case the longest lived birds had the longest telomeres, but the best predictor of lifespan was the length of the telomeres at just 25 days old. Prof Monaghan says the study shows the importance of processes acting early in life. The next step will be to find out why the length of telomeres can vary so much from individual to individual. "We now need to know more about how early life conditions can influence the pattern of telomere loss and the relative importance of inherited and environmental factors," she said. The results of the research have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. They are certain to raise the question of whether our telomeres are similar predictors of how long we will live. But it is a big leap from the laboratory to the real world - whatever our telomeres may say, human lifespans also have to contend with additional factors like diet, drink and stress. Wild finches, meanwhile, have snakes and birds of prey to worry about. The bottom line for now?  Ask not for whom the zebra finch chirps...	Scientists at Glasgow University say they have found a key genetic indicator of how long an individual will live.
Bill Palmer, from Southampton, called the Alex Dyke show on BBC Radio Solent about his life after his wife went into a nursing home. Dyke immediately ordered a taxi to bring Mr Palmer to the studio to allow phone-in listeners to chat to him. A recording of the call has been viewed tens of thousands of times on Facebook. The 95-year-old, from Sholing, married his wife Sheila, 85, on 2 June 2014 after they had been friends for 30 years. Shortly afterwards Sheila - who has dementia and colitis - fell and was taken into hospital. She was then moved into a nursing home, where she now lives. Mr Palmer phoned the BBC Radio Solent programme on Wednesday during a phone-in on "Love - later in life". Although he visits his wife every day, he said: "Every day is hell. I feel so alone". The production team immediately arranged to take Mr Palmer to the studio in Southampton, where he sat in on the rest of the show. Mr Palmer said: "I just sit with my wife and we tell each other we love each other, and that's it. "She knows who I am and she often says 'we did get married on the second of June didn't we?' - and that's when it hurts. "I listen to the radio and watch TV and have lots of friends, but unfortunately when you get old people don't visit - that's life." Listeners phoned in to offer support and advice to Mr Palmer. He was offered Sunday lunch, afternoon trips out and a ukulele orchestra to play for him, but he kindly turned them all down. "I didn't know such kindness existed," he told one caller. Dyke said Mr Palmer had "touched the hearts of thousands of listeners" and it was his "nicest moment in 30 years of broadcasting".	A 95-year-old invited into a BBC radio programme after calling in about being lonely has become a hit on social media.
Connor Williams, 17, and Conor Tiley, 18, both from Aberbargoed, died in a crash on New Road, Tir-y-Berth, Hengoed, on 3 January. The teenager was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Gwent Police confirmed no further action would be taken.	A 17-year-old boy arrested following a crash which killed two teenagers in Caerphilly county has been released without charge.
Around 200 people are feared to have drowned as they tried to cross from Zuwara, west of Tripoli, to Italy. Police in Italy have detained 10 suspected traffickers after 52 people were found dead in the hold of a ship off the coast of Libya on Wednesday. President Obama's spokesman said the migrant crisis showed that unrest in the Middle East had a worldwide impact. Josh Earnest said Europe should get tougher on traffickers who were exploiting migrants. On Friday workers from the Libyan Red Crescent were undertaking the grim task of recovering migrants' bodies which had washed up on the coast. "We, the Red Crescent, work with nothing. Some fishermen help us with a boat," Ibrahim al-Attoushi from the Red Crescent in Zuwara told Reuters. "We only have one ambulance car." Around 100 bodies have already been found, and the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) said a further 100 people are unaccounted for. Some of those who died were trapped in the hull of one of the boats. The Libyan coast-guard had worked overnight on Thursday, searching for survivors from the two boats. At least 150 survivors of the sinkings have been taken to a refugee centre and a detention centre in Libya. Ayman Talaal, a Syrian survivor, said he and his family had been "forced into this route". "It's called the route of death. It is now called the grave of the Mediterranean sea," he said. While most of the victims of Thursday's capsizes are thought to be from Syria and African countries, a Bangladeshi diplomat told the BBC that at least five Bangladeshi nationals, including a six-month-old baby, were among the dead. Some survivors were rescued having spent the night in the water, clinging to life jackets. Meanwhile officials in Palermo investigating the deaths of 52 migrants found dead in a boat's hold on Wednesday have detained 10 of the 571 survivors brought ashore, on suspicion of murder, Rai TV reports. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia told AP that those detained included seven Moroccans, two Syrians and a Libyan. A Swedish coastguard ship, the Poseidon, working with the EU's Frontex border agency, brought the survivors and the bodies to the Sicilian port. Thousands of people set off from lawless Libya every night, packed into boats, trying to reach safety in Europe. Many of the vessels are not seaworthy and are overcrowded. Since the overthrow of Col Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has descended into chaos, with various militias fighting for power. The internationally-recognised government has been forced to leave Tripoli and does not control the country's western coast, from where most migrant boats depart, aiming for Italy. The UNHCR says more than 2,500 people have died trying to reach Europe so far in 2015, not including Thursday's deaths. Meanwhile Austrian police have confirmed that 71 people died inside a refrigerated lorry found abandoned on a motorway near the Hungarian border. They think that at least some of the dead were from Syria. "If we had an orderly safe way for people to come to Europe then we would avoid these tragedies," the UNHCR's William Spindler told the BBC. "We would also have less incentives for illegal immigration because we would have legal avenues to come, so people would not have to risk their lives in this way".	Libyan workers continue to search for bodies at sea and on shore after two migrant vessels capsized on Thursday.
After 11 hours of secret discussions, the musicians could not reach a decision on a replacement for Sir Simon Rattle, who steps down in 2018. Board member Peter Riegelbauer said they would try again "within a year". The orchestra's 123 members met in a south-west Berlin church on Monday and were banned from using mobile phones. But after an announcement was delayed several times, Mr Riegelbauer said: "I must unfortunately tell you that we haven't reached any result." From September 2017, Sir Simon is to join the London Symphony Orchestra as its music director. Among his possible successors are: The Berlin Philharmonic, founded in 1882, has had three chief conductors over the past six decades:	Members of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra have been unable to agree on who should be their next chief conductor and artistic director.
The 80 signatories include leading figures in the Asian hospitality industry and award-winning gospel singer Rachel Kerr. The PM is expected to recommend Britain remains in a reformed EU. Remain campaigners said several Commonwealth leaders, including India's PM, had urged Britain to stay in. The 80 figures from Britain's Commonwealth community criticised Mr Cameron for a lack of ambition in his EU reform demands, which he hopes to put to the public in a referendum in June. They claimed the UK government's immigration policy discriminates against non-EU citizens. In their letter to Mr Cameron, published by the Vote Leave campaign, they say: "As patriotic Britons of Commonwealth backgrounds, we saw the EU renegotiation as an opportunity to rediscover Britain's global vocation. "As long as Britain's trade policy is controlled by the EU, we cannot sign bilateral free trade agreements with Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand or for that matter any other non-EU state. "Vested interests on the Continent sustain a relatively protectionist policy. We have to apply the EU's common external tariff to exports from Commonwealth countries - hurting consumers here as well as producers there. "At the same time, our immigration policy forces us, in effect, to turn away qualified workers from the Commonwealth so as to free up unlimited space for migrants from the EU. "The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom." One of the signatories, Pasha Khandaker, president of the UK Bangladesh Caterers Association UK, said the 12,000 curry houses his organisation represents "have been struggling to recruit the talent that they need because of the difficulties associated with employing people from outside of the EU". "If the UK had a fairer immigration system it would be easier for businesses to recruit skilled workers regardless of their nationality," he added. Other signatories include Rachel Kerr, who won a Mobo award in 2012, in the gospel music category, and Moni Verma, founder of Veetee Rice, a UK-based food business with a turnover of Â£80m a year. A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said: "Several Commonwealth leaders have been very clear that Britain is stronger, safer and better off in Europe. "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Britain is the entry point for trade right across Europe; while Australia's former deputy prime minister said the Commonwealth could never replace the trade Britain does with the EU. "We get the best of both worlds in Europe, trading freely with the world's largest market, as well as accessing free trade deals with over 50 countries around the globe. "While Leave campaigners may look back with rose-tinted spectacles, they have no plan for what Britain outside the EU would look like, and no guarantee that trade, jobs and prices wouldn't be hit." In a separate development, 63% of business people polled by the British Chambers of Commerce said David Cameron's EU negotiations would not change the way they will vote in the referendum. The internet survey of 2,133 BCC members found 60% would vote to remain, down slightly from 63% in a previous poll in September, with 30% saying they would vote to leave, a 3% increase. Those representing large firms were significantly more likely to vote 'remain' than small-business people. BCC director general John Longworth said: "Our findings suggest that for business people, this is a question of in or out - not renegotiation."	Community and business leaders with Commonwealth links have written to David Cameron to urge him to back Britain's exit from the EU.
This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.  I got it like other people on our network.  The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos.  I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence.  I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change.  It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself.  Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools.  When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people.  Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality.  If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted.  It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection.  I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.  At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting.  As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January.  We questioned whether it was really possible to have a "Facebook revolution". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before.  I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs.  I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.  This regime stopped us from doing that.  We had have poor education and no national cultural programmes.  I am so proud now, especially when I think of our young martyrs.  In Egypt we have suffered a lot and it's about time that we start to live like real people. Twitter: Nawara Negm I'm not writing my blog right now.  We're just using Twitter as it's easy and flexible to do from your mobile.  If we have a lot of action here I might do as many as 20 or 30 tweets a day.  We also use Bambuser for live-streaming from our mobiles here in Tahrir Square. The internet gave us our backbone but it is not because of Facebook that this happened.  It was the force used by the police that brought everybody together.  If they had let us leave peacefully on 25 January, this would never have happened.  It got worse with the violence on 28th: The shootings, the tear gas, the killings, the brutality.  When they cut the internet and mobile phone lines this only increased people's anger. In the square we have organised our lives well. We have a co-ordinating committee telling us where there have been attacks and a group doing cleaning.  We have some people singing and some praying. We have Christians, Muslims, agnostics, leftists and rightists and we all live together well.   In our community we're trying to set an example of how we can all live together.  It's like a city inside the city here.  We are the kernel of the revolution. Blog: MaLek X (in Arabic) The revolution was publicised on the internet.  The spark was Facebook.  People were really sceptical about it because they didn't think you could have a revolution where you named the date, but now I look around me and I am really proud of the Egyptian people and the initiative.  I'm sure that those who named the date didn't think things would go this far. To begin with on 25 January, we had mostly young people of all classes who somehow use the internet.  You have internet cafes even in the poorest areas of Egypt so even less well-educated people have access, especially to Facebook.  A lot was also achieved through word of mouth - people telling their friends and neighbours.  The independent media took a middle-ground to begin with as everyone was watching their backs but now they have got onboard. After our huge turnout on the first Tuesday, demonstrations continued for the next two days and we publicised further action for Friday on the internet.  That day they cut our communications and took our cameras so we had an information blackout and the violence was unbelievable. A lot of people died. Still the threshold of fear and pain had been broken and we have kept up momentum since. Now older people especially come up to us when we're collecting trash or whatever in the square and they say: "We're really proud of you... You did what we didn't manage to do for 60 years." People have called this the "Facebook Revolution" because it gave us a form of expression even when people were too scared to talk in big groups about political issues.  We had already set up Facebook pages for people who were tortured to death.  We found it was a way to talk without being tracked. In the square we have bridged a lot of gaps.  I've been living here since 29 January with tens of thousands of other people.  I put my head down to sleep and I don't know the people sleeping around me. I have wonderful conversations with people from all over Egypt who normally I would never have talked to. We're finally getting to know each other. It's wonderful.	Egypt's internet activists have played a key role in the pro-democracy protests from the outset, but they tell the BBC that the online campaigning is evolving to suit their real-life activism in Tahrir Square.
A message on Luton councillor Aysegul Gurbuz's Twitter feed claimed Hitler was the "greatest man in history". Another tweet on Ms Gurbaz's account suggested Iran could develop a nuclear weapon to "wipe Israel off the map". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said anyone who makes anti-Semitic remarks is "auto-excluded from the party" pending an inquiry. The BBC has contacted the councillor for comment. The Labour Party has confirmed she has been suspended pending an investigation. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn said: "Anti-Semitism is absolutely abhorrent and wrong. "We have suspended, we will suspend, any member that behaves in that way." The tweets in question were made before Ms Gurbuz was elected to Luton Borough Council in May 2015. A spokesman for the council said: "While these comments appear to pre-date her time as a councillor, the council is shocked by these comments. "This matter will be referred as a matter of urgency to the council's independent standards committee to allow a full investigation to take place." On Thursday, Mr Corbyn was criticised by a Jewish leader for not taking anti-Semitism seriously enough.	A Labour councillor has been suspended from the party over anti-Semitic comments on her Twitter account.
The German shepherd, which belonged to Cleveland Police, was being exercised near to Ormseby Stables in Eston when it bit a 28-year-old man. The man suffered puncture wounds on his arm and upper body and was taken to hospital. The dog handler also suffered an injury to his arm. The force has apologised and referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. A police spokesman said: "Based on an assessment of the animal it has been put to sleep. "This was not an easy decision for any of the people involved, but has been made in the best interests of all those involved." The incident occurred on 6 June. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Ciaron Irvine said it would be "wrong to speculate" until the full circumstances were known. "What is clear is that this incident should not have happened and we must absolutely understand what went wrong," he added.	A police dog has been put down after biting a member of the public.
Kengo Kuma was given a tour of the site where construction of the museum's curved inner walls is underway. The architect said he was confident the museum would be completed on schedule at the end of 2017 and open in the summer of the following year. It will take the remainder of 2016 to take the building up to roof height. Mr Kuma said:  I am very happy to see the progress of the construction. "The level of construction is very high and beautiful - it is not an easy construction because the detail is unique. "I can feel the scale of the spaces and the scale is as I expected." Key milestones in the first year of work included the completion of a coffer dam which enabled construction of part of the building that will sit out over the River Tay. This year's programme involves construction of the core inner walls, stairwell and lift cores and the outer double curvature walls of the building. Representatives from Dundee City Council and BAM Construction Ltd accompanied Kengo Kuma on the tour of the site. Dundee Lord Provost Bob Duncan said: "People can see from the outside that something really special is beginning to take shape on this site. "I am delighted that Kengo Kuma can see how much has been achieved here in the space of a year. "We are delighted with the attention that this project is focusing on our city." Pre-cast panels will be installed in 2017 to the exterior to give the building its unique slatted, multi-layered appearance. BAM's construction manager Malcolm Boyd said: "We are relishing meeting the unique technical and construction challenges and working with all our partners to deliver a building that will inspire Dundonians and attract worldwide recognition ."	The architect of Dundee's V&A museum said he was "very happy" with its progress one year after the £80.1m construction project began.
Their nationalities are not known. The incident occurred early on Wednesday in Helmand province. Soldiers returned fire killing the attackers, a coalition spokesperson said. There have been dozens of "green-on-blue" attacks in which Afghan security personnel have targeted their Western allies since 2007. No group has said it carried out the latest attack. Insider attacks - on international and Afghan forces - have became one of the gravest security threats of the later phase of the conflict in Afghanistan, although the rate of such incidents has dropped in recent years. More than 100 foreign soldiers have been killed. Nato has adopted special security measures to offset the threat. The alliance ended its combat mission in Afghanistan in December, withdrawing most of its troops apart from a 13,000-strong residual force used for training and counter-terrorism operations. One of the worst insider attacks took place last August when a US general was killed in an attack by an Afghan soldier at a British-run military academy near Kabul. US Major General Harold Greene was the most senior American military officer to die in action overseas since the Vietnam War. Many insider attacks are blamed on Taliban infiltration or arguments between foreign and local soldiers getting out of hand. In some cases such attacks are carried out by an individual - or individuals - acting on their own initiative rather than organised insurgency violence. The Taliban have stepped up their summer offensive despite an acrimonious leadership dispute following the death of their long-time leader Mullah Omar.	Two people in Afghan military uniforms opened fire on a vehicle killing two Nato soldiers at a military base in the south, alliance officials say.
Seventy staff at Ferguson Shipbuilder, Port Glasgow, were laid off last August when it went into administration. Entrepreneur Jim McColl, who took over the business, said it now employed 140 staff - and he hoped for a near 10-fold increase in that number by 2020. He plans to invest up to Â£65m in the yard, which was the last in Britain fully equipped to build merchant ships. The firm, renamed Ferguson Marine, is currently building a hybrid electric/diesel ferry for Caledonian MacBrayne. A bid has also been lodged to build two large Hebridean ferries, with an announcement due soon. At the same time, much of the yard is being demolished as part of a Â£12m rebuild. Mr McColl, who made his fortune building up the engineering firm Clyde Blowers, said he was attracted to Fergusons for "sentimental reasons" but there were also sound business opportunities underpinning the buyout. "We look at the market they're in and try to assess the demand for the kind of products that they do," he said. "We saw a huge demand. Most people who are looking for boats of any kind in the UK have to go overseas for it. Many of them don't want to. "They want the work done here. They want repairs and upgrades done here but the facilities aren't there any more. "Most of the yards around the UK have been turned into executive apartments and wine bars alongside the river side." He said part of the deal in re-employing the laid-off workers was that they would need to work flexibly. They also received a 5% pay rise. Mr McColl is looking at the market for refitting luxury yachts for the "super rich". He is also working with a Formula 1 team, trying to get better performance out of marine batteries. "We've got a five-year plan. One scenario which is an optimistic one, we could have 1,300 employees here. That's ten times what we have got just now. "There's a fairly buoyant market for the kind of work we're looking to do. There are very few facilities in the UK that can do it. "By May next year we will have a completely new fabrication facility and shipyard here and by August next year we'll have the new office up as well. "So in a year's time this will be a 21st Century shipyard that's very efficient, able to compete with anywhere in the world."	Plans are being developed to employ up to 1,300 workers at a Clyde shipyard which went bust a year ago.
John Porter's brother Mike, 66, died at the scene after the men were knocked to the ground by cows in Wiltshire. After an inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death, he said he hoped more could be done to prevent a further tragedy. The jury noted that there had been previous attacks in the same fields. And jurors noted a lack of separation between cattle and public, in a narrative accompanying their verdict. Mr Porter, 74, from Monkton Combe, near Bath, told the BBC: "Accidents will always happen, sadly. But I do think that we do need to look at ways in which we can make our footpaths safer." His brother was visiting from Edinburgh in May 2013 when they walked dogs on leads across a public footpath through Elbow Field, Turleigh. They were knocked to the ground by two cows and stamped on. Mike died at the scene of internal bleeding. The inquest heard that Simon Dark, Bleddyn Griffiths and David Billington had also suffered injuries after being trampled in the fields in 2008 and 2011 - although it was not possible to say whether the same cows were involved. The farmer Brian Godwin, 81, had been visited by the Health and Safety Executive after Mr Billington was injured. He had put in place some safety measures, including signs and some electric fencing. He has since sold the cattle and is trying to establish a new herd. The lawyers representing Mike Porter's partner Adrienne Sillar and their two sons said there was a "clear issue" about whether Elbow Field should remain a public right of way and "whether cows should share the enclosure".	A man who survived a cow trampling attack in which his brother was killed has told the BBC public footpaths need to be made safer.
As we walked in, three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one, I wondered, was the father of Bitcoin? Then I realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunky laptop - this was Dr Craig Wright. He carried on working, apparently unaware that we had entered the room. Once we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the cryptographic keys used by Satoshi when he made the first Bitcoin transaction in 2009. We had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of Bitcoin was at last stepping out of the shadows. What we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain. But Jon Matonis, a senior figure in the Bitcoin world, was in the room watching, having had his own demonstration some time before. And the news that Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, was also convinced provided more reassurance. Now Craig Wright has published his evidence on his blog, it will be examined in minute detail for any chink in his case. But put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he didn't care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating, if somewhat prickly Dr Wright. Why keep his secret so long? Why come out now? What about that run-in with the Australian tax authorities? And is he fabulously rich, with a huge stock of Bitcoin? At our first meeting - without a television camera  - we roamed freely over all sorts of territory. We learned that he ran a substantial business in London, employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of Bitcoin trading and consultancy operation. We challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an "audit" underway in Australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding Bitcoin.  We asked where the pseudonym had come from - he mentioned a 17th century libertarian philosopher called Nakamoto but said he'd keep the Satoshi bit to himself. He talked of the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose statement refusing the Nobel Prize is used in the Satoshi-signed file given as evidence in the blog published today. His politics were very far from the "lefty" Sartre, he explained, but like him he did not want his identity to be defined by one thing - he refused to be Craig "Satoshi"  just as Sartre did not want to be Jean-Paul Nobel. What he wouldn't say is how many Bitcoins he has - "that would be telling" - though he indicated that he would not be spending any of them in a hurry. He told us that he had a "nice big house and a nice fast car" in London, went on holidays to Paris, and didn't feel the need to acquire vast riches. The second time we met, to film a television interview, the mood changed. It was immediately clear that he hated the whole process, refusing to move from behind his laptop to a more spacious room where the shot would have been much better. At first, he insisted that he would give an answer to just one question - why he had decided to go public after all these years. Once we started filming he opened up a little, but mainly because he wanted to express his anger at, as he sees it, being forced into the public eye. "I don't want money, I don't want fame, I don't want adoration, I just want to be left alone," he said with some venom. He accused journalists of threatening to make up stories about him if he did not cooperate and said lies had been told that would affect his family and his staff. It seems his main grievance surrounds the stories that spread last December when he was first identified as a potential Satoshi, then dismissed by some as a hoaxer. At that time, questions were asked about his academic and business career, and there were some who said he just did not have the intellectual capacity to be the man behind Bitcoin. Throughout the demonstrations he showed us he kept on stressing the complexity of the process - "obviously everyone said I have no idea about this stuff so I'm going to do it in the most convoluted way possible". We were then supplied with a series of documents providing evidence that Dr Craig Stephen Wright was a Master of Statistics, IT Management, and Law, and a long list of peer-reviewed articles. Now he says he intends to continue his research into improving the technology behind Bitcoin, and plans to publish several papers over the coming months. With the community around the currency in some turmoil right now over how it develops, you might think that Craig Wright could provide some leadership. After all, he could be said to be to Bitcoin what Tim Berners-Lee is to the web. But he bridled at my suggestion that he could be a figurehead for the currency, making clear that this was the first and last television interview he would do. Having emerged from the shadows, Craig Satoshi Wright now wants to return to them as quickly as possible.	It was in a conference room above a coffee shop a fifteen minute walk from BBC Broadcasting House that we first met the man who says he is Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.
It had aimed to raise £10m of investments in the club from small-scale retail buyers of shares. There was already a commitment to the major part of the share offer, with rich individuals and institutional investors signing up to at least £17m. The club announced on Tuesday evening that it had raised a total of £22.2m. On Wednesday morning, the shares in Rangers International Football Club plc will start trading on London's Alternative Investments Market (AIM). It is part of the London Stock Exchange, on which shares in Celtic Football Club are also traded. The deadline for fans to buy new shares in the club passed on Tuesday afternoon. A statement from Rangers said: "A total of £22.2 million has been raised from professional and institutional investors and supporters which will be used to take the club forward, strengthen the squad when appropriate and improve facilities." Chief executive Charles Green said: "This is an exciting time for everyone associated with this 140-year-old institution but we are just at the start of the journey. "We are rebuilding and Rangers will rise again and we will do so with the help of our fans and the institutional investors who are on board." Mr Green was listed as the club's main shareholder in the share prospectus with a stake of almost 15%, which will now be diluted. He had not planned to add to his shares. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was the third largest shareholder with 9% before the issue of extra shares, behind a consortium called Blue Pitch Holdings. Meanwhile, Green took to the Ibrox pitch to address the crowd ahead of the 3-0 win over Annan Athletic to announce how much been raised through a share issue. However, while his speech was taking place, a section of the support staged a protest against potential plans to sell the stadium naming rights. After his side's 3-0 win, Rangers manager Ally McCoist described it as "a great day off the park". "The fact that it's in the region of £22m, and for the fans to chip in with roughly £5m, I think is absolutely staggering," he said. "They've only had the opportunity to do that in the last week or so. "In the lead-up to Christmas, when finances are tight at the best of times, in a recession, for our supporters to go into their pockets and come up with that money is another incredible show of support for this football club. "I think the best way I can put it is, the one thing the investors and, certainly, the fans deserve is for their money to be used wisely. "And I would certainly hope to have an opportunity to use some of that money wisely."	Rangers Football Club has raised half its target investment from fans, following the deadline for its share offer.
It features the vast Cuajone copper mine in the Andes, where some 170,000 tonnes of metal are taken from the ground each year. Built by Europe's Airbus group and launched on 16 September, PerúSAT-1 can see features as small as 70cm. Its pictures will have myriad uses - from agriculture and urban planning to border control and disaster relief.

It has been a great experience for me to be involved with Melbourne and winning the Australian Women's Grand Final against Perth Glory is another career highlight. We made history by being the first team to retain their title and that is phenomenal. To fly away from home and win it 2-0 truly was one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. The big difference for me this year is being involved as a player-manager, rather than just a midfielder. Is it a hard adjustment to make? Absolutely. It's very hard to deal with. It's very mentally and physically draining, but it's equally very rewarding in different ways. When the final whistle went at the weekend it made every second of the season worthwhile. The juice was definitely worth the squeeze. Being a manager is a very difficult thing to do and you have to have a very good group of players and coaches for it to work. Thankfully and luckily we did have that. I have thought about getting into coaching, but the way this came about was more to do with circumstances than anything else. Our head coach (Jo Montemurro) went into our men's side as an assistant and I stepped up. It was a natural thing, really. We were so far into the season that it was probably going to be the least disruptive for everyone involved. I didn't think twice about it when the (Melbourne) City group asked me to do the job. Equally I knew that it would be OK with the group that we had, because we have a very, very good group of girls. For me, at the stage of my career, this is the best of both worlds. I want to learn how to coach and how to develop as a coach and I believe I'm in the best place for that. But I'm not anywhere near retiring right now so I'm still playing and loving my football. I believe coaching educates me as a player as much as me learning as a coach pushes me out of my comfort zone. After an absolutely amazing experience in Melbourne, I head home soon to meet up with Wales ahead of the Cyprus Cup. I'm going to stay with Wales for another campaign after briefly considering international retirement and am really excited to get back to prepare for our World Cup campaign that will start later this year. My experiences with Melbourne can stand me in really good stead for Wales and my American club side Seattle Reign. I just go as a player to those camps, but I do have experience in leading groups and being a good person who helps when they're in a bit of trouble or being successful. The experience of this whole campaign I've just had with City is probably one of a kind. I certainly want to continue in football beyond playing, but who knows if the opportunity will ever be there to coach in the men's game. I think it'll be a lot easier for women to go into the male game in the future, in the right environment, as I had in Melbourne. At Melbourne, everyone believes in and supports each other and the crossover between male and female is very similar and even. In that environment I can't see it being a problem. But that environment is not replicated all over the world. Some clubs would be very receptive to a female coach, other clubs less so. But luckily, that is not something I have to worry about for a good few years yet!	I have certainly had worse 24 hours in my life than winning the Grand Final with Melbourne City and then being named in the Wales squad for the Cyprus Cup.
His comments come amid the expenses scandal that has embroiled the government for the past three weeks. Mr Abbott said on Friday the woman at the centre of the scandal, Speaker of the House of Representatives Bronwyn Bishop, was "deeply remorseful" about her use of taxpayers' funds to travel to friends' weddings and Liberal party functions. The prime minister has himself had to pay back money spent on travel in the past. The scandal began when it became public that Ms Bishop had spent A$5,000 ($3,647; Â£2,339) of public funds on a helicopter flight to a Liberal Party function that could have easily been reached by road. She has also claimed expenses for travel to several weddings of her Liberal Party colleagues. Australia's rules about travel entitlements for politicians are hazy but Ms Bishop's spending set social media on fire and she soon became the speaker who sparked a thousand memes. The Facebook page Bronwyn Bishop Memes gained more than 13,000 followers in just a week, as users poked fun at her chopper ride. Memes have adopted the helicopter as their main tool to mock the speaker, with Ms Bishop using chopper flights for everything from taking extreme holidays and dropping the kids at the local swimming pool to going for a jog - via chopper. The public have also had fun at her expense with cultural references ranging from Australian TV soap operas to movies such as 101 Dalmatians and Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. Social media taunts even included sly hints towards other expenses scandals, such as the misuse of living away from home allowances for politicians. Ms Bishop has apologised and is paying back the helicopter costs but she is resisting calls, from independent senators and reportedly even from some members of the government, to resign. "I love this country very much and it does sadden me that I have let [the public] down," Ms Bishop told reporters. "I won't resign from the position but I will be working very hard," she said.	Prime Minister Tony Abbott has reminded Australian politicians they cannot "get away with exploiting the rules" on expenses.
Notts slumped to 73-7 before Luke Wood (65 not out) Steven Mullaney (63) shared an eighth-wicket stand of 92. Onions took 5-56 as the hosts were dismissed for 204 in 54 overs, which meant Yorkshire were crowned county champions for the second year in a row. Durham closed 30 runs behind on 174-2, with Mark Stoneman making 62 and Scott Borthwick unbeaten on 56 The visitors won the toss and invited Notts to bat on an overcast day and Jake Libby, playing in his first game of the season after recovering from a cruciate ligament injury, fell to Chris Rushworth (2-15) in the first over for a second-ball duck. Onions got rid of Brendan Taylor and Michael Lumb, both for one, with the hosts slipping to 7-3 in the sixth over and Riki Wessels (13) then became a first wicket for 22-year-old Durham debutant Barry McCarthy (2-51). McCarthy dropped Mullaney, who was on 41 at the time, in the deep, but later trapped the former Lancashire player leg before. Wickets continued to fall and it was only the partnership of Mullaney and Wood - who passed fifty for the third time this season - which pushed Notts past 200 and earned a single batting bonus point. Durham started at pace in their reply with Stoneman and Jack Burnham putting on 78 for the first wicket in 15.5 overs. Stoneman, who was caught by Mullaney off Jake Ball, and Borthwick, who reached his ninth half-century of the season, then put on a second-wicket partnership of 53 as the hosts reached the close in a strong position. It meant Notts wicketkeeper Chris Read still requires two dismissals to become the 26th player in history to reach 1,000.	Graham Onions claimed a five-wicket haul to help Durham have the better of day one against Nottinghamshire.
The 22-year-old Australian will act as cover at Allianz Park during the Rugby World Cup, which takes place between 18 September and 31 October. Sarries could potentially lose Jamie George and Schalk Brits to England and South Africa duty at the tournament. "We felt we that we needed some more depth in the hooking position," Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall said. "Alongside Scott Spurling and Jared Saunders, Dave will provide us with more options. "He has been training with us since we've returned to pre-season and has fitted into the club very well." Porecki has had a spell with Super Rugby outfit Waratahs and has been playing for Sydney side Manly Marlins. Saracens will begin the defence of their Premiership title at home to Sale Sharks on Saturday, 17 October.	Premiership champions Saracens have signed hooker Dave Porecki on a short-term contract.
The unmanned cargo ship was launched from Kazakhstan on Tuesday, but contact was lost with it soon afterwards. Russia's space agency says Progress M-27M is now orbiting in an uncontrolled spin. It cannot reach the ISS and is likely to break up on re-entering Earth's atmosphere. The craft carried on to a higher orbit after contact was lost. Igor Komarov, the head of Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, said: "The craft's continued flight and its docking with the ISS is not possible." Two astronauts spending a year on the ISS, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, told the Associated Press news agency that flight controllers had given up hope of controlling Progress again. Progress is likely to re-enter Earth's atmosphere some time between 5 and 7 May. Other capsules - including one Progress craft last year - have burned up and disintegrated on re-entering Earth's atmosphere without posing a threat to the planet's population. Cathleen Lewis, a specialist in Russian space programmes at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, said it was not yet known where debris will fall - but that it was highly unlikely to hit urban areas. "I always remind people that two-thirds of Earth's surface is water," she said. "The likelihood of it coming down and hitting someone is so remote as to be minuscule." The problem with the loss of the Progress is that it puts further pressure on the volume of stores held on the space station. ISS managers like to keep a good six months' supply of food, water, fuel and other resources in reserve at all times. Currently, however, this volume is somewhat depleted - in part because of the explosion on launch last year of the American Cygnus freighter. The responsibility for keeping the stores topped up leans heavily on Progress and the second American freighter, Dragon. The latter is due to make its next supply run in June. As long as it keeps working well, ISS officials in Houston and Moscow will not be unduly concerned. If, for some reason, supplies did become marginal, the space agencies would simply reduce the size of the normal six-person crew until matters could be improved. Progress was to deliver food, water, fuel, oxygen and clothing to the crew of six people on the space station that orbits about 420km (250 miles) above Earth. Even after Progress' loss, the astronauts have enough supplies to keep them going until the next expected delivery on 19 June. A Roscosmos spokesman told Reuters that the loss was valued at 2.59 billion roubles ($50.7m, Â£32.9m).	A Russian spacecraft delivering supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) is out of control and will fall back to Earth, officials say.
The All Progressives Congress (APC) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday's elections. It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since military ruled ended in 1999. It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time. APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May, after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan. The PDP's decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday's elections for governors and state assemblies, reports the BBC's Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital, Abuja. The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna, the home of outgoing Vice-President Namadi Sambo. It also lost control of Adamawa, one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's insurgency. However, the party managed to hold on to Rivers State, Nigeria's oil hub. The PDP won eight governorships, mostly in the south-east. Taraba is the only result still outstanding, while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive, because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory. Elections were not held in seven states. Analysis: Chris Ewokor, BBC Africa, Abuja The APC has made historic gains, relegating the once-powerful PDP to a regional party. The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west. However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants. In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing. Why Jonathan lost? Buhari's historic victory Nigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries. The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll. Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended. On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state. It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999. Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader. The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says. It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections. The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.	The party of Nigeria's incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party's dominance.
Hatton made eight birdies and three bogeys in his five-under-par 67, while Fitzpatrick carded a level-par 72. They are tied with Australia's Marc Leishman (71) at Bay Hill, three shots behind American leaders Charlie Hoffman (71) and Kevin Kisner (68). Rory McIlroy moved up to a tie for eighth after a seven-under-par 65. World number three McIlroy scored the joint-lowest round of the day, along with American Rickie Fowler - who moved into a tie for 11th. The 27-year-old Northern Irishman started the round 11 shots behind overnight leader Hoffman, but five birdies on the back nine moved him up the leaderboard. "I just played better, held some putts, which was nice to see. I just had to put it all together and I did," McIlroy told the PGA Tour. "Hopefully I can be in with a shout and then if I get off to a fast start tomorrow, I can be right in there."	England's Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Fitzpatrick are both three shots off the lead going into the final round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
Camden Glass, part of the Camden Group, has started a 30-day consultation with staff on the closure of its factory in Benburb, according to Unite. The firm produces and supplies PVCu window and door products. Camden Group has told Unite it will be creating 50 new jobs at a new plant in Antrim. Unite's representative Joanne McWilliams said Camden Group's investment in the Antrim plant was "cold comfort to the workforce in Benburb". "Many workers in Benburb have longstanding service at the plant - one of our members has worked there for 43 years," she said. "Many of the workers facing redundancy have built the company's success long before the current management took over. "To compound [the] decision, management have offered the workforce only the bare minimum, statutory redundancy. "Camden Group must live up to their social responsibilities and fully compensate their workforce for a decision driven by corporate priorities."	Sixty-five workers at a County Tyrone manufacturing company are set to lose their jobs, a trade union has said.
Groups who use the hall in Llanwinio said they would hand in their keys after the rent tripled and they were asked to sign up to a 25-year lease. Peter Walton, from the association that runs the hall, described the changes as "unreasonable and unfair". But the Diocese of St Davids said as a charity it was "obliged by law" to charge market-value rent. Rent costs charged to the Community Association of Volunteers are set to increase from £250 to £750 a year and it will also have to meet the costs of the insurance for the first time. The St Davids Diocesan Board of Finance (DBF) said: "A proper valuation of [the rental value] was undertaken and the rental charge increased in line with that. "The rental goes to the parish, not the DBF, hence keeping it within the local community." But Mr Walton from the Community Association of Volunteers told Newyddion 9 the finance board was behaving in an "unfair, unreasonable and unjust manner". He added: "It's not just the money... we will be taking all of our belongings out of this building on Saturday 27 February and we'll be handing the keys back unless there's a change of heart."	A row has broken out between community groups and a Carmarthenshire diocese over the cost of using a church hall.
Health Secretary Vaughan Gething told a BBC Radio Wales election phone-in he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two leadership contests, but still wanted him to become prime minister. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not," he said. "The alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want." Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Gething rejected listeners' suggestions that Welsh Labour was failing to support the party's UK leader. "I want a Labour prime minister - and that means Jeremy Corbyn being prime minister," he said. "I don't think it matters whether I'm a fan or not - it matters whether I think he can do the job in running the country. "It matters whether I think this country will be better off having a Labour prime minister than a Tory." Mr Gething admitted he had not backed Mr Corbyn in the last two Labour leadership contests, but accepted the party had voted "decisively" for him to be its leader and candidate for prime minister. He said he also wanted to see Welsh Labour MPs "being returned from Wales in large numbers". "We know the alternative is the Tories able to do what exactly they want, so it's up to us to stand up for Wales," he said. Mr Gething dismissed the idea that Labour was under threat in Wales from the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. "I don't think we will be wiped out here," he said. "We've got a good record in government ... we're directly engaged in our local communities," he added, pointing to the fact that Labour held onto control of seven councils after the local elections in May. Questioned about policy issues, Mr Gething said Labour was "appalled" that the Conservatives were planning to abandon the "triple lock" guarantee on pensions, and claimed working people were worse off under the Tories. On Europe, he said Labour would argue for a "more open relationship" with the EU than a "hard" Brexit, calling for "full and unfettered" access to the single market and freedom of movement to work. Mr Gething said he recognised public concern about immigration, but insisted that most migration was "economically beneficial". "There's a challenge for us about understanding what sort of deal we can have with Europe that doesn't compromise Welsh jobs and investment," he said. "I do not think that people voted to make themselves poorer, but that is exactly what I think a hard Brexit would do, and that's what Theresa May wants." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies responded: "A vote for Labour is a vote for more debt, more taxation and a chaotic Brexit, no matter how cynically Welsh Labour ministers attempt to carve out a distinct brand for themselves."	Labour figures in Wales are not trying to distance themselves from party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a Welsh Government minister has insisted.
A blogger posted screenshots suggesting a Carmarthenshire councillor shared a Facebook post by a far-right group. The post said: "When a dog attacks a child it is put down. Shouldn't we do the same with sex predators?" Tegwen Devichand said she did not remember sharing the post and opposed the death penalty. Ms Devichand, who is Labour deputy group leader at Carmarthenshire council, said: "I couldn't put a horse down, let alone a human being." The post which Ms Devichand appears to have shared was initially posted by far-right group Britain First. Ms Devichand opposes plans to remove English-stream education at Ysgol Llangennech which were approved by Carmarthenshire council in January. "People should have choice, it shouldn't be forced on them," she said. The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". The decision has been controversial with one Labour councillor Kim Thomas describing it as "segregation... at worst, apartheid". Plaid Cymru has accused Labour members of working with UKIP to undermine the council's decision. She also said Labour had not contacted her about the matter and she had not been told the party was investigating. Ms Devichand said she was complaining to the police about a "hate campaign" against her. On Sunday Labour said a different member connected to the row had been suspended. Plaid Cymru Carmarthen East and Dinefwr MP Jonathan Edwards said over the course of the weekend "we have seen Labour members and an elected councillor exposed for sharing the propaganda of ultra-right groups. "This is in addition to another elected councillor branding Labour's own education policy as 'apartheid'." "Launching an investigation into the Llanelli Labour party is a welcome first step, but the party's head office must take swift and immediate action to stamp this out this type of divisive campaigning." A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "The Labour Party takes all complaints of this nature very seriously. The local party in Llanelli have made us aware of complaints and an investigation is under way."	Labour has launched an probe into complaints about members connected to a row over the move to change a primary school to Welsh-medium education.
The decision to call off the match was taken at 12:35 GMT following an inspection at Sportsdirect.com Park where part of the League One club's pitch was still frozen. The Latics are 22nd in the table and in the relegation places with Posh in sixth place. There has been no announcement as to when the fixture will be rearranged.	Oldham Athletic's League One fixture against Peterborough United has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.
Rory Gallagher's side have recovered from the disappointment of their heavy Ulster semi-final defeat to Tyrone with narrow wins over Longford and Meath. Galway enter into Round 4A of the qualifier series after surrendering their Connacht title to Roscommon. Cian Mulligan is the only injury concern for Donegal with a quad strain. Following their nine point loss to Tyrone in the Ulster championship, Donegal returned to winning ways with a hard-fought victory over Longford and then came out on top of a thrilling shoot-out against Meath earlier this month. 2012 Footballer of the Year Karl Lacey will equal Christy Toye's record of 65 championship appearances for Donegal if he features on Saturday. Galway had a strong start to their season when they beat Kildare to finish top of Division Two of the National League and earned promotion to Division One for next season. Kevin McStay's side beat arch-rivals Mayo in their Connacht championship semi-final but they will be disappointed with the way they lost their provincial title after a heavy nine-point loss to Roscommon in the Connacht final.	Donegal are hoping the momentum they have gained through the qualifier series can carry them through to the All Ireland quarter-finals.
Barker, 33, who captained Derby under Clough, has not played competitively since dislocating his knee and rupturing ligaments in March 2012. He is set to start training with Burton after undergoing minor knee surgery. "If we have room budget-wise and he is OK, then it is a no-brainer for us," Clough said. "He is just a good post influence to have around with Championship experience. He is a good person to have around the football club. "His treatment is going well and he is close to joining back in, so he is one that we haven't ruled out at all." After taking nearly three years to recover from his horrific knee injury, Barker returned to play for Derby's under-21 side in February 2015, only to be released by the Rams later that year. He has since been granted a testimonial year by the Championship club and has repeatedly expressed a desire to return to play professionally. Clough says Barker is still capable of making an impact as a player. "You want him to contribute on the pitch, but he has a lot more to offer than just on the pitch," Clough said. "He wants to get out and play. There will be plenty of times this season with five or 10 minutes to go when we will need someone to come on and head the ball in our box. "I cant think anyone better than him."	Former Derby County defender Shaun Barker will be offered a deal at Burton Albion if he can prove his fitness, says manager Nigel Clough.
Darya Klishina, 25, initially escaped a blanket ban on Russia's athletes for doping by governing body the IAAF, but her eligibility was revoked following new, but unspecified, information. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport has overturned that decision. Qualifying for the long jump takes place on Tuesday. "I can thankfully focus my time and attention on competing tomorrow night and enjoying my Olympic experience, which I have dreamed of since I first began long jumping as a young girl," said Klishina on Facebook. Russian track and field athletes were banned from the Olympics following claims the country ran a state-sponsored doping programme. Klishina, 10th in the 2015 World Championships, had been cleared to compete in her first Olympics as her drugs-testing record was established in the United States, where she is based, rather than in Russia. In upholding Klishina's appeal, Cas said that her permanent residence outside Russia still applied despite the IAAF's additional information. "We instigated a review process following new evidence presented to us," said the IAAF in response. "The outcome we reached to revoke Darya Klishina's exceptional eligibility was not upheld by Cas despite the information received and she is therefore eligible to compete in Rio."

The only Russian due to compete in the athletics at Rio 2016 has been cleared to contest the women's long jump after successfully appealing against a ban.
The 28 EU interior ministers will hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on 14 September. July was a record month, with more than 100,000 reaching the EU's borders. But it is proving difficult to get agreement on joint action, as migration pressure varies from country to country. What are the biggest obstacles to a solution? Free movement arguments The EU core principle of free movement - embodied in the passport-free Schengen area - is in dispute. UK Home Secretary Theresa May called the EU migration system "broken", saying the Schengen system had "exacerbated" the problem of large-scale irregular migration. The UK and Ireland are not in Schengen, but nearly all of their EU partners are, as well as some non-EU countries. Nationalists across Europe, such as the National Front (FN) in France and Italy's Northern League, also blame Schengen for the ease with which many migrants have travelled from southern to northern Europe. But the governments in France and Germany are among those who value Schengen for its contribution to the European economy. Schengen makes it easier for firms to hire workers from other EU countries, or to post workers abroad. The principle of free movement also has huge symbolic value for the EU. East Europeans embraced it eagerly after decades of communism, when travel to the West was impossible for most ordinary citizens. But Schengen members can re-impose border controls temporarily for national security reasons, for example if they face an extraordinary surge of migrants. There is pressure in the EU now to give authorities more discretion to do that. Why do Europe's political leaders seem unable to act? Arguments over barriers Hungary, which is in the Schengen zone, has built a 175km (110-mile) razor-wire fence 4m (13ft) high along its border with Serbia, which is outside the area. The barrier will be strengthened in the coming weeks, but it is highly controversial. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius criticised it, in remarks rejected by the Hungarian government as "shocking and groundless". In the first quarter of 2015 Hungary became a new migration hotspot, as thousands of asylum seekers saw it as an easier gateway to northern Europe. Of the 32,810 asylum applicants in Hungary in that period 70% were from Kosovo. Most Kosovans are fleeing dire poverty, rather than political or religious persecution, so in most cases their asylum claims are rejected. But now, many of those reaching the fence have fled the war in Syria and have legitimate asylum claims. Trainloads of migrants are heading for Austria and Germany from Budapest - and Hungary's neighbours worry that it has merely shifted the problem on to them. Bulgaria - not in Schengen - has also put up a razor-wire fence on its border with Turkey, to keep migrants out. Spain's small territories of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa are similarly fenced off. The UK's investment in extra border security at Calais, in northern France, is less controversial, as the UK is not in Schengen and migrants have been risking their lives jumping on to lorries and trains. But it suggests a growing "fortress Europe" attitude in the EU, contradicting the liberal values on which the EU was founded. Many Europeans cherish their hard-won democratic freedoms, and oppose the creation of new border fences. Many also argue that, instead of erecting barriers, the EU should do more to tackle the people-traffickers who make huge profits from migrants' misery. Quota disagreements EU ministers have rejected binding quotas for the distribution of refugees, despite the difficulties faced by Greece, Italy and Hungary. They are the main entry points for migrants crossing the Mediterranean and the Balkans. The European Commission urged EU governments to accept a mandatory "distribution key" to resettle 40,000 Syrian and Eritrean refugees. Instead, they agreed to accept 32,500 on a voluntary basis. The UK has opted out of any quota system, amid a widespread hardening of attitudes towards immigration. There are tensions in the EU over the whole European asylum policy, because of the disproportionate burden faced by some countries. The EU is trying to adapt the rules to deal with the crisis, but politicians want to see rapid progress, not just long-term plans. The controversial Dublin Regulation is under review, and Germany has stopped abiding by it. Under Dublin, the EU country where an asylum seeker first arrives has a duty to process their claim. So if that migrant moves elsewhere in the EU he/she can be sent back to where they first arrived. Extra EU help has been promised for the countries most in need. Of the €2.4bn (£1.7bn; $2.7bn) approved for the next six years, Italy is to get nearly €560m and Greece €473m. The UK, France and Germany have called for migrants to be fingerprinted and registered when they arrive in Italy and Greece. But the migration hotspots need more EU help, as their reception centres are overcrowded. Burden-sharing is a divisive topic. Germany accepted by far the largest number of asylum claims last year and expects to see as many as 800,000 this year. Sweden had the second-highest number, yet it has a far smaller population than the UK, which accepted fewer asylum seekers. There are calls for eastern European countries to take in more asylum seekers. Slovakia argues that most migrants will still move to richer countries, where wages and welfare are better. Arguments over conflict zones Many Europeans are calling for much greater EU efforts to end the conflicts in Syria, Libya, the Horn of Africa and Afghanistan that are fuelling the exodus of refugees. The UK government is among those arguing that the EU aid budget can help stem the flow of poor and desperate migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The UK says it is contributing generously to refugee welfare in countries bordering on Syria, which are housing far more Syrian refugees than the EU. Most refugees, it is argued, want to go home as soon as peace and stability are restored. And projects to ease poverty in sub-Saharan Africa can help to stem the considerable exodus from there. But critics of the UK stance say those are longer-term goals, whereas the crisis demands urgent action and co-operation among all 28 member states. Improving the economic prospects of young people in the Western Balkans - still recovering from war - could help stem the migrant surge from there. Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama says the EU should do much more to raise living standards in poor Balkan countries, which are negotiating to join the EU. Albania, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Kosovo are all experiencing an outflow of frustrated citizens seeking a better life in the EU. But EU countries cannot agree on the amount of aid those countries should get. There are fears that corruption could undermine aid projects - something that has bedevilled Kosovo. Nationalist arguments Nationalist parties and movements have played a big role in hardening attitudes towards immigration. Far-right Jobbik won 20% of the vote in Hungary's 2014 parliamentary elections, making it the most successful anti-immigration party in Europe. But even in the powerful, long-standing EU member states many mainstream politicians have taken a tough stance towards migrants. The UK Conservatives are urging new EU rules to limit migrants' access to welfare benefits. The UK Independence Party, demanding strict border controls and exit from the EU, also has a strong following. France's National Front has wooed many voters away from right and left. Meanwhile, ruling coalitions have done deals with the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) in the Netherlands and the Danish People's Party (DPP) in Denmark. In Finland, the nationalist Finns have entered government. In neighbouring Sweden, which has an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees, support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats has soared to almost 20%. Even in Germany - seen as profoundly loyal to EU values - nationalists and Eurosceptics have staged anti-immigrant marches, under the banner of Pegida, and have been elected to regional assemblies. Insecurity about migrants is widespread in a Europe blighted by unemployment and welfare cuts. So politicians are anxious not to appear "soft" on immigration. It means less hospitality towards migrants, even genuine refugees.	Europe is struggling with its biggest migration crisis since World War Two, with unprecedented numbers of refugees and other migrants seeking asylum in the EU.
Some 1.57m sq km (600,000 sq miles) of the Southern Ocean will gain protection from commercial fishing for 35 years. Environmentalists have welcomed the move to protect what's said to be the Earth's most pristine marine ecosystem. They hope it will be the first of many such zones in international waters. At this meeting in Hobart, Australia, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) agreed unanimously to designate the Ross Sea as an MPA, after years of protracted negotiations, New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully announced. The Ross Sea, its shelf and slope only comprise 2% of the Southern Ocean but they are home to 38% of the world's Adelie penguins, 30% of the world's Antarctic petrels and around 6% of the world's population of Antarctic minke whales. The region is important to the rest of the planet as the upwelling of nutrients from the deep waters are carried on currents around the world. The Ross Sea is also home to huge numbers of krill, a staple food for species including whales and seals. Their oil is critical for salmon farming. However there are concerns that overfishing and climate change are having significant impacts on their numbers. The proposal, introduced by New Zealand and the US, and accepted by all the other nations, will see a general protection "no-take" zone where nothing can be removed including marine life and minerals. As part of the compromise that emerged in negotiations, there will be special zones where fishing from krill and toothfish will be allowed for research purposes. "I'm absolutely overjoyed," said Lewis Pugh, the UN Patron for the Oceans, and someone who has campaigned for years in support of this new MPA. "This is the biggest protected area on the land or the sea, this is the first large scale MPA on the high seas, they are largely unprotected." The ocean advocate and swimmer drew attention to the Ross Sea with a series of swims in the icy waters - and for two years he has engaged in a series of meetings, dubbed "speedo diplomacy" with Russian officials to convince them of the value of the MPA. At the end of negotiations last year, Russia was the one country holding out against a consensus on the Ross Sea. But this year there has been what Mr Pugh describes as an "environmental glasnost". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has designated 2017 as the Year of Ecology and the country has recently expanded an MPA around Franz Josef Land in the Arctic. Sergei Ivanov, President Putin's Special Representative for Ecology, welcomed the new deal. "Russia has a proud history of exploration and science in Antarctica. In this time of political turbulence in so many parts of the world, we are pleased to be part of this collaborative international effort to safeguard the Ross Sea," he said. One of the key questions in the negotiations was how long the MPA should last. China is on the record as stating it believes that 20 years is long enough for a designation. Many conservationists say this is far too short, given the lifespan of creatures that life in the Ross Sea, such as whales. Ultimately, the parties agreed on 35 years. The designation was welcomed not just by campaigners but also by those with close links to the Ross Sea. "The Ross family are euphoric that our family legacy has been honoured in the 175th anniversary year since James first discovered the Ross Sea," said Phillipa Ross, great, great, great granddaughter to Sir James Clark Ross, after whom the Ross Sea is named. One of the other big concerns that delayed the proposal was the fact that it could set a precedent for other high seas negotiations around the world, such as in the Arctic and in attempts by the UN to develop a new marine biodiversity treaty. Lewis Pugh is very hopeful that this will be the case. And he's willing to keep swimming until it happens. "This to me represents a first step, I am heading back down to the Antarctic peninsula to carry on swimming, I want to see a series of MPAs around this continent that I feel so much about," he explained. "For me this is an issue about justice - justice between generations. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with us destroying our oceans so our children and grandchildren have absolutely nothing." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.	Delegates from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea in Antarctica will become the world's largest marine protected area (MPA).
Davies, 26, followed up sealing her World Championship place in the 20km by setting two new British bests in the mile and 5km event. The Cardiff walker won the 5km at the British Championships in Birmingham. "It's been a very good week, all the hard work has paid off," said Davies. Davies competed in three events in seven days which began with achieving the London 2017 qualification time when she finished in a Welsh record 93:04 behind Gemma Bridge. Davies will be joined by Bridge and Tom Bosworth and Callum Wilkinson at the World Championships next month in London (August 4-13). "It is unbelievable," said Davies. "I probably when I was younger never expected to get to this level of sport. "It hasn't sunk in yet and when I get there I will probably have to take a few moments. "It's absolutely fantastic to be on the same stage as such big names. "This will be the biggest competition I have ever been to and it will be a big step up." Davies will now take part in a three-week altitude camp in Livigno, Italy and St. Moritz, Switzerland and attend a British Athletics holding camp in Paris before her event on 13 August on the Mall. Media playback is not supported on this device "It will mean so much because the first chance I saw race walking was at London 2012," said Davies. "To go from a spectator to the start line alongside the girls who have inspired me and are now my friends and rivals will be amazing. "It is going be a home event where all my friends and family will be watching. "Growing up, the thing I remember was watching the London Marathon finishing on the Mall. "To be there and doing my sport at the highest level is going to be amazing." Davies believes walking is receiving a higher public profile. "From when I started it (walking) has grown," said Davies. "We are getting more attention which has been helped by Tom Bosworth coming sixth in the Olympics last year which has raised the sport's profile. "Race walking is a really good way to get people drawn into athletics."	Welsh walker Bethan Davies says the hard work has paid off after qualifying for the World Championships in London and setting new three personal bests in a week.
Seamus McCollum, 56, died at Maine private nursing home in Randalstown in September of last year. However, the death was not treated as murder until April of this year, following the results of an autopsy. Mr McCollum had cerebral palsy and had lived at the care home for nine years. Police said the woman was being questioned at Antrim PSNI station.	A 61-year-old woman arrested by police investigating the murder of a man at a County Antrim nursing home has been released unconditionally.
Christian Englander will now face trial, with jury selection scheduled for 23 September, Assistant District Attorney Anastasia Martin said. Each charge carries a maximum jail term of six months and a possible $500 fine. Police said Englander had acknowledged throwing the peel after he was offended by jokes Chappelle made about a friend. "If I can, I would like to avoid a trial," Englander said on Monday, following a brief hearing before Judge Donita Sena in the magistrates' court. "I'm not afraid of the end result, but it's a waste of human resources." There are "real criminals out there that they can try. If there is a plea offering, I'll take it," Englander added. The case has attracted attention after Chappelle said throwing a banana peel was a racist act. On Monday, Englander, who is white, said that after the police apprehended him on 30 March, Chappelle came to the police station to speak to him. According to Englander, Chappelle asked him: "Don't you know bananas are racist?" Englander said he told Chappelle, 41, that he did not agree. Lieutenant Andrea Dobyns of the Santa Fe Police Department confirmed that Chappelle attended the police station that night to talk to Englander.	The man accused of throwing a banana peel at comedian Dave Chappelle during a New Mexico show has been charged with disturbing the peace and battery.
Defender Elphick, 28, first sustained the injury during the 4-3 win against West Ham in August. The former Brighton player last appeared for the Cherries in their 3-1 defeat at Norwich last month. "Tommy has had surgery on his ankle and could face 10 weeks out. It could be shorter," said manager Eddie Howe. Elphick was ever-present in the league last season as he captained the Cherries to the Championship title. Howe also confirmed striker Callum Wilson has had an operation after he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee against Stoke. Wilson, 23, faces up to six months out. Winger Ryan Fraser, currently on a season-long loan at Ipswich, will receive treatment at Bournemouth as he also recovers from medial ligament damage. The 21-year-old sustained the injury while training with Scotland Under-21s and is set to miss the next two months.	Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick has been ruled out until the new year following an operation on an ankle injury, the club has confirmed.
Santa Cruz's WBA Super World featherweight title will be on the line at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn. Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights. The Belfast man has had to relinquish his IBF world super bantamweight belt ahead of his featherweight title bid. In February, Frampton beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout. It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held, but he has now vacated both crowns in order to challenge Santa Cruz in the higher weight division. He was stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux. On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez. Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests. "This is the fight I wanted - me and my team have been chasing it for a long, long time," said Frampton on his decision to move up a weight. "I'm 100% confident that the belt will be coming home to Belfast. It is the one my manager Barry McGuigan held 30 years ago. "Santa Cruz is a strong and aggressive undefeated champion but his style is made for me. "We know we have the tools to beat Leo. He throws a lot shots and is a proven operator. It is going to be a great fight. "I would like to say a huge thank you to the IBF for their professionalism during my time as their super bantamweight champion. "I have been a proud IBF World champion for nearly two years and I one day hope to once again become an IBF champion."	Carl Frampton's world featherweight title bout with defending champion Leo Santa Cruz will take place on 30 July in New York.
Over 100 shops in the coastal town of Cumana were hit and at least one person died according to local media. Venezuela has one of the world's highest inflation rates at 180% and people can queue for hours for subsidised food. Opposition politicians blame government mismanagement for the shortages. But the government says the shortages are part of an economic war being waged to drive President Nicolas Maduro from office. Most of the shops were looted for food according to opposition congresswoman Milagros Paz. She is quoted in Venezuelan newspaper El Universal as saying that the authorities "have not admitted the food distribution emergency". But according to the socialist governor of Sucre state, Luis Acuna, it was off licenses, opticians and clothes shops that were targeted in the looting, reports El Nacional. Food and medicine are in short supply and street protests have become increasingly agitated. More than 10 attempts of looting happen every day, according to the non-governmental organisation Venezuelan Violence Observatory. Diosdado Cabello, a lawmaker from Mr Maduro's PSUV party, blamed the opposition for inciting violent protest. "These are fascist groups which are generating unrest," he said. "Don't come to me with this fairy tale that these are spontaneous protests," he said on his television programme.	At least 400 people have been arrested in Venezuela after rioting and looting over food shortages.
Crews were called to the blaze at a building in Stewartville Street, in Partick, at about 12:15. The fire broke out in a communal area of the block. Four people were treated at the scene for the effects of smoke inhalation. The blaze triggered a large response from the emergency services. A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said: "On arrival crews found a well-developed fire on the third floor of a six-storey residential block of flats with residents unable to leave the building. "Firefighters quickly brought the fire under control, whilst at the same time rescuing 17 people from the property, some of whom were suffering from slight smoke inhalation and minor injuries." Crews worked through the night to deal with any fire spread and make the scene safe. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: "About 25 to 30 persons were evacuated." The Scottish Ambulance Service sent four resources from their special operations response team, two A&E ambulances and an ambulance car. A spokesman said: "We did not transport anyone to hospital. We dealt with smoke inhalation."	Firefighters have rescued 17 people from a six-storey block of flats in Glasgow's west end after a serious fire left them trapped in the building.
The Northern Irishman, twice a winner of the European Tour's season-finale, stumbled to a three-over-par 75 to lie joint 55th in a 60-man field. McIlroy, 27, has never finished worse than 11th in his seven appearances at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai. Westwood, meanwhile, carded seven birdies and just one bogey in his 66. The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week. Westwood's partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem, and his place went to Chris Wood. Under tournament rules, Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan. "I'm disappointed not to be playing," said Westwood. "I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything." The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit. Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament. Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai. Noren, another Swede, needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field. McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field. It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day, and although he swiftly added another on the next, the four-time major winner double-bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and sock - to play from the edge of a water hazard. Westwood's former Ryder Cup partner Nicolas Colsaerts and France's Julien Quesne share second place on five under, with Sergio Garcia, Francesco Molinari and Joost Luiten a shot further back.	World number two Rory McIlroy had his worst ever round in the DP World Tour Championship to lie nine shots behind first-round leader Lee Westwood.
Mr de Mistura said the agenda would include the formation of a transitional administration and elections. But it is not clear who will attend the indirect talks in Geneva, with some opposition leaders yet to confirm. On the ground in Syria, a partial truce that began 12 days ago has considerably reduced the intensity of the fighting. Mr de Mistura said the cessation of hostilities was holding "by and large" and was open-ended as far as the UN was concerned. The first round of talks on a political solution to the conflict in Syria was suspended last month while still in the "preparatory" phase, with both sides blaming each other. It came as government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, launched a major offensive on opposition-controlled areas around the northern city of Aleppo. The government succeeded in cutting a key rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo before the US and Russia brokered the cessation of hostilities agreement, which does not include the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front. At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr de Mistura welcomed what he described as "a sustained reduction of violence". "Incidents are taking place, no question and they are. I'm expecting even worse incidents to take place, probably caused by spoilers," he added. "The secret will be whether the sides are in a position, as so far touch wood has been the case, [to] contain them, make them not become an unravelling of what has been after five years quite a change... for the life of every Syrian." Mr de Mistura said he expected informal discussions to begin at hotels across Geneva immediately, but that formal talks would not resume until Monday. He added that they would once again be indirect "proximity" talks, with representatives of the warring parties located in separate rooms, and would last only 10 days before pausing for a week. "We believe that having a timetable and a time limit is healthy for everyone so that we don't think that we can go onâ€¦ for two weeks hoping to get into substance - we go seriously into substance as soon as we can." The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the focus of the talks will be a transitional government, a new constitution, and elections. Humanitarian access and ceasefire violations will not be on the agenda. The UN has set up two taskforces to deal with those issues, and clearly wants the opposition and government representatives to concentrate on a political settlement, our correspondent adds. UN aid agencies say good progress has been made getting supplies to besieged areas, with almost 240,000 people reached, most of whom received nothing in the last year. But our correspondent says it remains unclear exactly who will arrive in Geneva on Monday, with some opposition leaders suggesting they have not yet decided whether to attend. Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein told the BBC that the international system had failed Syria. "We've seen in this conflict... almost every conceivable war crime allegedly being committed, in addition to crimes against humanity," he said. "What does it say to us? It says... that the international system is incapable of addressing this sort of conflict. So future 'Syrias' - we have no algorithm, no formula, for how we address these conflicts. And it doesn't bode well for the 21st Century, of course," he added.	The UN special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, expects "substantive, deeper" talks between the government and opposition to begin on Monday.
Inflation is among the highest in the world, there are long queues for basic goods and the atmosphere on the streets is becoming increasingly agitated. Meanwhile politicians on both sides are so hostile to each other, a political solution remains remote. For years, the opposition in Venezuela has claimed the country was "becoming another Cuba" but such claims were rarely given much credence, or dismissed as hyperbole. But the BBC's Will Grant, who has lived in both countries, says there are growing parallels to a specific point in Cuba's past. Etched into Cuba's collective memory is its infamous Special Period. A reference to the years just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it is a time forever synonymous with suffering, austerity and hunger on the communist island. Without its wealthier benefactors in Eastern Europe, Cuba struggled to provide enough food for its people. The stories from those days are legion. People remember selling family heirlooms to buy food and even stray cats ending up in the cooking pot. Whether the tales are apocryphal or not, Cuba was certainly on its knees economically, and largely remained that way until a leftist former soldier took power in Venezuela. Once Hugo Chavez became the president of Venezuela, which has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, things quickly started to look up for Cuba. Mr Chavez aligned closely with Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and began to fill the gap that the Soviets had left behind. These days, though, Venezuela is the more troubled of the two socialist allies. What's gone wrong in Venezuela? Having lived in Venezuela at the height of Mr Chavez's power, when oil was worth more than $130 a barrel, and having last visited Caracas in April 2013 when Nicolas Maduro was elected president, it was quite a shock to see for myself how quickly things have deteriorated. While the place was always chaotic, run by a sort of live-television ad-hoc form of policy making, I have never seen it quite like this. We encountered the first queue, snaking back for over a block, almost as soon as we emerged into the west of the capital from the airport. It did not take long to see lots more. As in Cuba, the government subsidises and controls the prices of certain basic goods. Now, with inflation spiralling, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans spend their days waiting outside stores for bread, flour, baby milk, cooking oil, nappies and toilet paper. Worse still, many join those queues based on rumour alone, in the forlorn hope of finding those products on the shelves only to be turned away empty handed after hours in the blistering sun. Needless to say, in such circumstances, tempers can easily fray. "We don't sell the subsidised goods," explains Sonia, a 40-year-old storeowner who provided us a little refuge from the pushing and shoving unfolding in the street outside her shop. As we stand on her roof terrace, a healthy distance away from the soldiers who had tried to stop us from recording and to confiscate our equipment, Sonia explains how she and her husband were initially disappointed that they had not been granted the concession to sell government-regulated products a few years ago. But now, she says, it has saved them from the madness that their competitors on the other side of the road are dealing with on a daily basis - desperate crowds and armed troops at the door, the spectre of looting constantly hanging over them. "People can end up killing each other in these situations," she comments, tears forming in her eyes. "It's sad, so sad to live like this. We have young daughters and at times, even we have to resort to buying from the black market." As we watch the troops corralling the queue into order, Sonia points out people she says are "bachaqueros", price speculators and black marketeers who wait in line to purchase food not for their families but to sell on at a huge profit. The black market for basic goods has been thriving in Cuba for decades. It now looks set to become a common feature in Venezuela too. "Venezuelans are good people", she says. "We really don't deserve any of this." Meanwhile, President Maduro came to a regional summit in Cuba to drum up support in his war of words with Luis Almagro, the head of regional body the Organization of American States. The latter recently said the Venezuelan president was in danger of becoming just another "petty dictator in Latin America" and proposed invoking the organisation's democratic charter against him. Cue some pretty earthy language from President Maduro:  "I suggest you put this democratic charter in a very thin tube and find a better use for it, Mr Almagro. You can shove that democratic charter wherever it fits." Of course, back when Cuba was battling through its darkest economic days, Venezuela was very cosy with Washington. President George Bush Snr visited Caracas in 1990, Bill Clinton seven years later. As Nicolas Maduro left Cuba, an island which first formed his socialist ideals, the irony cannot have escaped him - one country recently entertaining the US president as a friend, the other on the brink of economic collapse.

Djokovic won 6-3 7-5 in a largely commanding performance. The 29-year-old, who has now won seven titles this year, has beaten the Japanese on nine successive occasions. Djokovic, who was beaten in the third round at Wimbledon by Sam Querrey, will represent Serbia at the Rio Olympics. "I don't need to explain that every athlete dreams of being a part of the Olympic Games," he said. "I'm competing in singles and doubles. "Hopefully I'll get at least one medal."	World number one Novak Djokovic won his first title since his surprise exit from Wimbledon with a straight-sets win over Japan's Kei Nishikori in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto.
Giovanni Dixon, 17, of Norwood, stabbed James Hunter in the heart after the 18-year-old tried to protect his friend. The Old Bailey heard Dixon and his friends had set upon Ezekiel Andrews with knives last May and Mr Hunter stepped in to protect him. Dixon was found guilty of murder and wounding and was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. The court heard Mr Andrews, 18, who was described as a "tall and somewhat awkward boy", was punched to the ground, kicked and stabbed three times in the buttocks, following a perceived slight to the gang's friend Jacob Ayoade in the weeks before. Mr Hunter, 18, suggested they fight "one on one" but Dixon rejected that idea and instead stabbed him in the heart on Wells Park Road. The court heard Dixon "jovially" described what he had done as he made his getaway on a bus with his friends Jerome Catterall, 18, Jason Odumusi, 17, and Benedict Leka, 16. Judge Rebecca Poulet QC said the boys' behaviour demonstrated a "preoccupation almost bordering on obsession with knives". Catterall, of Sydenham and Odumusi, from Catford, were cleared of murder but convicted of wounding and sentenced to four and a half years each while Leka, from Forest Hill, who was 15 at the time, received four years for the same offence. Ayoade, from Forest Hill, was sentenced to three years for encouraging the offence and possessing a knife. Judge Poulet lifted a ban on naming all the defendants in light of their convictions.	A teenager "obsessed" with knives who bragged about stabbing a boy in south-east London has been jailed for life.
Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG), which overseas health services, has said the non-emergency service lacks "resilience". South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) runs the phone line and has said calls have increased by 16% in the last year. It claimed staff shortages contributed to problems in answering calls. In a risk assessment report published by OCCG, it said: "Patient safety in the 111 service will be compromised due to performance issues caused by a lack of resilience to peaks in demand." OCCG has ranked the phone line as a "red risk", the highest category for risks to patient safety. It comes after an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph in June recorded a worker at SCAS's 111 call centre in Bicester, Oxfordshire, saying all staff had "killed someone indirectly". After the report prompted an investigation in January, the Care Quality Commission said the service was "safe and effective". The ambulance trust said that a 16% increase in call volume meant phone handlers could not answer calls "as quickly as we would like". In January alone, the service received 173,563 calls on both their 999 and 111 phone lines. SCAS has also said that a recruitment shortfall has contributed to issues in responding to calls. A spokesperson added: "We are working hard to improve our response to the patients who require our assistance. "We are continuing to recruit staff to the NHS 111 service across our area." SCAS provides ambulance services for Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire.	The safety of patients using the 111 service in Oxfordshire could be "compromised", according to the county's leading health body.
Kent closed on 288-5, a lead of 437, opting not to set Essex a target. Essex earlier were bowled out for 292, avoiding the follow-on by one run. Kent were reduced to 40-4 but Northeast shared an unbroken 185 with Will Gidman (63 not out) as runners-up Kent batted through the remainder of the day. The hosts had already secured the six points that guaranteed second place, a promotion spot in any other season. In reality, the prospects of a result were slim as soon as David Masters and Matt Dixon scored the three runs Essex needed to avoid the follow-on, with Dixon then out from the very next ball. Even when Kent slipped to 40-4 and 103-5, it never seemed likely that Essex would be able to force victory without the aid of a declaration. Northeast, an immovable figure, ensured as much, the only excitement coming when he took 30 off one Kishen Velani over - three fours and three sixes. The final over was bowled by retiring Essex seamer David Masters, the 38-year-old ending his first-class career with 672 wickets from 202 matches. He was given a guard of honour that included England Test captain Alastair Cook as he left the field.	Sam Northeast made 178 not out as his Kent side batted out a tame draw against County Championship Division Two champions Essex on the final day of the season at Canterbury.
During his emotional testimony he said Ms Steenkamp died before the ambulance arrived while he was holding her. He said he tried to help her breathe and stem the bleeding from her hip. The athlete denies deliberately shooting dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year, arguing he mistook her for an intruder. Prosecutors contend he intentionally killed her in the toilet of his bathroom after a row. The 27-year-old Olympic and Paralympic sprinter, who is a double amputee, faces life imprisonment if convicted of murder. On Tuesday, he broke down in tears whilst describing the events leading up to the shooting and the actual event. If acquitted, South African law stipulates that the court must consider the separate, lesser charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter, for which he could receive between six and 15 years in prison. Mr Pistorius also faces charges of illegally firing a gun in public and of illegally possessing ammunition, both of which he denies. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. On his third day on the stand, Mr Pistorius described the moments after paramedics had arrived at the scene. "They asked for some space to work so I stood up. Reeva had already died whilst I was holding her before the ambulance arrived. So, I knew there was nothing they could do for her," he told the court. He also described his distress as police and other officials arrived at the house. "I asked a policeman if I could wash my hands because the smell of the blood was making me throw up," he said. His lawyer Barry Roux also asked him to demonstrate how he would swing a cricket bat. Mr Pistorius said he was on his prosthetic legs when he used the cricket bat to break down the toilet door. He said the three sounds heard by witnesses at 03:17 local time was the cricket bat hitting the door - about five minutes after he shot at the toilet door. He said he was on his stumps, when he shot at the door. "I can barely stand on my stumps," he said. During his questioning, Mr Roux also mentioned statements from close neighbours who were listed by the state but not called by the prosecution. He said the statement from Kenny Motshoane's house described hearing "crying" and not "a woman screaming", as mentioned by other witnesses. Another woman living nearby also says she heard "loud crying" and not a woman screaming, Mr Roux said. Before Mr Roux ended his questioning he asked Mr Pistorius if he had intentionally killed Ms Steenkamp. "I did not intend to kill Reeva  or anybody else for that matter," he replied. On Tuesday, the athlete described how the couple had spent a quiet evening together on 13 February, Ms Steenkamp doing some yoga as he spoke to his cousin on the phone. He had then watched TV in bed with his head resting on her stomach and she would occasionally show him photos of cars she was looking at on her phone, he said. He said that they had bought Valentine's Day gifts for each other. Ms Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, reality TV celebrity and law graduate, was hit by at least three bullets while in the toilet cubicle of Mr Pistorius's home in Pretoria. 1 2 5 4 6 3 Mr Pistorius said in his statement at the start of the trial that he woke in the early hours and  walked on his stumps to the balcony, pulled in two fans, closed the sliding door and drew curtains. He said that shortly before he had spoken to Reeva, who was in bed beside him. He said he rejected prosecution claims that a witness heard arguing coming from the house before the shooting. Mr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars. "Unbeknown to me, Reeva must have gone to the toilet in the bathroom at the time I brought in the fans," he said. Mr Pistorius said he approached the bathroom armed with his firearm, to defend himself and his girlfriend, believing Ms Steenkamp was still in bed. Both sides agree four bullets were fired. Ms Steenkamp was hit three times. Mr Pistorius said he fired his weapon after hearing a noise in the toilet which he thought was the intruder coming out of the toilet to attack him and Ms Steenkamp. He said he was in a fearful state, knowing he was on his stumps and unable to run away or properly defend himself. Mr Pistorius said he rejected claims that he was on his prostheses when he shot at the door. A witness told the trial she woke to hear a woman screaming and a man shouting for help. She said that after the screams she heard four shots. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom after shooting at the toilet door, still shouting for Reeva. Lifting himself up onto the bed, he felt over to the right hand side of it and noticed Ms Steenkamp was not there. Mr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bathroom but the toilet was locked, so he returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs, turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat. Forensics expert Johannes Vermeulen told the court that the height of the marks on the door caused by the cricket bat suggest Mr Pistorius was on his stumps at the time. Mr Pistorius's defence team say he then called security at the gated housing complex and a private paramedic service before carrying Ms Steenkamp downstairs. A security guard claimed it was the other way round, and he had called Mr Pistorius first after reports of gunfire. However, phone records shown to the court revealed Mr Pistorius called the estate manager at 3:19am, a minute later he called the ambulance service and at 3:21am he called estate security. A minute later he received an incoming call - estate security calling him back. According to police phone expert Francois Moller, Mr Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris a short time later and just after 4:00am he called his brother Carl.	South African athlete Oscar Pistorius is back in court in Pretoria describing events after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home.
Dean Melnyk, 20, of Lockerbie, was found guilty by a jury of murdering Kevin MacKay in Ecclefechan. Co-accused Andrew Brown, 23, of Ecclefechan, had previously admitted the attack in August last year. Judge Lord Armstrong deferred sentence until June when he will determine how long they have to serve before being eligible to apply for parole. The pair believed their 39-year-old victim had supplied the drugs which had killed their teenage friend Jamie Abba - nicknamed Jabba. The High Court in Glasgow heard the attack on Mr MacKay took place just hours after the 19-year-old's funeral. Melnyk told jurors that he was "drunk and angry" when he and Brown went to Peacock Place in Ecclefechan on 22 August last year and attacked Mr MacKay - known as Kesty. During his trial he denied murdering Mr MacKay, but admitted culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility. However, the jury rejected the suggestion that he was suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of the killing. Melnyk said he was devastated when Mr Abba died and suffered nightmares and flashbacks in which his friend appeared to him and said: "Help me." The court heard that at the teenager's wake Melnyk had become increasingly angry  and at one point Brown - known as Buster - came over and spoke to him. "Buster said 'We'll go and give Kesty a kicking' to try and cheer me up," Melnyk said. He told the court that the two got a lift to Ecclefechan and, after going into another house in the village, Brown led him to where Mr MacKay was staying. He added: "We both had a knife each - I saw Buster stabbing Kesty. "Kesty was on his feet and Buster was stabbing him. "I was in shock - Buster was turning the furniture over and shouting: 'You killed Jabba, Kesty.'" Melnyk said Mr MacKay had spotted he had a knife and had grabbed his leg. "I couldn't get him off me, he was much bigger," he told the court. "Buster kicked him off and I began stabbing Kesty - I don't know how many times. "The handle broke off the knife." The court heard that after the killing, Melnyk made his way to a friend's house in Lockerbie and told him: "I think I've killed Kesty." Brown, a fisherman, told police that Mr MacKay had been attacked by two men wearing balaclavas and he had tried to help fight them off. A charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice against Jennifer Melnyk, 60, was dropped during the trial. Police in Dumfries and Galloway said they hoped the village could "start to move forward" after the convictions. Ch Insp Steven Lowther said: "The village and community of Ecclefechan have gone through a traumatic time recently. "The death of Jamie Abba and the murder of Kevin MacKay have left two families devastated. "These events have clearly affected the wider community as well." He said police would work hard with residents to "help bring some sort of normality back to the village". "Of course we understand that there are still tensions in and around the village," he added. "However, we want to make it quite clear that, as in the past, tensions which boil over into acts which break the law will be dealt with firmly and robustly."	Two men are facing life sentences for stabbing a man they blamed for the drugs death of a friend.
The A&E unit at Telford's Princess Royal Hospital could be downgraded, leaving the Royal Shrewsbury as the only hospital in the county to offer emergency and critical care. Women and children's services would also be moved to Shrewsbury, despite a Â£28m centre opening in Telford in 2014. The proposals have been made by the NHS 'Future Fit' board. More updates on this and other stories in Shropshire Urgent care centres would be based at both sites, which Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said would attend to the majority of patients who are currently seen at A&E. These "preferred options" will be considered by Telford and Wrekin Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and Shropshire CCG, who will formally decide if a public consultation can begin. The board is also recommending three other options be put forward for public consultation. No formal decisions will be made until at least Summer 2017, Telford and Wrekin CCG said. The NHS Future Fit programme was launched in 2014 to review the health system across Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and mid-Wales and is set to finish in spring 2017. Princess Royal Hospital in Telford: Royal Shrewsbury Hospital: There has been criticism of the plans to move women's and children's services from Telford. Shaun Davies, leader of Telford & Wrekin Council, described the announcement as "a total farce that is being railroaded through" and said he opposed the idea of downgrading Telford's A&E department. "If there is to be only one, then it makes sense from a financial and clinical perspective to locate it at Princess Royal Hospital; in the area where there is a growing population."	Shropshire could have one emergency and trauma department under recommendations being put forward by NHS bosses.
The event represents the final opportunity for GB to attain a maximum of two berths (one male and one female) for August's Rio Olympics. The UK Sport-funded GB women's team will need to rank in the top six from nations who have not already qualified. "We'll give it our all to qualify for the Olympics in Rio this summer," Smith told BBC Sport. "It's going to be a tough competition but I'm confident in my preparations." Commonwealth champion Smith is the lead candidate to represent Team GB should the GB women claim a berth, but rising star Rebekah Tiler is expected to rival her. Ex-England lifter Hannah Powell - who now aims to represent Wales - will line up at her first major international since the 2011 World Championships. The unfunded British men's team need a top-seven place at the European Championships in Forde, which run from 10 to 16 April. They are boosted by Welsh lifter Darius Jokarzadeh's first appearance in the sport since finishing fourth at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The US-based athlete, who wants to be an American footballer, is joined by Olympian Gareth Evans and British champion Sonny Webster in the squad. "Qualification for this summer's Olympic Games remains extremely competitive," British Weight Lifting performance director Tommy Yule said. "Our elite lifters have proven themselves more than up to the challenge, however, and have a terrific opportunity in Norway to seal Olympic qualification." Should GB attain a place or places at the Rio Olympics then athletes will bid to represent Team GB through performances at the British Championships in June.	London Olympian Zoe Smith will lead a 14-strong British team at April's European Championships in Norway.
Robert Kerr, 39, inflicted 76 wounds on 39-year-old Xin Xin Liu at their home in Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire. The Crown accepted his plea to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility after it emerged he suffered "an abnormality of the mind". Kerr will remain at the State Hospital under an interim compulsion order. At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Boyd imposed the interim compulsion order for Kerr to remain at Carstairs and the case was adjourned until November. The court heard that Xin Xin had moved to Scotland from China around 15 years ago to study law at Aberdeen University. It was there she met Kerr, who was completing a computer course. They were married in 2003. Kerr was latterly a lecturer at West College Scotland in Paisley, while Xin Xin was training to be a translator. They were described as a "quiet and private couple" with family not aware of any problems between them. In April this year - weeks before the killing - Kerr had contacted his GP complaining of stress in respect of "work and personal issues". He added he was suffering from anxiety, insomnia and spoke about "paranoid feelings". Four days before the attack, Kerr spoke to a nurse and said he had been feeling much better and appeared to be sounding "chirpier". The court heard that on 26 April, however, Kerr attacked Xin Xin as their two sons slept upstairs. Just before midnight, he dialled 999 and admitted: "I have just killed my wife. I murdered her in a stabbing frenzy." He went on to state there was "blood all over the place". Police discovered Xin Xin lying on the kitchen floor with a knife still in her body. After being held, Kerr then told officers: "I found out tonight they were not mine." Prosecutor Jane Farquharson said he had "suspicions" that a friend was the father of his children. Ms Farquharson told the court: "A paternity test recently carried out...has since confirmed that Robert Kerr is the biological father." A number of blood-stained items were found at the couple's house, including a milk carton. The advocate depute said: "Kerr has since admitted that he had made himself a hot drink after this incident." A post mortem later revealed Xin Xin had suffered a total of 76 wounds. The court heard that Kerr had since been receiving treatment at the State Hospital at Carstairs. One doctor concluded that his "ability to control his conduct" that night was "substantially impaired by reason of abnormality of mind". He was said to be suffering from a "delusional disorder" including his belief about the paternity of his children.	A college lecturer has admitting killing his wife in "a stabbing frenzy" after wrongly believing he was not the father of their two children.
A small crowd cheered and applauded as the skyline went dark. The Opera House was lit in a deep shade of green to symbolise renewable energy. The annual event is organised by WWF, the global environment campaign. It encourages cities and individuals to switch off non-essential lights for an hour at 20:30 local time. Critics have dismissed the campaign, now into its seventh year, as a gimmick of little or no practical benefit. This year, Russian President Vladimir Putin is taking part for the first time. The Kremlin due to switch off its lights at 16:30 GMT along with 90 other landmark buildings in Moscow. Sydney cut its lights at 09:30 GMT. "It's really exciting," local resident Jessica Bellamy told AFP news agency. "It's been a very inspiring night because it's all about hope and change." One person wrote on Twitter: "Sydney Harbour bridge is in darkness for Earth Hour. You can even see the stars!"	Australia's biggest city, Sydney, has switched off its lights for an hour as the Earth Day climate change protest gets under way across the globe.
Both 48-hour and 24-hour strikes have already been held on seven Shell-operated platforms. Further action was planned but was put on hold for fresh talks. Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions said in a statement they had held two full days of constructive discussions which would continue next week. The statement said: "These collaborative discussions have demonstrated a clear, shared understanding of the issues being raised by all parties, plus the challenges facing the North Sea. "We remain focused on reaching a mutually-acceptable outcome, which demonstrates collective leadership in shaping the future of the North Sea." The initial 24-hour strike on 26 July was the first industrial action of its kind in the North Sea in nearly 30 years and was followed by a 48-hour stoppage the following week. The platforms involved are the Curlew, Brent Alpha, Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie, Nelson, Gannet and Shearwater. Aberdeen-based Wood Group provides maintenance and construction to Shell and signed a three-year extension to its contract earlier this year.	"Constructive" talks have been held between unions and the Wood Group in an ongoing dispute involving offshore workers.
About 1,000 people gathered to observe a minute of silence and light candles in front of the Senedd. There are over 2,000 French people living in south Wales registered with the French consulate in London. Marie Brousseau-Navarro, the Honorary Consul of France in Cardiff, said messages of support had been touching. She said: "We are united in shock and united in sorrow... And united with all the people who have marched across the world." Saleem Kidwai, chairman of the Muslim Council of Wales was applauded by the crowd as he told them to "stand together shoulder to shoulder". "My condemnation is absolute," he said. "We will eventually win and truth wins over falsehood and light over darkness." First Minister Carwyn Jones was among the many to hold up a candle for the silence, while others held up pencils. The silence was marked at the end by an applause. Earlier, he said: "The vigil in Cardiff Bay tonight is an opportunity for the people of Wales to pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the truly abhorrent attack in Paris. "It is also a chance to show solidarity with the people of France and all those who believe in upholding our democratic values and freedoms that are threatened by such senseless acts of terror." Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb tweeted earlier: "Standing with the French community in Wales and in support of freedom of speech everywhere. 6pm this eve. Senedd, Cardiff. #CharlieHebdo" In a show of unity, London landmarks have been lit in the colours of the French national flag. And world leaders have gathered in Paris for a huge unity march involving over one million people, dwarfing Saturday's marches that saw 700,000 take to the streets. On Saturday, Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis dedicated his side's goal in the 1-1 draw with West Ham to the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Wales' police forces and media organisations held a minute's silence to support those attacked in the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris on Wednesday. A police officer was killed on Thursday and French forces stormed two separate hostage sites in and around Paris, killing three hostage takers, on Friday. "We have been really moved by the hundreds of messages of support and condolences," said Ms Brousseau-Navarro. "Most of all we appreciate the support and solidarity."	A vigil has taken place in Cardiff Bay for French citizens and others following terror acts in Paris which left 17 people dead in three days.
Lancaster left the role on Wednesday after England's World Cup failure. Gatland's Wales beat England at Twickenham to help the hosts' demise and he has been linked with a move. New Zealander Gatland is contracted to Wales until 2019 and Thomas believes "he'll see his time out with Wales and probably go back to New Zealand". Gatland has said he intends to step down from the Wales role after the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Thomas also believes Gatland will have "one eye on coaching New Zealand after a successful run with Wales and with the British and Irish Lions". However, former Lion Thomas says he understands why the English Rugby Football Union might want to have Gatland in charge - even if Wales' record against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa has not matched their Six Nations efforts under him. "I'm sure England would want to make a move for someone like him after seeing what he's done for Wales," said Gatland. "Since he's been in charge, Wales have been an amazingly successful - unfortunately not against the mights of the southern hemisphere as much as he would like. "But we are such a force now in world rugby and are feared and respected, and that's due to the players, yes, but also due to him and the structure he's given the players. "So I'm sure they'd want him and if anybody could afford him, the RFU, I'm sure, could." South Africa's 2007 World Cup-winning coach Jake White "is interested" in the England job.	Former Wales captain Gareth Thomas doubts head coach Warren Gatland could be tempted to succeed Stuart Lancaster as England boss.
Kirsty Blackman, SNP MP for Aberdeen North, found a toy rabbit at the Carriage Gates entrance last July. She tried to trace the owner on social media but no-one came forward for months. After turning to Mumsnet, a user got in touch at Hogmanay, saying the toy belonged to her six-year-old daughter. The woman said she worked near Westminster at the time and her daughter was "gutted" when the bunny went missing as they had been "inseparable since birth". She reclaimed the toy on a visit to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Ms Blackman updated followers on the toy's time at Westminster, including pictures of her and the Jellycat Bashful Bunny with Big Ben behind them and at Prime Minister's Questions. She also drafted an Early Day Motion stating the House of Commons is "saddened by the discovery of the abandoned bashful bunny by the gates of the Palace of Westminster" which was not submitted to parliament but was signed by several SNP colleagues. Ms Blackman said previously: "I have two young children, so I know the devastation that can be caused when a toy is lost."	An MP who issued a social medial appeal after discovering a soft toy abandoned outside the House of Commons has reunited it with its young owner.
Hutchinson is involved in metal design and manufacturing and laser cutting. The jobs will be recruited over the next three years. A further 40 new jobs have been filled in the past nine months at the company. The jobs consist of manufacturing roles, business development and sales and marketing. It is part of a Â£4.1m investment supported by Invest Northern Ireland. The investment includes the expansion of the company's Kilrea site and further investment in laser technology with the addition of two new lasers.	Forty jobs are being created in Kilrea, County Londonderry, and in Antrim town, by manufacturing company the Hutchinson Group.
Royal Mail said the rise of delivery firm Whistl could wipe £200m off sales. It also said competition was endangering its government-mandated Universal Service, which guarantees a single price postal service that delivers to all UK addresses. The caution came as Royal Mail reported a small fall in pre-tax profits. They dropped to £218m for the six months to 28 September, from £233m in the same period last year. In its financial statement, Royal Mail named Whistl, formerly known as TNT, as a direct threat to future profits. The company also said it faced increased parcel competition and that Amazon's recently-launched delivery service could singlehandedly dent its business by as much as 2%, in the short term. In the past six months, Royal Mail's UK parcel delivery division saw revenues fall by 1%. However the firm's international parcel delivery service, GLS, fared well, with revenue up 7%, helping the company's overall revenue to rise by just £5m to slightly above £4.52bn. Royal Mail's letter business saw volumes drop by 3%, although this was not as steep a fall as had been expected. The slower decline was due to election pamphleteering, particularly relating to the Scottish Referendum, for which Royal Mail delivered seven million campaign mailings and over five million poll cards. Royal Mail boss Moya Greene told the BBC that increased competition was threatening the company's ability to deliver letters to all parts of the UK - a service mandated by law. She added that the "cherry-picking" of urban mail routes by competitors "undermines the economics" of its nationwide delivery service. Royal Mail has long called for the regulator, Ofcom, to consider expanding the Universal Service mandate - which ensures mail is delivered across the UK, six days a week, at one fixed price - so that it includes rivals such as Whistl. That may include forcing competitors to also deliver letters to rural areas at an affordable price - a service for which companies can make little or no profit. "We believe the current regulatory framework does not fully address the problem posed by unfettered direct delivery competition," Royal Mail said. "We think there is an urgent need for a new framework that will secure the sustainable provision of the Universal Service for the future." In response, a spokesman for Ofcom said the regulator's own evidence "clearly shows that the service is not currently under threat". "We would assess any emerging threat to the service quickly, in the interests of postal users," he added. Royal Mail has been under increased public scrutiny since it was privatised in October 2013. In July, a group of MPs voiced concerns that the taxpayer may have lost out by about £1bn after Royal Mail shares were "undervalued". After an initial pricing of 330p, Royal Mail shares rose above 600p in the months after its flotation, but have been steadily declining since the early summer, to 430p. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC Business Editor Lurking on page 8 of today's numbers is the real story in Royal Mail's results - that the business is warning of a "material risk" to the Universal Service obligation. Some may dismiss this as special pleading from a company that does not much like competition. But I have just spoken to the Royal Mail's chief executive, Moya Greene, and she is clear - if action isn't taken now, Royal Mail's ability to fund the six day letter delivery service across the UK will come under possibly unmanageable strain. "The threat is now," she told me.	Shares in Royal Mail closed down 8.3% after the firm warned that rivals - including Amazon - were eating into its parcel delivery business.
Mike Welch, chief executive of Blackcircles.com, can expect to gain a third of that sale price, while staying with the company. He started selling tyres aged 16 before joining Kwik-Fit. Aged 21, he set up Black Circles, basing it in Peebles, where it employs 50 people. Welch, now aged 36, built it up to annual sales in 2013 of £28m, with annual growth of around 20% per year since 2008.  The first three months of this year have seen revenue rise by 34% on the same period last year. The company developed a "click and fit" business model. Customers choose their tyres online, they are then delivered directly from manufacturers to one of 1,350 independent garages, where the customer then books in a tyre-fitting session. According to the chief executive, prices undercut conventional sales by 20%-to-40%. In March, the company announced that it was looking at ways to extend its growth, including a float on a stock exchange, private equity investment, or a sale. It recruited former Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy onto the board, to use his expertise in retail. There is also a trial of a Blackcircles fitting service at some Tesco superstores. The Michelin deal opens up expertise and a much wider distribution network, without limiting Blackcircles.com to the parent company's brand products. Michelin already owns the conventional tyre distributor ATS Euromaster, and the French firm hopes there will be synergies between the two distributors, although Blackcircles.com will continue to operate independently within the Michelin group. "I'm delighted to have found in Michelin a partner who shares our passion for customer service, innovation and technology," said Mr Welch. "The strength of the Michelin Group will allow us to underpin the multi-brand offering that we deploy in each garage, on every street corner. "I am convinced that our teams, our customers, our garages and our suppliers will rapidly start to see the benefits of this partnership." Jean-Dominique Senard, chief executive of the Michelin Group, commented: "Our strategy illustrates our ambition: to be ever more innovative, efficient and proactive for our customers by offering them products and services suited to individual needs, and by simplifying the entire purchase process, from choosing their tyres to having them fitted by professionals." Michelin has 68 production plants in 17 countries, and employs 117,000 people. An interview with Mike Welch can be heard on Business Scotland this weekend - at 06:00 on Saturday and 07:30 on Sunday - on BBC Radio Scotland.	One of Scotland's most successful entrepreneurs has sold his tyre-fitting business for £50m to Michelin.
Unions at BAE Systems have warned of possible delays to funding for the Royal Navy's new frigates. But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted there was no change to the timetable. Labour said it was vital that promises were kept while the Lib Dems called for an end to uncertainty. The UK government confirmed in its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November that eight Type 26 frigates would be built on the Clyde, although the total number was scaled back from 13. In the meantime, the yards are being sustained by Ministry of Defence orders for new offshore patrol vessels. But after briefings with management, the GMB union said last week that work on the new frigates would not begin until 2017 and raised concerns that up to 800 jobs could be lost if there was any backsliding on commitments. SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was "gravely concerned" by the developments. She said: "The future of both Govan and Scotstoun depend on these orders. Solemn promises were made in the run-up to the referendum and if those promises are broken, it will be seriously damaging for the shipyards but I think people across Scotland will feel very let down by the parties that made those promises." She added: "I think the government has the responsibility to make cast iron assurances here." Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said she had held discussions with shipyard workers and BAE management  about the need to protect jobs. She said: "It's my deep regret that Labour didn't win the general election - so the Tories have to fulfil their promise to the workers in the yards, and I'll be making that case every step of the way." Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed frustration about the uncertainty. "There are serious concerns about the future of orders at the yards and it's important that the Conservative government gives an absolute commitment. We've got to end this feast and famine of orders at the yards," he said. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, however, said she had been given assurances by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that nothing had changed. She said: "He confirmed there had been no change to the orders that were set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review last year. "That means all eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates that are coming, plus the light frigate order on top of that, and the two offshore patrol vessels. They are coming to the Clyde, as discussed last year, to the same timetable and the same number." A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: "Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are working with the Ministry of Defence to agree a revised baseline for the Type 26 ships and a production schedule for the two additional offshore patrol vessels in Glasgow. "We are engaging our trades unions as we work through this process. Our focus is to deliver the capability the Royal Navy needs, while ensuring the best value for UK taxpayers."	First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has called for "cast iron assurances" jobs will not be lost at Clyde shipyards because of contract delays.
La Gommeuse achieved the top price of $67.5m (£45m) at Sotheby's, as part of their Impressionist & Modern Art sale on Thursday. And Van Gogh's atmospheric landscape, Paysage sous un ciel mouvemente, sold for $54m (£36m), helping to take the evening's total to $306.7m (£203m). Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it "a small sale that packed a real punch". He added: "Each season Picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two Blue Period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper." La Gommeuse, described as most the important blue period Picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901. The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into English as 'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs. It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work. The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Manach was apparently intended as a gift for the Catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris. The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers. At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by Asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons. The $306.7m (£202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (£182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (£244.5m). This total brings Sotheby's sales of Impressionist & Modern Art in just the past 24 hours to $575.8m (£381m), Earlier this year, Picasso's Women of Algiers became the most expensive painting to sell at auction, going for $160m (£102.6m) at Christie's in New York.	A new record for a blue period Picasso has been set at auction in New York.
The study says girls as young as 10 are forced to marry much older men in countries including Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Somalia. Save the Children says early marriage can trigger a cycle of disadvantage across every part of a girl's life. Conflict, poverty and humanitarian crises are seen as major factors that leave girls exposed to child marriage. "Child marriage starts a cycle of disadvantage that denies girls the most basic rights to learn, develop and be children," said Save the Children International CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt. "Girls who marry too early often can't attend school, and are more likely to face domestic violence, abuse and rape. They fall pregnant and are exposed to STIs (sexually transmitted infections) including HIV." The girl who said no to child marriage Europe struggles with migrant child brides Gambia and Tanzania ban child marriages Big money for Niger's child brides The report, called Every Last Girl, ranks countries based on the hardest place to be a girl based on schooling, child marriage, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and the number of women in parliament. Chad, Niger, Central African Republic, Mali and Somalia were ranked at the bottom of the index. The report says girls affected by conflict are more likely to become child brides. It says many refugee families marry off their daughters as a way to protect them against poverty or sexual exploitation. The charity used the example of a 13-year-old Syrian refugee in Lebanon it called Sahar - not her real name - who was married to a 20-year-old man. Now 14, she is two months pregnant. "The wedding day, I was imagining it would be a great day but it wasn't. It was all misery. It was full of sadness," Save the Children quoted her as saying. "I feel really blessed that I am having a baby. But I am a child raising a child." The report says girls also suffer during humanitarian crises such as the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone where the shutting down of schools led to an estimated 14,000 teen pregnancies. The UN children's agency, Unicef, estimates that the number of women married in childhood will grow from 700 million today to around 950 million by 2030. The Save the Children's report coincides with International Day of the Girl on Tuesday.	One girl under the age of 15 is married every seven seconds, according to a new report by Save the Children.
East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust serves a population of more than 750,000 people across five different hospitals. Experts from health regulator Monitor also identified issues with safety, leadership and "a culture of bullying". The trust said it would "work to make improvements to the services". It was deemed inadequate by the independent watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, in August. The trust runs the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford; the Kent and Canterbury in Canterbury; the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (QEQM) in Margate; the Buckland in Dover; and the Royal Victoria in Folkestone. Concerns were raised about a culture of bullying at the organisation and inspectors identified staff shortages in A&E, children's care and at night. They found risks to patients and incidents involving patient safety were not always identified. The inspection team also noticed that in a number of areas around the trust, buildings and equipment were "poorly maintained". Monitor said it would be appointing an improvement director at the trust to provide support and to ensure it is making progress. "The trust needs to urgently improve the safety of care for patients, and strengthen its management to better support frontline staff," said Paul Streat, regional director at Monitor. "By putting the trust into special measures we can ensure they turn things around quickly. "Senior leaders need to listen to and work with all staff to understand and tackle problems on their wards," he said. Patients visiting the Kent and Canterbury Hospital on Tuesday said they had no confidence in the management. Former cancer patient Ken Rogers, who quit in July as a governor, said: "I've argued with the trust over some of the performance results of what they've been doing to patients and they haven't listened." Robert Watts, who was at the hospital with his wife and baby son, said: "You want the best. You want to be told the right things and hope that they do the best job they can. "Sometimes they don't, they miss it. I just don't think that this hospital can do that." The trust's chief executive, Stuart Bain, said: "We want to work with our regulator Monitor, our staff and our health partners to make improvements to the services we provide to the people of east Kent." He said areas for improvement had already been recognised including the investment of an additional Â£2.9m to recruit 69 nurses where shortages existed. An additional four general surgeons had also been recently appointed and a further three would be recruited shortly, Mr Bain added. "In addition we identified the need to improve our appointment system some time ago and have just completed a public consultation on our outpatient services that will allow us to make improvements to the services we offer patients. "New appointment booking systems, more flexible appointments, and an investment of Â£28m in improved facilities including a new hospital in Dover will start to address these issues," he said. "The trust is committed to working with staff and health partners to produce an action plan to address the issues raised by the CQC and Monitor and to see us removed from special measures as soon as possible."	One of the largest hospital trusts in England is to be put into special measures because of "serious failures" in patient safety.
Scott Carson was at full stretch to tip a header from Brentford's John Egan behind, while Tom Ince saw his free-kick turned over by visiting keeper Daniel Bentley. The visitors almost scored when Scott Hogan rounded Carson, but he could only find the side netting. Derby, who have just seven goals in 13 games, are three points off relegation. Johnny Russell and Ince had the Rams' best second-half chances, while Romaine Sawyers had a penalty shout waved away for Brentford. Despite the lack of goals, Steve McClaren's Derby side are now on a four-game unbeaten run, conceding just once in the process. Their lack of attacking impetus was compounded by James Wilson's knee injury in training, and they also lost Will Hughes, who limped off midway through the first half. Brentford, winless in three games, are just a point outside the top six and rarely looked in trouble against their hosts. The clean sheet was their first against Derby in 11 attempts, going back to 1953, and they have not won an away game against the Rams since 1939. Derby County manager Steve McClaren:  "The first half was too slow, no tempo and a little too safe. "But we've got to play football with these players, they are football players, we can't play long ball. "At times they are making mistakes but that will progress and will get better and I had no faults apart from in the final third where we needed that bit of magic. "A draw was probably a fair result, we huffed and puffed without blowing the house down." Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "I don't know if we deserved to win but we certainly deserved a penalty. "It was a double whammy and how it's not given I don't know. I think their bench was embarrassed it wasn't given as well. "I thought our performance was very good, very disciplined and the intensity of pressing in our half was very good. "Derby have got very good players but had very few clear-cut chances and I think our goalkeeper was rarely troubled. Match ends, Derby County 0, Brentford 0.

Aker Solutions said employees had been told about 650 positions, mainly in the UK, Norway and India, may be affected. A more specific breakdown for Aberdeen and London jobs has not been announced. A spokesperson said: "The adjustments are being made because of the continued market slowdown and as part of a global reorganization that will strengthen the company's competitiveness." Aker employs about 15,000 people, of which more than 2,000 are in the UK, the majority of them in Aberdeen and offshore.	Hundreds of jobs are set to go at oil services firm Aker Solutions with about 100 at risk in Aberdeen and London.
Operation Anagram was formed by Strathclyde Police in 2006 after Tobin raped and murdered 23-year-old Polish student Angelika Kluk in Glasgow. It also helped convict him of the murders of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol and 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton. Police said that while the operation was being scaled back it would never end. Det Sup David Swindle, who formed the operation, said anyone with information regarding Peter Tobin would still be able to contact the Anagram incident room via e-mail which would be monitored daily. "Since Operation Anagram was formed in 2006, I could never have believed the momentum and magnitude it would have developed into," he said. "The public response and assistance from the media has been unbelievable. "The long-running investigation has brought some solace to the families of Vicky Hamilton and Dinah McNicol in knowing what happened to their loved ones." Det Sup Swindle said that although Anagram had not uncovered other murder victims of Tobin to date, he was "proud" of its "success in bringing closure" to some bereaved families. He added: "I leave Strathclyde Police after 34 years in the knowledge that we have tried our best to find out the truth of what Tobin has done and also with confidence that the Anagram processes built up over the last four and a half years ensures a life long awareness of this cowardly, vicious serial killer Tobin. "Any new information coming to light will continue to be researched which may bring similar closure to other families. "The search for the truth about what Peter Tobin has done will continue." Tobin is serving three life sentences for the murders of Vicky Hamilton, Dinah McNicol and Angelika Kluk. Ms Kluk was raped and murdered at a church in Glasgow in 2006. The bodies of Ms McNicol, from Essex, and Ms Hamilton, from Redding in Falkirk, were found the following year in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent. Operation Anagram has helped piece together a timeline of Tobin's movements and relationships over decades in a bid to determine whether he is responsible for other unsolved crimes.	A dedicated police operation set up to examine the activities of serial killer Peter Tobin is to be wound down.
The three-month tests of 137 island homes, 73 in Guernsey and 64 in Jersey, measured the level of gas in the walls. Radon occurs naturally in areas with a large amount of granite and 99 of the homes tested were below target levels. Fourteen island homes were above the target level and owners have been told to ensure there is good ventilation. The survey was carried by the islands' authorities with the UK Health Protection Agency. The 137 properties were selected to cover a range of geological conditions and population areas. The aim was to find out more about radon and its distribution. Val Cameron, the Channel Islands strategic lead for environmental health, said: "The recent survey updates and confirms the information from previous surveys; this is that radon is associated with the granite geology of the island, and not the construction material of an individual building." International research has found exposure to radon gas can increase the chances of contracting lung cancer for people who smoke. Dr Susan Turnbull, medical officer of health for Jersey, said: "To help put the main risk factors for the commonest form of lung cancer into perspective, for every 100 cases of lung cancer around 95 will have been caused by smoking alone, about four will be due to the combined effects of smoking and radon exposure. "Only one will be due to radon exposure alone. So it is a real risk, albeit a low one. The most sensible thing anyone can do to reduce their risk of getting lung cancer is to stop smoking." Mrs Cameron said: "Of the homes surveyed, some were identified as being above the action level. Advice has been given to those householders about measures to remedy the problem." Previously radon surveys were carried out in Jersey in 1987, 1992 and 1997, and in Guernsey in 1985. In 2012, tests were also carried out in Herm, Alderney and Sark. In 1984 the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and the International Commission on Radiological Protection reported on the need for a reduction of radon exposures in homes.	The amount of radon gas found in the Channel Islands is associated with the geology of the island and not construction materials, a survey finds.
He is one of 249 men suing the Catholic Church over alleged historical sexual abuse at St William's residential school in Market Weighton. Only one man out of five initial cases heard at the High Court in Leeds has been awarded compensation. In December, a judge ruled in favour of one claimant and ordered the church to pay Â£14,000 in damages. At the same hearing, His Honour Judge Gosnell dismissed three other claims. More on this and other East Yorkshire stories In January 2016 the former head of St William's James Carragher was jailed for the third time after he was found guilty of sexually abusing boys. Carragher, 75, had already been sentenced to 21 years in prison for sexually abusing boys and was jailed for a further nine years in January. He was jailed for seven years in 1993 and a further 14 years in 2004 for offences he committed at St William's, which closed in 1992. Co-defendant Anthony McCallen, 69, a former chaplain at St William's, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a series of historical sex offences. He was acquitted of eight other charges at the same trial. The De La Salle Brothers, a Christian order of lay teachers, which ran the school in conjunction with the Diocese of Middlesbrough, has apologised "unreservedly" for the abuse. Another set of compensation claims is expected to be heard in late 2017.	A man who claimed he was abused at an East Yorkshire Catholic school has lost a legal action for compensation.
About 14m birds are bred for the table a year. Processing companies are big employers and the industry sustains thousands of jobs on farms and in factories. But poultry has a problem - how to deal with the waste it generates. At the moment, the millions of birds reared in Northern Ireland create 260,000 tonnes of poultry litter a year. The litter is a mix of bedding and droppings and if the industry expands, it could generate 400,000 tonnes of waste annually. For the moment, much of the waste is spread as fertiliser on fields. But it is rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can run off into rivers and lakes and damage them - a process known as eutrophication. European Union regulations are in place to stop that. To show it is making progress, Northern Ireland needs a long term solution to deal with its poultry waste. The Northern Ireland Executive has set up a £15-20m fund to try to find an answer and soon it will be spending some of that cash. It will be lent to companies who will use it to part fund at least two "demonstrator" plants to test new technology. They would be expected to deal with at least 20,000 tonnes of waste a year. Six applications have been assessed by the business development agency, Invest NI. Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said at Christmas that schemes based on anaerobic digestion (AD) were furthest advanced in the selection process. Anaerobic digestion uses micro-organisms to break down organic matter inside a sealed and heated system. That gives off a biogas which can be burned to produce heat and power, but there is a problem with using AD technology for this. Unless expensive stripping processes are included, the same amount of nitrogen and phosphorous going into the system in the poultry litter, will be present in the byproduct, or digestate, when it comes out. If you want to spread the digestate on land, you will face the same potential problems with eutrophication. That is why, in 2014, a report commissioned by the agriculture minister said anaerobic digestion was not the answer to the poultry litter problem. However, it seems officials are determined to overcome this issue with the AD projects being assessed for funding. The Department of Agriculture has said that, in those projects, the digestate would either be exported for field spreading or further refined to separate out the nutrients in pellet form. The first loan agreement with Invest NI was expected to be signed by the end of last year. The minister said that once the finance was in place, she expected the first plants could be operational by late 2016 or early 2017.	Poultry meat is big business in Northern Ireland - worth £205m in 2014.
After two hours of talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, he said that the "two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this relationship". Although there was some "common ground" on Syria, "broad differences" remained. Mr Lavrov said the two sides needed to overcome "time-bomb issues" inherited from Barack Obama's administration. Tensions have risen since a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead. The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government, and the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase in response. Syria denied carrying out the chemical attack and has the support of its main ally, Russia, which on Wednesday vetoed a motion brought to the UN Security Council which would have required Bashar al-Assad's government to co-operate with investigators. It is the eighth time Moscow has used its veto to protect Syria. Both Mr Tillerson and Mr Lavrov said the discussions were frank. Mr Tillerson said: "I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. There is a low level of trust between our two countries." He added: "We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of greatest importance to both of us." It was a view echoed by President Donald Trump later, who said at a press briefing with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: "We may be at an all-time low in terms of our relationship with Russia." Mr Trump said "it would be a fantastic thing" if the nations improved ties, but warned "it may be just the opposite". Mr Lavrov said a pragmatic conversation was needed to remove the "irritants that piled up under the Obama administration". Both ministers said there was agreement on working towards a stable and unified Syria, and in defeating so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups. Both agreed to work towards an international investigation of the chemical attack. But it was obvious there were many differences. Mr Tillerson said there was clear evidence that the recent chemical attack "was planned, directed and executed by Syrian regime forces". He said the reign of Bashar al-Assad must end and that Mr Trump's description of the Syrian president as "an animal" was "a characterisation President Assad has brought on himself". Mr Lavrov said there was no evidence Syria was behind the chemical attack and pointed to the turmoil that had been brought to other nations when leaders had been removed. There was little concrete to come from the meeting, although the fact Mr Putin granted Mr Tillerson an audience - which had been in doubt - was a measure of success. Mr Putin did say he was ready to restore the US-Russia air safety agreement over Syria, and Mr Tillerson said there would be working groups set up on smaller issues. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Lavrov said Russia had "a lot of questions regarding very ambiguous and contradictory ideas... coming from Washington". Afterwards he said "we understand each other better" and there were "many prospects for co-operation with the US". He said there were "certain time-bomb issues inherited from the previous administration - we know to overcome these obstacles we have to make efforts and that the Americans must move towards us as well". Earlier, the US and Russian presidents revealed the wide gulf between them over Syria. Referring to Mr Assad in a Fox Business Network interview, Mr Trump said: "Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person... if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now." He later called Mr Assad a "butcher". Speaking on Mir television, Mr Putin rejected allegations that Syria was behind the chemical attack, saying Syria had given up its chemical stockpile. He said: "Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any." Referring to the US air strike, he said: "But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact." And despite hopes that US-Russia ties would improve under a Trump presidency, Mr Putin said: "One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved, but rather has deteriorated."	US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says ties with Russia are at a low point and must improve.
Supporters and colleagues gathered outside the Alvorada Palace to bid her farewell, some handing her flowers. Ms Rousseff was dismissed last week after the Senate found her guilty of manipulating the budget. She denies wrongdoing and has dismissed her impeachment as a "coup d'etat". Brazilian television showed Ms Rousseff walking out of the presidential residence surrounded by former ministers and Congressmen from her Workers' Party. How will history look back on impeachment? Profile: Dilma Rousseff Supporter Cecilia Monteir, 56, said she was "very, very sad, feeling like the country will be left a bit orphaned". More supporters awaited Ms Rousseff as she arrived at an airport to board a plane to the southern city of Porto Alegre, her adopted hometown. On her arrival she was greeted by more well-wishers. Hours after the impeachment vote, Ms Rousseff's vice-president Michel Temer, was sworn in, ending 13 years in power for the left-wing Workers' Party. He will serve out Ms Rousseff's term until 1 January 2019. Ms Rousseff has filed an appeal at the Supreme Court against the Senate's decision but correspondents say it has very little chance of succeeding.	Former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has left her official residence in the capital Brasilia for the last time following her impeachment and removal from office.
After three wickets fell in the morning, Lloyd made 102 not out, with a six and 14 fours, supported by Aneurin Donald (44) and Jacques Rudolph (38). Stu Whittingham (1-58) and Danny Briggs (2-62) were the pick of the Sussex attack on a placid pitch. The teams shook hands on a draw at 17:20 BST when Lloyd reached three figures. Sussex looked in with a strong chance when Will Bragg was run out just before lunch for 33, after nightwatchman Owen Morgan (36) had earlier been bowled by Briggs. But they took just one wicket in the afternoon, and Lloyd was dropped at slip on 66 off Whittingham when the home side took the second new ball. Sussex remain in the lower half of the table despite remaining unbeaten, with one win and seven draws. Glamorgan have been unable to win a Championship game in the first half of their season, but do have a successful limited-overs campaigns to focus on - and they will meet Sussex again, in the T20 Blast, in Cardiff on Thursday. Sussex captain Luke Wright told BBC Sussex: "It was a tough four days but I am really chuffed for the guys, particularly with the way we batted. We've not scored enough big runs, and to see the guys get big hundreds is exactly what we are looking for. "It was always going to be difficult. The wicket didn't really turn, we kept flying in and tried everything, but credit to Glamorgan for holding on tight." Glamorgan top scorer David Lloyd told BBC Wales Sport: "It was a big challenge, we lost an early wicket but the way the boys turned up today and occupied the crease was really good, so to come away with a draw is excellent. "I tried to bat time but also to bat positively as well so as not to die in a hole - the way Aneurin [Donald] played his shots, it rubbed off on myself as well so we just had to make sure it was the right ball to put away. "I didn't have a choice [about staying on for his hundred], I thought by the field that Sussex set, I had  one over to get it so that's what I tried to do. "We've had a good start in both white-ball formats and the T20 is the one we're really trying to target after the start we've had, so hopefully we can keep it going at home."	Sussex's victory bid was frustrated as David Lloyd's unbeaten hundred enabled Glamorgan to bat out the final day.
Defeats by Munster, Edinburgh and Ulster were followed by a run of nine wins in 11 Pro12 and European games, including a win against Toulon. Ospreys beat Scarlets 19-9 on Tuesday. "Hopefully it's just a glitch. We'll see next week if it's a huge step back," Owens told BBC Radio Wales. "We've bounced back well, we didn't have a great start [losing first three games] but we've built momentum. "We've got some great performances in during the international period and over the last couple of weeks." Scarlets are fifth in the Pro12 following the Ospreys defeat but Owens is optimistic about their progress this season after a poor start to their league campaign. "You can't win every game in the season and, as long as we turn up with a huge win against the Blues, then we'll be back in that winning groove again," Owens continued. "You can't go all season winning every game, it's not going to happen, so we will put ourselves in a position now from the start we had." Scott Williams says Ospreys' kicking game proved vital in the defeat and says they need to look at themselves closely before facing Cardiff Blues on New Year's Day. "We knew it was going to be close but there were too many mistakes and too many penalties," Williams said. "Our defence has been pretty good the last couple of weeks but you can't be giving penalties away when they've got boys like Dan Biggar and Sam Davies in their team. "We'll be tough on ourselves now. We've got another derby in four days so we've got to get our heads on for that and make sure we turn up."	Scarlets captain Ken Owens says they can bounce back from their derby defeat by west Wales rivals Ospreys - just like they recovered from losing their first three games of the season.
He was a surprise choice to lead the Fifa investigation, and ruffled feathers at football's governing body. On one occasion, he turned up unannounced to interview members of the senior executive committee who had cast votes in the World Cup bids. Even before he dismissed Fifa's report as "erroneous", there were signs that he was not afraid to pick a fight with his employers. In an interview last year he said his authority was to investigate "any official, top down, for misconduct... no-one is above the ethics code". He acknowledged that he took on the investigation as an outsider. "I come into this case with no history or experience of what might have happened," he said. "I will look at the facts and my jurisdiction and make decisions on whether the ethics code was violated." In a recent talk to lawyers in London about ethics in sport, Mr Garcia said Fifa's ethic's code needed transparency and leadership - a comment seen as a thinly veiled critique of Fifa boss Sepp Blatter. He eventually quit Fifa in December 2014, saying that a "lack of leadership" at the organisation had led to his decision. Mr Garcia made his name in his native New York, serving as a federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York from 1992 to 2001 and working on a series of high-profile cases. These included the prosecution of four defendants for the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, and the investigation into the 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He once told his daughter that his goal was "to punish people who do bad things and break the law". In March 2003 President George W Bush appointed Mr Garcia, a Republican, as assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement. The post put him in charge of more than 20,000 staff and a budget of more than $4bn. Later he moved back to New York's Southern District, serving as a US attorney from 2005-2008. There he supervised investigations into securities fraud, bringing a series of insider trading prosecutions. An investigation he led ultimately forced the resignation of Democratic governor Eliot Spitzer over a prostitution scandal. But he also took on some major international corruption and fraud cases, including the oil-for-food programme in Iraq and alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the Norwegian energy firm Statoil. He is currently a partner at private US law firm Kirkland and Ellis, and it was from here that he was chosen by Fifa in 2012 to lead the investigation into the bidding process that awarded the World Cup to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022. A year later he was among 18 Americans barred from entering Russia in Moscow's response to the Magnitsky List, which banned Russian officials from the US. Married to an FBI agent, he has kept largely out of the media spotlight and has not run for public office, despite speculation that he could be in a strong position to do so.	Michael Garcia, the American lawyer hired by Fifa to investigate the World Cup bidding process before criticising the organisation's summary of his own report and eventually resigning, is a former prosecutor with a history of launching corruption probes.
Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983. They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. Judges have ruled that there will now be a "By Order hearing" to discuss the next part of the case. Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions. The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals. The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was "wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself". However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case. These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said "for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election". The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts. Lady Paton said: "Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context. "The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement." Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was "irrelevant" and "bound to fail". Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live. The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years. It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April. Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the "details of the account are not correct". The constituents who brought the petition were aided by crowd funding.	A legal challenge to Alistair Carmichael's election as MP for Orkney and Shetland is to proceed.
No-one is absolutely certain it will happen, but most people I've spoken to assume it's coming. In reality, the Americans will just tell everyone what they want and when they want it. I'm told that European governments don't get much say in the matter or much notice of any changes - in fact they're watching the media and Twitter just in case it's sprung on them. Any ban would hit Heathrow the hardest. Three-quarters of UK flights to the US go from Heathrow. That's 761 planes a week, by far the most from any European airport. However, there is widespread concern that by tackling one threat, terrorism, the Americans could be fuelling another, even more serious problem. Fire. If lithium-ion batteries are damaged or short-circuited they make a hell of a bang. It could even be enough to bring down a plane. Captain John Cox is as knowledgeable as anyone you will meet when it comes to plane fires. The former pilot and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society has studied them for more than a decade and now travels the world advising operators, manufacturers and regulators. "Bunching lots of electronic devices together into the same secure box in the hold is the worst possible thing you could do," he told me. "Devices collected together will dramatically increase the ferocity of any fire." Aircraft holds do have fire extinguishers and limited oxygen, but that doesn't help when it comes to lithium battery fires. "The cargo hold extinguisher will put out the open flame but it will reignite. Lithium battery fires produce their own oxygen as a by-product of thermal runaway, and that keeps the fire going," says Mr Cox. Thermal runaway is the process whereby the fire spreads from one battery cell to the next. Once it gets going it's impossible to stop. And the more cells you have bunched together, the bigger the fire. Catching the fire early and stopping thermal runaway is critical. The best device for doing that remains an old fashioned, well-trained human being. Airline staff practise what to do: you put the battery into water if you can. Or wet towels. No-one can do that if it's in the hold. Steve Landells is the safety expert at the British Airline Pilots Association, "Given the risk of fire from these devices when they are damaged or they short circuit, an incident in the cabin would be spotted earlier and this would enable the crew to react quickly before any fire becomes uncontainable," he says. "If these devices are kept in the hold, the risk is that if a fire occurs the results can be catastrophic; indeed, there have been two crashes where lithium batteries have been cited in the accident reports." Mr Cox says that balancing the different risks is complex and needs a thorough assessment from a range of experts. But along with many others in the industry, he's not confident that will happen. The feeling is that the people at the US Department for Homeland Security will take their decision in isolation from the safety people at the US Federation Aviation Administration. That's what happened when the current laptop ban on some flights from the Middle East was brought in. Passengers will no doubt support a ban if they are convinced it'll keep them safer. But the experts are lining up to say that a laptop ban could make flying more dangerous.	Airports, airlines and the government are bracing themselves for a ban on laptops, tablets, cameras and e-readers going as hand luggage on flights between Europe and America.
Six members of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg blocked the entrance to the building at Llandudno Junction at about 06:30 GMT. North Wales Police were called to the protest, which ended at midday. The Welsh government said it was taking action to promote the language. The protestors said the action was part of a general Cymdeithas campaign to put pressure on the Labour administration in Wales to act urgently for the Welsh language. They want the Welsh government to adopt six basic policy changes, including making Welsh-medium education available for all and what they call "fair funding" for the language. Robin Farrar, chairman of the society, said: "We're here to speak out for the present generation, and those to come, who should be able to live in Welsh. "There's a real crisis facing the language, but the Welsh government is not acting seriously. "We're certain that our unique national language can thrive over the years to come with positive campaigning and political will." A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We are very disappointed that Cymdeithas yr Iaith has decided to take this course of action, especially as we've held regular, and constructive, dialogue with the group. "Over the past year we have taken positive action to promote the Welsh language, including significant measures such as publishing proposed standards to improve Welsh language services to citizens."	Welsh language campaigners have chained themselves to the gates of Welsh government offices in a protest at a "lack of response" to the decline in the number of Welsh speakers.
With a population of fewer than 5,000, nearly one in 10 people in South Cave expressed opposition to the plans by Gladman Developments. The developer wants to build on land off Little Wold Lane. South Cave Parish Council has also objected to the proposal, saying it would cause "landscape harm" in the picturesque village. A local campaign group, Save Our Valley, is co-ordinating opposition to the development. Villagers claim the new housing would run parallel to the Wolds Way, a national walking trail, "seriously impacting" on views across the valley. Concerns have also been raised about increased flooding risk and congestion. Gladman said the development would "provide a choice of housing to meet the needs of the area, whilst respecting and enhancing the site's environmental and cultural assets". The development would include access roads and landscaping, together with a play area. The standard consultation on the proposals finishes on 7 April.	More than 600 people in an East Yorkshire village have objected to plans for 119 new homes.
Little is beyond their reach. Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. "I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves," he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. "DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery," Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. "We only use data obtained by people we trust and know," Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the "genocide" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is "We won't forgive or forget", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: "Joseph Biden is the fascists' master." Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists "war criminals" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as "Humpty Dumpty". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Throughout the bitter violence of the Ukrainian conflict, another hidden war has been waged, involving several groups of computer hackers.
The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes. "If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid," the Italy international said. "I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game." AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour. Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to "face this issue head-on". The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: "They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable." Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem. He told CNN: "I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit." There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players. A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng. The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby. And in April, champions Juventus were fined 30,000 euros (£25,000) after their supporters racially abused the AC Milan players.	Mario Balotelli has threatened to walk off the pitch if he is ever again subjected to racist abuse from fans.
Media playback is not supported on this device First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales. France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003. "England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out. "Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit." The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose. Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union. France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end. England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra. After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most. Read more from Tom's blog But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish. Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag. Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot. England's players had talked of "blitzing" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger. Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0. England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street. Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try. England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right. England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball. They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7. Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work. Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on. France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7. Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved. England: Foden, Ashton, Tuilagi, Flood, Cueto, Wilkinson, Youngs, Stevens, Thompson, Cole, Deacon, Palmer, Croft, Moody, Easter. Replacements: Wigglesworth for Wilkinson (65), Banahan for Youngs (65), Corbisiero for Stevens (49), Hartley for Thompson (56), Shaw for Deacon (49), Lawes for Croft (46), Haskell for Moody (63). France: Medard, Clerc, Rougerie, Mermoz, Palisson, Parra, Yachvili, Poux, Servat, Mas, Pape, Nallet, Dusautoir, Bonnaire, Harinordoquy. Replacements: Marty for Rougerie (68), Trinh-Duc for Yachvili (53), Barcella for Poux (56), Szarzewski for Servat (56), Pierre for Pape (65), Picamoles for Harinordoquy (72). Not Used: Heymans.	England's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage.
Paul McMullen got them underway when he finished a Billy King cross, and shortly after it was 2-0 when King scored with a long-range shot. Mark Durnan volleyed in a third to give the visitors a commanding half-time lead against the Highland League side. The result was marred with United striker James Keatings carried off. The result at Victoria Park gives Ray McKinnon's men six points out of six following the 2-0 win on Saturday over Raith Rovers.	Three first-half goals moved Dundee United three points clear at the top of Scottish League Cup Group C as they eased past Buckie Thistle.
He is appealing against an appeal court ruling lifting a ban on him being named in the media in England and Wales. The Supreme Court said it will now hear arguments about whether it should grant an appeal, and if so, decide if it should be "allowed or dismissed". An interim injunction will remain in place until the end of the hearing. On Monday, Court of Appeal judges gave the man - who has young children, and whose spouse is also in the public eye - until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to apply to take the case to the UK Supreme Court. In that ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday. The Supreme Court said that interim injunction will now remain in place until the conclusion of the next hearing. The Sun on Sunday wants to publish an account of alleged extra-marital activities by the man, who is referred to as PJS. But he argues he has a right to privacy and has taken legal action. Monday's court judgement said the celebrity had "occasional sexual encounters" with another person - referred to in court as AB - starting in 2009. They had a text message exchange in December 2011 in which they discussed a "three-way" with AB's partner, CD. Accordingly, the three met for a three-way sexual encounter. In January, the two other parties approached the Sun On Sunday with the story. That month a High Court judge refused to impose an injunction barring publication. But the man appealed and two appeal court judges ruled in his favour. They prevented him being identified in publications in England and Wales. Lawyers for News Group Newspapers - publishers of the Sun On Sunday - then asked Court of Appeal judges to lift the ban. They argued that stories had been published in the US, Scotland and elsewhere where the injunction does not apply. The story had also spread across the internet and on Twitter. PJS opposed that application and said the ban should stay. On Monday, the judges ruled that PJS was now unlikely to be able to get a permanent injunction Details about the allegations were now "so widespread" that confidentiality had "probably been lost", they said. The man's solicitors had been "assiduous" in monitoring the internet and removing stories in breach of the injunction but the judges said that it was now a "hopeless task".	A celebrity who wants an injunction to keep an extra-marital relationship out of the media will put his case at the Supreme Court on Thursday.
Many MPs are spending a lot of time in their constituencies preparing to contest the most closely-fought and unpredictable election in decades. As early as last year Labour taunted the government that this was a "zombie" Parliament, as much of the legislation in the coalition's programme from 2010 had already been passed. The opposition has repeated the allegation many times since. MPs on the government side have hit back with claims that Labour has given up scrutinising bills properly. But as MPs look to the final few weeks before the dissolution of the Parliament elected in 2010, there are still a few bills left to deal with. A bill to improve and strengthen the service complaints system and enable payments to be made to charities and other organisations that support the Armed Forces across the UK. The bill began in the the Lords and has passed all stages in the upper house. It is awaiting its Commons report stage at a date to be confirmed. It is likely that the third reading will also be taken on the same day. As the bill is not particularly controversial it is likely to see royal assent before Parliament is dissolved. A bill overhauling consumer rights law, covering contracts for goods, services, digital content and the law relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts. Consideration of Commons amendments in the Lords was on 24 February, so this will make it to the statute book. A bill to devolve powers to set the rate of corporation tax to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It was due to have its remaining Commons stages - report stage and third reading - on 4 March. The devolution of powers to set the corporation tax rate was a key demand of political leaders ahead of the Stormont House Agreement finalised in Belfast last month. It is still to go through the Lords but the government aims to pass the law before May's general election and Labour has not opposed it. The bill makes a number of changes which would affect business generally and in particular areas including decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee. All Commons stages are complete, while its third reading in the Lords is due on 4 March. However, peers defeated the government during report stage, voting for there to be no move to decriminalise non-payment of the fee before 2017. It remains to be seen if MPs will overturn this amendment and another game of ping pong will ensue. First reading - the bill's formal introduction, in which the name of the bill is read out but no debate takes place. Second reading - a debate on the general principles of a bill. Committee stage - detailed scrutiny of the bill, either in a committee of the whole House or in a public bill committee. Report stage - consideration of the report of the bill committee and a further chance for MPs or peers to table amendments. Third reading - final consideration of the amended bill as a whole. In the House of Lords, there is a final chance to table amendments. Ping pong - if one House rejects the other's amendments, the bill goes back and forth between the lower and upper Houses until agreement is reached. A bill concerning the membership and functions of the House of Commons Commission, which is responsible for the administration and services of the House of Commons. This bill was fast-tracked through the Commons, with all stages on one day - 24 February. After that, it will need the approval of peers. This is a private members' bill, which would put into legislation a target of spending at least 0.7% of national income on aid. It has passed its Commons stages and had its report stage in the Lords on 27 February. Unlike most private members' bills, Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore's bill stands a good chance of becoming law. The bill to allow women Church of England bishops to sit in the House of Lords had its committee stage in the upper House on 26 February. It sailed through its Commons stages and its second reading in the Lords. Basically, its passage is guaranteed. The first woman bishop has already been consecrated. The Right Reverend Libby Lane became Bishop of Stockport in January. The bill to give people greater flexibility in accessing their pension benefits and to help them make informed decisions about what to do with benefits is at the ping pong stage. MPs considered Lords amendments on 24 February. The bill provides for a recall petition to be triggered if an MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House for at least 21 sitting days. It is due to have its third reading in the Lords on 2 March, having passed all stages in the Commons. This bill started in the Lords and had its Commons report stage and third reading on 23 February, with the Lords due to consider any amendments made by MPs in March. This bill aims to improve access to finance for businesses and individuals and also concerns public procurement and the regulatory provisions relating to business and certain voluntary and community bodies. It has passed all stages in the Commons and has its Lords report stage on 3 March. This private bill, which applies to Transport for London and its subsidiaries, started in the House of Lords and had its Commons report stage on 26 February. Private bills are usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, rather than the government. They are distinct from private members' bills which are promoted by individual MPs or peers. And spare a thought for those that are likely to fall by the wayside. A bill which would confer powers to acquire land and to construct and operate phase one of HS2 - a high speed rail line from London to Birmingham. This is a hybrid bill, which features aspects of a public bill and a private bill. This means it is of general application but it contains provisions which have a different legal effect on the private interests of particular persons. The hybrid bill procedure gives those persons who are directly and specially affected an opportunity to petition against the bill and be heard in select committee. Following the bill's second reading it was sent to a select committee and has remained there ever since. The government has admitted that the legislation will not be passed before the general election. This is private members' bill sponsored by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi. It has passed all stages in the Lords and had its Commons second reading scheduled for 27 February, although it was too low down the day's schedule for MPs to even begin debating it. Even if the bill manages a second reading, it might struggle to progress further in the time left before Parliament dissolves. It has also faced some passionate opposition from other MPs and peers. Conservative MP Jonathan Evans' private members' bill has already completed its journey through the House of Lords and has its Commons report stage on 6 March. However, it is likely that no time will be left for a third reading.	The election is approaching fast and both Houses of Parliament have put in some short days recently.
Laurence Shahlaei, originally from Cheltenham, took the title in Leeds from two-time title holder Hafthor Bjornsson who is also famed for his role in the popular television series. Mr Shahlaei, nicknamed "Big Loz", said: "He's a great strongman but it was my day and it felt really good to win." The 32-year-old is the first Englishman to win the title in 27 years. Standing at 6ft 2in (1.9m) and weighing 22 stone (145 kg), the Wiltshire-based athlete had to overcome injury last weekend to take the crown. "I've had a rough few years with injuries and to come back and win Europe's Strongest man has just meant the world to me," he said. "There's five different events that you have to do. I did a 420 kilo dead lift, which was good enough for joint second and then we did a frame carry - it's a race and you're running a 20-metre course while carrying 450 kilos, which is close to 90 stone, and I won that event." Competitors also had to lift a 177kg (28 stone) block above their heads "as many times as possible" as well as tackling the infamous Atlas stones - an event synonymous with strongman competitions. But it was running 20m (65ft) with a Volkswagen Beetle on his shoulders in around 11 seconds that clinched the title from Iceland's Hafthor Bjornsson. "My favourite of the competition was the car walk.  Imagine Fred Flintstone running in his car - that was basically me," he said. "I actually broke the world record on that event.  They made the car even heavier this year and I managed over a second off my world record - which was really, really good."	Game of Thrones star "The Mountain" has been beaten to Europe's Strongest Man title by a man from Swindon.
The FTSE 100 index rose 77 points, or 1.1%, to 6,911.4, with similar rises seen elsewhere in Europe. Most analysts had expected the Fed to hold rates on Wednesday, although the US central bank indicated rates could rise before the end of the year. The dollar fell after US rates were held, which pushed commodity prices up. That led to rises in shares of mining companies, as the price of copper hit a one-month high and other metal prices increased. Shares in Glencore and Fresnillo led the FTSE 100 higher, with both seeing rises of more than 5%. "Given the rise across the spectrum for commodities, it comes as no surprise that the FTSE leaderboard is headed by some of the biggest names in mining," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG. In the FTSE 250, shares in Kier Group rose 1.3% after the construction group reported a 45% increase in underlying full-year pre-tax profits to Â£125m. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.55% against the dollar to $1.3104, but was little changed against the euro at â‚¬1.166.	(Close): UK shares joined in the global rally triggered by the US Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged.
The Taiwanese firm, also known as Foxconn Technology, posted a net profit of NT$37bn ($1.2bn; Â£814m) in the October to December quarter. It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to NT$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and Apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from Apple account for almost half of Foxconn's total revenue. In the October to December quarter, Apple had sold 47.8 million iPhones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of iPad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet PCs - it sold 22.9 million iPads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on Apple has also raised concerns that Foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet PCs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. "In most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage," said Andrew Milroy of consultancy firm Frost & Sullivan. Mr Milroy added that Apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, Apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, Apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. "They are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as China," he said. The fear is that if Apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as Foxconn.	Hon Hai Precision Industry, a major assembler of Apple products, has posted record quarterly profits helped by growing demand for iPhones and iPads.
Neil Aspin's promotion-chasing hosts have not lost in nine National League matches while Adam Lockwood's side are unbeaten in five. Guiseley went ahead on 15 minutes against the run of play when a throw-in found James Hurst who squared to Jake Lawlor to stroke into an empty net. Gateshead defender Liam Hogan superbly blocked Jordan Preston's effort and Guiseley keeper Jonny Maxted then saved well from Wesley York's shot just before the break. The hosts, who started the second half well, levelled on 62 minutes when a slip by half-time substitute Derek Asamoah let York curl sweetly into the top-right corner from the edge of the box. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Gateshead 1, Guiseley 1. Second Half ends, Gateshead 1, Guiseley 1. Substitution, Guiseley. Michael Rankine replaces Jordan Preston.

Pink Mist also took the Roland Mathias poetry award. Francesca Rhydderch won the fiction prize with The Rice Paper Diaries and Meic Stephens took the creative factual award for Rhys Davies: A Writer's Life. In Welsh, Ioan Kidd won the book prize and people's choice award with his work, Dewis. Literature Wales chief executive Lleucu Siencyn said: "This is a book-loving town and local support has ensured the success of this evening. "From Japan to New Quay, Afghanistan to Bristol, Fitzrovia to Blaenclydach the 2014 winners have guided readers to near and distant lands. "Many congratulations to Meic Stephens, Francesca Rhydderch and, of course, to second time winner Owen Sheers." Sheers won the book of the year title in 2005 for his work The Dust Diaries. This year's winning book Pink Mist is about three young soldiers from Bristol who are deployed to Afghanistan. The poem looks at the effect of war on the men and those closest to them when they return from service. Sheers told BBC Radio Wales it was a "fantastic surprise" to win. "It's a book that started with around 30 interviews I did with recently wounded service personnel and their families," he said. "I actually did those interviews for a stage project called The Two Worlds of Charlie F, but when that finished I found that I still had so much more that I wanted to say and there were so many stories I hadn't been able to tell on stage, so that's when Pink Mist was born. "It was Radio 4 that approached me about writing a verse drama - sort of, I suppose, a play for voices if you like - and I asked them if I could go back to this same territory." The theme of war continued in the fiction category where Rhydderch's winning novel is set both in wartime Hong Kong and in west Wales. Stephens won the creative non-fiction category with the first full biography of one of Wales' most prolific writers, Rhys Davies. In Welsh, Kidd enjoyed a successful night with his novel Dewis, which looks at the trials and tribulations of contemporary family life. Each category winner was awarded Â£2,000, and the main award winner in each language received an additional Â£6,000.	Poet Owen Sheers has won Wales Book of the Year at a ceremony in Caernarfon for his work about three young soldiers.
Patrick Bauer and Nathan Byrne helped Karl Robinson's men complete a perfect smash and grab, cancelling out Zach Clough's free-kick. A victory which furthers the Addicks' own play-off ambitions was made all the more impressive considering that they were a man short from the 12th minute onwards following Lewis Page's red card. After Page was sent off for a professional foul on Josh Vela, Clough then made the punishment count double with a brilliant free-kick, his ninth goal of the season. But Robinson's side refused to lie down, equalising on 23 minutes when Jake Forster-Caskey's free-kick was turned in at the far post by defender Bauer. The Addicks then grabbed a shock lead in first-half stoppage time when Forster-Caskey led an impressive counter, feeding Byrne to slot the ball under the advancing Ben Alnwick. Bolton, now without a win in their last five games in all competitions, threw all they had at Charlton after that and struck the woodwork when Andrew Taylor's cross deflected off Chris Solly. They failed to seriously test goalkeeper Declan Rudd in the second half, however, as they slipped to a second consecutive 2-1 defeat in front of their own fans. Charlton, unbeaten since Christmas, have now picked up 11 points from their last five matches to climb to 11th, just six points off a play-off place. Report supplied by the Press Association.	Charlton Athletic came from behind with 10 men to deliver a blow to Bolton Wanderers' League One promotion hopes  at the Macron Stadium.
The Tennis Integrity Unit said Lindahl plotted to throw a match at a minor Australian tournament in 2013. Two other Australian players, Brandon Walkin and Isaac Frost, were also disciplined over the incident. It comes days after Australian Open junior champion Oliver Anderson was charged with match-fixing. Last year, a joint BBC/Buzzfeed investigation alleged the TIU failed to act on suspicions that 16 top-50 ranked players have been involved in match-fixing. Lindahl, 28, achieved a career-high ranking of 187 in singles before retiring in 2013. The TIU, which is responsible for policing tennis, said the offence happened at the Australian F6 Tournament in Toowoomba, Queensland. "He was found guilty of charges of contriving or attempting to contrive the outcome of an event, and failing to co-operate with a TIU investigation," it said in a statement. The penalty means Lindahl will not be able to resume his international playing career or attend official tennis events for seven years, the TIU said. He had already been fined A$1,000 by a court in New South Wales last year. Walkin, 22, was handed a six-month suspension for "passing a corrupt proposal to another party" on behalf of Lindahl. But the 1,066-ranked player is free to compete after his penalty was suspended for six months, subject to further breaches. Frost, 28 and ranked 1,515, refused to hand over his mobile phone during the investigation. He will not be further penalised after serving a provisional suspension between October 2013 and September 2014.	Australian former tennis player Nick Lindahl has been banned for seven years and fined $35,000 (Â£28,000; A$47,700) for match-fixing.
Homeowners hit by the flooding in December can apply for up to Â£5,000 from the government's Future Flood Prevention Funding scheme. Figures seen by the BBC show that only 13 people have applied for the money. Rachael Maskell, Labour MP for York Central, said she had received complaints about accessing the fund. "The form filling is incredibly complicated and that's where people have been struggling," she said. "It's putting off a lot on people." Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded in the city after the Rivers Foss and Ouse burst their banks. The scheme is administered by City of York Council and requires a survey to be carried out on the flooded property before funding can be applied for. The council said that 360 private homes were eligible for the grant. The authority added: "We very much welcome grant applications but know that this can take time while people wait for quotes and loss adjustor reports. "We're appointing a case worker to help residents and businesses through the application process."	York residents are being put off applying for flood protection grants as the process is "incredibly complicated", a local MP has claimed.
PSA, which includes Peugeot, wants to buy General Motors' loss-making European arm, which includes Vauxhall plants at Luton and Ellesmere Port. There are fears that the deal could lead to job losses. Carlos Tavares, boss of PSA Group, is also set to hold talks with Unite union leader Len McCluskey. The company said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties. Vauxhall employs 4,500 workers at the two UK plants, with thousands more involved in its retail and components chain. A Downing Street spokesman said a request for a meeting with Mr Tavares had been received, adding: "The meeting will take place, in principle, subject to diary availability." Unite general secretary Mr McCluskey said he was pleased Mr Tavares had "responded speedily and positively" to his request for a meeting to discuss Peugeot's intentions. He said he would use the meeting to press the case for the UK's "world class facilities and workforce". Apart from meeting the prime minister, PSA will also see Germany's Angela Merkel. It could end up like a corporate beauty parade as Britain and Germany hope to persuade PSA not to shut factories in their respective countries. That's now a real possibility after General Motors said this week that it was in talks to sell its European brands of Opel and Vauxhall to PSA. European car manufacturers have far more production capacity than they need and PSA will probably want to consolidate its factories if it acquires GM Europe. Vauxhall's factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton are both very efficient, but they could face export tariffs when Britain leaves the single market, and probably the customs union, in two years - making those plants unviable. PSA said it was engaged in a "constructive dialogue" with all parties in the bid for GM's European division, which includes German-based Opel as well as Vauxhall. A spokesman said: "Our intention is to establish the same maturity in our exchanges in France, Germany and the UK. "This is why Carlos Tavares has asked to meet Theresa May as it was done with German authorities." David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston Business School in Birmingham, told the BBC that a deal would not be straightforward. "I think it's inevitable if this deal goes ahead that there will be plant closures. The plants in the UK look particularly vulnerable because of flexible labour markets and uncertainty over Brexit," he said. "So the government I think at some point will have to cut a deal with Peugeot, as it did with Nissan, over things like skills, innovation, rebuilding the supply chain. "And basically, what Nissan got, whatever it was, every other car producer in the UK will be looking for as well."	Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed to meet the head of France's PSA Group to discuss its planned takeover of Vauxhall in the UK.
The train firm said it would refund the difference in cost between mainline and high speed fares - to compensate for the loss of direct high speed trains. Southeastern will also give season ticket-holders from five stations a backdated 20% refund on mainline fares. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke, said the line still needed repairing quickly. He said it had been a difficult time for rail users and it was right passengers should be compensated after the problems were caused when cracks appeared in the sea wall. Mr Elphicke said an emergency peak-time high-speed rail service between Dover and St Pancras to help commuters had made a difference. "We now need Network Rail to confirm how long it will take to repair the sea wall," he said. Steve Kilby, from Network Rail, said the team was working hard to get a final design in place for repairs. But, he said: "This week has been very stormy on the beach and our guys have been working through tough conditions." He said 15,000 tonnes of rock had been placed on the shingle to protect the railway from heavy seas and eventually more than 70,000 tonnes would be in place. The stations where passengers will be compensated are Sandwich, Deal, Walmer, Martin Mill and Dover Priory. Compensation claim forms are available for people at the station.	Passengers affected by the collapse of a railway line during storms in Dover are to be compensated, rail operator Southeastern has said.
The FBI has ordered Apple to disable the security software on a dead murderer's iPhone but the tech giant has refused. Mark Zuckerberg said he did not believe the authorities should have backdoors to bypass encryption protection. However, a lawyer representing some of the gunman's victims has backed the federal bureau. Stephen Larson, a former judge, said he intended to file legal paperwork next month telling Apple to co-operate. "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," he added. He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee. Mr Zuckerberg made his comments at the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona. "I don't think that requiring back doors to encryption is either going to be an effective thing to increase security or is really the right thing to do," he said. "We are pretty sympathetic to Tim [Cook] and Apple." He added that Facebook was committed to doing all it could to prevent terrorism but his company was in favour of encryption. The social network had previously issued a statement saying that the court order could create a "chilling precedent". Leaders at Google and Twitter also voiced support for Apple last week. Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in California last December. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has described the FBI's order as "dangerous" and "unprecedented". He has said the firm would have to build a new operating system in order to comply. "We strongly believe the only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn't abused and doesn't fall into the wrong hands is to never create it," the firm stated in a Q&A on the Apple website. In a statement published on Sunday, the FBI Director James Comey said the demand was "about the victims and justice". "We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly," the FBI director wrote. "That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land. "Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn't. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead." Last week anti-virus creator John McAfee offered to unlock the iPhone for the FBI. "It will take us three weeks," he told Business Insider, adding that he would eat his shoe on television if his team failed.	Facebook's chief executive has said he is sympathetic to Apple's position in its clash with the FBI.
Archaeologists are racing against changing tides to record and excavate the find in peat at Borth, which gives a snapshot of a time when the shore lay further west. The team believes the footprints could be 3,000 to 4,000 years old. Staff and students from the University of Wales Trinity St David are carrying out the work. As well as the footprints, a line of post holes has been found, which could have been a causeway. They lie across an area that would have been salt marsh when the footprints were made. The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments is providing survey support, mapping the extent of the peat and other exposed features. Submerged forests have been found further north on the beach and nearby in the past. Dr Martin Bates is one of the archaeologists leading the excavation team, and it was his father, retired geologist Denis Bates, who discovered the footprints last month. Dr Bates told BBC Wales' news website: "My father has had an interest in submerged forests for many years. "He was down in February as this part of the beach was very clear. "For various reasons the patterns of sand movement have been temporarily altered and it means this area of beach has been stripped of sand. "He noticed the marks and told me they didn't look natural." He estimates they have a window of a few months to log the discoveries and take samples away for environmental testing before the sands shift again and cover the footprints up. "In the context of Ceredigion and west Wales, it's the first time we have found this type of evidence. "The submerged forests [nearby] are probably the most significant in the UK. "What we have never had before is documented evidence of human habitation." 'Quite special' Dr Bates added that there were a range of footprints discovered, including cattle, sheep or goat and possibly a bear. However the one which resonates with him is a print which belonged to a young child. "We have got a footprint of a four-year-old's foot where we can see the toes and everything. "I can stand where this child was standing about 4,000 years ago and even though we would have been seeing different things, the intimacy of that is quite special." Work in previous years on submerged forests found on the area to the north has established that a forest was growing in the area between 3000 and 2500 BC. The area was gradually waterlogged with peat growth. A number of finds in the area included a Mesolithic composite tool of antler, two flints, an auroch (extinct ox) skeleton and a piece of antler.	Human and animal fossilised footprints that may be from the Bronze Age have been exposed on a Ceredigion beach.
Aged 19, Jack Evans is working in one of the country's oldest and most nostalgic industries - the steam railway. "It's always different, the weather's always different, you're always on with different people," he said. "I'm interested in engineering, I'm studying engineering at university at the moment and being here, it just ticks all the boxes for what I want to do later on." He works alongside Jac Smith, who recently passed his steam engine driving test on his 21st birthday - making him one of the youngest in the job in the UK. Although the Vale of Rheidol line no longer carries lead ore from the mines, as it did between 1902 and the 1930s, it does carry tourists from the seaside town of Aberystwyth to nearby Devil's Bridge. Its workshop, near Aberystwyth railway station, restores locomotives for museums and railways across the UK - and has recently been commissioned to create new wheels for the town's cliff railway which takes visitors up Constitution Hill. "These are the sort of things you can't learn in college, you have to learn on the job," Will Smith, operations and safety officer, said. "So you'll find the railway itself is operated by quite a young staff, so it bucks the trend for the tourist railways and safeguards it for the next generation. "It's an interesting place to work, no two days are the same. You get to meet thousands of interesting visitors and everybody's here to have a good day out." Mr Smith said since 1902 the railway, which has always included a passenger service, had only stopped operating once - during World War Two. "Pretty much everything in the country shut down," he said. "As part of the war effort it stopped operation, but I'm told the day the war ended they steamed the engine up and blew the whistle all the way down the line. "Someone said that was their first memory of the railway." Simon Cowan, carriage and locomotive painter, is trained as a fireman and a driver. "The main thing is to make things from scratch, to replace items which are no longer made," he said. "So we copy them faithfully and make them all in the old fashioned way and then I pass these skills on to other people, it's a bit like a big museum. "It's the older people, I'm one of them, who have grown up in that specialist knowledge, that area, passing those skills on - because I will get to the point where I can't do this any more. "I show people how to paint, it's a lovely way of seeing people develop, so when I go on holiday I'm not thinking 'gosh what are they doing to my paint shop'. "We also put them out on the trains as firemen and guards, and we teach them as much as we can. "Carriages are painted with 24 carat gold leaf and they go 'wow that must be so expensive', well no it's so wafer thin. "We show them how to make a tracing of a word and get the typeface correct and show them how to apply the lettering on to a piece of wood, and then we'll use this varnish and paint that on to there, and when the varnish is sticky put the gold leaf on and peel it off and 'wow, that's great'. "Then I'll say 'give us your thumb' and put a bit of varnish on, just let that dry, and gold leaf their thumb and they think it's hilarious - but then they've learnt how to do it. It's really fun." Mr Cowan added because the carriages dated back to the 1920s and 30s, work had been going into improving disability access - with a new platform planned. And a great deal of work has to go into maintaining the locomotives and the 12 miles of track. Mr Smith said: "With steam railways, the equipment we use is very bespoke. "You can't get the parts off the shelf, so you make them yourself... it's very specialist and it's good to keep the skills in the local area. "The last few years we've built a really renowned workshop and that allows us not only to do our own work but also take on work for other businesses, other railways." He added: "In the far end of the workshop there's a cattle van which is coming together which was supplied new to us in the 1920s. "There were stories of livestock going up to Devil's Bridge in wagons, so they decided to build two cattle vans but unfortunately it was a bit too late for the demand - most livestock was going by road by then. "So they became redundant and the vehicle went to another railway and more recently it's come back to us and our job is to restore it back to how it would have been."	"When I tell people I'm a fireman, they think I put out fires and I've got to tell them I make them instead!"
The owner was forced to open the crocodile farm's gates on Sunday to prevent a storm surge, the local Beeld newspaper says. Many of the crocodiles have been recaptured, but more than half are still on the loose, it says. The floods have killed at least 10 people in Limpopo province. The crocodiles escaped from the Rakwena Crocodile Farm, a tourist site about 15km (nine miles) from the small town of Pontdrif, which borders Botswana. Zane Langman, the son-in-law of the farm's owner, told the newspaper that many of the crocodiles had escaped into dense bush and the Limpopo River, the second biggest in South Africa. "There used to be only a few crocodiles in the Limpopo River. Now there are a lot. We go to catch them as soon as farmers call us to inform us about crocodiles," said Mr Langman. "I heard there were crocodiles in Musina [about 120km away] on the school's rugby field." Mr Langman said he went to rescue friends in a flooded house in the area by boat on Sunday. "When we reached them, the crocodiles were swimming around them. Praise the Lord, they were all alive," he is quoted as saying. The South African Air Force is being used to rescue people affected by the flooding in remote settlements, some of which are cut off from the outside world. The floods have also affected neighbouring Mozambique, where tens of  thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes.	About 15,000 crocodiles have reportedly escaped from a farm in South Africa's far north amid heavy rains and flooding.
Englishwoman Evans, 29, is a 10-time ladies' champion. Doherty, 45, won the tournament in 1997, but the world number 43 has not reached the third round since 2006. The winner must make it through two more qualifying rounds to reach the main draw, which starts on 18 April. The tournament has increased this year from 128 to 144 players. The top 16 seeds automatically qualify for the first round, with all non-seeded players starting in the first of three qualifying rounds which run from 8-15 April. Evans received an invitation to the qualifying draw from snooker's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA). Six-time world champion Steve Davis is also attempting to qualify. He faces Jamie Cope in the first round of qualifying. Jimmy White, six times a runner-up at the Crucible, meets Thailand's James Wattana, while 2006 world champion Graeme Dott has been drawn against Mark Owens. Defending champion Mark Selby is the top seed, with five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan seeded second - the two met in last year's final.	Reanne Evans will face former world champion Ken Doherty in the first round of qualifying as she bids to become the first woman to appear in the main stages of the World Championship.
Blair Turgott got on the end of a good passing move to secure victory in the dying minutes at Grange Lane. The Villagers' problem this season has not been creating chances but taking them, as when Steve Brogan curled in a shot from long range that clipped the bar. After the break, Reece Thompson eventually put the home side ahead with a great finish from Kyle Wootton's cross. However, Bromley substitute George Porter equalised swiftly from close range with his first touch of the match. Turgott's late winner left the bottom club quizzical about when their wretched luck will turn. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, North Ferriby United 1, Bromley 2.

The search giant's all-important advertising revenue was also up 11%, to $16bn. In a statement Google's finance chief Ruth Porat highlighted ad growth on mobile and YouTube. Google's shares jumped 7.5% in after-market trading as traders welcomed the better-than-expected results. The share price had already risen 3.5% during normal trading hours. Advertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of their ads. "Cost per click", or the average price of online ads, fell in the quarter, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes. Google's ad revenue has been under pressure as consumers access its services on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, whose advertising rates tend to be lower. Google's share price rise "is reflecting the fact that they've effectively just beat earnings for the first time in several quarters," said Victor Anthony, an analyst at Axiom Capital.	Google's net income rose 17% to $3.93bn in the three months to June from the quarter last year, boosted by an 11% rise in revenues to $17.7bn.
The Care Inspectorate and Healthcare Improvement Scotland looked at services provided by NHS Western Isles and local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. The watchdogs said there were "weaknesses" and "crucial areas for improvement" in the services. They acknowledged that care provision was "performing well in some aspects". The comhairle and health board provide the services as a partnership. A new report on the inspection carried out in April and June last year includes 12 recommendations for improvements. The inspectors said in the report that too many older people were subject to delayed discharge from hospital, and were having to wait too long for care-at-home support or a care home placement. They also identified "very limited" development of intermediate care services and said there was a need for "timely diagnosis" of dementia. Inspectors also flagged up where the health board and council have been working well. Front line health and social work staff were "well motivated and worked well together", said the report. There was also a "strong sense of community spirit" among staff and patients. Karen Reid, chief executive of the Care Inspectorate, said: "This report has highlighted important weaknesses in services provided for older people across the Western Isles, and we have clearly laid out our recommendations as to how these should be addressed. "In particular, effective and consistent leadership is needed to ensure that services deliver better outcomes for older people who access them, and for their families and carers. "We require significant improvement to ensure high-quality care is provided to older people in a way which reflects their needs and promotes their rights. "The Care Inspectorate will now work with Healthcare Improvement Scotland and the Scottish government's chief social work adviser to directly support improvement in the partnership." Robbie Pearson, acting chief executive of Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: "In this joint inspection we found that most of the older people and carers that we met were generally happy with the services provided to them in the Western Isles. "They felt that the services contributed to better outcomes in respect of their health and wellbeing. We also saw good examples of older people being supported to remain in their own homes. "However, we found a number of important weaknesses that need to be addressed. A significant proportion of older people were subject to delayed discharges from hospital - this issue was raised in a previous inspection for the care of older people by Healthcare Improvement Scotland." He added: "We are confident that the recommendations set out in this report will result in significant improvements in the care that older people receive."	A joint inspection of the delivery of services for older people in the Western Isles has identified the need for improvement.
The fire raged across the city from 2 to 5 September 1666, destroying more than 13,000 houses and 87 churches. The stamps are designed by comic book artist John Higgins, who has used a graphic novel style of illustration. They feature scenes from the start, spread and aftermath of the Great Fire, using a street map design. Higgins has contributed to titles such as Judge Dredd and 2000 AD. Philip Parker, from Royal Mail, said: "Despite the terrible devastation caused by the Great Fire, it provided the opportunity for the regeneration of large swathes of the city and shaped the London we know today. "It was the catalyst of the building of iconic landmarks such as St Paul's Cathedral and dozens of parish churches. "It is fitting that we mark the anniversary of the fire with an innovative set of stamps that re-imagine the events."	The 350th anniversary of the Great Fire of London is being commemorated with a set of six new stamps.
Andreu was denied from the spot by a brilliant save from Raith keeper Kevin Cuthbert 15 minutes from time. United were reduced to ten men when former Rovers defender Lewis Toshney was sent off in 55 minutes after collecting a second yellow card. Rudi Skacel struck the bar for Raith but neither side could find the net. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon is desperate to add more of a goal threat to his team and Dutch trialist striker Felitciano Zschusschen watched from the stands. The Tangerines struggled to make clear cut chances but with 15 minutes to go Scott Fraser went down in the box as he tried to go between Jean Yves M'Voto and Kyle Benedictus. Cuthbert produced an impressive save to deny Norwich City's on-loan striker Andreu to ensure the points were shared. Raith Rovers manager Gary Locke: "It was a great save from Kevin but he shouldn't have had to make it. It was a poor decision. "I'm not one that likes to go about these things as the referees have got a hard job and it's not something I want to talk about too much but it was a soft, soft decision. "It was great that he saved it though as we wouldn't have deserved to get beat in that game." Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I'm so proud of the players today as I thought we were the better team for the entire 90 minutes and even when we were down to ten men we were excellent. "We created a few chances but there will be twists and turns in this league all season and we have lots of positives to take forward. "To get a point against a tough team like Raith with just ten men was absolutely outstanding and if you had said to us three months ago we would be up at the top of the league we would have taken that."

"The decision has dealt the final blow to democracy in the country," said the Organisation of American States. The court ruled that the assembly was in contempt and said it would exercise congressional functions. The charge stems from alleged electoral irregularities by three opposition lawmakers in elections in 2015. The head of the OAS Luis Almagro accused President Nicolas Maduro's government of carrying out what he described as a coup against itself. Brazil's foreign ministry said the court's decision violated the country's separation of powers. Several other Latin American countries expressed concern too. Peru recalled its ambassador to Caracas, saying there had been a rupture of democracy. The United States also condemned Venezuela's government. "This rupture of democratic and constitutional norms greatly damages Venezuela's democratic institutions," said a State Department spokesman, Mark Toner. Venezuela's opposition had earlier said President Maduro was becoming a dictator. Venezuela's foreign ministry accused critics of the government of forming a right-wing regional pact against President Maduro. He says the OAS is a pawn of US "imperialism".	There has been growing criticism of Venezuela's government after the Supreme Court took over legislative powers from the National Assembly.
Media playback is not supported on this device And this isn't a sentence from the early 1980s. At Swansea there's a new Toshack in town these days. Cameron, son of former boss John, helps coach an under-23 side having an impressive season. On Tuesday night they played in the quarter finals of the Checkatrade Trophy but were beaten on penalties by Coventry City. The Checkatrade Trophy is tournament much-maligned this season, but Swansea's youngsters beat three league sides to get so far and were the only Premier League academy side to reach the quarter finals. But there are still three sides they could win this season and Cameron hopes it's just the start of another successful Toshack career. "The next step for me would be to work in a first team environment," he told BBC Wales Sport. "Hopefully that's not too far away." Few can claim to have had the same success at home and abroad as John Toshack. His managerial CV includes Swansea, Wales, Real Madrid and even a league title in Morocco last year. Toshack Jr worked alongside his father when he coached in Macedonia five years ago, but now he's ready to make his own reputation. "It can be a help and a hindrance (being John Toshack's son)," he admits. "Obviously I'm very proud of what my father has achieved over the years. He's one of the most successful British managers ever. "It's great for me to have that experience on the end of a phone. I speak to him regularly and he watches the progress of our team. "But I'm not looking to emulate or be somebody else. I'm Cameron Toshack and I'm my own man." Aside from the name, there aren't too many similarities. Toshack Senior was a disciplinarian who didn't suffer fools. In his own words, his son is much more analytical. "He's a learned type - a little bit too much for me," he jokes. "All this analysis that goes into the game is now is a bit beyond me. But he's very, very conscientious and always looking to learn. "Hopefully the Swans will get the benefit of it." Of course transferring success with a youth team to success as a head coach is easier said than done. But Cameron Toshack only has to look at Swansea's new head coach for inspiration. Paul Clement started his career as a coach in Chelsea's academy, before his promotion to assistant manager under Carlo Ancelotti. Toshack is working towards his Pro Licence and is the first person at Swansea to complete the Premier League's Elite Coach Apprenticeship Scheme. He feels he's almost ready to make the step up. "Without getting ahead of myself, I'd like to eventually be in and around the first team here - and if it's not here maybe at another club somewhere in Europe," he says. "I'd like to follow in my father's footsteps in that respect. I'm not averse to moving to other countries to learn my trade and be a success."	Toshack's Swansea side have won 16 out of their last 19 and are top of their division with a chance in the cup.
HS2 Action Alliance says a paper by HS2 Ltd shows engineering work will mean closing parts of some passenger lines for 133 weekends, and some freight lines for 50 weekends. It would also mean 19 weekend closures at Euston station, the group said. HS2 said any closures would be carefully planned. On the Derby to Birmingham lines for example, the document says 32 weekends will be hit between 2017 and 2022, 13 of them for just a day and 19 for the entire weekend.  The CrossCountry rail firm and freight services would both be affected. For the Coventry to Leamington Spa route, it says four whole weekends will be lost in 2018, with passengers asked to catch a replacement bus instead. Part of the busy West Coast Mainline will close for 31 weekends in 2018-19, as they build a new flyover junction in the Handsacre area, with trains diverted via Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Richard Houghton from HS2 Action Alliance said: "It is clear that once again HS2 is being less than honest with the travelling public. It is planning a huge number of weekend closures which will impact the travelling public. "Combined with this its arrogance continues. It is planning to issue Â£7bn of supplier contracts before the Hybrid Bill passes through Parliament and now we discover it will start closing Euston before they have the legal go-ahead for the new line." The document does say that the number and length of the closures are just estimates at the moment, and that work will be tied in with everyday engineering projects wherever possible, to minimise disruption. But it does warn that "HS2 phase one will need to recognise the cumulative effect on passengers and operators of disruption". Train operators could also be compensated for the impact on their services. HS2 Ltd spokesman David Meechan said: "Our railways are becoming increasingly crowded.  Britain desperately needs this new high speed rail network to boost rail capacity and improve links between our biggest cities. "There will be times when construction impacts on the current railway, but this will be carefully planned with Network Rail and the train operators. "HS2 Ltd will do all it can to minimise disruption to passengers.  Compensation to the train operators for any such disruption will be drawn from the existing budget for the HS2 project." Two years ago a government commissioned report said that the alternative to building HS2, basically beefing up what is already there, would cause 14 years worth of weekend problems across the network.	Building the proposed new High Speed Two (HS2) rail line will mean years of weekend "misery" for rail passengers, according to a campaign group.
Craig Nelson, who was also known as Craig Preston, was found at the Woodhead Tunnels off the A628 in Derbyshire at 11:00 BST on Monday. A post-mortem found the 34-year-old from Wath-Upon-Dearn in Rotherham died as a result of head injuries. A man, 41, and a woman, 23, were arrested in Sheffield by South Yorkshire Police and remain in custody.	Police have arrested two people on suspicion of murder after a man's body was found on moorland.

Work was due to begin this week on demolishing Prestatyn Community Hospital which closed two years ago. But now National Resources Wales has ruled that because seagulls are nesting on the roof, the demolition must be put on hold until the chicks have  flown. Developers Pure Residential and Commercial have bought the site and lodged plans for apartments and houses.	Seagulls have come to the aid of campaigners fighting to save a former hospital from immediate demolition.
Premier had suspended its shares on 13 January after agreeing to buy E.On's North Sea assets for a net $120m (Â£84m) plus working capital adjustments. The deal was amended during the suspension so that it no longer constituted a reverse takeover. By close of trading, Premier's share price was up by nearly 90% to 36p. London-based Premier said the cost of the deal would now come to $135m, including completion adjustments. Premier added that this was a result of an increase of the dividend paid to E.On before completion of the deal. In a statement, it said: "On the basis of this lower aggregate consideration, the acquisition has been classified as a Class 1 transaction." The proposed acquisition is still subject to approval by Premier's shareholders and lenders. The assets Premier is buying are located in the Central North Sea, West of Shetlands and the Southern Gas Basin. E.On's UK oil and gas upstream portfolio includes stakes in 40 licenses, including a 5.2% interest in the Elgin-Franklin field, a 47% interest in the Babbage field and a 50% stake in the Tolmount discovery. The deal will add about 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to Premier's production totals in 2016, according to the company.	Premier Oil's shares nearly doubled in value on Monday after trading was restarted following a suspension triggered by a major North Sea deal.
He had an initial spell with the Vikings between 2008 and 2013 and was named one of its 50 greatest players. Defensive end Allen, 34, last played for the Carolina Panthers in 2015 and also had spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago Bears. "We are proud to have Jared retire as a member of the Vikings franchise," said Vikings owner Zygi Wilf.	Jared Allen will retire as a Minnesota Vikings player after he signed a one-day deal with the NFL team on Thursday.
Old hands at the book club game are husband and wife team Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan and Oprah. Their clubs began on TV but the new breed has, from the off, been virtual - online and on apps. And the main players are almost exclusively female, including Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Florence Welch, Zoella and Sarah Jessica Parker, as are the clubs' members. It would be easy to be cynical about this new trend but it has its merits, says Claire Armitstead, associate editor for culture at the Guardian. "These celebrities want to show they are intelligent people and not just celebrities, that's perhaps their motive for it. "But what they bring is their brand. There are so many books in the world that any kind of 'sorting hat', to use a Harry Potter term, is a good thing for reading." Debut writer Caz Frear knows the benefit of star endorsement. This week she sees her first novel, crime thriller Sweet Little Lies, hit the shelves after winning Richard and Judy's second Search for a Bestseller competition.  She says it was the couple's name that encouraged her to enter. "It was the possibility of their validation, they are huge names in the literary world. You think, if they like it then I must have something. There were other competitions that weren't small fry but I wanted to put myself in the strongest position." The Richard and Judy club has grown into a polished brand  in collaboration with high-street chain WH Smith since starting on the couple's Channel 4 chat show in the early 2000s. Now only online (and in stores), it is more successful, says Madeley. "I knew it would be fine, we are a brand and, in fact, we're selling more books than before... the internet is king. Books are submitted for consideration by publishers, which inevitably leads to recurring well-known names. But the final selections - issued three times a year - are made on quality alone, says Madelely. "We choose a lot of established names, yes, but it's entirely on merit. We love finding new talent like Caz... you need fresh blood all the time... books are the stuff of life." If he and Finnigan keep an eye on the new celebrity clubs, it's from an interested, not competitive, stance. "We're all out there to get people reading," says Madeley. A recent survey by The Reading Agency showed two thirds of people would like to read more but are too busy. Yet, the agency's chief executive supports Armitstead's "sorting hat" theory: "Most people also said they struggled to find a book they liked. Recommendations are the most likely thing to convince people to read more literature... however they are signposted to books, it can only be a good thing," says Sue Wilkinson. Harry Potter star Emma Watson points her followers towards powerful feminist literature through her club Our Shared Shelf (OSS) on the Good Reads website. She is also active on Instagram. Watson launched OSS in 2016 following her appointment as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and her HeForShe speech. Every two months she selects a book for her 193,000-plus members to absorb and discuss. Selections have included Gloria Steinem's My Life on the Road and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale - now enjoying renewed interest possibly due to a heady combination of a Channel 4 dramatisation, Watson's endorsement and the topicality of its issues. Watson's enterprise is clearly serious and she's left books for others to find on the London and New York undergrounds. "Emma Watson with her feminist classics is placing herself as a young thinking woman but doing it through her position as a UN ambassador is quite structured," says Armitstead. "Similarly, if someone wants to project themselves as a fun person they are going to choose fun books. "Emma Watson will have people advising her, probably in order to push the kind of books the organisation thinks people should be reading. "It is a good thing for a woman to read Gloria Steinem but has Emma Watson?" Relaxed and seemingly without agenda is Florence Welch's Between Two Books on Twitter.  Her fan website also promotes the club. It was established by Welch enthusiasts in dedication of her love of reading, demonstrated in her regular online posts about books. She got involved at their invitation. Welch suggests a wide range of literature, from Eimear McBride's The Lesser Bohemian to the poetry of Ted Hughes. She also involves her music mates, so that Nick Cave and Bat for Lashes have flagged up choices. Welch dips in and out of the 11,000-plus members' discussions and even offers the chance to meet her, authors and each other at book events such as the Borris Festival. Unlike some other clubs which are more inclined towards just showcasing the star's reading, Watson and Welch's are clubs in the traditional sense. They allow like-minded people "to get together" (literally in Welch's case) and talk. And the fans love it. "The club (Between Two Books) is for fans and managed by fans, ordinary, lovely and like-minded people," says one ardent fan, Kawanna Pena Cepeda, from the Dominican Republic. "It makes it more approachable and grounded. It doesn't have any 'agenda'... other than share amazing literature that our queen, Florence, loves. "It's an amazing way to connect with other Flo fans other than by her music. It's exciting to think the book you are currently reading, Florence is reading as well... it feels like we are connected." Similarly, Maritza Jimenez in Chicago, Illinois says she joined OSS "because I really admire Emma Watson". "To have that instant connection (however small) feels really good. Then, I put some serious thought into what she's trying to do... open up a discussion on women's issues... it's a complex topic to tackle because it is a very human issue." Authors and the book industry are also reaping benefits from this endorsement. "Steinem's My Life on the Road, Emma Watson's first title, had a 200% boost week on week in the UK for the second week of January 2016, from 138 copies to 415," says Lisa Campbell of the Bookseller. And a true powerhouse in driving author interest, and sales is Reese Witherspoon.  The actress has become "a champion of female fiction writers", says Isabelle Broom, book reviews editor at Heat magazine. Her book club is on Instagram, with 71,000-plus followers. She also talks books on Twitter. And, she has an eye for a story which is prime for movie adaptation and is quick to buy the rights through her production company, such as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. Broom describes the actress as a "positive force of good" and authors are effusive too, among them Jessica Knoll, writer of Luckiest Girl Alive. "[Witherspoon's] support has immensely boosted Luckiest Girl Alive's visibility and sales," says Knoll. "It was featured in a lot of traditional media and that definitely had a cumulative impact, but when Reese featured my book... I noticed an immediate and enormous uptick in my Amazon ranking. The Zoella Book Club, also supported by WH Smith and just relaunched for 2017, has also had industry impact - and on teenage girls. With a recent National Literacy Trust study suggesting reading for pleasure falls after primary school years, the club helmed by 27-year-old Zoe Sugg - the fashion and beauty YouTube vlogger known as Zoella - is arguably a good thing. Author Alex Bell's Frozen Charlotte was chosen for Zoella's 2016 crop of reads and she says "it meant the book was able to reach a much wider audience than it would otherwise". "Zoella's book club is particularly worthwhile because it helps get teenagers excited about books and reading for pleasure, which is a wonderful thing," she adds. Zoella and the other female star book-clubbers demonstrate the trend for reading groups in the real world to be mostly (90%) made up of women, according to Sue Wilkinson at the Reading Agency. Heat's Isabelle Broom suggests this is because "women like to feel part of something, and lots of us like to feel validated, too... Plus, us girls LOVE to chat". But, while the reason needs further investigation, says Wilkinson, what is clear is that "real" book clubs - in libraries, homes and pubs - are still a big deal, and the agency has more than 4,000 in its reading groups network. And what of the future of the virtual celebrity club? "They have a shelf-life and people like Emma Watson will get bored and start looking for the next new thing," says Claire Armitstead. "But someone else will come along. There's no end of people who want to hitch their wagon to the star of reading." Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

The Commons Public Accounts Committee said whistleblowers had often been subjected to bullying and harassment. Its report called for whistleblowers to be offered legal and counselling help and for "swift sanctions" to be imposed on staff who victimised them. The government said it was acting to ensure people felt free to speak out. The report highlighted the "important" role whistleblowers had played in uncovering details about the Hillsborough disaster and the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust scandal. The committee said whistleblowing was a "crucial source of intelligence to help government identify wrongdoing". However, it found there had been a "startling disconnect" between policies encouraging whistleblowers in theory and what happened in practice. The report said it had "heard of too many cases of appalling treatment of whistleblowers by their colleagues". Officials who tried to raise concerns often had to show "remarkable courage" in coming forward. The report highlighted whistleblowing in relation to the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989, where 96 Liverpool fans at an FA Cup semi-final lost their lives. Prime Minister David Cameron later apologised for the "double injustice" of the disaster, after an independent report published in 2012 showed police and emergency services had attempted to deflect the blame. It also highlighted the Mid Staffordshire NHS scandal, where staff at Stafford Hospital had blown the whistle on "appalling care" between 2005 and 2008. The committee heard from Kay Sheldon, a member of the board of the Care Quality Commission who, the report said, had been "victimised" by senior officials after she tried to raise concerns about the way it had been operating. The report said no-one had faced any form of sanction over her treatment. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the public accounts committee, said whistleblowing was "crucial" and must be taken seriously by all chief executives of major companies and public sector organisations. She said protection for whistleblowers was still not adequate, citing the example of Osita Mba - a former lawyer at Revenue and Customs who drew attention to what he claimed were "sweetheart deals" between the tax authorities and Goldman Sachs. She said Mr Mba was a "really brave guy" but it had become "impossible for him" to remain with the organisation after his disclosures and he had had "to start his life again elsewhere". "The way you support whistleblowers is hugely important," she added. "I think it is really important that there are proper sanctions in place in an organisation so if someone does blow the whistle, they are properly supported and if anyone dares bully or harass them, they are not only reprimanded but punished." Legal protections for whistleblowers The 1998 Public Disclosure Act protects workers who disclose information about potential criminal behaviour and other malpractice at their workplace, or former workplace, provided certain conditions are met. Depending on the nature of information disclosed and who it is confided to, a whistleblower is legally protected from suffering from any detriment as a result. If these conditions are not met, a disclosure may constitute a breach of the worker's duty of confidence to his employer. The laws apply to direct employees and agency workers but not those working for the security services, and campaign group Public Concern at Work says other individuals - such as volunteers and interns - are also excluded. The law was amended last year to include a specific public interest test, whereby whistleblowers have to "reasonably believe" that their actions are in the public interest to be protected. Workers who raise concerns about bullying and harassment by work colleagues are also protected. Colleagues who victimise them are personally liable for their actions while their employers are  "vicariously liable". The Taxpayers' Alliance said the report suggested there was a "culture of secrecy" in much of the public sector and whistleblowing must be encouraged. "Though the practice often asks tough questions, it is a crucial tool to increase the accountability of those in charge and to ensure our public services work as well as possible for the people who need them," the campaign group's chief executive Jonathan Isaby said. A government spokeswoman said: "All civil servants must be able to raise concerns so that poor services and inefficient operations can be identified and acted upon. "That is why this government is ensuring people feel free to speak out. Awareness of how to raise a complaint has risen by 20% and two-thirds of civil servants feel that any complaint will be investigated properly. "In addition, we are ensuring that all departments have a clear whistleblowing policy." Labour said whistleblowing had led, in many cases, to major changes in policy. "There must be a clear standardised policy for handling whistleblowers working across all of our public services to ensure that there are no disparities in how people are dealt with, and that staff are protected from being victimised." said shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher.	The treatment of employees in public services who have raised concerns about wrongdoing has often been "shocking", a group of MPs has said.
Nine families have been resettled in Aberdeenshire in the past few weeks. Faith groups and the North East Scotland Credit Union (Nescu) have set up an account to allow people to donate money for essential items. Rev Stella Campbell, of Skene Parish Church, said: "We wanted to do what we can to help them settle in to their new life here in Scotland." The fund will be managed by representatives of the Church of Scotland, Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre (AMIC), and the Aberdeenshire Partner Refugee Group. More details are available via info@nescu.co.uk	An appeal to raise money for Syrian refugees who have arrived in the north east of Scotland has been launched.
Sanchez, 40, signed a contract extension in January to remain in charge until the end of next season. However, Deportivo won just two of their last 22 league games and were beaten 8-0 at home by Barcelona on 20 April as they finished 15th. Former Spain and Real Madrid midfielder Sanchez was in charge of Deportivo for 13 months.	Deportivo La Coruna have sacked boss Victor Sanchez after a disappointing end to their season in La Liga.
Barry Gray's side have taken maximum points from their last four matches, scoring 12 goals and conceding none. In the night's other two league games, Glenavon host Glentoran and Portadown travel to Ballinamallard United. Carrick Rangers play Amateur League side Crumlin Star in a rearranged Irish Cup sixth round tie at Seaview. The winners will have home advantage against Crusaders in the quarter-finals of the competition. "We are just glad to have regular games. There has been so much 'is it going to be on, is it not going to be on' since we have had the problems with the pitch at Taylor's Avenue," said Carrick manager Gary Haveron. Warrenpoint now lie just one point behind fellow strugglers Ballinamallard, Dungannon and Carrick at the foot of the table thanks to a seven-match unbeaten league run which stretches back two months. "We are in a position now where nobody wants to sit out games. All the players are eager to get started again so everyone will be ready to go on Monday night," said 'Point boss Barry Gray. "The players we brought in during January have brought a freshness to the changing room and competition for places. "They have brought quality too and the players around them have stepped up to the mark. "Whether it's enough given our poor start to the season, we'll have to wait a couple of months to find out." Glentoran will be out to avenge a 4-1 sixth round Irish Cup defeat by Glentoran at the Oval when the sides meet again at Mourneview Park. The Lurgan Blues must plan without striker Eoin Bradley, who was sent-off in the 1-1 draw with leaders Crusaders on Friday night. Portadown central defender Ken Oman is suspended for his side's trip to Ferney Park after being dismissed in the victory over Linfield but Ronnie McFall's side should have Garry Breen and Sean Mackle available again. Ports assistant manager Kieran Harding has hailed the impact made by ex-Linfield and Derry City midfielder Philip Lowry since his recent arrival at Shamrock Park. "Philip has outstanding energy and he covers the ground. If we had him from the start of the season, we may not be in the position we are in," argued Harding, whose side have moved up to seventh in the standings. Mallards boss Whitey Anderson lamented his team's performance in a 3-0 loss to Warrenpoint on Friday and has made clear that he expects more from his players. "You can try to play all the good football you want, but unless you can display heart and desire it counts for nothing. That's what I want to see," said Anderson.

A 12-week consultation on the scheme, worth up to £1,200 a child, has begun. Families with two working parents could be able to claim, and ministers said carers who look after disabled relatives and others would be included. Chancellor George Osborne said stay-at-home mothers, who had made a "lifestyle choice", would not be eligible. The government says the overall scheme - set to replace the existing system of employer-supported childcare vouchers - will help 2.5 million families. It is aimed at getting more people back into jobs. The UK has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, with many people with two or more children saying it does not make financial sense for both parents to work. The new system is expected be phased in from autumn 2015, with children under five helped in the first year. It will then build up over time to include all children under the age of 12. Families with two working parents on less than £150,000 each would be able to claim up to £1,200 a year per child. Critics have said the focus on work will penalise parents who stay at home to look after their children, or are unable to work because they act as full-time "carers" for other adults. However, extra details released by the government on Monday make it clear that parents who do not work because they are carers will also be eligible. Carers are defined as those spending at least 35 hours a week looking after someone such as a disabled relative. But the scheme will not be extended to those who stay at home to bring up their children. Lisa Frederiksen, from Epsom, Surrey, was "staggered" by childcare costs for her children Casper, four, and Elizabeth, two. She said: "As a career-orientated woman, when I had my first child at the age of 40 I was staggered at the cost of childcare. "My employer would not agree to a part-time role, so I was faced with childcare costs of £1,200 per month. "After my second child, it became  apparent that working was not going to pay. With two lots of childcare and the costs of commuting, it just wasn't worth working. "My Danish husband's family cannot comprehend the cost of childcare here. They pay £300 a month for care in well-equipped, carefully staffed nurseries. "This new scheme is a drop in the ocean, but we need a radical rethink." Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: "This is help for formal childcare. Obviously it's not for stay-at-home mothers. "I have huge regard for mothers who want to stay at home and look after their children. That's their lifestyle choice. I want to help those families too. I'm not trying to be exclusive. "We have a proposal on married couples' tax breaks which I'm going to introduce in the Autumn Statement later this year... that will help stay-at-home mothers." Lynne Burnham, secretary of Mothers at Home Matter, called for a "level playing field" for all families, with the introduction of a "family allowance" for all households with children under the age of 16. She added: "It should not be for this government to dictate how a family chooses to care for its children." Under the proposal, parents will be required to open an online voucher account with a voucher provider and have their payments topped up by the government. For every 80p families pay in, the government will put in 20p, up to the annual limit of £1,200. The vouchers will be valid for any Ofsted-regulated childcare in England and equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Half of the funding for the new scheme will come from the abolition of the previous system of employer-supported childcare vouchers  - which is provided by only about 5% of employers - and in part by funding switched from elsewhere in Whitehall. A separate scheme will provide funding for parents who claim universal credit. It will see the state cover up to 85% of their childcare costs, up from 70% at present. For Labour, shadow children's minister Sharon Hodgson said: "Only David Cameron's government could be so out of touch that they expect families to be grateful for help with childcare in 2015 when they've already seen costs spiralling and support taken away."	The government says it wants to expand a planned childcare tax credit scheme to include parents who stay at home because they are full-time carers.
Daniel Braxton was driving through Towyn, Conwy county, with his 18-year-old daughter at 07:15 BST on Tuesday. She thought she saw a dead baby in the bus stop near the Magpie and Stump pub and screamed at her father to drive back to check, which he did. Mr Braxton, 35, said he saw the lifeless naked baby on the ground, with her umbilical cord still attached. "We blocked the road off and rang the emergency services," he told BBC Radio Wales. "I had a dressing gown in the car and ran to grab that, wrapped the baby up, gave her some good hard rubs on the chest and the head. "She took one big gulp of breath and opened her beautiful little eyes." Mr Braxton, who is originally from Birmingham and living in nearby Pensarn, said they guessed that the baby was less than one hour old. "To be honest, I think the fatherly instinct and the adrenaline kicked in because my daughter was hysterical and my partner was hysterical," he added. "So it was just a case of as soon as I saw her lying there, her naked little body just left on cold concrete, I knew something had to be done." Mr Braxton said police have told him that the baby has "stabilised and is on her way to a full recovery". Police are concerned about the welfare of the baby's mother and have urged her to come forward. Helen Douglas, of North Wales Police, said: "We are concerned about the health of the mother of the baby girl and are appealing for her to come forward. "Alternatively, if anyone knows who the mother is or can provide any information which may assist in identifying her please contact North Wales Police. "We want to ensure that the mother is provided with the medical support she needs."	A man has described how he managed to revive a lifeless newborn baby which was found in a bus shelter.
The original game was postponed on 26 November because of a frozen pitch. The offer from the Latics is for both home and away supporters visiting SportsDirect.com Park. Oldham, who are next to bottom of the table, three points from safety, have just exited a transfer embargo and reappointed John Sheridan as manager. "We want as many supporters to welcome back the manager to the football club as he takes his place on the sidelines for the first time," said a club statement. Supporters are, however, being invited to make a donation to a local charity. Brentford were the first team to offer free entry for a league game in England when they played Peterborough in 2001.	Oldham Athletic have offered free entry to all fans for their rearranged League One fixture against Peterborough United on Tuesday, 24 January.
Simon Cope delivered the package on the last day of the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine, which Wiggins went on to win. The Culture, Media and Sport select committee has been by told by Team Sky chief Sir Dave Brailsford the package contained a legal decongestant. But MPs say they are "concerned" by some of the evidence they have heard. The doctor who received the package on behalf of Wiggins' Team Sky, Dr Richard Freeman, and head of UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) Nicole Sapstead have also been invited to give evidence on 22 February. Culture, Media and Sport select committee chairman Damian Collins MP said: "There is a considerable public interest in Ukad's investigation and it is also important to our inquiry into doping in sport to understand what they have been able to determine from their investigation. "The committee has been told by both British Cycling and Team Sky that they have supplied all the information they have relating to this investigation to Ukad. "However, we need to know if they have received documentary evidence which confirms what was in the package that was delivered by Simon Cope to Team Sky. "Without this evidence, I am concerned about how it is possible for the anti-doping rules to be policed in an appropriate manner, if it is not possible to review the records of medicines prescribed to riders by the team doctors." Team Sky have been under pressure to reveal the contents of the package following a Daily Mail allegation in October 2016. Cope, who was a women's coach for British Cycling, travelled from Manchester to Geneva on 12 June 2011 to hand a parcel to the Team Sky doctor Freeman on the final day of the Criterium. Cope claimed he did not know what it contained. In an interview with Cycling News, he said: "It was just an envelope, a Jiffy bag, a small Jiffy bag," he said. "As far as I know I could have been pedals in there." Brailsford gave evidence in December and stated the package contained Fluimucil, which is legal in sport and "administered on a regular basis".	The British Cycling coach who couriered a 'mystery' package for Sir Bradley Wiggins has been invited by MPs to give evidence at a doping inquiry.
It was supposed to be a moment that rocked the virtual world. Mr Modi, widely acknowledged as one of the world's most influential politicians on social media, enveloped a slightly stunned Mark Zuckerberg in a bear hug. But what was it that really happened in Menlo Park? Why did some people think Mr Modi wasn't acting in India's best digital interests when he hugged Mr Zuckerberg? India with an internet population of 354 million - which has already grown by 17% in the first six months of 2015 - is an obvious target for not only Facebook, but other Silicon Valley giants. And they have all been more than happy to pledge their support for digital India -  a recently launched government initiative  aimed at reinvigorating an $18bn (Â£11.6bn) campaign to strengthen India's digital infrastructure. Google offered to provide 500 railway stations with free WiFi and Microsoft pledged to connect 500,000 Indian villages with cheap broadband access. But this huge show of support and the increased interest in India has caused some concern within the country. "Is Digital India going to only make India a consumer of services offered by global tech companies in lieu of data? Personal data is the currency of the digital world. Are we going to give that away simply to become a giant market for a Facebook or a Google? Look at the way the tech world is skewed. Only China has been able to come up with companies that can take on these MNCs" Prabir Purkayasta, chairman of the Society for Knowledge Commons in India, told the BBC. "The British ruled the world because they controlled the seas," he said. "Is India going to be content to just be a digital consumer? To being colonised once again?" And in the aftermath of the Facebook townhall in particular, some talk has begun to surface about what Mr Zuckerberg's real India ambitions are. Soon after the townhall ended, both Mr Modi and Mr Zuckerberg declared their support for digital India by using a special Facebook filter to tint their profile pictures in the tri-colour of the Indian flag. Multitudes of Indians followed suit and timelines were awash with snazzy tinted profile pictures, all in support of "Digital India". But then a tech website released what it claimed to be a portion of Facebook's source code, which allegedly "proved" that the "Support Digital India" filter was actually a "Support Internet.Org" filter. Facebook quickly issued a denial, blaming the text in the code on an "engineer mistake" in choosing a shorthand name he used for part of the code. But the "mistake" which has been coupled with a huge advertising blitz for Internet.Org across television channels and newspapers has raised suspicion about Facebook's motives. A Facebook poll on Internet.Org that frequently appears on Indian user timelines has also been ridiculed for not giving users an option to say no. Instead the answer options to the poll question  "Do you want India to have free basic services?" are "Yes" and "Not now". Internet.org (now called free basics), aims to extend internet services to the developing world by offering a selection of apps and websites free to consumers. Facebook's vice-president of infrastructure engineering, Jay Parikh has described the initiative as an "attempt to connect the two-thirds of the world who do not have access to the Internet" by trying to solve issues pertaining to affordability, infrastructure and access. When Facebook launched the initiative in India in February, it was criticised by Indian activists who expressed concerns that the project threatened freedom of expression, privacy and the principle of net neutrality. On the other end of the debate, Indian columnist Manu Joseph wrote in the Hindustan Times newspaper, hitting out at the "selfish" stand on net neutrality. He said concerns over the issue should be "subordinate to the fact that the poor have a right to some Internet". A massive campaign by India's Save the Internet Coalition exhorting Indians to speak out against initiatives threatening net neutrality caught public imagination and saw more than a million emails to India's regulator, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), demanding a free and fair internet in the country. Internet.Org was one of the initiatives immediately affected. TRAI since released a draft policy on net neutrality, but a question that has been asked is whether it was appropriate for Mr Modi to visit Facebook given that the policy was still under consideration. Mr Purkayasta is of the opinion that it could have been avoided. "It was not the time or the place to go. Even if it was simply a publicity gimmick, it still sends a signal to officials involved in drafting the policy," he said. However, Sunil Abraham from the Centre for Internet and Society told the BBC he believed that while Facebook's intentions were suspect, Mr Modi's visit had the potential to safeguard net neutrality in India. "India is a hugely important market for Facebook, and the prime minister has the power to force positive changes to its policies," he said. "We gain nothing by shutting them out."

Brantano employs about 2,000 staff in 140 stores and 60 concessions across the UK. Administrators from PwC are now running the Leicestershire-based business, which they said would trade normally while they sought a buyer. PwC's Tony Barrell said the chain was a victim of changing consumer habits. "The continuing challenging conditions for 'bricks and mortar' retail stores are well documented. "Like many others, Brantano has been hit hard by the change in consumers' shopping habits and the evolution of the UK retail environment." Brantano, along with Jones Bootmaker, was bought by retail investment firm Alteri Investors in October from Dutch-based Macintosh Retail Group. Jones is not affected by the administration. Brantano is one of the first sizeable retailers to fall into difficulty this year after the key make-or-break Christmas trading period. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said that Alteri specialise in turning around failing business, but "it appears that Brantano's trading position was worse than than expected. Christmas trading, I'm told, was also below expectations." She understands that a number of possible buyers have already approached PwC. Mr Barrell added: "The administrators are continuing to trade the businesses as normal whilst we assess the trading strategy over the coming days and weeks. "Staff will be paid their arrears of wages and salaries, and will continue to be paid for their work during the administration."	Discount shoe retailer Brantano has gone into administration, about four months after the chain was bought by an investment firm.
Four-month-old Eli Cox was found at an address in Lapwing Close in Minster, Sheppey, on 13 April and died in hospital on 27 April, Kent Police said. Katherine Cox, 32, and Danny Shepherd, 25, both of Millfield Road, Faversham, appeared at Medway Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. Both were released on conditional bail. Ms Cox and Mr Shepherd are also accused of one count of causing or allowing serious injury to a child and one count of possession of a class B drug (amphetamine). They are due to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on 13 December.	A man and a woman have appeared in court charged with causing or allowing the death of a baby.
UK Anti-Doping figures reveal players from Wales make up 33% of all sportsmen and women serving drugs bans. An ex-player, who took drugs, told BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme he is surprised more have not been banned. But WRU chief Martyn Phillips is not "overly concerned" because the number tested is proportionately higher than in other rugby unions and sports. The player, who would not be named, said: "It's totally off-the-scale. I think people are probably blind to it and if the truth came out I think there would be probably a lot more players who are banned from playing." The numbers caught are a small percentage of the thousands that play rugby, however 17 Welsh rugby union and league players, from grassroots to semi-pro, are currently banned, with the majority found to have traces of anabolic steroids in their systems. Ten of those banned are from rugby union and form the majority of the 16 players banned from the sport across the UK. UK Anti-Doping said the other seven are among 14 players banned from rugby league. The programme questioned 100 players from grassroots rugby union clubs and found 15 admitted to using some form of performance enhancing drug. Only five of that 100 said they had been drug tested in the past three years. Anti-doping expert Prof Yannis Pitsiladis, from the University of Brighton, said: "They can be quite confident when they go into testing that they won't be caught because the current testing will not be able to detect those drugs, because they are no longer in the system." But he said improvements in anti-doping technology and the ability to now keep samples for up to 10 years means athletes currently cheating may be caught in the future. UK Anti-Doping's chief executive Nicole Sapstead admitted keeping up with drug cheats is a constant battle. "I think if people really want to cheat the system they'll find a way," she said. "In an ideal world we'd be testing all sports all the time but that's not a reality for any anti-doping organisation in the world." Last week Merthyr Rugby Club player Owen Morgan, 25, and Glynneath RFC's Greg Roberts, 28, were banned for four years and two years respectively. Mr Morgan tested positive for the anabolic steroid drostanolone and the stimulant benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine. Mr Roberts tested positive for tamoxifen, which can be used for cancer treatment. WRU's Mr Phillips said: "It's a problem in society to start with. "I wouldn't sit here and say that it's not an issue in rugby because the fact that one player getting banned is one too many as far as I'm concerned. "So the challenge for us, not just in rugby but in sport generally, is we've got to try and get it out of the game. I don't think that's going to be easy. "The fact that we've caught people suggests there's an issue. So my job now is to get closer to that and to make sure we just become the best we can be to try and remove the problem." Chris Thair, chief operating officer of Wales Rugby League, called the figures a "wake-up call". He said: "It's a spike in the figures compared to previous years and it's not a great situation for the sport to be in. "It's not just a rugby issue, it's a huge global issue for all sports, and it's a challenge for everybody and we've got to do more." Week In Week Out, Rugby: Dirty Steroid Secret? Tuesday, 24 November, at 22:35 GMT on BBC One Wales	Steroid abuse is "off-the-scale" in Welsh grassroots and semi-professional rugby, it has been claimed.
Institutions across the UK are likely to be affected by joint action by the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1% which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2008. The employers maintain the offer is a good outcome for staff. The unions say they are willing to meet for last minute talks but say they are not optimistic "as the employers had so far refused to engage in talks aimed at resolving the dispute". Michael MacNeil, head of higher education at UCU, said: "There is widespread anger over the pay cuts staff have had to endure in recent years and all the reports we are getting suggest that Thursday's strike will be very well supported. "We are amazed the employers are still refusing to sit down with us to try and resolve this without any need for disruption. There are precious few hours left now, but our offer of talks remains open." Unison's head of higher education Jon Richards accused university management of "sitting on record surpluses, splashing out on senior management pay but refusing to give a decent wage to the staff who have made UK universities some of the best in the world". The Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), which represents the universities as employers, has expressed disappointment at the rejection of the offer. A spokesman for UCEA said that less than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote in favour of strike action and predicted "a low level impact on students". The spokesman said that they had made their final pay offer in May and had been engaged in a dispute resolution process with the unions throughout the summer. "We have met repeatedly over the last six months and as recently as last week." The spokesman added that "salary costs in most HE institutions will actually rise by around 3% this year. "Many staff will also get generous incremental increases and contribution pay. These pay increases will be seen as generous by many looking into the sector." He added that the GMB union had agreed to accept the pay offer for its members employed by universities. For Unite, the turnout for the ballot was 28% and of these, 64% (1,654 members) voted in favour of action. For the UCU the turnout was 35%, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Unison said that of those who had voted, 54.4% had been in favour of action and 45.6% against. UCU says its members last went on strike over pay in 2006.	University staff have offered to meet employers for eleventh hour talks to avert a one-day strike over pay, planned for Thursday.
The former Huddersfield and Birmingham manager will need to hit the ground running at Rugby Park, with the team just one point above the relegation play-off place. And his old team-mate Alex Rae - the St Mirren manager - reckons the Killie board have chosen wisely. "I think he will be a very good addition to Scottish football," Rae told BBC Scotland. "I knew him from playing against him, and he became a team-mate in 1997 when he joined Sunderland. "Lee has been around a long, long time now as a player and in the coaching and management side of things." Kilmarnock can certainly expect to see a manager who wears his heart on his sleeve. "The one thing about Lee Clark is you definitely see his passion, you see him running up and down the touchline," added Rae. "The board will be looking for a little bit of a bounce, they will be hoping they can continue the form from the last couple of games where they have drawn with Rangers and got a really good result at the weekend [a 2-0 victory at Motherwell]." "He will be going into a dressing room that will be a wee bit encouraged." The undoubted highlight of Clark's managerial story thus far was his first job. It ran from 2008 to 2012 following coaching spells at Newcastle United and Norwich City. For a while he was a huge prospect down south, famously taking League One Huddersfield on a 43-match unbeaten run. Backed by chairman Dean Hoyle, the remit for Clark was to take The Terriers into the Championship. Twice they made the play-offs. Twice they failed to go up. Eventually patience ran out and in February 2012 Clark was sacked following a 1-0 defeat to Sheffield United - a decision that looked harsh considering Clark had only lost three of his previous 55 league matches to that point. Hoyle wanted promotion and got it, with Clark's replacement, Simon Grayson, delivering via the play-offs. One of Clark's last signings for Huddersfield was Kallum Higginbotham - a player he will be reunited with at Kilmarnock. Clark would graduate to the Championship with Birmingham City but it was a time of turmoil at the club. Twice he preserved their status in the division, albeit survival in the 2013-14 season was secured by the tightest of margins - an injury-time goal from former Celtic player Paul Caddis keeping them up on goal difference. But a poor start to the following season saw Clark sacked in October 2014. His last managerial stint was an unhappy one as he immediately moved to Blackpool, who were bottom of the Championship. Relegation followed and he resigned in May 2015. Rae thinks it would be wrong to read too much into this dismal spell at the Seasiders. "The one thing about working for Blackpool - I was there as well - it is a really tough, tough environment to work in," he said. "The downsizing in terms of the playing budget almost made it impossible to succeed there. I would not judge Lee on that last tenure." The Killie board clearly like what they see in Clark but he is entering an environment he has little experience of. The 43-year-old is joining a club where money is tight and this will present challenges. He will need to be resourceful to make changes. There is precious little breathing space at the foot of the Premiership and the stakes are high for a club that could certainly do without enduring the financial hardship relegation would bring. 'Big prospect' is a tag that has hung around Clark both as player and boss. That is no longer the case and there is a sense of unrealised potential. But there is clearly a hunger to succeed as well. Kilmarnock may not be a final throw of the dice for Clark but there are only so many chances for managers in a highly competitive marketplace. As a youngster Clark was an exciting talent with the club he loved, Newcastle United. He represented England at schoolboy and at under-21 level. He enjoyed a very successful career - twice finishing as a Premier League runner-up with the Magpies and also played in the top flight with Fulham. Lee McCulloch and Peter Leven are staying on as Killie coaches and Rae thinks Clark will rely heavily on his new Scottish lieutenants. "These boys know the personnel and also the division," explained Rae. "The one thing about Lee is he is a motivator. He gets his teams at it. I have played against his Huddersfield - excellent back in the day. He will bring a lot to the table."	Lee Clark is a name well known to fans in England but the new Kilmarnock boss is less familiar in Scotland.
The Scottish champions went out 4-3 on aggregate after a 2-0 defeat in Sweden. Deila said: "The hype about the Champions League is big, everybody wants it so badly. You have to deal with it but we looked very stressed. "We didn't look like we wanted to go out and play football. We have a lot of young players coming through but this was a hard lesson for us." The Norwegian was new to the Celtic manager's job when his team was knocked out in the play-off round last season by Slovenian side Maribor. But having reshaped the team on his way to winning the Scottish Premiership in his debut season and across this summer, he was confident he could guide them into the group stage of the Champions League at the expense of the Swedish champions. And with a 3-2 lead heading to Malmo's 20,000 capacity stadium his side were in a strong position to qualify. Malmo are fifth in the Swedish league, seven points off the leaders with only nine matches to play of their summer season. Media playback is not supported on this device But Celtic will now compete in the Europa League and find out their opponents in Friday's group stage draw. Among the teams in Europe's second-tier competition are Liverpool and Tottenham. "We looked very uncomfortable on the ball. We looked frightened and scared and that is very disappointing," he said in his media conference afterwards. "It was a team performance that was not at the level we should expect at these games. We have to learn from this, some very hard learning. "We knew if we were at our best we had a good chance to go through but we were not even close. "We have shown that the Europa League is the level we have to compete at and it is better than nothing. It is a good competition." Asked about the goal Nir Bitton had disallowed for a foul - replays showing that Bitton's marker, Kari Arnason, had handled the ball in the aerial challenge - Deila felt Serbian referee Milorad Mazic had made "a big mistake". "It could have changed the game - it is irritating that we lost that," he said.	Celtic were "scared and frightened" in their Champions League exit to Malmo, said boss Ronny Deila.
The track's release date was brought forward by five weeks after a cover version by X Factor's Fleur East topped the iTunes chart last week. Ronson thanked "boy wonder" Bruno Mars, who features on the track, "without whom there would be no jam". Ed Sheeran, who scores a 10th week at the top of the album charts, fell to number two in the singles chart, while Band Aid 30 climbed to number three. The physical release of Do They Know It's Christmas? saw the charity track climb nine places, but it was kept off the top spot by Ronson and the ubiquitous Sheeran. East, who is the favourite to win this year's X Factor, performed the Ronson track during the show's semi-final on Saturday 6 December. Her mentor Cowell, who chose the track after Ronson and Mars pulled out of performing the song themselves on the talent show, called it "one of the top three performances" in X Factor history. East later apologised to Ronson, calling it "an amazing song". "I don't think anyone expected my performance to be as popular as it was," she added. Speaking to the Official Charts company, Ronson refrained from mentioning East, but thanked "everyone who bought, downloaded or DJ'd Uptown Funk this past week." "It's pretty much the coolest thing ever," he added. Featuring  Mars on lead vocals, Uptown Funk is the first single from British producer Ronson's fourth album, Uptown Special. Inspired by the feel-good funk of the 70s and 80s, it was already available in several countries around the world. Two Ronson tracks - Stop Me and Valerie, a collaboration with Amy Winehouse - reached number two in previous years.	Mark Ronson has clinched his first UK number one with Uptown Funk.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi scrapped 1,000 (Â£11.8) and 500 notes in a surprise move last week as part of a tax evasion and corruption crackdown. People have a limited time to exchange the notes for smaller denominations, but will have their fingers marked. The government wants to stop holders of "black cash" offloading their old rupee notes in small tranches. Authorities often use indelible ink to stop people from voting more than once in Indian elections. People were told they should deposit their high denomination notes in the banks, or could only exchange up to 4,500 rupees, ($65; Â£52) for smaller notes. But to clamp down on holders of unlawfully held or untaxed cash, depositors can only make such transactions once and so the banks are using the ink to prevent them from making multiple deposits. India scraps 1,000 rupee notes overnight Chaos at banks over India money ban Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption. The finance ministry suspects "unscrupulous" people have been trying to get around the crackdown by sending proxies to exchange their banned rupee notes. The withdrawal of the big notes is aimed at 'black money' and targets people who have been dodging taxes by holding stockpiles of cash. While the authorities say people will not be allowed another cash swap, critics are wondering what happens if the ink wears off? During elections, people have used chemicals to remove the ink from their fingers so that they can vote more than once. The government's ban on big bank notes first received widespread approval because less than 3% of Indians file tax returns. But the switch has caused chaos with tens of millions of Indians queuing for hours to exchange and withdraw cash. The government was ill-prepared for the ban which suddenly put 86% of the country's money supply out of circulation. Many businesses only accept cash and hundreds of millions of Indians do not have bank accounts and only use cash.	India is using indelible ink on fingers to ensure people get only one chance to change their big bank notes.
The song topped the UK singles charts in February 1969 and remained number one for four weeks. It was also number one in many other countries and won the Ivor Novello award for best song composition. He died peacefully after a six-year battle with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a family statement said. The statement said his closest family were "with him to the last" and that many people would miss his songs and his music. Where Do You Go To (My Lovely), a song about a girl born in poverty who becomes a member of the European jet-set, was replaced as number one by Marvin Gaye's I Heard it Through the Grapevine. It was included in the compilation programme One-Hit Wonders at the BBC, which was broadcast on BBC Four last year, although Sarstedt also reached number 10 in the charts with Frozen Orange Juice in June 1969. He wrote more than a dozen albums in a career that spanned more than 50 years, releasing his last, Restless Heart, in 2013 Born into a musical family in India, Sarstedt was one of three brothers who all enjoyed success in the UK singles chart. His older sibling, Richard Sarstedt, who performed under the stage name Eden Kane, also topped the charts with Well I ask You in 1961, while younger brother Clive, performing under the name Robin Sarstedt, reached number three in 1976 with My Resistance is Low. Sarstedt's music reached new audiences when Where Do You Go To (My Lovely) was included in the Wes Anderson films Hotel Chevalier and The Darjeeling Limited, which were both released in 2007. According to his website, he retired in 2010 because of his illness - a rare, progressive neurological condition.	Singer-songwriter Peter Sarstedt, best known for the song Where Do You Go To (My Lovely), has died at the age of 75, his family has said.
Alasdair McCrone, of Mull Theatre, and Gordon McLean, of the arts centre An Tobar, were among three directors of the umbrella body Comar. It looks after a number of arts organisations on the island. Comar's board said funding restrictions made it necessary to reduce three posts to one. It said the three existing directorial posts - in theatre/dance, visual arts/film and music/literature - would be replaced by one artistic director who would lead the entire creative programme Comar, which was created two years ago, said it hoped to continue to work with both Mr McCrone and McLean. Equity blames poor business planning and is calling on the board to resign. A public meeting about the decision is to be held in Tobermory next week. High-profile Scottish actor Alan Cumming tweeted: "This makes me so sad.  Another example of the accountants take over at the expense of the art. And in Mull too." Former Scottish culture secretary and SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, Michael Russell, tweeted: "Making Alasdair & Gordon redundant is an extraordinary wrong-headed decision and must be opposed."	The actors' union Equity has hit out at the decision to remove two of Mull's best-known creative directors from their posts.
Miller served his ban from 2004 to 2006 after admitting using blood-boosting agent EPO early in his career. The 39-year-old returned to the sport and has volunteered to educate Britain's young riders. Technical director Shane Sutton said "nurturing an anti-doping culture" was at the heart of British Cycling. Millar won stages in road cycling's three most prestigious stage races - the Tour de France, Vuelta a Espana and Giro d'Italia - and also won 2010 Commonwealth gold for Scotland in the road race time trial. The Scot, who retired in 2014, is regarded as one of the sport's leading anti-doping campaigners. Sutton added: "Having someone of David's calibre on board to support us in this education process is invaluable. He is readily available to share his well-rounded experiences as a professional cyclist to the young riders who aspire to succeed in their careers. "David will work with the squad on a voluntary basis until the end of the month with a view to subsequently joining the team in a more official capacity."	British Cycling has revealed that David Millar, the former British road race champion who served a two-year doping ban, is mentoring its academy riders.
PwC's Northern Ireland economic outlook said this was despite overall unemployment having fallen by more than 10,000 since June 2014. It said poor productivity remains the single biggest challenge to Northern Ireland's sustained recovery. PwC's Esmond Birnie said the pace of recovery was "decelerating". "Over the past seven months business confidence has been mixed, sometimes negative but always lagging the GB regions," Mr Birnie, who is PwC's chief economist in Northern Ireland, said. "There have also been recent mixed messages around consumer confidence, with June 2015 seeing the first rise in unemployment for more than two years; this may simply be a blip - or it may be indicative of a deeper malaise. "Currently, Northern Ireland's output is still 8% below the pre-crisis peak of 2008 and is something of a two-speed economy with employment contracting in public sector and financial services but growing fairly rapidly in advanced manufacturing, pharma, food processing and tourism. "PwC forecasts that Northern Ireland's economic growth will remain the lowest of the 12 UK regions at around 1.8% in 2015 - lower than the 2.2% growth experienced in 2014 - and will fall again in 2016 to around 1.7%." The report said that Northern Ireland's unemployment claimant count increased by 200 between May and June, the first month-on-month increase since December 2008. It said that 62% of those registered as unemployed have been out of work for more than 12 months, while 19.7% of young people aged 18-25 are unemployed - well above the UK average of 13.2%. PwC said the recent budget "confirmed that welfare reform and austerity will continue and that Northern Ireland probably faces a further four years of challenging economic circumstances, particularly around public spending".	Northern Ireland's economic growth will remain the lowest of the 12 UK regions in 2015, a new report has said.
The referee was happy with conditions when he arrived at 11:00 GMT, but the situation deteriorated and he called the game off after a 13:00 inspection. "The persistent rainfall over the last 18 hours has meant that the pitch is unfit and the referee had no choice," said Oldham chief executive Neil Joy. No date has yet been agreed for the rearranged fixture.	The League One match between Oldham and Blackpool has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.
Seven straight wins have lifted the Warriors into third place in the table. "We've put ourselves in a good position and the players are confident they can finish off well over the next three games," Murray told BBC Scotland. "There is a great desire and passion among the guys to do well again this year. I'm confident that we can do it and go to another Pro12 final." Glasgow lost in the semi-finals in 2013 before reaching the final 12 months later, and went one better last year by beating Munster in the final to be crowned champions. The Warriors are two points behind leaders Leinster and Connacht with three games remaining - away to Scarlets, home to Zebre, and away to Connacht in the final round on 7 May. The top four enter the end-of-season play-off semi-finals, with the top two enjoying home advantage. "We've managed to steadily climb our way back up the league and we've got ourselves back into the top four," said Murray. "Our target is to get in the top four and then, from our performances, we might get in the top two. "But we are in a good place and we're starting to play some really good rugby at the right time of the season." Glasgow travel to Wales to face a Scarlets side sitting three points behind them in fourth and who will be looking to leapfrog their visitors with a victory. "We've played them there already this season in Europe and we beat them 9-6, so we'll take a lot of confidence from that," said Murray. "Our target is to win all three of those games and it depends on what happens in other games. "Other teams in the top four all have hard games, so there could be a lot more ups and downs for all the teams. "There are four good sides in the top four at the moment and, for us to put ourselves in a position where we win it, we have to be better than them." Murray thinks the prospect of a final in Scotland, on Saturday, 28 May, should also provide motivation. "What a great opportunity to go play at a Pro12 final at Murrayfield, but there's a lot of rugby to be played before then," he added.	Assistant coach Kenny Murray says there is a growing belief at Glasgow Warriors that they can retain the Pro12 title.
Police were called after reports of the attack between 17:00 GMT and 18:40 on Monday. The victim was walking near East Park Road at its junction with Shearbank Road when he bundled into a car. Two men have been arrested following the incident and police are appealing for more information. The boy was driven away in a red or maroon car after he was approached and threatened. Police say the boy was questioned about his relationship with a young woman. The boy was taken to Beechwood Court, Blackburn, where he said four men assaulted him leaving him with cuts and bruises to his head. He was later able to call for help from an address in New Bank Road before being taken to the Royal Blackburn Hospital for treatment. Det Sgt Ben Hodgkinson, of Blackburn Police, said: "The circumstances would suggest this assault is linked to honour-based violence."	A 16-year-old boy has been kidnapped, assaulted and robbed in an attack linked to suspected "honour violence" in Blackburn.
News agency AFP said 10 people have been affected by E. coli in Bordeaux. It is thought a number of them had eaten rocket and mustard vegetable sprouts, believed to have been grown from seeds sold by Thompson and Morgan. The Ipswich-based company told the BBC it had no evidence of a link. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said no E. coli cases had been reported in the UK. However, it has revised its guidance and is advising people not to eat raw sprouted seeds, including alfalfa, mung beans (or beansprouts) and fenugreek. The agency said these should only be eaten if cooked until steaming hot throughout. A spokeswoman for Thompson and Morgan said the company sold "hundreds of thousands of packets of these seeds" throughout France, the UK and other parts of Europe every year. "We are very confident the problem is not with our seeds. People can still grow these seeds and use these seeds with absolute confidence," she said. "For such a small number of people to have been affected, it does suggest that the problem is perhaps in the local area, how the seeds have been handled or how they have been grown, rather than the actual seeds themselves." The company was co-operating fully with investigations, she added. Paul Hansord, the company's managing director, said: "We make sure that everything we do is to a high standard." He said the firm bought its seeds in bulk from suppliers around the world. The affected seeds may have been sourced from Italy. Thompson and Morgan also said they did not raise any seeds, instead selling packets via mail order to gardeners. Seven of those affected by the E. coli outbreak, who ate the sprouts at a country fair at Begres near Bordeaux, needed hospital treatment. Close contact The FSA says it is asking the company for more information about the seeds. There is no suggestion of a link to the German E. coli outbreak, which came from bean sprouts grown on an organic farm, but two people are said to be infected with a similar strain. Frederic Lefebvre, France's secretary of state for consumer affairs, was quoted by AFP recommending "consumers who bought these same products not use them". Mr Lefebvre added: "The link between the symptoms and eating of the sprouts so far has not been definitively established." The sale of the three seed types - mustard, rocket and fenugreek - has been halted in France. Thompson and Morgan have provided samples of these seeds to investigators in the UK. An FSA spokesman told the BBC: "We have been in contact with the French authorities about this outbreak and are aware that a UK business has been named in connection with it. "No cases of food poisoning have been reported in the UK linked with the outbreak in France but we are in close contact with the Health Protection Agency. "We have asked for further information from the French authorities with regard to the three named type of seeds to help us carry out investigations in the UK."	Officials are investigating a possible link between seeds sold by a UK firm and an E. coli outbreak in France.
"I have been asked in my younger years to consider joining, and I just never felt ready or prepared," said Ms Seifert, who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter. But the moment finally arrived in 2009, after she had finished a nursing degree in New York. At the age of 25 - the limit for most pageants - time was running out. Ms Seifert trained for over a month at a so-called beauty camp, setting her sights on representing the Philippines at the Miss Universe competition. But she said pageant organisers disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men's magazine. Undaunted, she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later. Not only did she win the national Miss Earth title, she went on to compete in the international pageant, where she was crowned runner-up out of 80 competitors from all over the world. Beauty pageants have been popular in the Philippines since they were brought to the country by the American colonial government in the first half of the 20th Century, says Jose Wendell Capili, an academic at the University of the Philippines in the capital, Manila. Opposition from feminists, if there is any, is muted. The recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further. Mr Capili, who wrote a book about Philippine pageants, says that as a result, pageants have become more competitive. "In the old days, an untrained candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pedigreed family," he said. "These days, there are talent scouts and modelling agencies who actually train some of the girls, months, even years, before the national competition." One of the most successful beauty camps is headed by Jonas Gaffud, who is CEO of a large modelling agency, Mercator. He and a teams of mentors field an average of 10 candidates a year. The mentors work for free, and many of the women dominate the national pageants and go on to place well internationally. Mr Gaffud is credited with helping Megan Young win the first Miss World crown for the Philippines in 2013. His team's beauty queens have also been finalists in every Miss Universe pageant since 2010. Some have also placed in previous Miss World and Miss International finals. In scouting a potential candidate, Mr Gaffud said that height - at least five feet five inches tall (165.1cm) - and "the beauty of face" were most important. But training was just as important. He said candidates need to start training at least six months before a competition. This included studying the pageant's cause, learning how to walk on stage, knowing how to do hair and make-up, exercising to tone the physique and practicing how to answer questions, he said. Ms Seifert, who trained at another beauty camp, said that the hours spent training were intense. "There are different exercises that you do, all the way from head to toe. Stretching, neck rotations, really tough waist movements to shape your waist," she said. One exercise was called the "duck walk" and involved walking in circles in a bikini at a dance studio lined with mirrors. "Just imagine doing lunges in high heels with a book or several books on your head - and they cannot fall," she said. And despite her previous experience as a television host, she still received coaching for the pageant Q&A, as well as advice from former pageant winners. Like Ms Seifert, Sian Elizabeth Maynard also trained at a beauty camp before taking part in a national pageant, even after successfully winning three local titles. She did calisthenics exercises and walking training, which included "doing weird lunges and wiggling". Sian Elizabeth Maynard, now 27, did not really want to join beauty pageants. But she says her mum "begged me to, so I joined a local one". She joined three local pageants a year from 2007 to 2009 - two in Cebu province in central Philippines and one national pageant - and won all titles. She was one of 10 finalists in Miss Philippines-Earth in 2010. They were not all pleasant experiences. Once, some of the candidates' sashes - which must be worn at all times in the competition - went missing. Replacements were quickly made, but some women ended up wearing their sashes even while brushing their teeth. Ms Maynard slept with hers under her pillow. "In other pageants, someone would cut the strap of a bikini or the strap of a sandal," she said. "The number one rule is that you have to watch your belongings because there could be a lot of theft, like make-up and cell phones go missing," Ms Maynard said. But she had good memories too, and said she made many friends. She learned how to dress up and present herself, when before joining she "didn't even know or bother to comb my hair". "So when we do these lunges, and we wiggle our hips, it's really tiresome. And we all do this in four-inch heels minimum. It helps us to lengthen our stride and to put more sway in our hips," Ms Maynard said. Sometimes she had to do the high-heeled lunges while answering questions called out by her mentors. "And then, every so often while we're doing it, one of them [trainers] would just call out a question, like you know, 'If you had to take out an element out the universe, which element would it be and why? Earth, wind, fire or water?' "It's really not just about smiling and standing in front of people. It's a lot of hard work," said Ms Maynard, now 27. Even the tiny details matter, Mr Gaffud said. He helps pick the right outfits and involves himself with how a candidate "should sway on stage". He even helps pick a candidate's lipstick shade - anything to help improve her chances. He said mentors tried to build on a candidate's natural traits, such as whether to cultivate a sweet or sexy image. Some mentors do charge for their services, but most like Mr Gaffud do it "for the love of finding a girl". "This is a side project," he said, adding that mentors help pay for the candidate's make-up, pictorials, food and sometimes even their rent. Some mentors, however, go on to manage their beauty queen's careers after they are successful in pageants. "They don't expect us to pay for anything, which I just find really amazing," said Ms Seifert, "because these pageant aficionados have full-time jobs, but they really dedicate so much of themselves to helping us develop and train," she said. Becoming a beauty queen is not always glamorous, Ms Seifert cautioned. "The moment I got crowned was the moment all the hard work began," she said. In her case, being a Miss Philippines-Earth winner and Miss Earth runner-up meant many public appearances to promote environmental causes. Pageant winners have high public profiles in the Philippines, and winning a title is seen as coming with big responsibilities. As "an important public figure", it was important to set a good example to young girls who looked up to beauty queens, Ms Seifert said. Winners are feted, introduced to high-ranking officials, and often recognised on the street and asked to pose for photographs. Anjo Lorenzana, a lecturer from the Ateneo de Manila University who specialises in media and popular culture, said pageants were also an opportunity for the Philippines to promote its image on an international stage. "By winning international beauty contests, Filipinos, who are usually equated with lowly occupations, can be seen in a better light," he said. For the candidates, pageants can be a stepping stone for upward social or economic mobility, Jose Wendell Capili said. He added that Filipinos were deeply passionate about pageants, pointing to heated online discussions. "Rooting for a particular candidate can sometimes break up families, friendships and relationships," he said. Tammy David, who has been photographing pageants since 2007, said the most unusual pageant she shot was inside a large jail. "You could see how parents were proud because their daughter was Little Miss Bureau of Corrections," Ms David said. "Beauty pageants are everywhere."	Sandra Seifert is tall, pretty, smart and articulate, but it took a while for her to decide she wanted to take part in a beauty pageant in the Philippines.
Tidal energy specialist Nova Innovation said this was the first offshore tidal array in the world to deliver electricity to the grid. Two 100kW turbines have been installed so far in the Shetland Tidal Array at Bluemull Sound. The blades for the turbines were made by Shetland Composites. Edinburgh-based Nova Innovation said tidal energy was a "long-term source" of predictable renewable power, with the turbines generating to full power across all tidal conditions. Simon Forrest, managing director of Nova Innovation, said: "We are absolutely delighted to be the first company in the world to deploy a fully operational tidal array." Mr Forrest said the deployment of the second turbine showcased the technology. The UK Carbon Trust estimates a Â£126bn global tidal energy market could be developed by 2050. WWF Scotland said the turbines were another "major milestone" on Scotland's journey to becoming a "fully renewable nation". The charity's director in Scotland, Lang Banks, added: "With some of the most powerful tides in Europe, Scotland is well placed to lead in developing this promising technology, which will help to cut climate emissions and create green jobs right across the country." Jenny Hogan, director of policy at Scottish Renewables, said: "Scotland is already at the forefront of capturing power from the tides and waves, and Nova's latest news demonstrates that lead is well-deserved. "The country is already home to some of the most advanced marine energy technologies anywhere, as well as the European Marine Energy Centre: arguably the most advanced marine energy proving site in the world. "With companies like Nova and others all working on developing this cutting-edge technology, the sector holds huge promise for the future."	Turbines installed off the coast of Shetland could herald a "new era" in tidal energy, according to the company running the project.
Aberdeenshire-based Harbro Group saw pre-tax profit increase by £800,000, to £3.5m, in the year to the end of June 2016. This was despite turnover falling by £1m to just over £100m. Harbro said international sales grew over the year, both in Europe and in new markets further afield. The Turriff-based company manufactures and supplies feeds for the beef, sheep, dairy, pig and poultry sectors. It also has a network of 19 shops across Scotland, operating under the Country Store brand. The stores cater for farming and rural communities with a range of products, including fireside supplies, country clothing and footwear. In accounts filed with Companies House, the company said: "As always, the outlook for agriculture is difficult to predict. "We have certainly been experiencing challenging times over the last 12-18 months but the industry is a robust one. "The impact of Brexit is still to be fully understood, although the board are confident that the group will be well positioned for whatever business challenges this may bring about."	One of Scotland's largest animal feed producers has posted a rise in profits, despite reporting a "challenging" year for the industry.
Coffins representing two men and two women who resisted the Nazis in World War Two were carried through the French capital before being interred. The coffins contained only soil from the fighters' graves as their relatives did not want their bodies disturbed. French President Francois Hollande said the group "embodied the spirit of the Resistance". A ceremony was held at the Pantheon alongside the coffins of Germaine Tillion, Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay. Tillion, who died in 2008, and de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of former French leader Charles de Gaulle who died in 2002, were caught and deported to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Brossolette, a radio journalist who broadcast on the BBC during the war, committed suicide after being arrested and tortured in 1944. Zay, who was minister of education before the war, was killed in 1944, having tried to set up a government-in-exile in north Africa. "Faced with the occupation, with submission, they gave the same response," Mr Hollande said. "They said 'no', immediately, firmly, clearly." Mr Hollande drew parallels with those who marched in French cities on January 11 this year, days after terror attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. The induction now sees three women interred at the Pantheon, after the scientist Marie Curie. There are now 74 men interred at the mausoleum, the first being the writer Victor Hugo.	France has honoured four members of the French Resistance with a ceremony at the Pantheon mausoleum in Paris.
Mae grŵp wedi'i sefydlu yn Arberth, Sir Benfro sy'n helpu i ddod â theulu o ffoaduriaid i'r DU a chynnig cartref iddyn nhw. Mae Arberth yn un o 10 tref yn y DU sydd wedi ymgymryd â chynllun gan Lywodraeth y DU yn 2016 i gymryd cyfrifoldeb o gefnogi cartrefu ffoaduriaid. Dywedodd un sy'n aelod o Croeso Arberth, Christina Hughes, wrth raglen Eye on Wales ar BBC Radio Wales nad oedd hi'n gallu "eistedd nôl a gwylio pobl yn dioddef". Felly daeth criw o bobl leol at ei gilydd i sefydlu'r grŵp, sy'n cymryd cyfrifoldeb o hyd at dri theulu drwy ddarparu cartref ar eu cyfer a'u helpu i ddysgu Saesneg er mwyn dod o hyd i waith. Mae ffigyrau yn dangos bod grwpiau cymunedol o'r fath wedi cefnogi hyd at 53 ffoadur y llynedd. Ond mae Croeso Arberth yn pryderu bod y broses yn un cymhleth. Roedd yn rhaid iddyn nhw gasglu £4,500 ar gyfer yswiriant ar gyfer y saith ffoadur maen nhw'n eu cefnogi, yn ogystal â chadw £6,000 mewn cyfrif i dalu am gyfieithwyr a chostau teithio. Mae £200 yn cael ei gadw 'nôl hefyd fel lwfans i aelodau o'r teulu. "Dyma oedd dechrau'r broses gyda nifer o ffurflenni gan y Swyddfa Gartref i'w llenwi," meddai Ms Hughes. "Doedd gennai ddim syniad faint o waith oedd yn ei gymryd. Hanner ffordd drwy'r broses roeddwn yn gofyn i fy hun 'be dwi'n ei wneud?' "Ond dwi'n falch fy mod wedi bwrw 'mlaen." Dyma beth sydd i ddisgwyl gan gymunedau sy'n noddi ffoaduriaid: Roedd rhaid i'r grŵp gael caniatâd gan Gyngor Sir Benfro cyn bwrw 'mlaen gyda'r cais i ddarparu cymorth i'r ffoaduriaid, yn ogystal â Citizens UK. Bellach mae'r broses ar ben ac mae teulu o saith ffoadur o Syria wedi cyrraedd Arberth. "Allai ddim credu bod y cyfan drosodd," meddai Ms Hughes. "Gan ein bod yn un o'r grwpiau cyntaf i gyflawni hyn dwi'n gobeithio wrth fynd ymlaen bydd y Swyddfa Gartref yn gwneud pethau'n gynt i grwpiau eraill."	Wrth i'r swyddfa gartref gyhoeddi £1m i helpu cymunedau noddi ffoaduriaid mae pryder ynglŷn â pha mor gymhleth yw'r broses.
Speaking from South Africa, Mr Machar told the BBC that his rebel faction could still negotiate a peace deal with President Salva Kiir. His statement comes despite last week's heavy fighting in the city of Malakal. Mr Machar, who first fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, is now being treated in Johannesburg. In July, Mr Machar's bodyguards and President Salva Kiir's presidential guards fought each other, sparking days of violence. Hundreds of people died and more than 100,000 fled across the border. The fighting erupted less than a year after a peace deal was signed to form a unity government and end the civil war. Riek Machar profiled Speaking to the BBC's HARDtalk programme, Mr Machar said: "I'm going to return to South Sudan." "Because President Salva Kiir doesn't want democratic and transparent and fair elections to be conducted, he attacked us, he has restarted the war. "But I am hoping that wise leaders in the region, and in Africa, and the rest of the world will throw up a political process which will bring about peace again, and the resuscitation of the peace agreement, and the reconstitution of the transitional government of national unity." Mr Machar also denied that claims that he was a warmonger, saying that his troops were simply defending themselves against government attacks. President Kiir's officials accuse Mr Machar's forces of starting the attacks. Both sides in the bitter conflict have been accused of perpetrating atrocities, the BBC's Karen Allen in South Africa reports. More on South Sudan's crisis:	South Sudan's sacked Vice-President Riek Machar - who fled the country in August - has vowed to return, saying his credibility is intact.
Kelly Mahon, of John Broad Avenue, Arleston, was arrested after the infant was reported missing from his home on 24 February. He was found safe and well the same day. Mahon, 41, admitted one charge of kidnap at Shrewsbury Crown Court and was remanded in custody. Judge Robin Onions told the defendant she was likely to receive a custodial sentence "of some length". During a hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court last month the prosecutor told the court the kidnap had been "pre-planned". Kelly Crowe told magistrates on 26 February: "When officers go around there (to Mahon's home) a number of baby items were present; cots, clothes, baby clothes, both female and male and also a to-do list. "She made reference to sterilisers, nappies, and milk for babies." The case has been adjourned until 12 May.	A woman has admitted kidnapping a nine-week-old baby boy in Telford.
We've asked BBC Sport readers to predict the top three before every race this season and, after the British Grand Prix, we got our calculators out and had a look at how many people got the top three bang on. The vast majority of you were on the money when it came to predicting the top two. Lewis Hamilton was top of the pile for 24% of BBC Sport's predictor users with Valtteri Bottas picked to finish second more than any other driver. However, third place caught a few of you by surprise. Sebastian Vettel was picked more times to finish third (7.5%) than any other driver but it was his Ferrari team-mate who snatched the final place on the podium. Seven percent of BBC Sport predictor users correctly predicted Kimi Raikkonen's third-place finish. Clearly there are some optimistic - or mischievous - McLaren fans out there as well. Fernando Alonso, who has not won a race in four years, was backed to win the British Grand Prix by 0.3% of predictor users. Keep fighting the good fight, McLaren fans. Fancy channelling you inner Nostradamus? Then head here to predict the qualifying top 10 for the Hungarian Grand Prix.	When it comes to Formula 1, you lot know your onions.
During the first nine months of 1938, he oversaw the Czech Kindertransport, which brought Jewish children from German-occupied Czechoslovakia to safety in the UK. He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees. Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge. Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London. His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton. They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised. In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics. He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin. In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London. His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis. In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees. He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France. British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home. He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home. Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories. Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy. "The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway," he said. "It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help. "I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had." In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden. The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two. "Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared," Winton later recalled. "None of the 250 children on board was seen again. "We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through." Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned. He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children. In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend. Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them. Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport. In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. A train dubbed "The Winton Train" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital. In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion. In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: "In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today." It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis: "In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed. "The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care."	Sir Nicholas Winton, who has died aged 106, has been hailed as a hero of the Holocaust.
A foul smell led residents to the site in March. The government says all the bodies were buried in a single night and include stillborn babies and unclaimed bodies. But Human Rights Watch says they must check to see if any of the people killed during anti-government protests in January have been buried there. Dozens of demonstrators died in protests over a proposed electoral law change which would have required a national census to be held before the presidential election could take place. The US-based watchdog Human Rights Watch (HWR) has said that bodies went missing during the protests and also during government crackdowns on criminal gangs in the capital last year and in 2013. Human rights workers first became aware of the burial site after residents of Maluku in Kinshasa reported a terrible smell near the local cemetery more than two weeks ago. A woman working in the field then discovered a limb sticking out of the ground. The DR Congo government has said that the bodies were all buried in individual graves on 19 March. A spokesman said on Monday that there would be no exhumations of the bodies.	The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been urged to investigate at least 421 bodies found in an unmarked burial ground in the capital, Kinshasa.
At about 21:00 BST on Friday, a man armed with a knife entered a shop at Northland Avenue in the Rosemount area and demanded money. Police said the suspect was restrained by members of the public until officers arrived and arrested him. Another man was arrested nearby a short time later. The men, who are both 19, are to appear in court on Monday. They are charged with attempted robbery, conspiracy to rob and possession of an offensive weapon.	Two men have been charged over the attempted armed robbery of a shop in Londonderry.
Imaginative thinking would be required to ensure trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was not affected, said Mr Ahern. But he believed customs checks were inevitable. Mr Ahern added that now was not the time for a border poll. Speaking to the BBC's Today Programme, he said: "There has to be far more consensus, there still is a divided society, the institutions are not operational. "The big issue, I think, for the Irish and the UK government is on the other side of 8 June is to try to help broker a deal to get the institutions back up and running and certainly having a border poll in the foreseeable future will not help that process." In March, Mr Ahern told the BBC's Newsnight programme that dissident republicans might use the re-introduction of border posts in Northern Ireland to justify their campaign of violence. He said a hard border with customs checks would have to be re-introduced because of the UK's decision to leave most of the customs union under Brexit. Mr Ahern drew a comparison with the IRA's so-called Border Campaign in the 1950s. But he said he did not expect a return to large-scale violence. The UK government has pledged to ensure there will be no return to the "hard border" of the past.	Former Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Bertie Ahern has warned there is no easy solution to resolving the Irish border issue before the UK leaves the EU.
A monthly travelcard costs £135 ($174), according to a Deutsche Bank report - £33 ($43) more than Dublin, which was ranked second priciest city. Auckland, where a ticket costs £95 ($123), came third, while New York City, at £91 ($118), came fourth, and Tokyo fifth at £86 ($111). Transport for London (TfL) said the findings did "not show the true cost of transport in other countries". The survey also found the cost of travel in the capital dropped since 2014, when commuters paid £165 ($213). Source: Deutsche Bank Its authors ranked London tenth most expensive for petrol, and the third for car hire. Hong Kong had the priciest petrol, while Amsterdam was the most expensive for a daily car rental, the report said. London's taxis fared slightly better, ranked 20th in a list of 47 cities, with Zurich topping the list for the most expensive fares. For quality of life, London was ranked 33rd in the world, similar to other "mega cities" such as Tokyo, Paris and New York. According to the report, these cities "rank very low" for quality of life, mostly due to "high living costs, crime, pollution and commuting time". "This is highly subjective and one person's long commute may be another person's chance to catch up on Netflix," the report said. "Megacity dwellers may also forsake short-term quality of life for aspirational reasons," the report added. Wellington, in New Zealand, was ranked as the best city to live in in terms of quality of life, followed by Edinburgh, Vienna. Melbourne and Zurich. In February, TfL revealed its fares income was down £90m last year. TfL is currently planning to cut £16bn from its budget by 2020/21 as it  aims to become self sufficient with its operating costs. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has frozen fares on buses and trams until 2020, but travelcard prices are set by train operating companies and so are not under full TfL control. A TfL spokesman said: "London also has one of the most extensive set of travel concessions in the world with free or discounted travel for children, the over-60s, students and veterans."	Public transport in London is the world's most expensive, a report says.
The men, aged 26 and 24, were in a house in Melrose Street when three men armed with a knife, hammer and batons forced their way into the property just before midnight on Saturday. After assaulting the men, the gang left with a sum of cash and personal items. They also smashed a number of windows. The men in the house received medical treatment for their injuries. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.	Two men have been assaulted by an armed gang in south Belfast.
But he says the only way to attract viewers to his vlogs is by being "incredibly, painfully honest". "The economy of YouTube is based off honesty porn. It's just, how far can you go?" the 24-year-old says. "The more horrendously out there and honest you are, the more people respond to that. It's unhealthy. They're all addicts." Honesty is something he says he is attracted to however, and that's one of the reasons he agreed to take part in a new documentary - The Creators - which goes behind-the-scenes in the life of vloggers. Watch TomSka talking about how hard it is now to make your mark in the world of YouTube To begin with he says he was worried that it would be another "puff piece" talking about how "kids make money in their bedrooms, like every news report" on them. And, given how much of their lives are already public, it could seem like an odd choice of subject for a documentary maker. "Even though they are sharing their lives, they're not necessarily sharing all the different aspects of what it's like to be a vlogger," says Nanette Burstein, the Oscar-nominated director behind the film. "This was an opportunity to get them to open up." Along with TomSka, The Creators also features Zoella and twins NikiNSammy. "They put in me ranting about things and it wasn't just 'everything is lovely'," TomSka says. "I mean you do get a lot of everything is lovely because you see Zoella, who is just lovely... but then you get me being all pessimistic." He says, unlike other vloggers, he finds it harder to make money through brand endorsements. "As YouTube has grown, managers and people have learned to apply the Disney kid method," he says. "They become these deities, these beings of perfection in the eyes of their audience. And that is worth a lot more money. "I would rather put an honest version of myself forward. And it makes me no money. No-one wants to buy a shirt with me on it." He did get in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority last year, over a promotion with a biscuit brand, that was said not to be clearly labelled as an advert. "I've always tried to be very open and very honest with my audience. I've been caught out by that recently. Apparently I wasn't honest enough," he says. He has been open about his problems with mental illness as well, sharing videos with his fans about his depression. "I really don't know what long-term effects my relationship with my audience and with YouTube is going to have on me," he says. "I like sharing and I like being very honest and I have found that it feels good but then again maybe it's not. "I've forgotten what the difference is between Thomas Ridgewell and TomSka." "You put me in a room with 1,000 fans and I can take photos and sign and be lovely to every single person. "But you put me in a room with 10 people who know the real me and I'm not going to know what to do any more." The Creators is available to view on YouTube now.

He vowed to recover billions of dollars "stolen" under previous administrations. Mr Buhari held talks with state governors over the lack of money to pay government workers their salaries. He and his All Progressives Congress won elections in March, ending some 16 years of rule by the Peoples Democratic Party. He was sworn in less than four weeks ago, taking over from Goodluck Jonathan, who had been in office since 2010. "The days of impunity and lack of accountability are over," he told state governors. "The next three months may be hard, but billions of dollars can be recovered, and we will do our best," he added. In an earlier briefing with journalists, he said it was a "disgrace" that government workers had not been paid for months. African news updates "This bad management we find ourselves in - we really need your help to protect us from people before they march on us," he said. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo estimates that Nigeria's debts stand at about $60bn (Â£38bn). However, former Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has rejected the claim, saying the debt was much lower and most of it was incurred by states, rather than the federal government, AFP news agency reports. The president won the elections on a promise to tackle corruption, and to lead Nigeria to greater prosperity. Nigeria is Africa's biggest oil producer, but most of its citizens are poor.	Nigeria's treasury is "virtually empty", President Muhammadu Buhari has said.
McManus netted from close range on the quarter-hour mark to open the scoring and Ross Forbes' deflected strike quickly doubled Morton's lead. A shot by Kyle McAusland pulled Alloa back into the game before half-time. But another McManus finish and one by Denny Johnstone late on ensured a comfortable win for the hosts.	Declan McManus scored twice as Greenock Morton beat Scottish Championship bottom side Alloa Athletic, who remain 10 points adrift.
The cargo ship SS Politician, which had 28,000 cases of whisky, sank off Eriskay in Western Isles 75 years ago. Eight bottles of the whisky were recovered by a diver in 1987. The National Trust for Scotland (NTS) has suggested that two bottles it has on the Isle of Canna could be added to these eight known bottles. The bottles in the care of NTS are kept at Canna House and belonged the late John Lorne-Campbell and his wife Margaret Faye-Shaw, who gifted the property and Hebridean island to the trust. Fiona McKenzie, archivist at Canna House, said: "According to the previous archivist, the bottles have 'always been at the house'. "She was here from the 1960s and that's well before the diver brought up eight bottles in 1987. So looks like we may have two bottles that are not included in the official stats." Many other bottles were salvaged from the SS Politician at the time of its sinking in 1941 and still thought to survive, but have not been officially recorded. Hundreds of cases of whisky were hidden from customs officers by islanders. Some locations of these secret stashes have since been forgotten, according to islanders today. The SS Politician was headed for Jamaica when it ran aground on the northern side of Eriskay in bad weather. Scottish author Compton Mackenzie, published the novel Whisky Galore in 1947, which was loosely based on the shipwreck. It was adapted for the cinema in a 1949 Ealing comedy.	Two bottles of whisky recovered from a shipwreck that inspired the book Whisky Galore may have been missed from official statistics.
The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were discovered on a beach in Koh Tao on 15 September. Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police, who are holding two Burmese suspects. The UK detectives will now compile a report and "update the families of Hannah and David," a spokesman said. "Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work, as far as possible," the Met Police said in a statement. "They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings. "The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit." Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers from Myanmar, also known as Burma, are alleged to have confessed to the killings. Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair, both aged 21, have since withdrawn their confessions. The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery, and could face the death penalty if found guilty. However, the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d'affaires to express concerns about the police investigation. The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment. The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand. He had previously rejected offers of assistance. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds. Thai police have said DNA found on Ms Witheridge matched samples taken from the suspects.	UK police are to return from Thailand after reviewing an investigation into the murders of two British tourists, Scotland Yard has said.
If this volume is hard to visualise, imagine the Earth's entire land surface covered in a layer some 180m deep. The new calculation comes from a Canadian-led team and is published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Significantly, little of this water - just 6% - is the kind of bankable resource that is most useful to people. That small fraction is referred to as "modern" groundwater: it is extractable because it is near the surface, and can be used to supplement above-ground resources in rivers and lakes. "It's the groundwater that is the most quickly renewed - on the scale of human lifetimes," explained study leader Tom Gleeson from the University of Victoria. "And yet this modern groundwater is also the most sensitive to climate change and to human contamination. So, it's a vital resource that we need to manage better." To quantify just how much water is stored in the top 2km of the Earth's surface, Dr Gleeson's team had to combine large data sets with an element of modelling. They included information on the permeability of rocks and soil, on their porosity, and all that is known about water table gradients, which tell you about inputs from precipitation. Key to determining the age of all this stored water is a collection of thousands of tritium measurements. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that spiked in the atmosphere 50 years ago as a result of thermonuclear bomb tests. It can therefore be used as a tracer for all the rain that has made its way underground ever since. The map above shows the distribution of this modern groundwater around the globe. Dark blue shows where it is very quickly renewed. Light blue shows the older groundwater, which is mostly stagnant and non-renewable. "Old water is highly variable," Dr Gleeson told BBC News. "Some places it is quite deep, in some places not. In many places, it can be poor quality. "It can be more saline even than ocean water and it can have lots of dissolved metals and other chemicals that would need to be treated before it could be used for drinking or agriculture." This puts further emphasis on the modern reserves and the need to manage them in a sustainable way. The study underlines just how unevenly they are spread around the globe. The next step, Dr Gleeson said, was to try to work out just how fast some water stores were being depleted. Also writing in Nature Geoscience, Ying Fan, from Rutgers University, US, commented that "this global view of groundwater will, hopefully, raise awareness that our youngest groundwater resources - those that are the most sensitive to anthropogenic and natural environmental changes - are finite".

The Labour authority voted in favour of changing 2,700 contracts from 52 weeks to term time-only. The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and "reduce the risk" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was "bitterly disappointed" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: "This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary." She said there was "no option" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: "It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs." Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would "find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East" and the council was "very likely to face legal challenge". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a "real risk" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: "I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce." He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.	Durham County Council has approved plans to cut the salaries of teaching assistants by nearly 23% by not paying them during school holidays.
The degrees form part of the UK's cyber security strategy published in 2011. The strategy recognised that education was key to improving defences against hackers and online fraud. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said internet cyber security was a "crucial part" of the government's long-term plan for the British economy. He said the courses would help to make the "UK one of the safest places in the world to do business online". He said: "Through the excellent work of GCHQ, in partnership with other government departments, the private sector and academia, we are able to counter threats and ensure together we are stronger and more aware." UK universities were invited to submit their master's degree courses for certification. The universities now running GCHQ-approved programmes in cyber security are Edinburgh Napier University, Lancaster University, the University of Oxford and Royal Holloway, University of London. GCHQ has also given provisional accreditation to Cranfield University's cyber defence and information assurance course, and the University of Surrey's information security course. A spokesman for GCHQ said the universities "were judged to provide well-defined and appropriate content, delivered to the highest standard".	Intelligence agency GCHQ has accredited six UK universities to teach specialist master's degree courses to future internet security experts.
Pools, who were relegated from the English Football League last season, lost their opening game at home to Dover on Saturday but started well at Moss Rose, with Cassidy and Jack Munns both firing inches wide. Macclesfield hit back, with Danny Whitaker's volleyed effort superbly tipped away by goalkeeper Scott Loach. The home side took the lead in the 38th minute when Elliott Durrell's ball into the box was headed home by Whitaker. There was a let-off for Hartlepool at the start of the second half when a mistake from defender Scott Harrison set Tyrone Marsh clear but he shot straight at Loach. Pools levelled after 58 minutes when Cassidy nodded in a cross from Ryan Donaldson and came closest to winning it when the striker's flicked header was saved.

Media playback is not supported on this device The Briton, 30, won 6-2 4-6 6-1 7-5 after two hours and 39 minutes, with match point clinched at 20:57 BST. Fognini, the 29th seed, had five set points to force a fifth set but Murray won five games in a row to seal a place in the last 16 for the 11th time. Murray will play Frenchman Benoit Paire in the fourth round on Monday. Fellow Briton Johanna Konta earlier reached the second week for the first time with a 6-4 6-1 win over Maria Sakkari of Greece. Media playback is not supported on this device "The end of the match was tense. It was an up and down match. I didn't feel like it was the best tennis at times but I managed to get through," Murray told the BBC. "It was getting dark towards the end and I was probably thinking a bit about that. "We would have had to go off for the roof to go on, so that would have meant a change in conditions. I'm pleased to get off in four." Media playback is not supported on this device Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded. Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday. The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second. Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set. At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life. Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away. A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points. It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games. The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory. "I feel OK," added Murray. "I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday. "I'm happy to get through the first week and anything can happen from here on."	Defending champion Andy Murray won a thrilling third-round contest against Italy's Fabio Fognini at Wimbledon as darkness fell around Centre Court.
Colin Hughes was attacked in Old Swan in September 2010 as he went to investigate a noise at the door of his  home. Two men, aged 18 and 21, from Old Swan and Huyton, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday. Detectives have arrested six people as part of the inquiry, but no-one has been charged. Mr Hughes had been playing cards with his fiancee Paula Greenwood when they heard the glass in the back door smash at about 0045 BST on 21 September. Ms Greenwood went to call the police while Mr Hughes, a chef at a local pub, went to investigate. She later found him lying face down in the garden. He was taken to hospital but died soon afterwards. A post-mortem examination found he died from a single stab wound.	Two men arrested over the killing of a 42-year-old man in his back garden in Liverpool have been released on bail.
Both teams had a man sent off - the Terrors' Lewish Toshney, and solitary goalscorer Jason Cummings who picked up two yellow cards apiece at Tannadice. Cummings volleyed in the only goal after 38 minutes, shortly after Toshney's dismissal. But his 75th-minute sending off for punching the ball into the United net made for a nervous finale for Hibs. Neil Lennon's side extended their lead at the Championship summit to nine points, ahead of second placed Falkirk, who play Ayr United on Saturday. Ray McKinnon's United are 10 points adrift in third place, having played a game fewer than Hibs. Clearly, the home side had to start on the front foot and pressure their opponents. With games running out they really had to win to close the gap the Easter Road side. United's eagerness to play at pace and be in Hibs' faces ultimately cost them, epitomised by Toshney's rashness. The right-back was lucky to escape one early reckless challenge, but was correctly punished for another on Andrew Shinnie, and when he clattered the midfielder once again, it was a simple decision for referee Don Robertson. Hibs quickly asserted themselves by going in front and it became too big a task despite Cummings' offer of assistance. United didn't lack fight. They lacked composure and quality on the night. A first home defeat this season was badly timed. They're not entirely out of the title race, but the smart money would be on a play-off place for the Tannadice side. Head coach Lennon might not admit it but few will back anyone other than Hibernian to take the Championship title now. Cummings' fabulous first-half finish was timely, not too long after Toshney's red card. The striker stole in behind a defence that seemed intent on playing a high line. Shinnie exposed that with a lovely lofted ball into Cummings' path and he made no mistake with a vital, instinctive goal. Cummings was also unlucky to be flagged offside when clean through and might have earned a penalty when William Edjenguele appeared to catch him near the goalline just before half-time. It was the 21-year-old's 20th goal of the season - great work from him all-round, until later. Martin Boyle should have ended the contest when he had time, and space six yards out, but volleyed wildly over. The impressive Shinnie thought he had sealed the win after great work from Boyle, only for Cammy Bell to parry his shot over the bar. Hibs rarely looked troubled with goalkeeper Ofir Marciano a virtual spectator. This was a massive step for Lennon's men, and with three home games to follow, they are very much on track for the top flight. For all his positives, Cummings risked this win with few minutes of madness. He was unnecessarily booked for throwing the ball away when ruled offside. Minutes later he threw himself at a cross, blatantly punched the ball in the net and was correctly ordered off. It was utter madness and offered United a lifeline from nowhere. Luckily for him, his team mates saw it through. In total, 10 players were booked, and Lennon was ordered to the stand late on. However, Hibs got the job done, and deserved to finish with three valuable points. Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "It was extremely difficult when we went down to 10 men. "I thought we started the game excellently and controlled the first 15 minutes, but the sending-off certainly had a massive impact on the game. "I haven't seen it again, but Lewis has gone for the ball and then he has pulled out. It was clear for everybody on our bench. "The ref is entitled to make that decision, but we were very disappointed. You have to look at all the decisions that were made and some of inconsistencies and tackles that went unpunished. "But what is important is what we do from now until the end of the season and focus on winning every game. "I thought we showed great character to battle back hard with 10 men. We will take the positives out of that and fight for every point until the end and see where we end up." Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "Jason's got to learn to control his temper. "I've been there - I got many a telling off from Martin O'Neill in my younger days - but he's an outstanding talent and he's come up with a really big goal in a big game and he does it consistently and it's not a coincidence. "We were outstanding. The only disappointment was the sending off really, which put us on the back foot for 10 minutes. "The rest of the game, we played really strongly and we looked a very good side. Thoroughly deserved to win. "I wanted them to put down a marker for the rest of the season and hopefully they've done that. "It is a difficult place to come and win, but I thought we were head and shoulders above Dundee United. "I underplayed it this week, but it is probably the biggest game we've had league wise for two or three seasons and they've responded brilliantly." Match ends, Dundee United 0, Hibernian 1.

Worst affected is the Abruzzo region, still recovering from a 2009 quake, while towns hit in Marche and Lazio last year are also badly affected. More than 300,000 people are without power in Abruzzo and traffic has been disrupted in the Marche quake zone. Three deaths across Italy have been attributed to freezing weather. A man of 67 was found dead in the street in Ceglie Messapica, Puglia, and a homeless man of 53 was found dead in a square in Canicatti, Sicily. A man aged 67 died in Giulianova, Abruzzo, after falling from a boat into icy water. Fabrizio Curcio, head of the country's Civil Defence Department, told Italian radio the harsh weather was expected to last until Thursday night at the earliest. The temperature in Amatrice, Lazio, where 236 people were killed by the earthquake on 24 August, and Arquata del Tronto, Marche, where 46 died, is set to fall as low as -6C on Tuesday night, with more snow forecast. That quake left several thousand people homeless, while a further tremor on 30 October put 30,000 out of their homes. Up to 1.3 metres (4.3ft) of snow is lying on the ground in Marche, where some 20,000 people were without power on Tuesday, the regional authorities said. Camps for people made homeless by the quakes in Marche region are now closed with most people moved to hotels along the Adriatic coast or into secure houses, flats or container homes, the press office told the BBC on Tuesday. Meanwhile, buildings made fragile by the tremors are under renewed pressure from the weight of the snow. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the fire service has been continuing its earthquake recovery work in Norcia, Umbria, another town badly damaged by tremors. The cold snap continues to affect other parts of Southern Europe. Snow fell in Spain's Balearic islands as well as the east coast city of Valencia. Weather forecasters said temperatures in the Pyrenees mountains in northern Spain could fall as low as -30C.	Central Italy is in the grip of heavy snowfall and very low temperatures, adding to the disruption caused by recent huge earthquakes.
This is demonstrably false. Far-right parties failed to pass a 5% barrier to enter parliament, although if they had banded together, and not split their vote, they would have probably slipped past the threshold. Only one government minister has links to nationalist parties - though he is in no way a neo-Nazi or fascist. And the speaker of parliament, Volodymyr Groysman, is Jewish. He has the third most powerful position in the country after the president and prime minister. But Ukrainian officials and many in the media err to the other extreme. They claim that Ukrainian politics are completely fascist-free. This, too, is plain wrong. As a result, the question of the presence of the far-right in Ukraine remains a highly sensitive issue, one which top officials and the media shy away from. No-one wants to provide fuel to the Russian propaganda machine. But this blanket denial also has its dangers, since it allows the ultra-nationalists to fly under the radar. Many Ukrainians are unaware that they exist, or even what a neo-Nazi or fascist actually is, or what they stand for. This hyper-sensitivity and stonewalling were on full display after President Petro Poroshenko presented a Ukrainian passport to someone who, according to human rights activists, is a "Belarusian neo-Nazi". The Ukrainian leader handed out medals on 5 December to fighters who had tenaciously defended the main airport in the eastern region of Donetsk from being taken over by Russian-backed separatists. Among the recipients was Serhiy Korotkykh, a Belarusian national, to whom Mr Poroshenko awarded Ukrainian citizenship, praising his "courageous and selfless service". The president's website showed a photo of Mr Poroshenko patting the shoulder of the Belarusian, who was clad in military fatigues. Experts who follow the far right have strongly objected to President Poroshenko's decision. They say Mr Korotkykh was a member of the far-right Russian National Unity party and also a founding member of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Society (NSS) in Russia. According to Ukrainian academic Anton Shekhovtsov, the NSS's main goal "is to prepare for a race war". Mr Shekhovtsov said the Belarusian had been charged for involvement in a bombing in central Moscow in 2007, and was detained in 2013 in the Belarusian capital Minsk for allegedly stabbing an anti-fascist activist. He was later released for lack of evidence. Even though the details involved accusations rather than facts, if true they were damning, said human rights activist Halya Coynash. Top Ukrainian officials then rejected as defamatory any claims that Mr Korotkykh had neo-Nazi ties. "Counter-intelligence has no information that could prevent him from receiving Ukrainian citizenship," said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security services. Nevertheless, the fact is, neo-Nazis are indeed a fixture in Ukraine's new political landscape, albeit in small numbers. As Mr Korotkykh's case demonstrates, the ultra-nationalists have proven to be effective and dedicated fighters in the brutal war in the east against Russian-backed separatists and Russian forces, whose numbers also include a large contingent from Russia's far right. As a result, they have achieved a level of acceptance, even though most Ukrainians are unfamiliar with their actual beliefs. The volunteer Azov Battalion is a case in point. Run by the extremist Patriot of Ukraine organisation, which considers Jews and other minorities "sub-human" and calls for a white, Christian crusade against them, it sports three Nazi symbols on its insignia: a modified Wolf's Hook, a black sun (or "Hakensonne") and the title Black Corps, which was used by the Waffen SS. Azov is just one of more than 50 volunteer groups fighting in the east, the vast majority of which are not extremist, yet it seems to enjoy special backing from some top officials: Ukraine's media have been noticeably silent on this subject. Recently, prominent newspaper and online publication Left Bank published an extensive interview with Mr Troyan, in which the journalists asked no questions at all about his neo-Nazi past or political views. And after the Unian news agency reported the presidential ceremony under the headline, "Poroshenko awarded Belarusian neo-Nazi with Ukrainian passport", it was soon replaced with an article that air-brushed out the accusations of extremism. Unian's editors have declined to comment on the two pieces. There are significant risks to this silence. Experts say the Azov Battalion, which has been widely reported on in the West, has damaged Ukraine's image and bolsters Russia's information campaign. And although Ukraine is emphatically not run by fascists, far-right extremists seem to be making inroads by other means, as in the country's police department. Ukraine's public is grossly under-informed about this. The question is, why doesn't anyone want to tell them?	Ever since Ukraine's February revolution, the Kremlin has characterised the new leaders in Kiev as a "fascist junta" made up of neo-Nazis and anti-Semites, set on persecuting, if not eradicating, the Russian-speaking population.
Those selling the illicit weapons often disassembled and sent them in different packages or embedded them in old stereos or printers, the report found. Researchers found that firearms and related goods generated 136 sales per month and a monthly revenue of $80,000 (Â£62,000). The firearms trade has gained attention following recent terrorist attacks. The dark net is a part of the internet that requires specific software to access, in order for users to remain anonymous. While the trade was unlikely to fuel large-scale terrorist operations, it had the potential to become the platform of choice for "lone-wolf" terrorists to obtain weapons and ammunition, the report said. Non-profit organisation Rand Corporation Europe, working with Manchester University, found 52 unique vendors selling weapons or similar items such as ammunition, explosives, or components such as silencers across 811 listings and 18 markets. Police believe the 2016 Munich shooting, which left nine people dead, used weapons purchased on the dark net. Lead author of the research, Giacomo Persi Paoli, said: "Recent high-profile cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real. "The ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists, who can make virtually anonymous purchases, but also vulnerable and fixated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect." Guns account for less than 1% of items sold on the platform, with its main trade being in narcotics. Nevertheless, the volume being sold "can be considered sufficiently high to be a cause of concern for policy makers and law enforcement agencies", said the report. The study involved collecting data from 12 dark net marketplaces during a week in September 2016. Most of those selling guns were based in the US, but Europe was the most popular destination for the weapons they sold. Judith Aldridge, co-investigator on the study, said: "In very simple terms, anyone can connect to the dark web and within minutes have access to a variety of vendors offering their products, which are most often illegal. "The dark web enables illegal trade at a global level, removing some of the geographical barriers between vendors and buyers, while increasing the personal safety of both buyers and sellers through a series of anonymising features that obscure their identities."	Criminals and terrorists are using the so-called dark net to buy weapons, a new study has suggested.
Keane, 23, who has played for England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels, will report to St George's Park on Tuesday with the rest of the squad. Gareth Southgate called him up after Johnson was ruled out of Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Malta. On Monday, Andros Townsend replaced the injured Raheem Sterling in the squad. Crystal Palace's Townsend, 25, has played 11 times for his country and scored three goals, but was not selected for Euro 2016. He has played in all seven of Palace's Premier League games since joining from Newcastle for £13m in the summer. England, led by interim manager Southgate, face Malta on 8 October and Slovenia three days later. No details have yet been given on Manchester City player Sterling's injury. Keane has featured in all of Burnley's Premier League games this term. Between 2013 and 2016, the former Manchester United trainee made 16 appearances for the under-21s side under Southgate. Goalkeepers: Fraser Forster (Southampton), Joe Hart (Torino, on loan from Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley) Defenders: Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Michael Keane (Burnley), Danny Rose (Tottenham), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Kyle Walker (Tottenham) Midfielders: Eric Dier (Tottenham), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Michail Antonio (West Ham), Jesse Lingard (Manchester United), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Dele Alli (Tottenham), Andros Townsend (Crystal Palace) Strikers: Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool), Jamie Vardy (Leicester)	Burnley defender Michael Keane has been handed his first international call-up after Stoke's Glen Johnson withdrew from the England squad through injury.
The US posted annualised growth of 2.6% for the fourth quarter - lower than the 3% projected by economists. The figure was weaker than the 5% growth in the third quarter of 2014. However, the dramatic slide in fuel prices in recent months has put more money in consumers' pockets and allowed them to spend more. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, rose by 4.3% in the fourth quarter - the fastest rise in nearly nine years - and higher than the 3.2% for the third quarter. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said: "It took us a while to get here, but I think the economy is finally off and running. "We are seeing a number of positive developments. Businesses are hiring aggressively and the big drop in gas prices means that people have more money to spend on other items." The near-60% slide in oil prices in the plast seven months has cut the price of petrol to about $2 per gallon, or the equivalent of Â£1.32 for 4.5 litres. That is little more than British drivers pay for just one litre of petrol. The fall has saved Americans about $175bn, Mr Zandi said: "A big part of growth this year will be people spending their gas savings." For 2014 as a whole, the economy expanded by 2.4% - better than the 2.2% for the previous 12 months. The report came two days after the Federal Reserve said the US economy was expanding at a "solid pace", but said it will "remain patient" in determining when to raise interest rates. The main rate has been held at close to zero since December 2008. Some economists believe an increase could come in middle of the year, but Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said Friday's data could delay a rise until late this year or even early 2016. He feared that the US economy was too reliant on consumer spending given that business investment fell by an annualised rate of 1.9% - the biggest decline since the second quarter of 2009. "Ideally, a sustainable economic upturn requires business spending to be rising alongside consumer expenditure." "While Markit's Flash PMI survey data signalled a further robust expansion of private sector business activity in January, the latest reading was the second weakest for 11 months and points to GDP growth sliding to 2% in the first quarter," Mr Williamson added. "Companies also reported the weakest monthly increase in new orders since the recession, suggesting the pace of economic growth could weaken even further in February."	The world's largest economy expanded less than expected in the final three months of 2014 despite lower fuel prices boosting consumer confidence.
The home secretary wrote to cabinet colleagues in December seeking approval to "reduce significantly" one type of stop and search, Newsnight has learned. Despite setting a 12 December deadline, the changes are yet to be announced. Downing Street said the prime minister accepted reforms needed to take place. However, officials have refused to say when any decisions might be taken. Critics say stop and search unfairly targets the black community. In November, the Equality and Human Rights Commission said that, overall, black people were six times more likely than white people to be stopped, with Asian or other ethnic minority groups two times more likely to be stopped. On 4 December, Home Secretary Theresa May wrote seeking approval from the cabinet's home affairs committee to a "package of measures". This included a plan to "amend section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 so that the test for the power's use is 'necessary' and 'expedient', (to prevent incidents involving serious violence)". Under Section 60, police can stop and search someone for weapons in a designated area, for a specific time, without suspicion that the individual is involved in wrongdoing. However, a senior officer must hold a reasonable belief that violence has happened or may occur in the area. Mrs May told cabinet colleagues she intended to "raise the level of authorisation to a senior officer who must reasonably believe that violence 'will' take place (as opposed to 'may')". She continued: "I expect this to reduce significantly the number of stop and searches under section 60. Section 60 is only one kind of stop and search." One minister told Newsnight's chief correspondent Laura Kuenssberg that "we all want to get on" with the changes. But sources told her they feared "there's just a lack of will, a fear of looking soft on crime". The Liberal Democrats agree with the proposals and Labour has offered cross party talks to push the policy forward. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: "Instead of internal rows over this, Theresa May should accept our offer to work together to change stop and search." The prime minister's former adviser on youth and crime, Shaun Bailey, said: "Not getting stop and search right, certainly in urban communities, would be very dangerous because I believe it breeds criminals. "If I was talking to someone in government I'd say: 'Take the brave pill, you'll be rewarded for taking the brave pill and reforming stop and search'." He added: "There's many communities up and down the country who are divorced from politics and feel that the forces-that-be don't represent them and don't care about them. This would be a massive message in the right direction." While filming in Brixton, south London, Newsnight spoke to a teenager who said he had been stopped and searched as an 11 year-old. "Since then I've despised them [the police] more and more because for me they are like criminals in fancy dress," he said. "They've got such a big mob mentality." Another young man said he had been stopped and searched by the police "over 100 times" because he was "in a black neighbourhood" where the police "think everyone is a drug dealer". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe agreed that random stop and search powers had created distrust between some communities and the police in London. He said over the last two years the Met had reduced the number of stop and searches by over a third, while doubling the number of arrests to one in five. "We employ human beings, they make mistakes and when we make a mistake - particularly with someone who's innocent of any crime, and frankly never will be guilty of any crime - we leave a really bad imprint on that child, on that family, so it's important we get it right. "But I think it's an important power, that used wisely, is really effective."	Plans to limit police stop and search powers in England and Wales have been held up by "regressive" attitudes in Downing Street, senior Conservatives have told BBC Newsnight.
From her early days as a prodigious youngster, the career-threatening injury, the comeback and first world title to the iconic gold at London 2012. Then came Ennis-Hill the mum, a second world title and her final act, a silver at Rio. Minichiello has seen it all and tells BBC Sport why the "hard-working mum" deserves her place as Britain's greatest ever athlete. "How would I describe Jess in three words? A hard-working mum. "Leading into London she was an athlete first and foremost. But after her son Reggie was born she was a mum who did athletics. That is a lovely example, look at her, how she changed, she became just a mum with a hobby. "The World Championship medal in 2015 and the Olympic medal at Rio was more about doing something for her son; her son would see that and have an affinity with it. He is very sporty, and can throw a broom handle thinking it's a javelin. "He has seen his mum, whatever memory he may or may not have, he will have experienced what his mum's reputation will always be." Media playback is not supported on this device "I met Jess when she was nine. I was teaching on summer camps at the time and I saw this kid who stood out from her peers because she was just that bit quicker. "She only came down because her friend came down but she stuck with it and the friend went in a different direction. "Jess kept exceeding and exceeding expectations, people criticised her for being too small, said she'd never make it. They said my coaching was no good. But I was like 'no, come and see this kid, what she does, she is tenacious, a highly-competitive individual'. "She can be a pain, she is always ultra competitive. She gets it from her mum, even lobbing a drinks bottle into a bin from five metres. "Her best quality is her ability to be ultra competitive but be incredibly grounded and modest. She is critical of herself. She does not say 'look at me, the great I am'. She is modest and strives to be better and has an incredible work ethic. You could not ask for any more. She got her physicality from her parents and add that to the work ethic and competitive bit; bring all that together and you have lightning in a bottle. "She has always been sassy and was a cheeky little kid. But she has that determination to do better and never be satisfied with her performance." Media playback is not supported on this device "For me, the highlight of her career wasn't London 2012, but coming back from pregnancy and winning the World Championship in Beijing in 2015. "Number two would coming back from three stress fractures in her foot and winning her first World Championship in 2009 because that was potentially a career-threatening injury. The home Olympics was big but in my perspective overcoming adversity was better. "London was superb, but a bit surreal because the crowd were so supportive. It wasn't quite the same pressurised environment. Normally on the first day of a heptathlon it is three men a dog, but it was packed. "I have two great memories from London. The first was when she was introduced in the last heat of the 800m. They went down the line and when the announcer got to lane eight - Jess' lane - he was drowned out by the noise of the crowd. "The second was so many people staying in the stadium for the medal ceremony and singing the national anthem. It was the first gold medal and the first time the stadium heard the anthem." Media playback is not supported on this device "After Rio, I said 'go and take two or three months and make sure you're happy with the decision'. There will be no comeback, no Frank Sinatra moment, it won't be that, even though you get good odds for her to compete at Tokyo... the bookies were offering 10-1. "She had the shortest competitive preparation for Rio with injuries and it was not the most sensible competitive programme to try and retain an Olympic title. It had been a struggle, three injuries to get over and her body was not as forgiving as it was. She had this in mind when she made a judgement call about competing at the World Championships in London in 2017. Find out how to get into athletics with our special guide. "It was time. In fairness there is a new generation of British athletes coming through and the hope is they can step up and succeed. It's their moment, no need to dwell on the past, her time has been. "I will miss it, I like going to major championships, I like the buzz. But I have a whole new crop and hopefully have one or two who can make it." "If you look at somebody who in a career has won a medal at the youngest stage and gone all the way through to winning an Olympic medal, the changes that you had in that lifetime, that defines a career. "To come back from three injuries and to win a world title, again that would define a career. To win a home Olympics, again that would define you, To come back after pregnancy as a mum and how organise time and win a world title and Olympic medal, anyone of those individually would all define a career. To have done all four, that is staggering. "She is better than Daley Thompson, he never gave birth and came back and won, he trained and trained. To balance her home life and do that makes her the best British athlete ever." Toni Minichiello was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew Davis.	Coach Toni Minichiello has been by Jessica Ennis-Hill's side through the highs and the lows of her golden career.
From 21 June, EDF customers will see electricity prices increase by 9% and gas prices go up by 5.5%. The supplier previously increased electricity prices by 8.4% on 1 March, although it cut gas prices in January. The rise was immediately criticised by the energy regulator, Ofgem, which said it was hard to justify. The average dual-fuel customer will pay an extra Â£78 a year, bringing the annual bill to Â£1,160, EDF said. Combining both increases will mean that 1.5 million EDF customers will pay 18.1% more for their electricity this year. However, taking into account the previous cut, gas prices will remain flat, the company said. Most of its customers - 1.8 million - are now on fixed price deals, so will not be affected. Ofgem was highly critical of the increases. Dermot Nolan, its chief executive, said: "EDF's second price rise in four months, when there has not been a dramatic rise in wholesale energy prices since it last put up prices, is difficult to justify and is further evidence that the energy market is not working in all consumers' interests." Commentators said EDF customers on standard tariffs could save more than Â£300 a year by switching to the best fixed-price deal. "EDF has hit millions with a second shock price hike," said Archna Luthra, head of energy at MoneySavingExpert. "If you haven't compared and switched already, see this as a final red alarm bell to take action - what are you waiting for?" EDF said it would be contacting all customers on standard variable tariffs to review their situation. The company is also introducing a new three-year fixed deal. "I know that price rises are never welcome, but the industry is facing significant cost increases," said EDF's chief executive, Vincent de Rivaz. "To be a sustainable and responsible business, we aim to make a fair margin in supplying customers. This fair margin allows us to invest for the long term, in particular in good service, innovation and smart metering." Five of the big six suppliers have announced price rises this year:	Energy firm EDF is raising the price of electricity for the second time this year for customers on standard tariffs.
Yves Jego has launched a drive on the Change.org website calling for vegetarian alternatives to be compulsory in all schools. More than 73,000 people have so far backed the petition. The move comes after a town in eastern France banned all pork substitutes in school meals last week. The conservative mayor of Chalon sur Saone had earlier launched his own campaign on Change.org, reiterating France's secular values. His campaign has gained 2,750 supporters. "Messages of support and of encouragement have come from every corner of France and from French people of all backgrounds, faiths and professions," the mayor, Gilles Platret, wrote. A court in the city of Dijon last week rejected an appeal against Mr Platret's intention to ban pork substitutes. "Can we force a Catholic child to eat meat on Good Friday because nothing else is proposed, or a Jew or a Muslim to eat pork?," Mr Jego asked in his petition, set up in response to Mr Platret's. He said he would propose a law if the petition received 75,000 signatories. France insists on the separation of religion and the state, and in 2004 introduced a ban on headscarves in schools. France has five million residents of Muslim descent, half of whom are under the age of 24. It also has the largest Jewish population in Europe. A secular solution to the problem of school meals was possible, said Mr Jego, of the left-wing Radical Party. The petitions have led to a debate in some quarters on the nature of secularism and what is ethically correct. "Secularism is not the denial of religions and beliefs, but the respect of all religions," wrote Houari Zeidouni, who signed Mr Jego's petition. But France's Agriculture Minister, Stephane le Foll, wrote in a tweet: "Supporting French livestock with vegetarian menus: that's Yves Jego's programme! Let's be consistent."	A French MP is campaigning for vegetarian school meals to be introduced to help pupils whose religions prevent them eating pork.
Media playback is unsupported on your device 24 February 2015 Last updated at 20:27 GMT The 67-year-old, who was fearful of returning to his Gateshead home after the attack in January, has begun house hunting thanks to an online fundraising campaign that attracted donations of more than Â£330,000. But Mr Barnes, whose collarbone was broken when he was knocked to the ground, told Look North's Peter Harris he was not yet ready to meet his attacker, drug-user Richard Gatiss, 25.	Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes has said he is "ready to move on with his life" after a man appeared in court to admit assaulting him.
Police said he was James Gunn, from Stromness. Mr Gunn's white Ford Focus crashed on the A967 at Garson Farm, Shandwick, on Saturday morning. Police have appealed for anyone who saw the car between Stromness and Twatt from 04:15 to 05:30 to come forward.	A 32-year-old man who died after his car crashed on Orkney has been named.
The Mediterranean gull and black-headed gull eggs were illegally harvested from from islands in Poole Harbour, Dorset. The theft has been branded "sickening" by bird charity Birds of Poole Harbour. The group said some eggs - sometimes eaten as a delicacy - were not cleared for human consumption. Dorset Police and Natural England have launched an investigation. Natural England is urging any restaurants or pubs to ask to see a valid licence before buying eggs to prepare in meals. Birds of Poole Harbour had been surveying a group of islands in the harbour when the theft was discovered. Mediterranean gulls are classified as a Schedule One species, meaning anyone disturbing their nests must have a special licence. Paul Morton, who runs the charity, said Mediterranean gulls' eggs were not approved for human consumption, and could be a "health issue". "I'm distraught, really. To see the taking of hundreds and hundreds of eggs from an important colony is quite sickening," he said. Mr Moreton said there had been previous convictions for egg poaching in the last 10 or 15 years. He said continued monitoring was needed to understand the effect on the gull population in the harbour, which he said had fallen by 70% since 2008.	Hundreds of eggs belonging to a protected species of bird have been stolen from an important nesting site, with fears they could be sold to the restaurant industry.
"We are about a third of the way down the road," she says. Having been one the major players behind Manchester's recent cultural renaissance, she takes on the leadership of the Tate with palpable energy and ambition. Her intention, she says, is to change the Tate in the next 20 years as much as her predecessor - Sir Nicholas Serota - changed it in the last two decades. Given that he oversaw the transformation of the museum from a respected gallery in Pimlico (with a regional outlet in Liverpool) into a global mega art brand, it is a bold claim. Sir Nicholas built his Tate empire with bricks and mortar, refurbishing existing galleries and creating new venues such as Tate Modern. Balshaw will take a different approach with her expansionist agenda, focussing more on people rather than real estate. Roughly speaking, according to statistics collected by the newly-renamed Department of Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, around 50% of the British population visit a museum or gallery at least once a year, meaning - of course - 50% do not. These absentees are her target audience. She says: "We should absolutely reasonably expect 75% of the population to love the fact we have a national collection and feel happy to be visiting Tateâ€¦ and every young person should be given the opportunity to think and play and experiment in the spaces Tate holds. And that is a big, big shift." Her clarity of vision is impressive, but her ability to explain how it will be realised is less exact. She wants to usher in "an easier language to talk about the joy of art" but couldn't be specific beyond saying that arcane words should be either avoided or explained. She talks of a radical transformation in audience profile, of a lack of representation of people from BAME background among the staff and in the sector more generally. But when it comes to the organisation she is now leading, which is to be the agent for the change she desires, she says, "it's not that we need to change anything particularly". There is no doubt she is sincere in her ambitions, and probably more capable than most in the museum and gallery world when it comes to broadening the audience. But if she is to be successful in her aims she will need to take a leaf out of Sir Nicholas's job application for the Tate director's job back in the 1980s - in which he wrote that for the institution to change he would need to grasp the nettle.

Maria Balshaw wants to make the Tate "the most culturally inclusive institution in the world", which she thinks it is far from being at the moment.
There was no change of tone, no acknowledgement of any fresh message the voters had sent Mrs May, bar a passing reference to opportunity and fairness that echoed her speech on the same spot 11 months ago. It seems odd to me she didn't spend more of the election campaign talking about helping those who are "just managing" as she called them in her first (well-received) Downing Street speech. Her defiance extended to an insistence she would stick to the existing timetable for Brexit talks and her ambition produced the phrase "over the next five years". Perhaps she was just trying to steady the ship amid calls for her to resign. The Conservatives are notoriously ruthless with leaders who fail and I wouldn't put my mortgage on her still being in place for the conclusion of Brexit talks. Conservative MPs I have spoken to think she has done the right thing for now and that resignation would have increased the uncertainty with all the impact that would have had on financial markets. What does the loss of the Conservative majority mean for Brexit? That is harder to say. There is a growing argument that it means Mrs May will have to compromise more and go for a "softer" Brexit. But that ignores the sizeable numbers of Conservative and DUP MPs who favour a "clean Brexit" that would mean leaving the single market, the customs union and not paying into the pot after the UK has left. It also relies on the assumption that the remaining 27 EU countries are prepared to offer a choice of Brexit. In one of the most telling interventions of the election campaign, David Cameron suggested that the prime minister needed a large majority to prevent (rather than deliver) an "extreme Brexit". "It's so important," he said, "that the Conservatives win and win well, so Theresa can negotiate that Brexit deal, so she can stand up to people who want an extreme Brexit either here or in Brussels." A tiny majority - or no majority at all - would leave Theresa May having to secure a deal that would satisfy the likes of both Sir William Cash and Kenneth Clarke, a tall order in any circumstances. Unless Mrs May takes the advice of the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, who suggests she talks to other political parties to try to secure a cross-party consensus on what she called "an open Brexit". Ruth Davidson was one of her party's silver linings, leading the Conservatives to victory in 13 seats. Labour have pointed out that under 'English Votes for English Laws' those Scottish Tory MPs won't be able to take part in some Commons votes on health and education in England. That shouldn't affect the Conservatives' chances of winning votes in those areas as 46 non-Conservative MPs from Scotland would face the same restriction. As indeed would the new Tories' new friends from Northern Ireland. The Conservatives still have a parliamentary majority in England but its modest size means that controversial issues such as the expansion of grammar schools may struggle to pass through the House of Commons.	A visitor from another planet listening to the prime minister's speech outside No 10 on Friday could be forgiven for assuming nothing of significance happened the day before.
Ms Wood blamed the Conservatives in particular for claiming the SNP posed a threat to the future of the UK. She claimed "progressive" parties like hers were offering a "collaborative" alternative to "combative" politics. "This election presents an opportunity for harmonious co-existence between our nations," she said. Ms Wood's comments followed Conservative claims that Labour dependence on support from the SNP to form a government after the election on 7 May would threaten the break-up of the UK. Campaigning in south Wales on Monday, she said: "The parties advocating progressive, inclusive non-partisan cooperation in this election are not those who claim to cherish the political union above all others, but the national parties of Wales and Scotland. "Along with the Greens in England, our parties have provided people across these islands with a collaborative alternative to the traditional combative Westminster politics." Ms Wood added that she had received "hundreds" of supportive messages from people in England following the televised debates.	Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has accused rival parties of "dangerous and divisive rhetoric" in a "desperate" attempt to win votes.
UKIP is looking for a new leader following the shock resignation of Diane James, who had succeeded Nigel Farage after the EU referendum. MEP Steven Woolfe, who had been seen as the frontrunner, quit the party on Monday. He had been hospitalised after a "scuffle" with fellow MEP Mike Hookem. Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Coburn denied Mr Woolfe's claim that UKIP was in a "death spiral" and had become ungovernable. He said the incident between Mr Woolfe and Mr Hookem had been "regrettable" but had involved only two people rather than the whole party. Mr Woolfe has stood by his claim that he "received a blow" from Mr Hookem, though this has been denied by Mr Hookem. Mr Coburn said: "I keep saying it is country, party and self last. It is ideas that count, not individuals. What we are looking for is an agenda for the future, we are publishing it now and that is how we are moving forward. "Can I lead the party? Well, if I were asked by colleagues then of course I would do my best. But the thing is it is not about who is governing, it is to do with getting a group of people together, a collegiate group of people, who are going to run the thing." Mr Coburn said the party's libertarian politics meant people "can't be told what to do" but called on party members to "govern their own emotions and govern their own behaviour". He added: "What has happened is that we have had a charismatic leader for many years, who has kept a lid on things. "Now what you have got is you've got to choose a new leader. In that, you've lifted the lid off things a bit and it bubbles over." Mr Coburn, who is UKIP's only elected representative in Scotland, insisted there was still a reason for the party to exist despite achieving its core aim of having the UK leave the EU. He said he wanted to ensure the country was run "in the interests of the people not in the interests of big business or trade unions" and that he had joined UKIP because he wanted "radical change" to the way the country was governed, not just because he wanted to leave the EU. And he said he would "certainly not" be supporting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to keep Scotland in the EU single market after Brexit. Mr Coburn insisted: "We decided during the Scottish referendum on independence that we are part of the United Kingdom and in terms of that we voted in the European referendum, that was as a United Kingdom. "We entered as a United Kingdom, we leave as a United Kingdom. We voted as a United Kingdom, everybody knew that beforehand." Nominations to replace Ms James as UKIP leader close on 31 October, with the new leader announced on 28 November.	UKIP's Scottish MEP David Coburn has told the BBC he would "do his best" if colleagues asked him to stand for the party's leadership.
Ahead of the main procession, marchers and bands paraded around the city's historic walls. It is one of the biggest parades held in Northern Ireland and marks the anniversary of the ending of the Siege of Derry in 1689. Thousands of supporters from across the UK turned out to watch the 145 bands taking part. Having completed a circuit of the walls, members of the Apprentice Boys made their way to the Diamond for a wreath laying ceremony. A thanksgiving service, "to give thanks to God for the deliverance of the city," was then held at St. Columb's Cathedral. The memorial ceremony is held on the second Saturday in August each year, to commemorate the ending of the 105-day siege of the city in August 1689. Also known as William of Orange, or King Billy, the new monarch was supported by Protestants in Derry, who shut the gates of the walled city to keep out the advancing Jacobite army.	The annual Apprentice Boys demonstration has taken place in Londonderry.
The rare Tyrannosaurus bataar, 7m long (23ft), was bought by an anonymous bidder for more than $1m (Â£630,000) in New York. The sale went ahead despite protests from the Mongolian president. Elbegdorj Tsakhia says the skeleton, unearthed in the Gobi Desert, came from Mongolia and that exporting fossils found in the country is illegal. The auctioneers, Heritage Auctions, say the specimen was imported legally. A restraining court order in the name of the Mongolian leader was put on the sale. Tyrannosaurus bataar is an Asian cousin of the meat-eating Tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton in New York is thought to be one of the most complete and well preserved ever discovered, says the BBC's Jonathan Blake in Washington. "When it comes to dinosaurs, number one, dinosaurs in general are extremely rare. But the rarest of the dinosaurs are the carnivores, the meat eaters - the top of the food chain if you will," David Herskowitz, director of natural history at Heritage Auctions, told APTV. "And, of all the meat eaters that are out there, the most famous are the Tyrannosaurids. They are the most desirable, but they are the most elusive. They are the most difficult to find. Even though they are so big, there are not that many of them around." Found about seven years ago in the Gobi Desert, the T. bataar remained in storage in England. The T. bataar was slightly smaller and had longer arms than its cousin, Mr Herskowitz said. This is the second Tyrannosaurid to be sold at auction, says Mr Herskowitz. The first was a T. rex named Sue sold in 1997 for more than $8m. Lawyers for the auction house say the sale did not break any US laws - but it will not be confirmed until it has been approved by a US court.	A row has broken out over the sale of a dinosaur skeleton at auction in the US.
Instead of The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother, viewers tuning in on 7 May will see "Darren", the man in charge of keeping E4 on air, sitting in the channel's control room. It is believed to be the first time a UK channel has closed on polling day. E4 is one of the most popular youth channels on television, reaching 8.7 million 16-34 year olds every month. Its regular schedule will be suspended from 07:00 BST, when polls open, to 19:00 BST, when the channel will return to normal with Hollyoaks (polling closes at 22:00 BST). Dan Brooke, Channel 4's chief marketing officer said: "Less than half of under-25s voted at the last election so we've engaged the most powerful weapon that we have at our disposal to try and boost that number - switching off their favourite TV channel for the day." A pre-election advertising campaign, running on all of Channel 4's stations, will alert viewers to the reason for E4's absence. The adverts will ask viewers: "How many times have you missed life-changing events because you wanted to watch your favourite show? "May 7 is election day and Darren is going to turn E4 off so you might as well go and vote. You won't forget will you Darren?" However, viewers will only be able to use the switch-off as an excuse to vote if they have already registered - and the deadline has already passed. Meanwhile, Channel 4 will present an "alternative" to the election night coverage on the BBC and ITV, with a programme co-anchored by Jeremy Paxman and comedian David Mitchell. Paxman, who left BBC Two's Newsnight last June, said: "Elections matter. But that doesn't mean the coverage has to be dull. I hope there'll be room for both insight and laughter." David Mitchell added: "Our aim is to keep people watching much later than they intended and we will be judged by the dip in the nation's productivity on Friday 8 May." The show will also include special election-themed episodes of Gogglebox and The Last Leg. The BBC's coverage of the election will be anchored by David Dimbleby, while Tom Bradby presides over ITV's election show and Adam Boulton anchors Sky's coverage.	Channel 4 will shut down E4 on the day of the general election, in a bid to encourage more young people to vote.
It seems like only yesterday that the garages were locked and helmets hung up, as the sport emerges from one of the shortest winter breaks in its history. Lewis Hamilton's world title has barely had time to collect dust. The Mercedes driver and his winning team are this year's favourites too. Here's our guide to the 2015 season, with a little help from a former pit lane engineer. For the first time in five years, James Lyons will be watching the opening race at home with his dad. "I was senior electronics engineer at Marussia, I looked after everything from the lights in the garage to the control units in the car," explained the 30-year-old. James lost his job last November when the team entered administration. "I travelled the world but I won't be in the pit lane this time, I'll be sat on my mum and dad's sofa. It feels weird. "I'm really looking forward to the season." Alongside Lewis Hamilton, there are four other former F1 champions on the grid; Sebastian Vettel, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Raikkonen and Jenson Button. "I'm almost sure it will be either Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg in the Mercedes to win the title this year," said James. "They're likely to run away with it." Fernando Alonso, who has switched Ferrari for McLaren, will not be in Melbourne after being advised by doctors not to risk a second bang on the head. His place at Ferrari has been taken by Sebastian Vettel. "With a better engine and aerodynamic package they (Ferrari) could pull it out of the bag this year." Red Bull's junior team, Toro Rosso, have handed 17-year-old Max Verstappen his debut. The Dutchman is the youngest driver in F1 history. Mercedes are the reigning constructors' champions after winning 16 of 19 races last season. Their advantage seems to have been maintained if pre-season is anything to go by. Williams, Ferrari and Red Bull will be competing just behind them. It's McLaren you have to feel sorry for. Engine problems have hampered them after teaming up with Honda at the end of last season. "The Honda guys have got a big job on their hands trying to get that engine up to spec because the other teams have had much longer to work on theirs," said James. The 2014 season was littered with off-track drama. Caterham and Marussia entered administration which led to hundreds of job losses, as James knows only too well. "We had a big meeting at the factory in Banbury and the administrator said, 'This is it, we're closing the doors.' "I was absolutely devastated." While Marussia are back this season under the new name of Manor Marussia, there are clues the sport's finances have not been fully repaired. More just patched up with some sticky-back plastic. F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has given struggling teams an advance on their prize money, but Sauber, Lotus and Force India have all suffered cash flow issues during pre-season. "If the TV money was shared out a bit better then small teams like Marussia would stand a better chance," says James. "Some of the bigger teams get more money than other team's entire annual budget." Since 2014, an F1 car's power has been provided by a 1.6-litre turbocharged V6 engine. In total, each driver is provided with 13 sets of dry weather tyres, four sets of intermediates and three sets of wet tyres across a race weekend. But bosses are keen to increase the sport's appeal around the world and there are plans to widen the cars and tyres and make the engines more powerful. Those plans have not yet been agreed on and James says he doesn't like the sound of them. "Maybe that'll win back some of the old crowd, but they can't go down the route of trying to make the cars look like they did in the early 80s and 90s." F1 fans have 20 races to look forward to this season, starting in Australia and ending in Abu Dhabi in November. Samantha Charles is studying in Sheffield and plans to get up early to watch the opening race in Melbourne. "I love the adrenaline and anticipation of watching a race," she said. "The politics of last season were really disappointing and I think more money needs to be put in so these smaller teams can compete." As for her 2015 hopes, he says: "I want Jenson Button to win, but I think Nico Rosberg has a great chance of beating Lewis Hamilton." While Samantha will be watching on the sofa, Ollie Zorab from Somerset will be in Melbourne. "I paid about Â£130 for my ticket - and they're the cheap seats," he said. "It's going to stand out for lots of reasons because the spectators are really part of the race and all the Aussies are fully behind Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) in his home grand prix. "Everyone's excited and looking forward to it." Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter and Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube	Formula 1 is back this weekend.
Gillian Triggs told a senate committee that she had been asked to resign and offered a new role. The shadow attorney general has written to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) seeking an immediate investigation. The HRC released a report condemning the treatment of children in detention. Their report said that detaining children of asylum seekers violated international human rights law, and called for their release. Speaking to journalists in Sydney on Wednesday, Mr Abbott repeated his earlier statements that the government had lost confidence in Ms Triggs as president of the HRC. "What she does is a matter for her," said Mr Abbott in response to a question about whether she should resign. "As the secretary of the Attorney General's Department has made clear, she was not asked to resign and no inducement has been offered." On Tuesday, Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott launched a scathing attack on the HRC report, saying that it was a "political stitch-up". Earlier in a senate hearing, Ms Triggs said that she had been asked to resign during a meeting on 3 February by the secretary of Attorney General George Brandis' department. "I rejected it out of hand," she said, as quoted by ABC News. Ms Triggs told the hearing that the department's secretary, Chris Moraitis, had said that she would be offered another job with the government. She added that she had been "very shaken and shocked" by the "disgraceful proposal" and had reminded Mr Moraitis that she had a five-year statutory position. In a letter to the AFP commissioner, Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said: "The attorney general's offer to an independent statutory officer of an inducement to resign her position as president, with the object of affecting the leadership of the [HRC] to avoid political damage to the Abbott government may constitute corrupt and unlawful conduct." ABC News reported that Mr Dreyfus said that Ms Triggs preferred not to use the term "inducement" but that she had made it clear that the resignation request and the offer of a job had been connected. Local media reported that Mr Moraitis has denied asking Ms Triggs to resign but said they had discussed the possibility of her taking on another role. The attorney general admitted to the senate committee that he had lost confidence in Ms Triggs because of the timing of the inquiry into detained children, according to local media. He added that "as a matter of goodwill" he had told Mr Moraitis that he hoped that she could be encouraged to serve the government in other capacities. The HRC report, entitled The Forgotten Children, was published earlier in February. It said a third of detained children had developed mental illnesses of such severity that they required psychiatric treatment. The number of children in detention has fallen under Mr Abbott's government. He has questioned why the HRC did not launch an inquiry when the Labor government was in power and there were almost 2,000 children in detention centres. Successive Australian governments have been criticised over their harsh asylum policies, under which asylum seekers are detained for long periods in offshore camps while their applications are processed.	Australia's opposition Labor Party has asked police to investigate whether the government tried to induce the president of the Australian Human Rights Commission (HRC) to resign.
The inquiry was told Harry Clarke, 58, had been unconscious at the wheel of a bus in 2010 and during the bin lorry crash in December last year. Expert witness Dr Ronald Neville told the inquiry doctors did not note differing accounts of the 2010 episode. Mr Clarke told his GP he had fainted in the work canteen at First Bus. But the First Bus doctor was aware this happened while he was at the wheel of the bus. Six people died and 15 others were injured when the Glasgow City Council bin lorry veered out of control on Queen Street before crashing into the Millennium Hotel in George Square in December 2014. The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court is examining Mr Clarke's health, the condition of the lorry and the route taken. The court had previously heard that following the 2010 blackout when he was a bus driver, Mr Clarke was examined by Dr Kenneth Lyons, the medical advisor to First Bus. Dr Lyons subsequently sent a letter to Mr Clarke's own GP, which described how his loss of consciousness took place on a stationary bus and asked for further advice. Mr Clarke's GP, Dr Gerard McKaig, told the inquiry that the driver had said to him that he had fainted in the First Bus canteen. After he went on annual leave, Dr Lyons received a response to his letter from a Dr John Langan, who worked at the same practice as Dr McKaig. The letter said Mr Clarke had been "waiting for his lunch in a hot environment" when he fainted, and the driver was "unlikely to have another one". It concluded Mr Clarke was "fit to return to work as a bus driver". On Tuesday, the inquiry heard a second day of evidence from Dr Neville, a GP in Dundee, who also prepares expert reports on drivers' fitness to drive. He prepared a report on Mr Clarke after the bin lorry crash. Dr Neville told the inquiry that the "major discrepancy" in reports about the 2010 episode should have been caught by doctors. The expert witness said the letter that came back from Mr Clarke's GP's surgery lacked the detail or thoroughness you would expect from a healthcare professional. He said the First Bus doctor should have noted the major discrepancy in the account of the 2010 blackout and he should have got in touch with the other doctor. Dr Neville said that if either doctor had noted the discrepancy in Mr Clarke's account, an inquiry into the exact facts would have resulted. Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the bin lorry crash. Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed. The Crown Office has already concluded that there will be no criminal prosecution over the crash, with senior lawyers deeming it a "tragic accident". The inquiry continues.	The inquiry into the Glasgow bin lorry crash which killed six people last year has heard of a "lack of due diligence" from doctors in relation to the driver.
Nick Woodman described the remote controlled aircraft as the "ultimate" accessory for his firm's action cameras. He made the announcement at the Code Conference in California, where he also unveiled new kit to that helps capture video footage for virtual reality helmets. One industry watcher said GoPro's move into drones was "very significant". "It's the fact that the company has such a strong brand," explained John Stapley from Amateur Photographer magazine. "It's similar to what you can already see with action cameras. There are a lot of others out there but most people don't know they exist or don't have any interest in them because GoPro has become such a dominant name that it is 'the action brand' as far as they are concerned." The risk for the firm, he added, was that other drone manufacturers would opt to partner with other camera makers to avoid supporting a competitor. The world's bestselling commercial drone maker - China's DJI - has already decided to limit initial sales of its Phantom 3 flagship to a design that features its own proprietary video camera. The previous generation had been launched instead with an optional mount for GoPro cams. Mr Woodman said he planned to release the GoPro drone within the first half of 2016, and that it would be targeted at consumers. "Quadcopters have a special place for us at GoPro because I was a huge radio-controlled plane enthusiast as a kid and I could never really get anyone involved in it with me because it was either too geeky or it took a lot of time to learn how to fly these things - you'd crash them all the time," he said. "So, I was really surprised to see how quickly the general consumer was adopting quadcopters. "Quads plus GoPro has been one of the most democratising combinations in terms of enabling people to capture professional quality content and see themselves in their environment in a way that they'd never seen before. It looks like you're in your own movie." Drones are expected to be one of the fastest growing electronics sectors over the coming years. According to the US's Consumer Electronics Association, the global market for consumer drones totalled $84m (Â£54m) last year but is forecast to top $300m by 2018. The CEA adds that if regulators relax the rules for the use of such aircraft by commercial organisations, the market could further swell to $1bn by 2020. That could represent a lucrative new market for GoPro. The firm's existing cameras and other accessories generated $363m of sales over the first three months of 2015. That was up 54% on the previous year, but resulted in a relatively slim net profit of $16.8m. Mr Woodman also showed off a prototype mount that can hold six of his firm's Hero4 cameras, each pointing in a different direction. He said the resulting footage could be stitched together using software developed by Kolor - a start-up it bought last month - to create a single 6K-quality 360-degree image. This could then be used with virtual reality helmets - allowing a user to change their perspective by turning their head left and right and looking up and down - or via YouTube and Facebook, which are both adding support for interactive spherical videos. The Six-Camera Spherical Array add-on will go on sale later this year. Mr Woodman acknowledged, however, that the high cost of buying enough cameras to fill it was likely to limit the mount's appeal to professionals. At a subsequent event, Google also announced a more elaborate virtual reality capture device, which involves 16 GoPro cameras, as part of a tie-up between the two companies. The footage produced by the Jump camera array will be processed by the search firm's own software to produce panoramas, rather than spherical videos, that make use of depth data deduced by Google's algorithms.	GoPro's chief executive has confirmed it will make its own quadcopter drones.
The suppliers, one making seats and the other parts used in gearboxes, have stopped delivering to VW in a contract row. Car and parts production has already been halted at four plants and will be stopped at two others later this week. The carmaker said the interruptions in production would affect 27,700 staff. "Although Braunschweig District Court has issued injunctions obliging the suppliers to resume deliveries, the suppliers have not as yet met their obligations. Volkswagen continues its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers," said the company in a statement. The two suppliers are CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which makes cast iron parts used in gearboxes. They are demanding compensation from VW because they say they their incomes were hit when VW cancelled a contract. VW says it is continuing its efforts to reach agreement with the suppliers. The company said the production stoppage would not affect cars that have already been ordered. Any effect on future production will depend on how long the dispute lasts. Some production has already been halted at Wolfsburg, which makes Golfs, and at Zwickau where Golfs and Passats are made. Production is due to begin again later this week. Production has also stopped at Braunschweig, which makes chassis parts and plastic parts, but should start again next Monday. Later this week, production will cease at Salzgitter, which is involved in engine production, and Kassel where transmission and exhaust system production takes place. In what the company said was an unrelated issue, production was halted at Emden, which makes Passats, last week and will resume on Wednesday. In some cases employees have been sent home, in others they are engaged in short-time working on other jobs within the plants. The German Economy Ministry on Monday called on VW and the suppliers end the dispute. "We assume and also expect the companies to solve the sticking issues as soon as possible," Economy Ministry spokesman Andreas Audretsch told journalists during a regular news conference. He added: "It is about thousands of jobs, which could be affected by shorter work hours, and the responsibility to tackle these problems constructively is very high." VW in the UK issued a statement in which it said the company was "working intensively on minimising the acute supply risk, the priority being to maintain production in some areas and to ensure that deliveries can be made to customers. "Volkswagen currently expects to be able to adhere to all confirmed delivery dates," it added.	Volkswagen has halted production at several plants in Germany, hitting the output of Golf and Passat models amid a dispute with two external suppliers.
Three others were injured, one seriously, in the incident at Downsview Park, medical officials said. The collapse happened an hour before the gates were due to open for the concert, with queues already beginning to form outside. UK rock band Radiohead tweeted that the performance had been cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances". Emergency crews went to the scene and the area was evacuated. Toronto police said the stage collapsed at 16:00 local time (20:00). Police said the person who died was a man in his 30s, but did not reveal his identity. The victims were all part of a team involved with setting up the stage, officials said. Alexandra Halbert, who was working in a beer tent at the show, said she was about 200-300 yards away from the stage, with her back to it, when she heard "something that sounded like fireworks". "I turned around and the whole top part of the stage had collapsed, as well as the scaffolding," she told the BBC. "It seemed like there were a couple of minutes of hesitation and no one knew quite what to do. It was only afterwards that we all realised how serious it was." Jason Ip, a food vendor, said there was "chaos" as people waited for the emergency services to arrive. "A few people started running towards the stage. No one knew exactly what had happened, but it was clear that people were underneath the stage," he said. "It was like witnessing a car accident. In a situation like that, you just aren't sure how to react." Some 40,000 people were expected for the sold-out gig, which was also due to feature Canadian musician Caribou.	One person has died in a stage collapse before a Radiohead concert in the Canadian city of Toronto.
The University of Essex study of 712 Italian-American mafia members in the 1960s showed their income had risen by 7.5-8.5% per extra year of education. Those involved in complex crimes such as charging exorbitant rates for loans or extortion saw three times the boost of those who committed violent crimes. But, on average, the 712 left education a year earlier than other white men of a similar age in their neighbourhoods. "Criminal careers are known to start very early and are likely to be interwoven with schooling choices," the study says. Lead researcher Prof Giovanni Mastrobuoni said education tended to have a protective effect against getting involved with crime, but he added: "It is also true that if you decide to be a criminal it's better to be a better-educated one." The study says: "Private returns to education exist not only in legitimate but also in the illegitimate activities that imply a sufficient degree of complexity," "Mobster returns (in terms of income) to a year of schooling are around 7.5 to 8.5%, compared to 9-10% for the neighbour sample. "Moreover, for mobsters who, according to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics records, were involved in white-collar crimes that require running an illegal business (ie racketeering, loan sharking, bootlegging et cetera) we found returns to education that are about three times as large as for those who are involved in violent crimes (ie robberies, murders et cetera)."	Mafia criminals who are better educated tend to earn more, research suggests.
The British Embassy in Rabat said Roger and Mathilde Lamb from Pensham, near Pershore, died in separate falls. A spokeswoman said Mrs Lamb fell from a window of an apartment in the resort of Essaouira while Mr Lamb fell downstairs at a different building a few days later. They both died in hospital. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said the exact circumstances of the deaths were being investigated. The FCO is providing consular assistance to the family. In a statement, the couple's families said they were "deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths". The couple, who have four sons aged between 11 and 17, were staying in the Moroccan resort of Essaouira. Mrs Lamb's brother-in-law, Mark Rogerson, said the children were back in the UK being looked after by relatives. He said they knew very few details about what happened, but were aware of Mrs Lamb's death last Thursday and then heard about her husband's death on Monday. "We heard first of all that he was badly injured. And then on Monday we heard that he had died," he said. Mr Lamb, who was an engineer and a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was working in Christchurch, New Zealand, while his family remained at home in Worcestershire. The families said their main concern was for the couple's children. "Roger and Tilly's families have been deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths while on holiday in Morocco," the statement said. "Our principal concern at the moment is to provide love and support to their four sons who have had to suffer the loss of both a mother and a father in swift succession. "The boys are being well cared for by relatives. "We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the British consular authorities in Morocco for their invaluable assistance." The mayor of Pershore, John Grantham, said people who knew the couple had been saddened by the news. He said: "They're clearly very upset, it's been quite a shock." Mrs Lamb, who was known as Tilly, had relatives in Wiltshire. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police confirmed that her body was being repatriated to the county.	A couple from Worcestershire have died on holiday in Morocco.
Mr Navalny could now be barred from running in the Moscow mayoral election set for September. He also joins a growing list of opponents of President Vladimir Putin who have ended up on the wrong side of the law or in exile, or have met their deaths in suspicious circumstances. When Mr Putin first became president in 2000, he immediately set about curbing the power of the oligarchs - the group of billionaires who exerted huge influence over Russia's political system and media. His first victim was media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of NTV, a station that at the time was highly critical of Moscow's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and was home to the satirical puppet show Kukly, which mercilessly mocked the new president. When Mr Gusinsky refused to allow the Kremlin to influence NTV's editorial policy he quickly found himself charged with fraud in June 2000, and fled the country shortly afterwards. Within months, he was joined by his fellow media magnate and political fixer Boris Berezovsky. Mr Berezovsky is believed to have played a key role in helping Mr Putin into power in 2000. But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK. Mr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death. Perhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption. He has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as "prisoners of conscience". Mr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges. Political opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail. Two members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for "hooliganism motivated by religious hatred" after performing an "anti-Putin punk prayer" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal. Meanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012. Sergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence. Some members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences. Like Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin. Another member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres. But, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents. Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium. It is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin. Ksenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011. Since then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists. Mr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority. Shortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as "negligible". Ms Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.

Russian anti-corruption blogger and opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been jailed for five years for fraud, after a trial he says was politically motivated.
The body of Louis Thornton, 26, who played for Douglas-based Corinthians, was discovered at 05:20 BST on Saturday in his hotel room in James Street. Club treasurer Steve Corran said Mr Thornton, who had been on Merseyside to watch his beloved Middlesbrough play Everton, was a "big character" and a "leader, both on and off the pitch". Mr Thornton's death is not being treated as suspicious. In a statement, Corinthians said everyone was welcome at the club to pay their own tributes. Mr Corran said: "We would like people to come and visit the pitch where our Louis scored great goals, scruffy goals, put in crunching tackles, but most of all has given his family, team-mates, managers and fans so many memorable moments." Mr Thornton worked for an accountancy business in Douglas. Mr Corran, who was also his boss at work, said: "He worked hard and gave 100% in everything he did on and off the pitch."	The captain of a Manx football club has been found dead at a Liverpool hotel.
The bank said profits before tax not including those settlements dropped 10% to £1.43bn for the July-to-September period. The result comes a day after the bank confirmed Jes Staley would be joining as its new chief executive. Barclays said it had seen slow progress with its so-called non-core businesses, which it is selling. Losses for the package of businesses, which includes some investment bank assets and parts of the European retail banking operation, more than doubled to £337m. Barclays provided £270m to settle claims in the US over mortgage bonds and £290m to compensate clients over bad foreign exchange rates. For the businesses the bank plans to keep, including its UK High Street bank and Barclaycard, profit rose 1% to £1.76bn. Including the £560m hit, and other costs and gains the bank considers to be one-offs, third-quarter profit before tax fell to £861m from £1.22bn a year ago. Revenues dipped to £6.1bn from £6.4bn for the June-to-September period. On Wednesday, Barclays announced that Mr Staley will be joining the bank as its new chief in December. Mr Staley currently works for US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital Management, and previously has worked for JP Morgan. Barclays' previous chief executive, Antony Jenkins, was fired in July after falling out with board members. Mr Staley will be paid £1.2m in salary, £396,000 in pension contributions and as much as £5.5m a year in bonuses, which will mostly be paid in shares. He will also receive £1.15m in shares per year that he will have to keep for five years before cashing in. That is a total of £8.2m for the year, if he is awarded the maximum bonus. He will also receive shares in Barclays worth about £1.93m to replace shares in JPMorgan he will lose for leaving his former employer. In a letter to staff on Wednesday, Mr Staley indicated he would focus on areas of investment banking that did not require as much capital - the buffer of reserves it keeps to protect it from unexpected losses. Analysts said this could include such areas as merger advice and trading in stocks.	Barclays has reported a fall in third-quarter profits and set aside £560m for more customer refunds and litigation.
The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of €1.26bn (£1.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year. Sales jumped from €9.4bn to €10.5bn, an increase of 11%. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of "extending the service to other countries". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: "Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop." Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's "online drive" was important. "I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important," he said. "And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. "So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories." The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8% of new store space over course of the year. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals H&M and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year.	Profit jumped at Zara owner Inditex in the first half of the year as the firm opened new stores and invested in online.
The Potters' record signing, who arrived in January, powered home to give the visitors a half-time lead. Ibrahim Afellay struck a sweet second for Stoke, and substitute Joselu made it 3-0 two minutes later. Matt Ritchie responded immediately for the Cherries, but his left-footed strike proved to be a mere consolation. Media playback is not supported on this device It was Stoke's first away win in 2016 and only their second league victory in seven attempts. Mark Hughes's side move up to ninth in the table, five points off the European places, while Bournemouth remain 15th and four points above the relegation zone. Relive Stoke's win over Bournemouth Follow reaction to Saturday's games Stoke had been on the end of three consecutive 3-0 defeats in the league, and had failed to get on the score sheet for a month. But they looked clinical from the outset at the Vitality Stadium, even without Marko Arnautovic and Bojan in the side. Frenchman Imbula, who signed from Marseille for £18.3m on transfer deadline day, opened his Stoke account in only his second appearance by racing onto the ball and thrashing home. A superb counter-attack led to their second, as the impressive Jon Walters held the ball up before feeding to Afellay, who swept home his first ever Premier League goal. And only moments after coming on for the injured Glen Johnson, Joselu grabbed a third with a rising header after a pinpoint ball from Xherdan Shaqiri. Bournemouth enjoyed 62% of the possession in the first-half but failed to really test Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland - bar a looping effort from Charlie Daniels. Benik Afobe had scored three in five games since joining from Wolves in January but looked out of his depth at times, and only managed two touches in the box during the first 45 minutes. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe brought on Scotland international Ritchie for the second half, along with Josh King, and the wide pair made a huge difference going forward. Ritchie scored with a clinical effort from the edge of the box, and he almost grabbed a second from King's ball in, as Stoke struggled to cope without injured defenders Johnson and Marc Muniesa. But eventually the Cherries faded and they were unable to pull off an unlikely comeback, leaving them with back-to-back league defeats. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "They were quite compact and deep and I thought they were very respectful of how we played and the first moments of the game I was expecting us to have a really good afternoon but the goal seemed to change the game. Media playback is not supported on this device "I think the quality of their goals was really high and their first goal was a great strike, their third goal was very well worked but their second goal was the one I think we are really disappointed with." Stoke boss Mark Hughes: "It was a really pleasing away performance, we came here with a good game plan. "We conceded a bit of possession, more than we usually do but we felt we could get good opportunities on the break. With the personnel that we have got we could cause Bournemouth a problem."

A San Francisco judge has placed January's executive order in limbo, but the White House is vowing to appeal. San Francisco and Santa Clara County sued in February. The Trump administration has warned so-called sanctuary cities they could lose federal funds if they do not co-operate with federal immigration officials. On Tuesday, Judge William Orrick issued a temporary injunction against the presidential order as the case continues in the courts. "It's the 9th Circuit going bananas," White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said, in reference to the San Francisco-based appeals court, which conservatives often accuse of liberalism. Mr Trump's measure cast doubt on the transfer of some $1.2bn (Â£940m) for San Francisco and $1.7bn to Santa Clara County, home to many Silicon Valley communities. It is another legal defeat for President Trump in his efforts to curb immigration - his plan to curtail travel from seven Muslim-majority nations was twice blocked in federal courts. Lawyers for the federal government had argued in the sanctuary cities case that only funding related to law enforcement would be withheld. But Judge Orrick said any doubt about the scope of the "vague" order was erased by public comments made by President Trump, such as those calling the measure a "weapon" to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies. He accused the Trump administration of a "schizophrenic approach" to the order. The 49-page court ruling added that the plaintiffs challenging President Trump's order are likely to succeed in proving the order unconstitutional. "Federal funding... cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves," the judge wrote. However, Judge Orrick's ruling allowed the justice department to follow through with threats made to nine cities last week to cut specific programme grants if they do not adequately co-operate with federal immigration officers. In a press release last week, the department accused sanctuary cities of "crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime". There are several sanctuary cities across the US, including Mr Trump's home of New York. New York's Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Tuesday's ruling, saying the president went beyond his authority to cut funding to cities that "don't share his illogical and unconstitutional desire to scapegoat immigrants". Trump starts a 'sanctuary city' war with liberal America	The White House has labelled "bananas" a ruling that blocks President Donald Trump's order barring funding for cities that shelter illegal immigrants.

The state newspaper says the "suave" liquor will spare you wincing when you wake, despite boasting 30%-40% alcohol. The brew is reportedly made from a type of indigenous ginseng called insam and glutinous rice, and cultivated by an organic farming method. North Korean media is known for making often outlandish claims about its domestic achievements. Last year, it said medical products containing extracts from the insam plant could cure Mers, Sars and even Aids, NK News reported. The Pyongyang Times said the new alcohol "exudes national flavour", without dampening your national fervour the following morning. Among its other unique selling points, according to the paper - the spirit "is highly appreciated by experts and lovers". The newspaper article, titled, "Liquor wins quality medal for preserving national smack", says the Taedonggang Foodstuff Factory has been working for years on the elixir. The drink derives from Kaesong Koryo insam - a natural herb thought to have medicinal properties. According to the Pyongyang Times, replacing sugar with the scorched, glutinous rice removed the bitterness from the insam and, crucially, the hangover. "Koryo Liquor, which is made of six-year-old Kaesong Koryo insam, known as being highest in medicinal effect, and the scorched rice, is highly appreciated by experts and lovers as it is suave and causes no hangover," the article reads. The liquor "has already been registered as a national scientific and technological hit", it adds. Andray Abrahamian, who travels to North Korea on business for Chosong Exchange, told the UK-based North Korean News website that insam liquors were "OK"  but he is "not that keen on it as a tasty treat". "There are some high quality liquors made in North Korea, though in my experience there is no such thing as hangover-free booze anywhere in the world," he said.	North Korean scientists have invented a hangover-free alcohol, according to the Pyongyang Times.
Goalkeeper Manny Agboola, 18, will be on the bench after being recalled from a loan spell at North Leigh. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is likely to make changes again, as he did in the last round against Birmingham. Striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (knee) and midfielder Jack Colback (illness) could return. Oxford United manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford: "If we beat Newcastle, it would probably be as big a win for me as I've ever had as a manager. "I remember being manager of Blackburn in the FA Cup fifth round and we went to Arsenal and became the only team to beat them in a FA Cup tie at the Emirates. "That was some achievement as we probably spent about 80% of the game on the back foot. But for me, if Newcastle were in the Premier League right now, they'd be a top-10 team. "They've got a fantastic manager, are a great club with a winning mentality and with fantastic support behind them." Newcastle United boss Rafael Benitez: "We knew we had to make changes [in the last round against Birmingham] because we have so many games. "It is important to win, but using the squad and not taking too many risks with players was important. This competition is always difficult, but we will try to go through. "When you play against any team at this stage, especially away from home, it gives them extra motivation."	Oxford United could hand a debut to striker Toni Martinez after his loan move from West Ham, but forward Chris Maguire (thigh) faces a fitness test.
The children's laureate - always a well-known writer or illustrator of children's books - is chosen by a panel of judges from the book world. It comes with a bursary of Â£15,000, not to mention a shiny, silver medal. The role has a pretty loose job description - the laureate has to "promote and encourage children's interest in books, reading and writing". Jacqueline Wilson's "obsession" while she was children's laureate was to "get everyone to read aloud to children, all children, from the age of nought to 11". Malorie Blackman revealed that she spoke to over 20,000 teenagers when she was in the role but arguably her main achievement was setting up the UK's Young Adult Literature Convention, which now takes place each year as part of the London Film and Comic Con. Chris Riddell has spent much of his two years defending school libraries and librarians, and promoting the art of illustration at live events. In his final speech before he passes on the baton, he said the lack of investment in school libraries is a "blight on the intellectual development and creative future of all our children", as well as highlighting the issues faced by child refugees in the UK. Quentin Blake, the first children's laureate and best-known for his collaborations with Roald Dahl, produced a book called A Sailing Boat in the Sky in collaboration with 1800 French-speaking schoolchildren. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

The body was found near Heanor Memorial Park in Derbyshire. Derbyshire Police originally thought the man was 17-year-old Han Lan, but now believe it might be a 21-year-old man named Trung Thanh Hoang. The inquest also heard police think he may not have died at the park but that his body was dropped off there. Police officers are working with Vietnamese authorities to confirm his identity and to find relatives either in the UK or in Vietnam. The inquest at  Derby Coroner's Court heard it was believed the man visited a nightclub in Birmingham on Christmas Eve before returning to an address in Derby after feeling unwell. The cause of death is yet to be established but a toxicology report showed high levels of a number of drugs in his system. Police are still treating his death as suspicious. The inquest was adjourned until the end of March.	The identity of a man found dead in a car park on Christmas Day is still not clear, an inquest into his death has heard.
Chapelcross, near Annan, is one of five sites being considered but is the only one north of the border. Capenhurst in Cheshire, Sellafield in west Cumbria and Aldermaston and Burghfield, both in Berkshire, are the other possible locations. The consultation was at the Victoria Halls in Annan on Friday. Councillor Ronnie Ogilvie, who chairs the Chapelcross Site Stakeholders Group, said it was important as many people as possible took the opportunity to examine the proposals and express their opinion. The UK government has pledged that public opinion will be taken into account in deciding the final location. Consultation will run until February around all the locations on the shortlist. Ministers are planning that waste from nuclear-powered Royal Navy submarines which have left service would be stored at one of the sites until "some time after 2040" when the UK's deep level underground waste dump is available.	A final consultation event has been held on proposals to use a former Scots nuclear plant to store radioactive waste from redundant submarines.
The man named as Abdalfatah HA is suspected of being part of a unit with an al-Qaeda-linked group formerly known as al-Nusra Front, which killed 36 Syrian government employees in 2013. The federal prosecutors' office said the man, arrested in Duesseldorf, had carried out death sentences. A second suspected al-Nusra fighter was arrested in the town of Giessen. Abdulrahman AA is accused of breaking international weapons laws. Both are thought to have been part of the same combat unit for al-Nusra, which was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria at the time. The group formally severed its ties to the global jihadist network last year, renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. In January, JFS merged with four smaller groups to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. German prosecutors allege Abdulrahman AA, 26, and Abdalfatah HA, 35, took part in an armed battle against Syrian government troops including taking over a big arms depot near Mahin, central Syria, in November 2013, eight months after the murders of the government employees. Some local reports have claimed one of the men was an asylum seeker, but a spokeswoman for the prosecutors' office refused to confirm this.	A Syrian national has been arrested in Germany accused of war crimes involving the murder of dozens of civil servants.
The demonstration came after the deaths of several helpers in recent months. They also called for a pay rise, a limit on working hours and better accommodation. Eman Villanueva, spokesman for the Asian Migrants Co-ordinating Body, told the South China Morning Post:  "We are hopeful that our demands will be met." He added: "There are no reasons to reject them unless this is an anti-immigrant government." Early last month, a 35-year-old Filipino domestic worker fell to her death as she was reportedly cleaning the windows of her employer's flat. At least four other helpers are reported to have died this year from work accidents or suicide. "Cleaning windows from the outside is not a domestic worker's duty. It's a responsibility of the building management," said Mr Villanueva, himself a domestic worker from the Philippines. "It's necessary to have proper training and safety equipment to do that sort of job." The protest also called for a rise in the minimum wage for foreign domestic workers to HK$5,000 (US$645; Â£485) a month. The minimum wage is currently HK$4,210 per month, and employers are required to provide "suitable accommodation" as well as free food or a food allowance. The South China Morning Post quotes a study by the non-profit Justice Centre which suggests the average domestic worker in Hong Kong works nearly 12 hours a day, and nearly 40% did not have their own room. Mr Villanueva said there were domestic workers living in "boxes" similar to "dog houses".	Domestic workers have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to demand a ban on them being asked to clean windows in high-rise buildings.
I was a little surprised by all the fuss. On the whole, it has to be admitted though, that India is no stranger to comical brand names. Millions of men across the nation have marched into drug stores and asked for Manforce condoms. Meanwhile, housewives have purchased Stay On power capsules for their husbands, in the hope that they will. We've been using Cock brand fireworks for years. However, this does not mean that people from elsewhere can mock us. Every nation is home to some unfortunately named products. If you live in England, you should know that your nation produces Heinz Microwavable Spotted Dick, and has been doing so for many years. Somebody must be buying it. Your finer supermarkets stock Original Breast Munchies, which can also be ordered online. Meanwhile, people in Ghana are eating their French fries with Shitto sauce and washing it down with Pee Cola. You don't hear them making a fuss about it. So what if the Indian car name sounded similar to a lethal virus? Who are you to judge us? Rather than indulging in unnecessary mudslinging, this is a good opportunity to review the history of brand names in India, to see how we arrived at Zica. You could even argue that it's important, because the history of these names, and their evolution, is in some ways the history of a nation's soul. Our story begins in 1947, at which point we thought we were free. But it was not that easy. The British proved to be extremely hard to get rid of. Many of them lurked in the clubs, refusing to let others in. Others strode the chambers of commerce like colossi, until we plied them with gin and dragged them away after they fell to the floor, unconscious. When we were young and vulnerable as a nation, their malign influence was strong. Our favourite brands were biscuits and beverages, the sort which khansamas (cooks) served to their memsahibs, like Bournvita and Thin Arrow Root and Horlicks. Time has passed, but the shadow of the Raj has lingered. As we grew in confidence, we bought Indian-sounding Mysore Sandal Soap and Rooh Afza Syrup and Taj Mahal Tea, but a Raymond's suit was still better than a Dinesh. Sometimes this rising confidence could breed unfortunate hybrids, like the Premier Padmini. It was an automobile launched in 1974, and marched us boldly into the 1950s. The only thing Indian about it was the Padmini. Padmini was also the name of a popular actress, who shot through our lives like a comet, and dominated the dreams of many adolescents. As a boy I remember being highly embarrassed that our car was called a Padmini. As we breezed into the 70s and 80s, still oddly confident, we felt strong enough to challenge the might of Coca Cola, and came up with Thums Up, as a result of which almost no one in India can spell the word "thumb". Another local champion of the time was the Vijai Super Scooter, which ran on a mixture of petrol and kerosene, and sometimes made farting noises. All this gave you the national perspective, but there were also regional peculiarities. In my native Bengal, most brands have always been edible. Food is a big priority, perhaps because history has taught us that you never know when it will run out. My childhood was dominated by brands like Dulal's Palm Candy, Ganesh Brand Mustard Oil and Jalajog Sweet Curd, which was endorsed by poet Rabindranath Tagore: "After eating Jalajog Sweet Curd, I was extremely pleased." Gastronomical and pharmaceutical go hand in hand, which is why stomach remedies like Gelusil, Digene and Pudin Hara are also part of our sub-national psyche. As we moved into the 90s, the rest of the country, not as obsessed with stomachs, broadened its horizons. We remained convinced that foreign was better than Indian, but our definition of foreign expanded beyond Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus. We embraced brands that sounded like they were foreign, such as Monte Carlo from the city of Ludhiana, Da Milano from Kapashera (near Delhi), and La Opala from AJC Bose Road in Kolkata (Calcutta). An emerging subculture or subroutine was the "might be Japanese" category, with names like Onida and Okaya leaving just enough room for doubt. In this way, gradually, we got to know the world. We now live in a bold new era, where old rules are meaningless and assumptions are questioned. Products of today have rejected the tyranny of grammar and logic. I live right next door to a Kutz and Kurlz, and there are several Bathroom Shoppees within walking distance. The decision of Tata Motors to call its new car Zica has to be viewed in this socio-cultural and grammatical context. It was a bit of a boo boo, no doubt, but contextually correct. There is no need to worry. No harm will come of this. Tata Motors manufactures fine products, as do all the other manufacturers mentioned in this article. Whatever name they choose to give their new vehicle, it will surely smell just as sweet. Besides, we should not be so hasty in criticising names. We speak in many tongues. All names are open to interpretation, including our own. In India, names like Chokalingam, Vellasamy and Terry Mardi are perfectly acceptable in some parts of the country, but raise a wide variety of questions in others. So try not to rush into judgment. Just be grateful your name is not Anal Singh. Shovon Chowdhury's latest book, Murder With Bengali Characteristics, is set in a Calcutta occupied by China.	There was a minor sensation in India recently when Tata Motors launched a car named Zica.
A fire crew remains at Plasgran in Manea Road, Wimblington, more than 16 hours after the incident began on Wednesday afternoon. Road closures are expected to stay in place until midday, the fire service said. About 75 firefighters worked into the night to put out the fire. They also prevented its spread to neighbouring properties. The incident was scaled down at 2300 GMT, when the fire was brought under control.	An investigation has begun into the cause of a fire which has severely damaged a plastics factory in Cambridgeshire.
27 January 2015 Last updated at 14:30 GMT They show that the asteroid has its own small moon orbiting it. The asteroid passed by the Earth at a safe distance of 1.2 million km, giving scientists a rare chance to study it 'up close'. The new data shows that asteroid 2004 BL86 is about 325m across, and its moon is around 70m wide. Now that it has passed Earth the asteroid will continue on its orbit around the Sun, and it won't come this close again for another 200 years! The next 'close shave' of a large asteroid is due in 2027: that object is called 1999 AN10 and is just over 1km wide.	New pictures of asteroid 2004 BL86, which passed close by Earth yesterday, have been released by US space agency Nasa.
Ayoze Perez, Chancel Mbemba and Dwight Gayle scored in a comfortable victory, but it was Jack Grealish's 89th-minute goal which sealed the Magpies' title. Perez's flicked finish made it 1-0, before Mbemba smashed in to double the lead from a Perez rebound. Gayle added a late third before Grealish's goal handed them the title. It was a comfortable win for Rafael Benitez's side - yet it looked like it would not be enough to seal top spot, after Glenn Murray's penalty had put league leaders Brighton in front at Villa Park. However, despite being down to 10 men following Nathan Baker's red card, Grealish beat Brighton keeper David Stockdale to send the Magpies above Brighton in the table. At St James' Park, DeAndre Yedlin terrorised Barnsley down the right-hand side and it was his cross which Perez guided into the bottom corner to open the scoring. Christian Atsu forced Barnsley goalkeeper Adam Davies into two strong diving saves with powerful shots and Massadio Haidara smashed a good chance over the crossbar from Perez's cut-back as the hosts dominated. Davies kept out Jack Colback with his legs, but the Magpies got a deserved second when Davies pushed Perez's shot out perfectly for Mbemba to smash home his first goal for the club. Jonjo Shelvey struck the post before Aleksandar Mitrovic's header sent substitute Gayle through to complete the scoring with a confident finish past the onrushing Davies. Under manager Benitez, Newcastle brought 12 players to the club after dropping into the Championship last summer, with Matt Ritchie and Gayle moving down a division to sign five-year deals. With more than £50 million spent in transfer fees alone, the Magpies were under pressure to achieve promotion - a feat they managed with two games to spare. Benitez's side have battled with Brighton throughout the season for top spot, but since the Seagulls achieved promotion on 17 April they have dropped off the pace dramatically. Ultimately it is three straight wins for Newcastle and three matches without three points for Chris Hughton's side that has told, giving the Toon the perfect end to the campaign.

Kiel Hauley, 33, Jonas Marcius, 23, and Adrian Morley, 33, deny assaulting and murdering Craig Grant, of Inverurie, outside the Galleria shopping centre in August last year. Witness Shaun Wheeldon said he saw Mr Grant being held on the pavement. He said he was "shocked" to see Mr Grant's face was light grey. Mr Wheeldon told the High Court in Aberdeen he could see two men restraining Mr Grant on the ground outside Tonik and stopped to speak to a bouncer. He said:  "He just said he had been in the club and he was highly drunk." Mr Wheeldon said there was "quite a commotion" outside the bar with a lot of people standing outside. Advocate depute James Keegan QC asked: "How did you react when you saw his face?" He replied: "I was shocked at the colour of him. He was light grey." Mr Keegan asked: "When you saw the colour of him what did you think?" He replied: "That he was in a bad way." He said Mr Grant's friends were trying to intervene when police arrived at the scene because he had shown no response on the ground. He told the court police took over and tried to sit him up. He said: "They sat him up like a teddy bear. It wasn't a recovery position." Mr Keegan asked: "When you say a teddy bear what do you mean by that?" He replied: "Because he was limp." The trial continues.	A man was limp "like a teddy bear" after he was restrained by bouncers on the ground outside an Aberdeen bar, a murder trial has heard.
Media playback is not supported on this device Kubica suffered a partially severed right hand in a rally accident on the eve of the 2011 season and has not recovered enough movement to return. "I miss racing in F1, yes," he said in an exclusive BBC Sport interview before this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. "When you do everything you can to be an F1 driver and suddenly it stops, it's not painful but it's definitely not something you were looking for." Media playback is not supported on this device The Polish driver is competing this year in the European Rally Championship for Citroen and is doing work for the Mercedes F1 team in their simulator as he continues his recovery. He says he is still some way from being able to compete in F1 because of the restricted movement of his arm and fingers. "I have suffered big injuries in the rally crash," the 28-year-old said, "but I am still lucky I am able to drive on a high level, although not any more in F1. "Driving F1 would not be such a big problem, the problem would be to drive a complete race in all circuits but unfortunately that is not possible for now. "The problem in F1 is the space. Maybe one day if the FIA say the car has to be 10-15 cm wider, I can drive - but it is not that rally is second choice. "What is important for me is I am seeing progress. Even if in normal life I struggle with using the hand, [but] driving I see the progress, in the rally car, in the simulator. "The question is how far I will go and how long it will take but to be honest it really doesn't matter if it will take one month, one year or 10 years, maybe one day I will have chance to drive F1 again." Kubica, who won the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix for BMW Sauber and finished eighth in the world championship in his maiden season with Renault in 2010, was considered one of the very best drivers in the sport at the time of his crash. He admitted the past two years had been difficult for him to handle. But asked whether he was still in love with motorsport, he said: "I think more. I was always thinking I was very lucky to be in F1. "I spent a hard time after the accident for many months - I would say maybe even for nearly two years - not just because of the surgeries, the recovery and the pain but afterwards because when you recover you lie down in the hospital, you start missing it and then you realise how much maybe not love but affection you have for the sport." He added: "I paid quite a big price for a mistake but I could have paid a much higher price, that's for sure. "It is unfortunately part of this sport that you have to accept. If you are driving you are not thinking about this. If you don't accept, you don't do it." Kubica made it clear he still prioritised success in F1 over rallying but said he would not try to rush his recovery. He said: "What I learned is that because of my situation I cannot look too much forward. I have to look week after week, day after day and move forward, that's the most important."

Sexist, racist and homophobic remarks were being used by pupils against school staff, as well as offensive comments about appearance, the NASUWT said. There were also examples of parents being abusive on social media, it added. About 60% of 1,500 teachers questioned in a poll said they had faced abuse, compared with 21% last year. In one case, a photograph of a teacher was posted online with an insulting word underneath. In another, pupils used the name of a heavily pregnant school worker to post insults, the teachers' union said. Of those who had been subjected to insults, nearly half (48%) said these remarks were posted by pupils, 40% said they were put up by parents, and 12% said both parents and pupils were responsible. Almost two-thirds (62%) said pupils had posted insulting comments, while just over a third (34%) said students had taken photos or videos without consent. A third (33%) received remarks about their performance as a teacher, 9% had faced allegations from pupils about inappropriate behaviour and 8% had been subjected to threatening behaviour. More than half (57%) of pupils responsible were aged between 14 and 16, and 38% were 11 to 14, the teachers' poll found, with a fifth aged 16 to 19 and 5% were seven to 11. Among the examples published by NASUWT was the case of a student uploading a teacher's photo and then, along with classmates, writing insults underneath. One teacher had been harassed for nine months by students who sent sexually explicit messages and set up a fake social media account in the teacher's name. The union said it had been told of a teacher receiving the comment "I hope she gets cancer", while the heavily pregnant worker had faced abusive remarks. Another school worker faced comments from a pupil's family member about how they looked and that they were ugly. Chris Keates, the union's general secretary, said: "It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. "Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse. "The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and well-being, and undermining their confidence to do their job."	More teachers are facing abuse on social media, warns a teachers' union.
The personnel will assist in the temporary relocation of some staff from the US embassy in Baghdad. Fighters from the militant Sunni group ISIS have seized a number of Iraqi towns and cities in the past week. Separately the US says it is willing to discuss with Iran what measures can halt the advance of the ISIS rebels. However correspondents say that American officials have been quick to dismiss reports of military collaboration. Speaking on Monday to Yahoo News, Secretary of State John Kerry said that Washington would "not rule out anything that would be constructive" while emphasising that any cooperation with Iran would be conducted on a "step-by-step" basis. The UN says that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) rebels have carried out hundreds of summary executions. Human rights chief Navi Pillay said that systematic killings in the north of the country "almost certainly amounted to war crimes". Her remarks came as the militants, led by ISIS, were reported to have seized the strategic city of Tal Afar. Heavy fighting is also reported in Baquba, the provincial capital of Diyala province, on the north-eastern approaches to the capital. Rebels are reported to have taken over several quarters and captured the main police station, seizing many weapons. The rebels occupied several key cities last week, but some towns were retaken. Security in Baghdad has been stepped up after the insurgents threatened to march on the capital. The White House statement said that the main role of the 275 military personnel will be to help embassy staff to relocate to US consulates in Basra and Irbil. It added that 100 personnel would provide airfield management and security. "These US military personnel are entering Iraq with the consent of the government of Iraq," the statement said. "The US embassy in Baghdad remains open, and a substantial majority of the US embassy presence in Iraq will remain in place and the embassy will be fully equipped to carry out its national security mission." American officials quoted by the AP news agency have said that there is also a possibility of a limited special forces mission being deployed to train and advise demoralised Iraqi troops, although such a move has not yet been been given the go-ahead. Reports meanwhile have emerged that an army helicopter was shot down in fierce clashes near the city of Falluja, located just 70km (45 miles) west of Baghdad. Ms Pillay's comments came after Sunni militants posted photos online appearing to show fighters massacring Iraqi soldiers. In a video circulated online, ISIS fighters were also seen taunting captured troops with threats of decapitation. The Iraqi military earlier said the pictures were real, but their authenticity has not been independently confirmed. The US condemned them as "horrifying". The insurgents' lightning advance began last week with their capture of the cities of Mosul and Tikrit. Fighting in Tal Afar began on Sunday, with mortar shelling of some districts as the militants tried to enter the city in Nineveh province. Tal Afar, which has a mixed Sunni and Shia population, lies between Mosul and the Syrian border. The city of 200,000 people was taken just before dawn on Monday, Mayor Abdulal Abdoul told the Associated Press news agency. Eyewitnesses said militants in pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns and flying black jihadist banners were roaming the streets as gunfire rang out. But the government insists it still largely controls the town and that ISIS fighters would be swiftly dealt with, says the BBC's Jim Muir in northern Iraq. The prime minister of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region has told the BBC he doesn't believe the country will stay together. Nechirvan Barzani said it would be impossible for Iraq to return to the situation that existed before Sunni militants took control of the city of Mosul last week. The government on Monday said it had "regained the initiative" against an offensive by Sunni rebels. The defence ministry released footage on Monday which it said was of air strikes on ISIS targets north of Baghdad, including on Mosul and Samarra. The US earlier announced it might use drone strikes to halt the ISIS advance. The USS George HW Bush aircraft carrier has already been deployed to the Gulf, accompanied by two more warships. Britain reiterated on Monday that it had no plans for military intervention in Iraq. Iraq 'Massacre' photos: What we know	Up to 275 US "military personnel" are being sent to Iraq to provide security for the US embassy in Baghdad and other personnel, the White House says.
Gabriel Sakellaridis was speaking after Mr Tsipras won the late-night vote convincingly, but with more than 30 of his own MPs voting against him. The vote means the government lost its majority but is expected to survive. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the vote in a conference call. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed a €7bn (£5bn) "bridging" loan to help Greece pay debt interest due in several days. Live updates Under the terms of the bailout deal agreed in Brussels on Monday, the first tranche of legislation relating to tax and pensions had to be passed by Wednesday. The Greek parliament discussed the bailout deal beyond a midnight deadline into Thursday morning. Mr Tsipras won the vote by 229 votes to 64, with the support of some opposition MPs. See how events unfolded here The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says he has been weakened and will now need a reshuffle or a vote of confidence. Passionate opposition came from his own party, with parliamentary Speaker Zoe Constantopoulo calling the measures "social genocide". Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was another vocal opponent of the measures. Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis also voted against the package, prompting speculation they could lose their jobs in a reshuffle. In his address to parliament Mr Tsipras said: "I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them." He added: "The Greek people can understand the difference between those who fight in an unfair battle and those who just hand in their weapons." He also said it was a "positive development" that one of Greece's creditors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), had suggested that the bailout does not go far enough - and that some debts will need to be written off. Mr Sakellaridis said the vote was the first important step towards a deal and hinted that the government would try to remain in office despite losing its majority. "The basic priority of the prime minister and the government is the immediate and successful completion of the agreement," he said. When Eurozone finance ministers hold their conference call at 08:00 GMT they will discuss the next steps. Later, the European Central Bank's governing council will meet to discuss how to keep Greece's banks from collapsing. Greek banks have been closed for more than two weeks to reopen, with cash withdrawals limited to €60 a day. For Greece to secure its new funds, it must win the approval of the domestic parliaments of several of the other 18 members of the eurozone. Germany is expected to vote on the deal on Friday. Greece must also commit to a major overhaul of the civil justice system by 22 July and agree to more privatisation, to review collective bargaining and industrial action and to make market reforms, including Sunday trading. Thursday morning's vote approved: Opponents of the bailout measures took to the streets of Athens in mainly peaceful protests ahead of the vote. One group threw petrol bombs at police officers who responded with tear gas. Unions and trade associations representing civil servants, municipal workers and pharmacy owners also went on strike on Wednesday.	Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is focused on completing a €86bn bailout deal agreed with the eurozone despite setbacks in a crucial vote to push through tough reforms, his spokesman has said.
The two-time major winner last won at the Tournament of Champions in January 2016. Spieth carded a seven-under-par 65 in the third round to move to 17 under. Fellow American Brandt Snedeker (67) is second on 11 under, one ahead of Dustin Johnson and Kelly Kraft, who shot 66s. Spieth started the day in a share of the lead with world number one Jason Day and American Derek Fathauer on 10 under. Australian Day had a disastrous start with three bogeys and a double bogey in his opening six holes as he fell away with a three-over 75, while Fathauer signed for a 74. Spieth meanwhile was delighted with a return to form with the putter as he rolled in eight birdies, five on the back nine. "I hit my lines," the 23-year-old told Golf Channel. "It's been something I've been struggling with this year. "I've been striking the ball really well but my third and ninth place finishes were off of very average putting on strokes gained."	Jordan Spieth is on course to win his first PGA Tour title in over a year as he takes a six-shot lead into the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
The UK stage of the race comes to the city on 7 July. Cycling enthusiast Rad Wagon is recruiting people to knit 3,000 miniature "Tour jerseys" and wool-covered bicycle wheels. Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting and the council was "interested", he said. A similar "mini-jersey" idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race. The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them. "It's a bit copycat but we can do so much more," Mr Wagon said. "The city's well-known for its knitters and 'yarn bombers' who cover everything from bikes to trees to lamp-posts. It's 'very Cambridge'. "I think knitting is in Cambridge's DNA," he added. Mr Wagon, a cycling skills and bicycle maintenance trainer from Outspoken Training in the city, said he was a fan not only of the Tour de France, but the cultural activities surrounding it. "It isn't just a bike race. Its history is all about promoting your town and region and that's something we can do. "The world's eyes will be on us and it's a chance for us to show that Cambridge can do things slightly differently, and perhaps slightly oddly," he said. A knitting shop owner has offered to give knitting lessons and collect the tiny pullovers, Mr Wagon said. A cycle shop in the city has also offered a collection of battered wheels which Mr Wagon hopes can also be turned into knitted decorations. He said he was discussing suitable places his knitted bunting might go, with the city council.	A man who admits he "cannot knit a stitch" is hoping to cover the streets of Cambridge with knitted bunting and wool artwork during the Tour de France.
Prof Simon Wessely, said he was "genuinely surprised and incredibly honoured" by the award. He now heads the department of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London. He became interested in "medically unexplained symptoms and syndromes" early in his career, and studied chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) - or ME. In 1991 he was involved in setting up one of the first NHS clinics for people with CFS symptoms and in the mid 1990s, he started to investigate Gulf War Syndrome. This disputed condition had been linked to personnel who served in the first Gulf conflict in 1990-91. Reported symptoms ranged from chronic fatigue, headaches and sleep disturbances to joint pains, irritable bowel, stomach and respiratory disorders and psychological problems. Prof Wessely has said there may not be a distinct illness. He said: "Gulf War Syndrome is a misnomer," he said. "Rather it's an illness or health effect. "We established something happened, but we found no specific cause. "The fascinating thing is that it didn't happen again in Iraq, and the reason for that remains enigmatic." Prof Wessely continues to study the long-term effects on those now serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he said that there had been improvements in the mental health care for armed forces personnel and those close to them. "There is now improved psychological support, particularly for reservists and families." He was among a large number of researchers, charity workers and NHS staff to receive honours. Other health experts recognised included Stephen O'Brien, Chair of Barts and The London NHS Trust, who also receives a knighthood. Respiratory health expert Prof John Britton and Caroline Shaw, chief executive of Manchester's specialist cancer hospital, The Christie are among those made CBEs. One of those is Caroline Shaw, who is appointed a CBE for her work running The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester. A former midwife, Ms Shaw was one of the youngest female NHS chief executives when she took over at the Christie in 2005. She said: "I am incredibly proud... It is such a huge honour to be recognised in this way for my work in an industry I believe in and care passionately about."	A leading researcher into the mental health of military personnel has been knighted in the New Year's Honours.
Media playback is not supported on this device Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee. Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot. Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on. After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign. It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start. Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners. Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table. And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar. Dundee however restored their two-goal advantage as once again the visitors defence was breached. Hemmings had a shot on goal that was glanced into the top corner by Loy giving Gary Woods no chance in the County goal. The first-half action though was far from over. Schalk latched onto a long through-ball and although Dens keeper Mitchell got his hand to the shot there was enough The second half failed to live up to the opening period but there were still plenty of chances created at both ends. Gardyne blasted high over the crossbar from 12 yards out while Ian McShane saved on the line from Dundee top scorer Hemmings as the home side looked for goal number four. County survived a scare when Hemmings managed to get a touch on the end of a Stewart free-kick but the ball trickled only a few inches the wrong side of the post. The home side secured all three points with four minutes left when Wighton hammered the ball home after Stewart's shot was blocked. Stewart completed the scoring when he once again fired home with a cultured left-foot shot that beat Woods. Hartley's side are now in pole position to secure a place in the top six for the season run-in.	Dundee leapfrogged Ross County and moved into the Premiership's top six, prevailing in a hugely entertaining Dens Park encounter.
Umpires Ian Gould and Richard Illingworth, the former Worcestershire and England slow left-armer, made several inspections. But the previous day's incessant rain had left an already wet outfield totally sodden at New Road. Overnight frost on the covers also led to melting ice dripping onto the pitch. The two sides still hope to get underway promptly on Monday morning (11:00 BST). Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason: "We can't do anything about it. It's one of those things that is out of our control. "We have given the ground a good chance to dry out today and it has not quite done it. Player safety has got to come first." Kent captain Sam Northeast: "It's extremely frustrating. After four weeks of preparation in pre-season, we get to the first day and we are unable to play and the sun's out as well. "The boys are raring to go, so it's pretty disappointing. We hoped for the best but looking at the ground this morning, we knew it was going to be tough to get on."	Worcestershire and Kent spent a frustrating first day of the new County Championship season before play was called off in mid-afternoon.
The prime minister "is committed to free school meals in England", an official spokesman told the BBC. The coalition government introduced the meals a year ago for all pupils in the first three years of school in England. But there has been speculation the meals are at risk, after Chancellor George Osborne demanded cuts of between 25% and 40% from unprotected budgets. The spokesman said the prime minister had made the point that "it was in the manifesto, the manifesto words are very clear - we're proud of what we've done with free school meals". The Conservative manifesto says: "We will support families by providing free meals to all infants". The chancellor called for the cuts in July, as part of his spending review, due to be published in November. The free school meals budget has cost about Â£600m each year, and there had been speculation over its future. But the Department for Education has indicated that free school meals will be protected in the spending review. "We believe that every child, regardless of their background, should have the same opportunities," said a spokesman. "That is at the heart of what we are doing with school food. "No child should be hindered because they are not eating a nutritious meal at lunchtime. "We have provided significant financial support to schools to help them deliver universal infant free school meals. "We have come a long way, and the new School Food Standards mean pupils of all ages are eating good food that sows the seeds for healthy eating for life." At the weekend some 40 top health professionals signed a letter warning that scrapping the meals could harm children's health. "It would be short-term thinking indeed for the government to cut the funding for universal infant free school meals," said the letter. The National Association of Head Teachers called for "a swift and unequivocal statement" from government that it would honour its general election pledge to fund a meal for all infant children. "That message could and should be delivered straight away," said NAHT general secretary, Russell Hobby. "Schools signing contracts with catering companies this term can't afford to wait until the November spending review only to find out the policy has been changed."	David Cameron has dismissed speculation free school meals for all infant children could face cuts.
Ceredigion-based Lewis Coaches, which runs buses from Aberystwyth to Cardiff via Carmarthen, is to shut on Friday. The Confederation of Passenger Transport Cymru said 40 jobs were at risk. Ceredigion council said it was working to continue some services. The authority said plans were already in place to see the on-demand Bwcabus service and the 588 and 585 routes from Aberystwyth University to Lampeter taken over by other firms by Saturday. But the council said it understood the 701 Aberystwyth - Carmarthen - Cardiff service would end on Friday and it did not know if another operator would take it on. Lewis Coaches is the third bus company in Wales to collapse in the past two months, with 300 jobs lost when Wrexham-based GHA Coaches went into administration in July and Pembrokeshire firm Silcox Coaches, ceasing trading after 134 years in June.	Some bus services in mid Wales facing the axe because the firm which runs them went into administration could be maintained, a council has said.
Giving people the right to buy their council houses and shares in previously nationalised firms such as British Telecom and British Gas were among the initiatives that won her much support. But some believe that other changes, such as those that made mortgages and credit much easier to get, sowed the seeds of future crises that still affect many to this day. Here, BBC reporters look at some of the changes that, for better or worse, have changed our finances forever. By Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter, BBC News. The Right to Buy Scheme for council houses was one of Margaret Thatcher's most popular policies. It was enshrined in the Housing Act of 1980, making it one of her first major pieces of legislation after she came to office in 1979. The number of people who bought their council house from their local authorities rose to 200,000 by 1982, and again peaked at 180,000 in 1989, her last full year as prime minister. Since the Housing Act came into force, it is estimated that some two million homes have been sold to former council tenants. The sale price was based on market valuation, but included substantial discounts, depending on how long a tenant had been living there. When Labour came to power in 1997, it reduced the value of such discounts in areas where councils were running short of housing stock. Critics said the policy resulted in speculators buying up valuable housing stock too cheaply. The Right to Buy Scheme was extended in the March 2013 Budget, as the government vowed to increase sales once again. By Simon Gompertz, personal finance correspondent, BBC News Before Mrs Thatcher arrived at No 10, British passports contained a special page to record the amount of cash travellers took out of the country. The page was one of the first things to be scrapped by the new government, as the Tories moved to abolish exchange controls. The Chancellor, Geoffrey Howe, raised travel allowances to £1,000 per trip and permitted overseas property purchases of up to £100,000. On the tax front, the basic rate was cut by 3p to 30p in the pound, while the highest rate came down from 83p to 60p. But Thatcher's chancellors not only cut income tax, but also changed the way we pay tax. To fund lower taxes on incomes, up went tax on most things shoppers bought. VAT, or value added tax, jumped from 8% to 15%. Within a few years, the basic rate of tax had fallen to 25%, while the higher rate had been slashed to 40%. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor With money from tax cuts in their pockets, shoppers began to rediscover the "feelgood factor". They were encouraged further as credit was unleashed. Restrictions on hire purchase offers were relaxed, stores offered credit, credit cards boomed. Consumer borrowing tripled during the 1980s. And, of course, mortgages were easier to get. The old rule of thumb that you only borrow two-and-a-half times salary was thrown out of the window. Building societies were allowed to lend more and foreign banks set up in the UK to compete. The Bank of England did not control the expansion of credit and there are those who see the roots of the current financial crisis in the credit boom of the Thatcher years. Mrs Thatcher wanted self-reliance, not reliance on the state. That was the thinking behind the launch of personal pensions in 1988. The new plans provided a route to save for those who did not have a company scheme. But, sadly, they backfired. The promotions and publicity got out of hand. Advisers went to town, encouraging savers to switch out of solid traditional schemes into riskier personal pensions. Compensating the victims cost the pensions industry £11bn. More successful were personal equity plans or Peps, designed to encourage savers to salt away up to £6,000 a year in shares, in exchange for a tax break. To complement Peps, John Major, the last chancellor of the Thatcher era, introduced a tax-free vehicle for cash savings, the Tessa. The idea caught on. Peps and Tessas later morphed into individual savings accounts, or Isas, in which Britons have £390bn salted away. By John Moylan, employment correspondent, BBC News Few senior trade union figures have commented on the death of Baroness Thatcher. That silence speaks volumes for the lasting legacy that her reforms had on the power of the movement. She was ushered to power in the wake of the Winter of Discontent when a wave of strikes paralysed many parts of the economy. Rubbish was piled high in the streets as  collections stopped. And famously, gravediggers went on strike. The Conservative government set about a series of changes to employment and trade union laws, which ended mass picketing, secondary action and the closed shop, where staff had to join a union to get a job. Secret ballots were introduced, as were restrictions on holding legitimate disputes that still rankle with the unions to this day. In 1979 there were more than 29 million working days lost to strike action. These days, that number is typically well below one million. The miners' strike of 1984-85 came to symbolise the government's battle with the unions. The year-long dispute over pit closures led to repeated scenes of violence as striking miners clashed with police. In the end the miners went back to work. The balance of power in industrial relations had shifted forever. Unions insist that the collapse in traditional manufacturing industries during the 1980s did as much to diminish their power. Membership fell from over 12 million in 1980 - today there are fewer than 6 million members of Trades Union Congress-affiliated unions. One of the first actions of the Labour government in 1997 was to repeal the ban on unions at GCHQ - the Government Communications Headquarters - imposed under the Tories. But under New Labour, the main planks of the reforms of the Thatcher years remained unchanged. By Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter, BBC News A policy of privatising the UK's large utilities revolutionised share ownership in the UK, and as such it was widely popular with many, though the initiatives also had their critics. The recession of the early 1980s created the environment that allowed the Conservatives to drive forward the idea of moving nationalised industries into private ownership. By the end of its first term, it had already privatised British Aerospace and Cable & Wireless. British Telecom, British Airways, British Steel, as well as water and electricity firms were among those privatised later. This led to a new wave of first-time shareholders in the UK. One of the first privatisations and arguably the most memorable - through a celebrated advertising campaign - was the sell-off of shares in British Gas in 1986. The promotional campaign featured TV adverts in which characters urged each other to "tell Sid" about the chance to buy shares at "affordable" prices. Anyone who has held on to these shares will now have a portfolio that includes a stake in Centrica, BG Group and National Grid. Privatisation was key to the Thatcher government's economic policy. As a result, it hoped that the large subsidies granted to industry over the decades would be eventually phased out, allowing for further tax cuts and controlling borrowing. It also encouraged the idea of members of the public owning shares in big former monopolies. Yet, figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the percentage of the UK stock market owned by UK individuals was higher in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of value, than the 1980s. In 1981, 28% was owned by UK individuals. This had fallen to 20% by the end of the Thatcher term in 1990. Yet it fell to just over 11% by the end of 2010. By Rebecca Marston, business reporter, BBC News The impact of one of Margaret Thatcher's deregulation drives was the drastic reorganisation of the way shares were traded in the UK. The so-called "Big Bang", introduced on 27 October 1986, made it far simpler to trade shares on the London Stock Exchange. The most visible reform was that traders no longer stalked the floor of the Exchange, animatedly dealing with each other face-to-face. Big Bang moved them at a stroke from that to screen-based and telephone trading. It also broke up what many saw as a gentlemen's club, ruled by restrictive practices. (It is worth noting that there were almost no women and the gentlemen described came from a far wider class base than the phrase suggests.) Before Big Bang, share dealing was done through a stockbroker, who advised clients on dealings. Transactions were carried out by jobbers, who made markets in shares - physically seeking out others with whom to trade on the Stock Exchange floor. Price competition was not allowed, fixed commissions were the norm. At best it was a self-regulating club, where bounders could easily be spotted, but at its worst this club fostered insider dealing and share price ramping. Big Bang saw many of the City's historic names disappear in a frenzy of takeovers as banks jostled to buy  jobbers and stockbrokers in order to become one-stop shops. This, in turn, unleashed a succession of takeovers by even bigger organisations, the giant American finance houses. Big Bang helped facilitate privatisation, demystifying the share-buying process that many ordinary people had found a stumbling block, thus allowing people to simply walk into their banks and order a parcel of shares. But while it made dealing and investing easier, it also paved the way for the creation of giant financial institutions, whose size has meant their health is critical to the wellbeing of the general economy.	During her years as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher revolutionised the economic fortunes of every person in the UK.
Luke, 18, is one of 14 successful candidates from the 282 youngsters who entered the Fighting Chance scheme. GB Taekwondo chief Gary Hall said that, like his sister Jade, the teenager is "a good character". Hall added: "He hasn't got the tactical game finesse his sister has but he has a lot of the basic ingredients." The 14 who made the cut will undergo a three-month training regime before fighting at the Austrian Open in June. Performance director Hall added: "This group is really strong. We have done [the Fighting Chance scheme] four times and this has got to be one of the strongest intakes we have had. "They will go on a three-month programme, including participation in the Austrian Open, to see how they perform. "If they are really making progress in the system then we will continue with them." Find out how to get into taekwondo in our special guide.	The brother of Wales' double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones has been signed up by the sport's Great Britain academy.
Salvador Sobral's success with Amar Pelos Dois (Love for Both of Us) has made him a national hero. Wearing a plain black suit he delivered an emotionally charged song without the theatrics that often accompany other Eurovision acts. Previously Portugal had never got above the sixth place that it reached in 1996. It was a triumph for "brand Portugal", music journalist and advertising executive Manuel Falcao told the BBC. "The Portuguese language is present worldwide but sometimes it's hard for the national identity to make an impression, so for the brand this is very nice - people are very happy," he said. The timing was fortunate for Portugal, as the nation shows signs of recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and a massive bailout from its eurozone partners. "Polls show people are more optimistic here than three years ago, the economic indicators are not strong but positive - even by EU standards," Mr Falcao said. Eurovision success "coincided with a good mood in Portugal - we won the Euro 2016 football championship and tourism here is beating all records", he said. He cautioned, however, that one song would not make a radical difference. It was a doubly memorable weekend for Portugal, as Pope Francis drew a vast crowd to the Fatima shrine, where he made saints of two Portuguese children. Their visions of the Virgin Mary in 1917 turned Fatima into a top Catholic pilgrimage site. There is national pride that Sobral's song Amar Pelos Dois touched so many hearts, in a competition dominated by English lyrics. "The language, more than the Portuguese language, was music," Sobral said. The song was crafted by his sister Luisa, an accomplished singer-songwriter and music college graduate, with several CDs to her name. A fellow Portuguese music expert, Sofia Vieira Lopes, said the song's triumph proved that lyrics were not fundamental to a musical message. "It shows that it's not necessary to sing in English to understand the music," she told Portugal's Publico daily. Salvador Sobral criticised the commercialisation of pop, after his Saturday night triumph in Ukraine, speaking contemptuously of "fast-food music". "This is a vote for people who actually mean something with their music," he said. "Music is not fireworks, music is feeling." The state tourism authority, Turismo de Portugal, is thrilled by the boost to the country's image. "We are in the spotlight," its president Luis Araujo told the daily Diario de Noticias (DN). He characterised the winning song as "simplicity, transparency, honesty". The melancholy, bittersweet lyrics include the lines: "My darling, listen to my prayers / I beg you to come back, come back to love me / I know we can't love alone." There was a poignancy to Sobral's performance, as he has struggled with a serious heart condition. His success shows there is still a market for national musical traditions, despite the dominance of Anglo-American pop culture. Portugal requires broadcasters to observe a quota of Portuguese-language songs. France and Spain have similar quotas, to showcase home-grown talent. Even before the Eurovision final Sobral's song was hugely popular in Portugal, Mr Falcao said. Yet English remains the default pop language, even in Portugal, he said. And Salvador Sobral himself has recorded covers of American hits - in English.	Portuguese are celebrating the fact that an intimate love ballad in their language conquered a Eurovision song contest audience for the first time.
Susan Fowler, a software engineer, wrote a blog post about a "very, very strange year at Uber". In it, she says her manager tried to have sex with her on her first official day at work, sending her messages about his open relationship. It's just the latest blow for a company that has gained a reputation as a bastion of Silicon Valley's macho "bro" culture. But is Uber really any more sexist than other tech giants in the Valley? Ms Fowler's claims have resonated with many women in the tech world, and surveys suggest her experiences are not uncommon. According to a 2016 survey, 60% of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances. The "Elephant in the Valley" survey found that 87% of the 220 women interviewed had witnessed demeaning comments from their colleagues. Almost 40% of those who said they were harassed at work did not report the situation, fearing it would damage their careers. "I was propositioned by a hiring manager early in my career when I was a job candidate," one contributor to the study wrote. "He clearly indicated that if I slept with him, he would make sure I was promoted as his 'second in command' as he moved up the ladder in the company." Another said she had turned down her CEO's sexual advances the first time they travelled together for work. "After that, I was never asked to travel with him again," she said. "This impacted my ability to do my job." The study followed a high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015 from former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao - one of those praising Ms Fowler's stand against Uber. On Twitter, Ms Pao said Ms Fowler's blog post shows "the state of tech in one woman's story, also the story of many women, many people at many companies". Sexist van slogans banned in Australia Meet the female gamers challenging sexism Are universities secretly sexist? Discrimination is difficult to quantify - especially when victims are unwilling to speak out. Yet on top of Ms Pao's case, there have been several high-profile lawsuits and sudden exits in the tech world in recent years: Comparing results from different studies with different questions can be problematic - but there are some hints that Silicon Valley has a problem. Statistics on sexual harassment vary widely, but an extensive 1992 US national study found that 41% of women had experienced it; and about 40-50% of women in the EU, according to the United Nations. Both estimates are still lower than the Silicon Valley survey's 60%. The 2016 Women in the Workplace study - a major US national survey - found that 19% of the technology sector's top executives are women - broadly in line with sectors like banking, media, or professional services. The same study found that, across all industries, 30% of women who negotiated for a promotion or a better salary were told they were "bossy", "aggressive" or "intimidating". In the Elephant in the Valley survey, that rocketed to 84% of women being told they were aggressive (though that question was not specifically about negotiation). The world's biggest tech companies know they're dominated by white men, and many are funding schemes to address that. In its annual diversity and inclusion report, Apple said it had closed pay gaps over the past year by analysing salaries, bonuses and stock grants. Facebook has pledged to give $15m (£12m) to Code.org, a non-profit group teaching young women and underrepresented minorities how to write computer code. 31–33% of the three biggest tech brands' employees are female - but what about their actual technical staff? 19% of Google's tech workforce is female, compared to 31% within the whole firm 23% of Apple's technology staff are women - and 32% of its global total, including retail 17% of Facebook's technology team are women, it says - and 33% of all its staff And in 2015, Google told USA Today it would invest $150m (£120m) in workforce diversity initiatives that year, up from $115m in 2014. At the moment, 23% of Apple's tech employees are women. At Google, it's 19%. And at Facebook, just 17%. Change comes slowly in companies of this size, so the path could be a long one. But by broadening the pool of people qualified to work there, Silicon Valley is hoping to change the status quo.	Taxi-hailing app Uber has promised an "urgent investigation" into claims of workplace sexual harassment, after a female engineer said misogyny was rife at the firm and women were quitting in droves.
Sally Chidzoy said she was targeted after raising concerns when an MP appeared to convince a senior colleague to drop one of her stories. She further alleges she was "falsely imprisoned" by management during an attempt to seize her phone. Ms Chidzoy also claims she was sexually discriminated against and victimised. The tribunal in Cambridge was told Ms Chidzoy, who works as BBC Look East's home affairs correspondent, had been investigating East of England Ambulance Service boss Anthony Marsh's salary package. She said the story was dropped after assistant editor Steve Silk received a late-night email from then-Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb in July 2014. Sent from a private account, it noted Mr Lamb's "real concern about the potential damage" the story could have on the service. Giving evidence, Ms Chidzoy said she had discovered a "very close" relationship between Mr Lamb and Dr Marsh and she felt the MP was "attempting, in my view, to stop a broadcast". "He should not be doing this and leaning on the BBC and its duty to be impartial and independent. "[It was] a direct attempt to interfere with an ongoing piece that had not yet been broadcast." Representing the BBC, Sophie Belgrave disputed the suggestion Mr Silk had been influenced by the email, saying he would have done it in a "clandestine" way had this been the case. She said: "If he was going to give in to political interference from Norman Lamb on the sly, they would just do it." Disciplinary proceedings were launched against Ms Chidzoy after she raised the issue of the MP's interference and after an email from Mr Lamb to Mr Silk was leaked to a Sunday newspaper. Bosses subsequently attempted to seize her phone and "falsely imprisoned" her at a meeting in September 2014, the tribunal was told. Ms Chidzoy said she investigated another story about the Centre for Business and Public Sector Ethics, which was receiving money from the Chinese government. She was informed BBC Look East editor Nikki O'Donnell was the "organisation's press spokesperson", the tribunal was told. Ms Chidzoy said: "The problems I encountered involved what I believe is internal corruption and poor management." She also alleges she was subjected to a covert investigation by ex-Met police officers at the BBC investigation unit while the proceedings were ongoing. The tribunal continues.	A BBC TV reporter was the victim of a "witch-hunt" after blowing the whistle on political interference, a tribunal has heard.
The 19-year-old woman was attacked between 20:30 and 21:00 on Wednesday. Officers cordoned off an area of the park as part of their investigation, and were believed to be following a positive line of inquiry. Anyone with information was asked to contact Police Scotland.	Police are investigating the rape of a woman in Queens Park in Glasgow's Southside.
The official violated the International Paralympic Committee's (IPC) ban on political gestures. Belarus' neighbours Russia are banned from the Games following state-sponsored doping. "A hero has appeared amongst us," said Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry. "This is the person who showed solidarity with people who were disgracefully treated in an inhumane way in not being allowed to compete at the Paralympics," Zakharova told Interfax news agency. The official, identified by Russian media as Andrei Fomochkin, has had his accreditation for Rio cancelled by the IPC. IPC head of media Craig Spence said: "I'd like to thank the media for ensuring there was a picture of the individual on Twitter pretty quickly. We managed to locate that individual and confiscate the flag pretty much within 20 minutes of the flag being displayed. "It's seen as a political protest because he carried a Russian flag when he's in the Belarus delegation, and when you've got the president of the Belarus National Paralympic Committee being so vocal in the media before these Games saying he disagreed with our decision, then it's a pretty easy conclusion that it was a political protest. "We check all teams before they go out into the stadium at every single Games, so that flag was pretty well hidden on that person because all of the Belarus team was searched before they went out and the flag was somewhere on the person that we didn't notice." Fomochkin has received support from Belarus for his gesture. "This was the right thing," Dmitri Mironchik, press secretary for Belarus's Foreign Ministry, told RIA Novosti. "If we need to answer for these gestures, then we will answer."	A Belarus official who carried a Russian flag into the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games has been banned from the competition.
The New Zealand fighter failed to impress against the Romanian who took the bout at two weeks' notice, winning a 119-108 117-110 117-110 decision. The champion landed sporadic flurries throughout but never looked like scoring a stoppage in Auckland. He has said he will campaign overseas, with Britain's WBA and IBF champion Anthony Joshua a potential opponent. Though he remains unbeaten in 23 fights, the manner of this win may make Parker a tougher sell for pay-per-view audiences overseas. The 25-year-old - who claimed the vacant WBO belt against Andy Ruiz in December - did land some shots when in close to Cojanu but when at distance he looked incapable of finding ways to rock a man three inches taller and around two stone heavier. Cojanu, who now has 16 wins and three losses to his name, was one of Parker's sparring partners but stepped in to the main event when Britain's Hughie Fury withdrew through injury. Cojanu landed a left hook of his own in the 10th round and chased a stoppage win in the 12th. But, in truth, he always looked occupied with spoiling Parker's work, most notably when having a point deducted for leaning on the champion's neck in the fourth. Parker said afterwards: "You can all see why we bring Razvan into camp for us. He put on a great fight. "I've done my best to keep fights here in New Zealand but it's down to us to go and get some exposure overseas now."	Joseph Parker defended his WBO heavyweight title for the first time in a drab points win over Razvan Cojanu.
Files were found after the attacks on a computer dumped in a rubbish bin, a well-placed source confirmed. The computer also included a final message from one of the airport bombers, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui. Belgian authorities have identified all 32 victims who died on 22 March. Seventeen were Belgian, and the other 15 from around the world. Another 94 people are still in hospital, and dozens of them are in intensive care. The first funeral has taken place, for Raghavendran Ganeshan, whose body was returned to the Indian city of Chennai on Tuesday. The discovery of the computer emerged the day after the Brussels attacks. It had been abandoned in a bin in Max Roos street in the Brussels area of Schaerbeek. The three suspects captured on airport CCTV had left a house on the same street by taxi and the driver had later guided police to the address, where explosive materials were found. Quoting reliable sources, De Tijd newspaper said earlier that files on the computer contained details and photos of the prime minister's building and office at 16 Rue de la Loi (Wetstraat in Dutch) as well as details of his official residence in Lambermont street. It is unclear if these were downloaded from the internet or taken by the bombers themselves. A spokesman for Mr Michel said security had been strengthened well before the attacks last week because of concerns the buildings were vulnerable. The chancellery is also next door to the US embassy and on the same street as Maelbeek metro station, where Ibrahim el-Bakraoui's brother blew himself up little over an hour after the airport attack. The computer has become a vital source for Belgian investigators searching for the third airport suspect, who is thought to have fled the airport when his suitcase did not explode. In his final message on the computer Ibrahim el-Bakraoui complained of being hunted and not feeling safe anymore. Copies of laptop hard drives linked to suspects in the Brussels attacks have been sent to the FBI, according to reports from the US. Brussels airport remained closed for flights on Wednesday, after a test involving hundreds of staff. The airport operator said no flights were planned until at least Thursday afternoon as the results of the trial were still being assessed. A temporary check-in area has been installed along with enhanced security measures. But officials say they will only resume flights when they are able to operate at 20% capacity, Chief executive Arnaud Feist has said it will take months to reopen fully, as the departures hall will have to be rebuilt "from the air conditioning to the check-in desks". Several airlines have diverted flights to Liege, Antwerp Ostend and Charleroi. However, Brussels Airlines is running only 40% of its flights and says it is losing €5m a day because of the closure of Brussels airport. In a separate development, an open letter written by police at the airport has been published by Belgian broadcaster VRT, in which they express frustration and say security was not taken seriously enough. They complain of a shortage of staff and say the airport's "open infrastructure" meant that trains, buses and cars were able to approach and leave the airport without any control.	Jihadist bombers who attacked Brussels airport and metro last week also collected building plans and photos of Prime Minister Charles Michel's office and home, the BBC has learned.
Humberside Police, said Darren Lee Barton was assaulted outside the Rutland Arms on Saturday. He was taken to the Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby after the incident at about 18:00 BST, but died on Wednesday evening. Nathan Newland, 27, appeared before Grimsby and Cleethorpes Magistrates' Court on Tuesday charged with section 20 wounding and producing cannabis. He was remanded in custody until 22 August when he is due to appear at Grimsby Crown Court. Police said a post-mortem examination had yet to take place to establish the cause of death.	A 46-year-old man has died after he was attacked outside a pub in Grimsby.
The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try. A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead. South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence. It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired. No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter. This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43% possession. The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead. And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through. After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone. South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners. Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold. When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on. The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal. Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner. With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned. Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe. Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides. Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end. Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless. However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: "It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure. "We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes." South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: "Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions. "We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side."

Belmont, a Grade II* listed building in Lyme Regis, has been restored following eight years of research and two years of restoration work by the Landmark Trust charity. It was owned in the 18th Century by Eleanor Coade, who built up a successful artificial stone business. The building will open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Dr Anna Keay, director of the Landmark Trust, said the rejuvenated building was "a fitting monument to the genius of Eleanor Coade". She added: "Visitors will now be able to stay in her Georgian architectural gem and in so doing experience the beauty and peace that inspired one of our greatest modern writers, John Fowles." Belmont was Fowles's home for almost four decades from 1968, and it was where he completed his classic novel The French Lieutenant's Woman. The Landmark Trust's craftspeople have recreated any damaged or missing items at their studio in the Cotswolds, such as fireplaces, architraves, shutters and skirting boards. Coade stone was a ceramic, synthetic stone that was first produced during the 18th Century. Like the trust's other 195 buildings, Belmont will be let out for short breaks.	A Georgian seaside villa in Dorset, where author John Fowles lived, will open its doors after a £1.8m revamp.
This hard-fought-for policy united local political parties, but doubt now hangs over it. There are several reasons why. Firstly, although the legislation is in place, it needs a final green light from government. The Northern Ireland Executive must demonstrate its finances are on a sustainable footing. Does a potential £490m blunder over the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme undermine that? This is, perhaps, arguable. We are talking about finding £20-30m a year for 20 years to cover an RHI overspend, a small part of a £10bn annual block grant. But the crisis has put other hurdles on the horizon. The Northern Ireland Assembly must pass a rate recommended by the finance minister in the year before it applies. How soon will there be an executive or assembly the other side of an election? And will there then be a greater reluctance about paying for corporation tax with a £200m cut to the block grant? Any return to direct rule from Westminster might not offer an immediate solution either. European Union state aid rules apply until Brexit and they only allow devolution of corporation tax to a region which has "institutional autonomy". It is premature to pronounce Northern Ireland's big economic idea as dead. But in the here and now, things look mightily challenging - can Invest NI promote a rate and a date to overseas companies with any certainty? Even before the political crisis, some experts felt 2018 was ambitious anyhow for companies to adapt to new rules. And all the while, the main UK rate of corporation tax is falling, blunting the attractiveness of what Northern Ireland wants to offer.	Northern Ireland's political crisis could kill off plans to cut corporation tax to 12.5% in April 2018.
To the strains of the late reggae star's One Love, Mr Obama was shown around the sprawling house in Kingston that was Mr Marley's final home. The US president said he was a fan of the musician, telling his museum guide: "I still have all the albums." Mr Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. But his first stop after landing in Kingston was the old Victorian-style house in central Kingston that Mr Marley called home between 1975 and his death in 1981. Mr Obama spent 20 minutes in the museum, which now houses artefacts from the singer's life including gold records and his Grammy Lifetime Achievement award. His arrival aboard Air Force One on Wednesday made him the first sitting US president to set foot in the country since Ronald Reagan visited 33 years ago. He was greeted by Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and the US Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno. Mr Obama will meet representatives of the 15 countries in the Caribbean Community group on the three-day trip to Jamaica and Panama, and is expected to discuss energy and security issues.	Barack Obama has taken a tour of the Bob Marley museum in Jamaica after becoming the first US president to visit the country since 1982.
Olly Martins said the force, which has to save Â£7.5m over the next two years, spends Â£3m a year on its buildings. But changes in policing technology meant officers could now share facilities, he added. The Police Federation said it would be concerned that officers in shops may look "unprofessional". Mr Martins said many of the county's police buildings were in need of refurbishment and no longer in the best position to serve the public, while others were under used. An online public survey opens on Friday to asses residents' views. The survey answers will help gauge support for replacing some stations with more accessible facilities in public areas such as public buildings and supermarkets. The PCC said operational policing was already running at maximum efficiency, so he must look to other areas. Changes to modern policing due to the use of technology, meant "innovative ways of increasing access to the police while reducing overheads" could be considered, he added. "In the future officers will be able to carry out much of their communications and administrative tasks while on the move, which reduces the demand on premises and increases their visibility," he said. He said no decisions had been taken yet but "tough choices" needed to be made. Ray Reed from Bedfordshire Police Federation, said he was not resistant to change, but "had concerns" over response times and perception. "People already complain about response times and if you close down stations it will make things worse," he said. "Plus I would be worried about how police would be perceived in supermarkets, it may look unprofessional. "And [in public buildings] there is a risk element as you may get someone becoming aggressive in full view of the public. "[Police carry out] sensitive functions in the community and we have to think how and where we place them."	Some Bedfordshire police stations could be relocated to supermarkets to help bridge a funding gap, its Police and Crime Commissioner said.
The changes come as part of what the police force has called the "biggest shake-up" in policing in years. The PSNI said the teams will "deal with community problems" and give "advice". The first LPTs to launch will be based in Lurgan and Armagh city police stations in County Armagh. They will be supported by four mobile neighbourhood policing teams (NPTs). The roll-out of all 26 LPTs is expected to be completed by 1 October. Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said policing in Northern Ireland is in a process of "transformation" due to "significant budget pressures" and new council structures. He said "normal policing will carry on" and the new teams will respond to calls, conduct investigations, and "deal with community problems". "They will provide advice and reassurance and spend time learning about what most affects communities in order to work with them to improve safety and quality of life," he said. The 34 NPTs, which will be based in areas with higher levels of crime and deprivation, are to be set up with the aim of providing "an additional dedicated policing presence, reassurance and commitment to communities where it is most needed". ACC Martin said restructuring means the number of police stations currently in existence is under review. "The reality is that nearly all policing services are delivered outside of stations," he added. "Policing isn't about buildings it is about officers working with the community in the community."	The Police Service of Northern Ireland has started to phase in local policing teams (LPTs).
This time the poll was held under a new constitution, designed to prevent a repeat of that violence when more than 1,000 people died when supporters of rival candidates clashed. They have been choosing a president, members of parliament and senators, the new posts of county governors and members of county assemblies. The presidential contest is seen as a two-horse race between Prime Minister Raila Odinga against Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta. BBC correspondents around the country sum up how the voting went. The queues in some places stretched for more than a kilometre, as voters in Kibera stood patiently in line. The neighbourhood is one of Nairobi's largest slums. It is the constituency of Raila Odinga, one of the favourites for the presidential contest and the scene of some of the worst violence following the last election in 2007. Today, many had arrived before dawn, waiting patiently in line, sometimes for hours. Voters cast their ballots into colour-coded boxes - six each - for a variety of different representatives, local and national. The memories of five years ago are still fresh and, as the campaign drew to a close, a sense of apprehension was palpable. Police talked of conspiracies to cause chaos and warned that violence would be met in kind. But, in Kibera at least, as the sun grew hotter and the umbrellas came out, the mood was up-beat. "Peace, peace," one crowd shouted as a truck of paramilitary police trundled past. We came across a man with dreadlocks and a pot of white paint. His message, "Peace wanted alive", can be seen daubed on walls and roads around the neighbourhood. The real test of peace, though, is likely to come once all the ballots have been cast, and the results start coming in. As the sun begins to set, the heat is easing and some polling stations are still open after the official closing time of 17:00, with queues of people determined to cast their vote. Tensions have been running high in this insecure and arid region near the Somali border and there has been a heavy security presence at the polling stations - with between five and 10 armed police officers on guard. On Sunday night one people died in an explosion and another person was shot dead in what is believed to be election-related violence. Some people began queuing at 05:00 - an hour before the polls opened. But there has been frustration in the long queues, with some buying water to pour over their heads to cool themselves down and others sitting under umbrellas. The biometric voter ID systems have not worked at the polling stations in this north-eastern town so electoral officials have had to resort to the manual voters registers. The computerised fingerprint and facial identification was introduced after the last election to prevent fraud. This slowed the whole process down, as has the fact that about 60% of voters have needed assistance to cast their ballot as they are illiterate. One woman with a baby on her back told me that after waiting until she got to the front of the queue, she found her name was not on the roll, even though she had a voter registration card. Hundreds of people ended up giving up. One man who could not find his name after lining up in three queues over 12 hours told me he was going home without voting. In the centre of Mombasa many people lined up from 05:00 to ensure their place in the queue and avoid the sweltering temperatures that characterise the coast. A cluster of white gazebos went some way to protect the early voters from the sun and the six colour-coded ballot boxes that sheltered beneath. Nearly half a million voters are registered in Kenya's second city, with another half a million making up the surrounding counties. This is historically "opposition" territory but under the complex arithmetic of the presidential vote, the candidates cannot afford to ignore this part of the country. Many voters queuing patiently described it as an "historic day" - the first time Kenyans are voting under a new constitution. But further along the coast, election day was marred by technical hitches and sporadic violence in a handful of flashpoints. Faulty biometric voting kits caused delays in Mombasa West. In Changamwe, half an hour's drive from the city, four police officers were hacked to death with machetes by a gang, who the authorities claim were members of the separatist Mombasa Revolutionary Council (MRC). The group had urged voters to boycott the polls in protest at what they see as the marginalisation of Mombasa, but few seemed to heed that call. The crowds outside Changamwe's main polling station had swollen to several hundred by midafternoon: Women with their babies strapped to their backs and men with beads of sweat running down their brow, seemingly undeterred by the attack that took place shortly before polls opened. Many people in the crowd outside Changamwe Social Hall which was turned into the local polling station seemed unconvinced that the group was to blame. Kenya has had a long history of violent elections and areas deemed to be opposition strongholds like this, are used to what people describe as "powerful forces" seeking to scare people away from the polls. But this time there is a palpable determination to prove to the world that Kenya is on a new democratic path. A whistle stop tour by the new Inspector General of police to the "scene of the crime" helped to provide reassurance in what has otherwise been a peaceful poll. Too busy tweeting to vote? Q&A: Kenya’s 2013 elections In pictures: Kenyan elections There were also disturbances in the town of Kilifi, where two civilians were among six shot dead. Although the violence that flared up was in isolated areas, it got Khalef Kalifa from Muslims for Human Rights anxious.As an election observer he said police seemed "ill prepared" for any clashes and that in some polling stations computers were not working and "in one polling station a voter had to come and show the presiding offer how to use the computer". But election officials promised voters they would keep the polling stations open to compensate for earlier delays. By the time the evening call to prayer could bear heard echoing out from the mosques of Mombasa, Festus Mwanzia was number 27 in the queue.  He had waited patiently in line for nearly 12 hours. "I'll be home by 10," he chirped confidently. "Just in time to catch the results on TV." Many people here know the biggest test is yet to come once the tallying gets under way. In the western town of Eldoret, the provincial capital of the Rift Valley where much of the post-election violence occurred following the December 2007 election, voting started early in the morning with enthusiastic voters arriving as early as 05:00. There were long queues, some stretching for a kilometre. At the MV Patel polling station which has the highest number of registered voters in the region, people complained that the process was too slow. In Shinyalu, in the rural Kakamega district - between Eldoret and Kisumu - the area's former member of parliament, Justus Kizito, was ambushed in the early hours of the morning and his Range Rover was burnt to ashes. He says the attack was political and forced to flee for fear of his life before the mob set the vehicle on fire. At Kosachei Primary School near Eldoret, William Ruto, a suspect at the International Criminal Court from the Kalenjin community and running mate to presidential candidate and fellow indictee Uhuru Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, cast his vote at 07:30. Afterwards he told me that should their Jubilee coalition win, they would co-operate with the ICC in the hope of clearing their names. The two, who were rivals during the last poll, both deny charges of orchestrating the violence following the 2007 vote. At the Kiambaa polling station - just a stone's throw from the ill-fated church where more than 40 Kikuyu people who had sought shelter there were burnt alive on 1 January 2008, when it was set ablaze by a mob of armed Kalenjin youth - most voters were happy to have cast their ballots in peace. Paty Chelegat, a Kalenjin mother of two, told the BBC: "There is peace in Kiambaa area and indeed the entire Uasin Gishu county and my joy is that I have voted peacefully and [I am] hoping that all will be well even after the results are announced." Peter Kariuki, a father of four, said despite losing his relatives in the Kiambaa church fire, he is encouraged with the prevailing peace existing among the various communities that used not to see eye to eye. "I am very happy because this vote is a new beginning to residents of Kiambaa and Eldoret," he said. I was awoken in this lakeside city, a stronghold of presidential candidate Raila Odinga, at 02:15 by people blowing vuvuzelas - their alarm call to get people down to the polling stations early. By 04:00 - two hours before the polls opened - thousands of people were already queuing. There was a little tension at one polling station when it did not open on time and voters forced the gate open, but officials restored order and voting began. Women with babies or who were pregnant were able to get to the front on the winding line. At one polling station a woman stuffed a baby blanket under her dress so that she could pass for pregnant and be given priority to vote, but her belly ruse did not work. After that women in the slum of Kondele were asked to breastfeed their children to prove the offspring are theirs in order to jump the queues. Kondele, where there are high rates of unemployment, has a history of electoral violence with rival local politicians often using youths to cause trouble. A 56-year-old man in Kondele told me it was the first time he had ever witnessed a peaceful election in the slum. Mr Odinga's Cord alliance has been urging people not to drink alcohol and on the eve of the vote most bars in Kisumu were closed. The majority of businesses have also been shut today and after voting people followed advice to go home instead of hanging around in groups to watch the proceedings. It is hard to believe given the huge crowds earlier on but electoral officials in Kondele were already tallying the votes just an hour after the polls were due to close at 17:00. After being counted, the ballots will be taken to a central place in the city before being transferred to Nairobi. People came out in huge numbers to vote, some queuing in the chilly morning from 03:00. There were complaints about the slow process of casting the six ballots, but voters remained jovial. "I've waited five hours - I can wait 50 more," one man told me. "I will not leave before voting, come rain, sun, hunger or sleep." Nakuru is a cosmopolitan area, though it turned into an ethnic battle field between two rival communities, the Kalenjins and Kikuyus, after the last election. "We will redeem the image of Nakuru, what happened in 2007 will not happen again. We have learnt our lesson," a 29-year-old woman told me. Some people travelled long distances to vote, one man at the Afraha stadium - where the line was twice the length of a football pitch - had returned home from Uganda where he works. The biometric ID systems malfunctioned at most polling stations, which caused delays. One person, who joined a queue at 03:00 eventually voted at 11:00 because he was searching for his name on the paper voters' register - it was only at the front of the third queue that he was eventually successful. Despite the delays, everyone got a chance to vote and polling stations closed as planned at 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Most people have returned home, to follow the counting process on TV or radio. The usually busy city centre is deserted, with no cars or pedestrians. Even the curio stalls popular with tourists coming to see the flamingos at nearby Lake Nakuru are closed. I came across only one restaurant that is open. Trucks full of police can be seen patrolling everywhere in this town - an agricultural centre in the Rift Valley. But people I spoke to say they do not expect any violence once results come out, as efforts to achieve reconciliation between communities that were pitted against each other after the 2007 election have been successful.	Kenyans have been voting in a key election - the first since the disputed contest of December 2007 that triggered weeks of bloodshed.
Whilst on patrol over Winnipeg, the chopper's crew accidentally turned on its loudspeaker allowing members of the public below to hear them. Those listening say they heard pilots swearing and discussing oral sex. Winnipeg Police Service say some of the "conversation was inappropriate" and have promised an internal review. Brandi Armstrong told CBC news that she had been sitting in her garden on Monday evening as the helicopter flew over and was shocked by the exchange. "My jaw hit the ground; eyes bulged out," she said. She added that she would like to see the pilots punished. The police say that they are considering disciplinary measures. Another resident walking near the city's legislature building overhead a different, expletive-laden discussion about money. The officers were unaware that the loudspeaker was on due to the noise from the helicopter's engine. Residents listening below began to tweet to the city's police department as the pilots continued talking.	Canadian police have apologised after an explicit conversation was inadvertently broadcast from one of its helicopters.
However, there were people in the TV industry who thought the cast would struggle to find work once their time on the show was up. Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn't be able to shake off their sulky, angry, teen characters. But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O'Connell for example, they couldn't have been more wrong. Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest-serving members of the cast, appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem. She went on to appear in sci-fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp. Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience. He'd starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002. He has since gone on to play Beast in the X-Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals. Dev Patel's first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two, took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire. He told Newsbeat, he never would have got that role without Skins. "My career started off because Danny Boyle's daughter was a fan of the show, that is how I got an audition for Slumdog." He has two films out in cinemas at the moment, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman. Jack O'Connell, who played Cook in series three and four, was hand-picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken. The 24-year-old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year's Baftas. Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively. It is, of course, not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films. What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel. So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors? Co-creator Bryan Elsley told Newsbeat they made a conscious decision to hold open auditions. "There are really good kids working from agencies and drama schools but just on that one occasion we decided to go a different way," he explained. "We felt if we had young people playing characters the same age as themselves, and those actors weren't too trained, it would have a more natural feel." It sounds quite risky, but Bryan said the show was such a small project to begin with, they were able to take that approach. Jack O'Connell credits the whole team for the actors' future success. "I think they knew if they were going to identify that genre, that era, that generation, they needed people on the ground level," he said. "A writing team that understood, they got that right first and then I guess they chose to cast exciting people. "I feel very fortunate to be involved in the show but I don't think it was a coincidence that we all came through there." Piers Wenger is the head of drama at Channel 4 and he thinks it was the opportunities the cast had to stretch themselves that helped nurture their talent. "They had the opportunity to do properly complex [roles], rather than just two dimensional ones," he said. "It is extraordinary, in the past soap operas had been the sort of places where young people had been able to do their first job. "That would have been your only break, but time's are changing. "I think thanks to shows like Skins, unconventional approaches to casting are becoming more and more common."

Local authorities can apply for funds to support weekly collections, as well as for initiatives offering residents reward vouchers for recycling rubbish. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who announced the scheme last autumn, calls weekly bin collections a "basic right". But Labour's Hilary Benn says the funding would be better spent on children's centres and elderly care. Mr Pickles scrapped guidance telling councils to introduce fortnightly collections in a bid to reverse a trend developed under Labour. He will say later that rubbish collections are the "most visible service" paid for through council tax. "Labour's barmy bin rules have made putting out your rubbish more complicated than solving a Rubik's cube," he will say. "The public are fed up of all the bin dos and bin don'ts. They just want a simple service." The government scheme will make funding available for facilities with technology that sorts waste after it has been picked up, preventing families having to sort rubbish into as many as nine containers. More than half the councils in England collect refuse once a fortnight, although many pick up recycling or food waste on a weekly basis. However, BBC local government correspondent Mike Sergeant said there was no compulsion to bid for a share of the cash. "Having invested heavily in alternate weekly systems, some may be rather reluctant to go back," he said. Mr Benn, the shadow communities secretary, said local people were best-placed to decide how rubbish was collected and should not be dictated to by government. "At a time of deep cuts, when local councils are having to make very difficult decisions, the quarter of a billion pounds Eric Pickles has found for this could be much better spent on preventing SureStart centres from closing or providing extra care for our elderly people," he added. A survey by the Press Association news agency last year found many councils were sticking with fortnightly black bin collections, claiming that a return to weekly rounds would cost millions and undermine recycling efforts. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government says 67% of people surveyed agreed the government should mandate weekly collections. Ministers say more than 70 councils have signalled interest in applying for funding. Bids which support a comprehensive weekly collection of rubbish, combined with a weekly recycling collection of materials such as glass, paper and plastics, will be prioritised. The scheme will support initiatives which reward households for recycling, with points that convert into money off at retailers, such as Windsor and Maidenhead's RecycleBank and Birmingham's Nectar programmes. And it will back mechanical biological treatment plants, already used in Bournemouth, which take all rubbish in just one bin and sort out the materials for recycling, landfill and composting. Councils have until mid-March to bid for funding, which will be available from April.	A £250m government scheme encouraging councils to keep or bring back weekly bin collections is opening for bids.
The 22-year-old has not appeared for Shrewsbury this season, but has played once for Mansfield Town and four times for Wrexham while on loan. Bolton youth product Caton has also played for Blackpool and has loan spells with Accrington and Chester before joining Shrewsbury in 2014. Caton follows Jamie McCombe, 33, in signing for the National League side. The centre-back, who played 101 games for the club during his first spell, has left Stevenage and signed a contract until the end of the 2016-17 season.	Lincoln City have signed Shrewsbury winger James Caton on loan until the end of the season.
A team statement said Henao, 28, had been contacted by cycling's governing body and an anti-doping agency about data between August 2011 and June 2015. The Colombian said he was "beyond disappointed", having missed three months in 2014 over similar concerns. "I know who I am, how hard I have worked and the sacrifices I have made to be where I am today," he added. Henao was voluntarily withdrawn by Team Sky in 2014 while they carried out research into the biological characteristics of riders who live and train at high altitude. They said the results revealed nothing to raise suspicions of wrongdoing. Team Sky stressed Henao had not failed a doping test and had been withdrawn because of the "very obvious distraction to him". "We continue to support Sergio and remain confident in the independent scientific research which was undertaken," the team added. "It is our hope that this can be looked at and resolved quickly by all the relevant authorities so Sergio can start racing again soon." A specialist climber, Henao signed with Team Sky in 2012 and finished in the top 10 in his first Grand Tour, the 2012 Giro d'Italia.	Team Sky have withdrawn Sergio Henao from riding after concerns about his biological passport data resurfaced.
The 28-year-old's contract with Korona Kielce in his homeland had expired and Grzelak has also played for Wisla Plock, Dolcan Zabki and Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biala. He becomes head coach Ian Cathro's third summer signing. "For me, it's important that this club will be my home and I'm really excited to be here," Grzelak told the Hearts website. "I've had a really good impression from everybody that I've met here so far, and I've been told that the fans are fantastic. "When I knew that I could come here, then I was very happy to come. "My good features are that I am a strong player, who likes to tackle, and I prepare myself well for the physical side of the game. But I am also very calm on the ball. "I can play in defence, both in the centre and on the left, and I can also play in the centre of midfield." Hearts, fifth in last season's top flight, have already signed defender Christophe Berra and forward Cole Stockton so far this summer. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.

In a report, the agency says the past decade in Europe has been the warmest on record. It adds that the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events is rising, and the continent is set to become more vulnerable in the future. The findings have been published ahead of next week's UN climate conference. They join a UN Environment Programme report also released on Wednesday showing dangerous growth in the "emissions gap" - the difference between current carbon emission levels and those needed to avert climate change. "Every indicator we have in terms of giving us an early warning of climate change and increasing vulnerability is giving us a very strong signal," observed EEA executive director Jacqueline McGlade. "It is across the board, it is not just global temperatures," she told BBC News. "It is in human health aspects, in forests, sea levels, agriculture, biodiversity - the signals are coming in from right across the environment." 2C or not 2C The report - Climate Change, Impacts and Vulnerabilities in Europe 2012 - involving more than 50 authors from a range of organisations, listed a number of "key messages", including: As it currently stands, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has set a target of limiting the rise in global mean temperature to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels. But the report's authors warn that even if this target to mitigate warming is met, "substantial impacts on society, human health and ecosystems are projected to occur". To limit the impacts, experts say effective adaptation strategies need to be developed in order to minimise the risk to nations' infrastructure, homes and businesses. The European Commission is expected to publish its European Adaptation Strategy in 2013, outlining measures it think will help the 27-nation bloc deal with future climate shifts. Examples of adaptation measures include using water resources more efficiently, adapting building codes to be able to withstand extreme weather events and building flood defences. Prof McGlade said such measures would be essential in order to climate-proof the EU. "I think what the European Commission and other parts of the world are finding is that whilst it is important to understand what is happening at the global level, it is what is happening at the regional and local levels that will really determine how economies will weather the storm," she said. The report said the cost of damage caused by extreme weather events had increased from 9bn euros (Â£7bn) in the 1980s to 13bn euros in the 2000s. One of the report's authors, Andre Jol, head of the EEA's vulnerability and adaptation group, added: "We know that the main increase in damage costs from natural disasters has not been from climate change, as such, but more as a result of an increase in wealth, people and infrastructure in risk areas. "But one of the key messages from the report is that in the future, with projected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, we know that climate change will contribute to the increase in the cost of damage from extreme events." 'Lack of action' On Monday, the World Bank published a report that warned that the world was "on track to a 4C [increase by the end of the century] marked by extreme heatwaves and life-threatening sea-level rise". It added that the world's poorest regions would be hardest hit by the warming, which was "likely to undermine efforts and goals". "A 4C warmer world can, and must be, avoided - we need to hold warming below 2C," said World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim. "Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living in today." However, the UN Environment Programme (Unep) warned that it was still possible to achieve the 2C target but time was running out. Data in the Emissions Gap Report showed that annual greenhouse gas emissions were now "14% above where they need to be in 2020". Unep executive director Achim Steiner said: "While governments work to negotiate a new international climate agreement to come into effect in 2020, they urgently need to put their foot firmly on the action pedal by fulfilling financial, technology transfer and other commitments under the UN climate convention treaties." The reports have been published ahead of the annual two-week UN climate conference, which starts on Monday in Doha, Qatar.	The effects of climate change are already evident in Europe and the situation is set to get worse, the European Environment Agency has warned.
The 50 year-old said she was "lucky to be here" after falling ill at home and looking up her symptoms online. O'Donnell wrote on her blog that she searched "women's heart attack symptoms", which included sudden nausea and aches, before taking a few aspirin. She visited a cardiologist the next day, who inserted a stent into an artery that was 99 per cent blocked. O'Donnell said her chest began to ache last week and she became nauseous and feverish after helping a woman who was struggling to get out of her car in her Nyack village home, near New York. In the blog entry on her website, a poem entitled "my heart attack", O'Donnell revealed the type of attack was known as the "widow maker". The star, who has acted in several films and TV shows including Drop Dead Diva, Will and Grace and Nip/Tuck, also said she did not call the emergency services. However, she issued a warning to her readers: "Know the symptoms ladies, listen to the voice inside, the one we all so easily ignore, call 911." She recently hosted The Rosie Show on the Oprah Winfrey Network but the daily talk and gameshow was cancelled in March due to low ratings.	US comedian and talk show host Rosie O'Donnell has revealed that she suffered a heart attack last week.
That bargain could have backfired in a way that was neither good for his golf nor his social standing. Thankfully for the Spieth family, the lure of the clubs was too strong to resist. Eighteen years on, the obsessive kid has become a record-breaking champion. Ben Crenshaw, another Masters winner schooled in the high winds and heat of Texas, has spoken of looking into the 21-year-old's eyes and seeing the dead-eyed stare of Wild West gunslinger Wyatt Earp. The final day here at Augusta is often a shoot-out. The pressures of the back nine - greens like glass, fairways steep and narrow, water, water everywhere - have broken older men with far greater experience of these beautiful and brutal yards. Spieth admitted afterwards that he had struggled to sleep on Saturday night, self-effacingly pointing to his prematurely receding hairline as an indication of the stress he has been under. Yet even with so many big guns lurking - world number one Rory McIlroy, three-times Masters champion Phil Mickelson, major winner Justin Rose - the callow kid never looked like backing down. If it seemed less thrilling a finale than we have come to expect from Augusta, it is worth a reminder of the dramatic context: the second youngest winner in Masters history, the first to go to 19 under (before a bogey on the last), more birdies across his four rounds than any player here has ever made, the first man to win it wire to wire in 39 years. For those who have become desensitised to the scale of his achievement by the very fact that he had led so handsomely throughout, this might help: Rose and Mickelson's score of 14 under for second would have have been the winning tally in all bar five of the previous 78 Masters that have been played. Spieth has always been aimed at this day. He won the US Junior Amateur title twice (something only Tiger Woods had ever done before), tied for 16th in the Byron Nelson Championship as a 16-year-old (better than Woods ever managed as an amateur in a PGA Tour event) and became the youngest PGA Tour winner in 82 years when he won the John Deere Classic aged 19 years and 11 months. There is footage of him aged 14 declaring that his ultimate goal in life is to win the Masters. Goals like that are supposed to be good for young sportsmen. They also bring their own burden. Out on the course, beery breath and cigar smoke swirling in the cool breeze, there were groans and gasps when his overnight lead of four strokes was cut to three at only the second hole and again at the seventh. So locked in tradition is Augusta that no radios, phones or tablets are allowed through the gates, which preserves a certain atmosphere but also creates its own strange drama. How was Spieth doing? Was Mickelson closing, was Woods - full of promise of a charge through the front nine - rampaging along as of old? The only indication, for both players and patrons alike, is first when a volley of noise rolls in through the pine trees from a distant hole and then when the large wooden scoreboards are slowly adjusted by a troupe of men climbing up ladders, like stagehands dressing a particularly elaborate set. This sort of information vacuum frays the nerves of those watching, let alone a 21-year-old within touching distance of his greatest ambition. First a hole appears on the board next to the name of the player. Everyone turns and stares. Then, with minimal regard for the anxiety all around, an official will slowly insert a new numbered board. That was how Spieth found out that Mickelson was slipping, that McIlroy was improving too slowly, that Woods - name taken off the board entirely - was not the danger of old. Spieth would not give them a breath of hope. By the 10th - Rose three-putting the ninth - the lead was back to five. In the pine needles on 11, he bumped and ran beautifully to the right of the green before flicking on a wedge that stopped as if he had it on string. The crowds here were willing a Mickelson miracle. No-one is loved in these parts in the same way. Mickelson's avuncular grin, relaxed physique and famed generosity (few waitresses leave Phil's table less than $100 better off) have made him some sort of utopian Everyman for the American golf fan. Spieth's display rendered it instead first a procession and then a coronation. As he slipped on his first Green Jacket, with all the awkwardness that this sometimes painfully corny ceremony can offer, thoughts wandered off already to where he might go next. These debut grand triumphs are a lovely stage for a young sportsman, a point in time where everything seems possible, the future unchecked by the vagaries of injury, form or motivation. Spieth is still young enough to do exactly what his mother tells him - which is a good thing, when she spots you rather lost for words on the 18th green and tells you to congratulate your playing partner and thank the whooping crowd. It is a potent reminder of Woods at the same age, winning his debut Masters by exactly the same score and in the same nerveless fashion. It would take Woods almost two and-a-half years to win his next major. He would reach world number one rather sooner, within two months of his breakthrough at Augusta, and with Spieth already up to second in the rankings that particular piece of history may well repeat. It was easy to pick out what made the young Woods stand out - his huge driving, a power game that would cause even this living museum of golf to be radically altered. Even Spieth has trouble describing the best part of his own game, settling on the rather more prosaic "playing badly well" - what others would call course management and precocious self-control. Crenshaw, poetic in his Masters farewell, spoke of a "jeweller's touch". That does rather better in illustrating how beautifully precise Spieth was in adorning these greens with his short game. The only man who has putted like this at Augusta is Woods. Different characters in different eras, but in their graduation to the wider world with so much to share.	It began early for Jordan Spieth: when he was three years old and ready for potty-training, his mother Chris decided to bribe him out of nappies by hiding his plastic golf clubs on top of the washing machine until he had done what he had to do.
The US and UK have announced new carry-on restrictions banning laptops on certain passenger flights. The so-called Islamic State group (IS) has been working on ways to smuggle explosives on to planes by hiding them in electronics, US sources tell ABC. The tip-off was judged by the US to be "substantiated" and "credible". Inbound flights on nine airlines operating out of 10 airports in eight countries are subject to the US Department of Homeland Security ban. Phones and medical devices are not affected. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is hosting a two-day meeting of ministers and senior officials from 68 nations to discuss the threat from IS. The Washington talks will be the first full meeting of the coalition since December 2014. The BBC's Barbara Plett-Usher looks ahead to the Washington meeting: This will be a chance for the Trump administration to put its stamp on the global battle against the Islamic State group, and for the reticent secretary of state to put his stamp on a foreign policy issue that the president has identified as a priority. The State Department says the meeting aims to accelerate efforts to defeat IS in its remaining strongholds: the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa. On the campaign trail Mr Trump claimed to have a secret plan to obliterate the group. But his Pentagon has largely stuck with Barack Obama's strategy of supporting local ground forces, albeit with increased US military participation as the assault on Raqqa nears. Coalition members will also discuss how to stabilise and govern the cities after the conflict; and they're looking to see if Washington remains committed to a longer term effort to secure the region. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC News there was "a new aviation threat". "We know that our adversaries, terrorist groups in the United States and outside the United States, seek to bring down a US-bound airliner. That's one of their highest value targets. And we're doing everything we can right now to prevent that from happening." Another member of that committee, Republican Peter King, told the New York Times he was forewarned about the ban. "It was based on intelligence reports that are fairly recent. Intelligence of something possibly planned." The restriction is based, we are told, on "evaluated intelligence", BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner writes. That means that US intelligence has either intercepted discussion of a possible extremist plot or has been passed word of one by a human informant. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning The nine airlines covered by the US ban are Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways. The British ban, announced hours after the American measure, is similar but applies to different airlines, including British Airways and EasyJet. It covers direct passenger flights to the UK from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. The 10 airports affected by the US ban are: The airlines included in the US decision have been given a deadline of 07:00 GMT on Saturday to impose the ban, officials said, adding that the restriction had no end date. However, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters news agency the airline understood that the US directive would come into effect on 25 March and remain valid until 14 October 2017.

Amina Al-Jeffery, 21, who was born and brought up in Swansea, was taken to Jeddah in 2012 by her father, Mohammed, who said he did it to "save her life". Mr Al-Jeffery has denied the allegations at the High Court. But Mr Justice Holman said she had been "deprived of her liberty" and her father must facilitate her return. Ms Al-Jeffery, who has dual nationality, says her father took the action against her will after she "kissed a guy". Delivering the court order, Mr Justice Holman said Mr Al-Jeffery "must permit and facilitate the return of Amina if she so wishes to Wales or England and pay the airfare" by 11 September. However, he accepted there was "little or nothing this court could do" to enforce the order if Mr Al-Jeffery "was determined not to comply with it". But he said Mr Al-Jeffery might face contempt of court proceedings if he returned to Britain without having complied. Mr Justice Holman added: "There are no conventions between Britain and Saudi Arabia. The courts in Saudi Arabia would not even recognise the basis of the claim, because it does not recognise dual nationality." Her lawyer, Anne-Marie Hutchinson QC, said she has been unable to take instruction from Ms Al-Jeffery, who sent her emails in December 2015. She said she had been "physically abused" and there were times when she had not been allowed to leave her room, meaning she had to use it as a toilet. She described having her head smacked against the wall. Ms Hutchinson later told BBC Newsnight it had been a "difficult" but "compelling" case to work on. "I'm absolutely delighted that the judge has said he has got jurisdiction and that he has gone on to exercise his jurisdiction and make orders. "I'm expecting him [Mr Al-Jeffery,] to comply with the order," she said. Mr Al-Jeffery, who did not attend the case, denied his daughter wanted to return to England or Wales. He said he put up a barrier partition to stop her running away because he was concerned for her welfare, which was taken down on the advice of the authorities. He said he wanted to make sure Ms Al-Jeffery was safe and was not being mistreated. Neither Amina nor her father were in court to hear the ruling. And the question now is what difference a ruling in the High Court of England and Wales will make in Saudi Arabia. Mr Justice Holman said he accepted that there is "little or nothing" this court could do to enforce the order if Amina's father was determined not to obey or comply with it. Certainly the basis on which it was granted, that Amina has dual British and Saudi nationality, is not recognised in Saudi Arabia. And it is perhaps telling that Mohammed Al-Jeffery's legal costs have been paid for by the Saudi embassy. However, the judge stated that to do nothing "would in my view amount to a dereliction towards Amina". The court was told that in April Mr Al-Jeffery instigated legal proceedings against his daughter in Jeddah "seeking parental control over his child for the purposes of caring and supervision". Legal documentation showed both father and daughter agreed to a reconciliation. But Mr Justice Holman said that meant if "she were to run away the police, far from offering her protection from her father, would put her in prison". Mr Justice Holman said: "If Amina chooses to remain voluntarily in Saudi Arabia she must of course adhere to the law and culture of that society but the current constraint is denying to her the ability to be British and to live in Britain. "It is true that she is currently present and habitually resident in Saudi Arabia, but that is due to her obedience to her father in 2012. She did not travel there of her own free will." He said Mr Al-Jeffery "voluntarily chose to live for many years in Wales, to educate and bring his children up here... and to accept the constraints of the legal system of England and Wales". The judge said the fact Ms Al-Jeffery was born and brought up in Britain until she was almost 17 was a "very significant factor" in his decision. The court was told Mr Al-Jeffery's wife, from whom he is not estranged, and several of his children continue to live in the UK. Swansea West MP Geraint Davies has written to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to demand immediate action over the case. The former Swansea schoolgirl has been in touch with friends in the UK and asked them to contact the British Embassy to inform them of her situation, and has also sent a picture of what she claimed was the caged room her father had kept her in. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: "We recognise that this is a distressing time for Ms Al-Jeffery. We have been providing assistance to her since the case was first brought to our attention and will continue to do so. "British embassy staff have met with her to check on her welfare and helped her speak to lawyers in the UK."	A woman who claims her father has kept her locked up against her will in Saudi Arabia must be allowed to return to Britain, a UK judge has ruled.
The 32-year-old knows Coleman's side will be tough to beat having improved hugely since two defeats by Serbia in the last World Cup qualifying campaign. The Chelsea defender, who has led Serbia to the top of Group D, says they face a difficult match ahead of them. "This is the hardest game since we started qualification," he said. Ivanovic scored in the 6-1 thrashing of Wales in 2014 World Cup qualifying at Novi Sad, in September 2012 - the heaviest defeat in Coleman's reign. A year later he was part of the side which won 3-0 at the Cardiff City Stadium - the last time Wales lost a home qualifier. Set to earn his 91st cap for his country on Saturday, Ivanovic believes the scars of the past will provide extra motivation for Wales. "We know that and we have to be careful with that. We have to play much much better than last time to get something from the game because Wales is a completely different team from that moment," he continued. "Those kind of games happen may be once in 100 years. It's very difficult to win against one team three times in a row even when the opponent is not that strong and you cannot say that about Wales." Serbia go into the game topping the group as they edge the Republic of Ireland on goal difference while Wales are two points adrift in third. The visitors will be without the suspended Manchester City defender Aleksander Kolarov, who is suspended after collecting two bookings in the group. Wales will welcome the return of Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey for the first time in this campaign after his recovery from a hamstring injury. Ivanovic believes they will be stronger for his inclusion, but inevitably the major threat will be Real Madrid star Gareth Bale. "I think he is the biggest name and biggest star in the Wales team. But I think Wales as a group have improved," Ivanovic said. "The team have played a couple of years together to bring results and will, of course, be very difficult to stop Gareth Bale and the rest of the guys." "Most important for us is we have a lot of new things - new coach, new shape of the team. We are still building. We have improved a lot from last summer and we are going in the right direction. "But the way to Russia is so long we have to be careful and we have to play every single game like a final.  We know this is our hardest game so far."	Branislav Ivanovic says Wales will want to avenge their previous two defeats against Serbia when they meet in Saturday's World Cup qualifier.
Mr Tucker will take over on 1 October, succeeding Douglas Flint who has been in the role since 2010. The appointment breaks an HSBC tradition of appointing insiders to the chairmanship. One of his first jobs will be to find a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, who plans to step down next year. While HSBC is Europe's biggest bank, the bulk of its profits are generated in Asia. Mr Tucker has been chief executive of AIA for seven years, during which he oversaw the insurer's expansion in Asia. Before AIA, he was the chief executive of insurance giant Prudential, and brings to HSBC his experience at the top of a UK financial giant as well as his Asian exposure. Richard Dunbar of Aberdeen Asset Management, told the BBC the bank has "obviously decided" that an external perspective would be useful to HSBC at this time. He added that while chief executive of Prudential, Mr Tucker did a good job of expanding its Asian assets, which are seen as the firm's "jewel in the crown". HSBC has been through an overhaul in recent years in an attempt to reverse declining profits. Over the past six years it has cut more than 40,000 jobs and sold off businesses. Despite those efforts, profits tumbled more than 60% last year. The banking industry has been hampered by the extended period of very low interest rates, which makes lending money less profitable. For HSBC, that problem has been compounded by its move into less risky areas of banking since the financial crisis which started in 2007. Those challenges make the appointment of a new chief executive even more crucial for investors, a search which will now be led by Mr Tucker. HSBC has also been attempting to repair its image after a series of scandals. Earlier this year it reached a $470m (Â£325m) settlement with the US government and states related to dubious mortgage lending and foreclosure practices during the financial crisis. In 2015 Mr Gulliver and Mr Flint apologised for "unacceptable" practices at its Swiss private bank which helped clients to avoid tax. In late 2012 HSBC paid US authorities $1.9bn in a settlement over money laundering. AIA said that Ng Keng Hooi, would take over as chief executive from 1 September.	HSBC has appointed Mark Tucker, the chief executive of Asian insurer AIA, as group chairman.
The ex-Villa player and Nottingham Forest boss, 51, quit his role as Chris Hughton's number two prior to Friday's 1-1 draw between the two sides. "When I heard Colin was interested he shot to the top of the pile," Villa boss Steve Bruce told the club website. "We interviewed two or three people but once I knew Colin was available there was only one person I wanted here." The move to the West Midlands gives Calderwood, who also previously managed Hibernian and Northampton Town, a shorter daily commuting distance from his Northampton home. Media playback is not supported on this device A Brighton statement released on Friday said Calderwood, who was placed on gardening leave on 12 November, had left the club for a job "elsewhere". "We have to move on," added Hughton. "We have a team that is very well drilled at this moment. My main concern is that we have no disruption here. I will think long and hard about bringing someone in that position." Bruce took over as Villa boss on 12 October, bringing in former Birmingham City player Stephen Clemence as head coach, having had him as part of his backroom team at Sunderland and Hull City. The club also named Ian Atkins as their new chief scout/head of European recruitment. Villa director of football Steve Round added: "We are delighted to secure the services of Colin. He is an excellent coach and an outstanding person. "He has a wealth of experience at the highest level and will be a great addition to our management team."

It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to Â£3.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: "Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. "The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. "Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business." The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not "lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating "perverse incentives". Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a "Fair Pay Charter" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.	Britain's largest companies will have to reveal the pay gap between their CEOs and average workers, under new government proposals.
They seized the regional government's headquarters and prosecutor's office before opening fire with automatic weapons at the main police station. Interim President Olexander Turchynov criticised local police for their "inaction" and "criminal treachery". The US accused Russia of seeking to "change the security landscape" of Eastern and Central Europe. By David SternBBC News, Kiev The pro-Russian gunmen in Ukraine's east seem to be following a strategy of constant expansion and pressure on the Kiev government. Hardly a day goes by without another incident. Just recently, official buildings in Kostyantynivka have been taken over, Western military monitors detained, peaceful demonstrators in Donetsk attacked, and now the regional administration building in Luhansk has been seized. It is difficult to say what their ultimate goal is. Perhaps it is to keep government officials in Kiev on the defensive, forcing them to put out a number of fires at once, while others pop up throughout the region. Or else it is simply to keep the situation unstable, in order to prevent the presidential election scheduled to take place on 25 May. Or it could be just the opposite, as many in Kiev and throughout the country fear: to provoke the Ukrainians into a full crackdown, which would in turn spark a Russian invasion. The militants have called on Moscow to intervene on more than one occasion. In a speech at the Atlantic Council in Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry told the Kremlin to "leave Ukraine in peace" and warned: "Nato territory is inviolable we will defend every single inch of it." In other developments on Tuesday: Moscow has said it has no intention of invading eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia activists have seized government buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities. Until now, only the local office of the State Security Service (SBU) in Luhansk, a city of 465,000 people less than 30km (20 miles) from the Russian border, had been targeted. But on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of people shouting "Russia, Russia" gathered outside the headquarters of the regional government to demand a referendum on greater autonomy. A group of men armed with sticks and metal bars broke into the building. They pulled down the Ukrainian flag flying from the roof and replaced it with a Russian tricolour and the flag of Donetsk People's Republic. Crowds of pro-Russia activists then overran the building housing the prosecutor's office before attacking the headquarters of the interior ministry's police force. Hours later, an AFP news agency journalist reported that officers had abandoned the police station and been taken away in buses, as an angry crowd shouted at them to "Go home". Activists also went into a regional television station, but decided not to take it over after they were allowed to make a live broadcast. Following the takeovers, President Turchynov demanded the dismissal of the police chiefs in Luhansk and the other eastern city of Donetsk. "The overwhelming majority of law enforcement bodies in the east are incapable of fulfilling their duty to defend our citizens," he said. Pro-Russia activists control much of the neighbouring Donetsk region. Sanctions By Daniel SandfordBBC News, Moscow Sanctions screw is tightened Eastern Ukraine, which has a large Russian-speaking population, was a stronghold for former President Yanukovych before he was overthrown by protesters in February. The interim government has rejected the pro-Russian activists' demands for greater autonomy, fearing they could lead to the break-up of the country or more regions being annexed by Russia, as happened with Crimea last month. Pro-Russian activists continue to detain some 40 people, including seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) seized last week. On Tuesday evening, the self-styled "mayor" of the town of Sloviansk, where the observers are being held, said "good progress" had been made at talks with OSCE representatives. Vyacheslav Ponomaryov had earlier warned that they would only be released if the EU dropped its sanctions against separatist leaders. Earlier, the EU published a fresh list of 15 individuals facing travel bans and asset freezes. It included the chief of the Russian General Staff, the head of Russian military intelligence, and a Russian deputy prime minister, as well as separatist leaders in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk. On Monday, the US announced sanctions against seven individuals and 17 companies it said were linked to President Putin's "inner circle". President Putin warned that new sanctions might have an impact on the operations of Western companies in Russia. "If this continues, we will of course have to think about how they work in the Russian Federation, including in key sectors of the Russian economy such as energy," he said, adding that there were "neither Russian instructors, nor special units, nor troops" in Ukraine. US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions, first imposed by Washington and Brussels after Crimea was annexed, had so far caused "a quite substantial deterioration in Russia's already weak economy".	Pro-Russia activists have stormed several official buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk.
It does not include a final decision about where to locate a new station in or near Sheffield. The announcement confirms ministers' commitment to push ahead with the controversial £56bn project, which they say will boost the economy. Critics say HS2 is not needed and will spoil parts of the countryside. The announcement removes much of the uncertainty over the project, except over where to site Sheffield's station - a decision on which is expected next year. The government's preferred option is for the main HS2 route to run east of Sheffield, with a separate spur to take passengers to Sheffield city centre. This would cost around £1bn less than the alternative suggestions - which involved taking the main HS2 line through Sheffield city centre or to a new station at the Meadowhall shopping centre just outside Sheffield, near the M1. Another spur will take HS2 to a new station at Manchester airport. The first phase of the £56bn railway is due to open in December 2026, with trains to travel at high speed between London and Birmingham before continuing on the existing West Coast Main Line. The second, Y-shaped phase is due to be completed by about 2032-33. Now that the government has confirmed most of its chosen route, it will go through the parliamentary process. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said support and compensation would be available to those affected by the project, who can begin the process now by contacting HS2 Ltd. The Department for Transport says compensation will be calculated at 110% of the value their home would have had without any plans for HS2. Anyone living within 60m of the route is entitled to compensation, although the DfT said that could be extended in certain circumstances and wasn't "a hard and fast rule". Nevertheless, communities along the proposed route in South Yorkshire are still voicing strong objections. Among them are residents of the newly built Shimmer Estate in Mexborough, which is likely to be demolished to make way for the new rail line. Resident Russell Holmes said: "It may be a new estate, but it's a proper community. For that to be destroyed is devastating. "But the uncertainty, waiting until it happens, when you can actually put something in place to move, is horrible as well." The area's MP, former Labour leader Ed Miliband, said he would oppose the planned Sheffield part of the route, saying it "flies in the face of evidence, logic, value for money and the needs and interests of local people". He added: "This is the wrong decision for South Yorkshire, wrong for Doncaster and wrong for the residents who will see their homes destroyed and communities blighted." Jonathan Pile, of campaign group Yorkshire Against HS2, said the proposed route was "unsuitable, should be struck out" and was "unfit for purpose". Pressure group Stop HS2 said that once the high-speed railway was operating, existing intercity services to London would be reduced by up to two trains an hour. The group's campaign manager, Joe Rukin, said ministers were "trying to con the public" that the high-speed line was needed to boost rail capacity. "The government have finally come clean in admitting 'freeing up capacity' means for many cities 'losing the trains you already have', as the HS2 business case demands £8.3bn worth of cuts to existing services," he added.	The government has announced the route for the second phase of the high-speed rail line HS2, from Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds.

The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) accused ministers of offering an "unworkable" guarantee to protect firefighters aged over 55 who fail fitness tests "through no fault of their own". The government said it had been "clear" that the staff would get full pensions. It said "robust" plans were in place to protect the public during the strike. In December, MPs approved plans to make firefighters in England work until they are 60 and to increase their pension contributions. Fire minister Penny Mordaunt said no firefighter over 55 would lose their job for losing fitness if it was not their fault. But the FBU says it has contacted fire authorities and "a number" said they would not uphold the guarantee. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack claimed: "It is clear that when Penny Mordaunt gave the guarantee in Parliament she would have been aware that no fire authority ever planned to implement the 'guarantee'." He said Ms Mordaunt had "misled" fire service staff and Parliament, and firefighters were "unbelievably angry with the disgraceful actions of this government". A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said firefighters who "fail a fitness test through no fault of their own and cannot regain fitness with remedial help" would get an "unreduced pension". The FBU said its members in Northern Ireland had ended their dispute following a "revised and improved offer with a lower pension age". It said members in Scotland and Wales would not strike because "genuine negotiations" had taken place.	Firefighters in England say their next one-day strike in the long-running dispute with the government over pensions will be on 25 February.
Linda Norgrove, from Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, had been working in the country when she was kidnapped. Former colleagues have told a BBC Alba documentary that her captors told Ms Norgrove she was only being held hostage as a bargaining tool. The 36-year-old was killed by a US grenade during a failed rescue attempt. Ms Norgrove had been working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan in 2010 when she was seized by rebels. Colleagues still working in the country told BBC Alba that her captors told Ms Norgrove they did not intend to kill her. She was led to believe she was being held captive to secure the release of rebel prisoners and would be set free when that happened. The programme also shows images of Ms Norgrove's kidnappers that she took herself on her camera and phone before she was killed. It had first been thought her captors killed her during the US rescue mission in October 2010 but later evidence confirmed she was killed by a grenade thrown by a US special forces soldier. Ms Norgrove was abducted along with at least one other colleague who survived the rescue attempt. Abdul Wadood, another former colleague who is still working on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan, said: "Linda asked the abductors when they were planning to kill her and then the abductors talked to her in a very soft language and they told her and assured her that she would not be killed, because that was not their purpose to kill her - all they wanted was to release some of their prisoners, in the end she would be released when this deed is done." Travelling to Afghanistan, Ms Norgrove's parents John and Lorna said it was important for them to see where their daughter had lived and worked and to review the aid work now supported by the charity they set up in her name. Mr Norgrove said: "We deliberately took a choice that we thought what we should try and do is try and make something positive, because I think that's what Linda would have wanted after Linda had been killed. "It was with that in mind that we started up the charity that we did and it stopped us getting totally involved in all this blame culture of trying to work out whose fault it was, because at the end of the day I don't think it was anybody's fault." The Linda Norgrove Foundation is now providing financial help for the kind of work Ms Norgrove did while she was in Afghanistan, including support for schools and hospitals. Lorgan Linda - Linda's Story will be on BBC Alba on Monday 8 October at 21.00 and later on the iPlayer	The aid worker who died in Afghanistan during an attempt to free her two years ago was told by her captors they were not going to kill her, it has emerged.

The government said 19 of the 24 bills outlined in the speech will apply in whole or in part to Scotland. And the Scottish secretary said there will "undoubtedly" be more powers devolved to Edinburgh after Brexit. But opposition parties said the general election result meant the Conservatives have no mandate to govern. The SNP claimed that Theresa May was a "lame duck prime minister leading a lame duck government". And Scottish Labour said the speech had set out a "weak, vague and mean-spirited programme from a government in meltdown". Ms May - who lost her majority in the snap election earlier this month - has been forced to either axe or delay a number of key manifesto plans. Much of what remained in the Queen's Speech related to Brexit, including the so-called Repeal Bill - which will copy all existing EU laws into UK law, with parliament then deciding which bits to retain. The bill would give the UK Parliament temporary authority to amend laws that do not "operate appropriately" after Brexit. And existing decision-making powers devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be maintained pending further discussion on "lasting common frameworks". Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the powers will be returned from Brussels "in a way that works best for Scotland and the rest of the UK". He added: "There will undoubtedly be more decision-making powers coming to Holyrood, and I look forward to working closely with the Scottish government on this." The Scottish government has repeatedly claimed that the prime minister is planning a "power grab" because she has not confirmed that all of the powers associated with devolved areas, such as fishing and agriculture, will be handed to Holyrood once they return from Brussels. Ahead of what was a relatively low-key State Opening of Parliament, the prime minister promised to work with "humility and resolve" after failing to win the general election outright. In an apparent sign of recognition that she must seek a broad consensus for any Brexit deal, Mrs May said getting EU withdrawal right will mean securing "a deal which delivers the result of last year's referendum and does so in a way that commands maximum public support". The government used the Queen's Speech to stress that one of its priorities was to "build a more united country, strengthening the social, economic and cultural bonds between England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales". And Mrs May said her programme for government would include measures to support the aerospace industry in Wales, protect access to British waters that are "so important to Scottish fishermen", and open new markets for key exporting industries in Northern Ireland. She said: "So this is a government with purpose. Determined to deliver the best Brexit deal, committed to keeping our country safe, enhancing our standing in the wider world and bringing our United Kingdom closer together." The Queen had earlier been accompanied by the Prince of Wales, rather than the Duke of Edinburgh, for the ceremony. Prince Philip was admitted to hospital on Tuesday night as a "precautionary measure" for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. Conservative ministers are still attempting to secure a deal with the DUP, which would see the Northern Irish party support Mrs May's minority government. As well as the bill to convert EU rules into UK law, the government unveiled measures on trade, customs, immigration, fisheries, agriculture, nuclear and sanctions. On immigration, a bill will legislate for the end of free movement from the EU and make the status of EU nationals and family members subject to UK law. Although there are no specific details about a new system, ministers say they will be able to "control" numbers while attracting the "brightest and the best". A Fisheries bill will allow the UK to take on responsibility for "access to fisheries and management of its waters". And an Agriculture Bill will "provide stability" for farmers and ensure an "effective system" of support to replace the Common Agricultural Policy. Ian Blackford, the SNP's new leader at Westminster, said there was "nothing in the programme to try and turn around the faltering economy, or how to support our under-pressure public services". He added: "No one can have any confidence in this Tory government's ability to speak on Scotland's behalf in the vital Brexit negotiations - this makes it all the more vital that Scotland is given a seat at the negotiating table." Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said the government's proposals failed to reflect the message that voters sent to Mrs May in the general election. She said: "Theresa May has no political authority, and while she struggles to stitch together a deal with the DUP to stay in office, she has been forced to ditch policies from her wildly unpopular manifesto." The Liberal Democrats said the Queen's Speech was "bereft" of ideas to support public services.	The prime minister has pledged to bring the United Kingdom "closer together" as her government unveiled its proposed new laws in the Queen's Speech.
The 33-year-old was injured at Colchester police station in Essex during a struggle when he grabbed hold of a toilet bowl in his cell. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has started an investigation into the incident. It is believed seven Essex Police officers will be questioned.  The force has not commented. It is thought the IPCC will investigate claims the man was handcuffed after his fingers were severed, and allegations of a significant time delay in taking him to hospital. The prisoner, who lost part of three fingers on his left hand, was taken to hospital following the incident on 1 May. He had been taken into custody in connection with a public order incident. A spokesman for the IPCC said: "The Independent Police Complaints Commission is to independently investigate an incident at Colchester Police Station on May 1, 2015 where a man suffered serious hand injuries while in custody. "Further information is likely to be published in due course."	A police force is being investigated after a prisoner had three fingers severed while in custody.
The East Antrim MP had been considering putting his name forward after Nigel Dodds ruled himself out. Finance Minister Arlene Foster is the only person so far to declare an interest and has the backing of a majority of the party's most senior elected representatives. Nominations to become the next leader of the DUP close later on Wednesday. Peter Robinson announced in November that he was standing down as party leader. On Tuesday, Mrs Foster said she was "very humbled" by the support she has received from party colleagues. Mr Wilson thought long and hard about his decision and spoke to among others, party colleagues Mrs Foster and Mr Dodds. In the end he felt it would be in the best interests of the party that he did not put his name forward. He felt he wanted to make sure there was a smooth transition and that means almost certainly now that Arlene Foster will be the new DUP leader and the new first minister at Stormont. She said she looked forward to leading the DUP, if that was the party's wish. Mrs Foster said she had hoped to work with Mr Dodds as a team. "We will still hopefully work together as a team and that is certainly my wish for the future," she said. In a tweet on Monday night, Mr Robinson said he had "received a valid nomination" from Mrs Foster for the post of DUP leader. "Arlene's nomination was submitted with the support of over 75% of those entitled to vote in the electoral college," he added.	Sammy Wilson has said he will not be running for the DUP leadership.
The video of Bailey Matthews showing him abandoning his walking aid to cross the finish line has been viewed on Facebook more than 27 million times. Bailey, from Doncaster, was given the Richard Whiteley award at a ceremony in Leeds on Friday night. Cricketer Joe Root received the Sporting Achievement award. The Yorkshire Awards, now in their 27th year, "recognise the many and varied achievements of people and businesses in the county". Bailey competed in the children's event at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire in July, swimming 100m, riding a bike for four km and running for 1.3 km. Despite stumbling twice on his way to the finish line, he picked himself up and ran the final 20m of the course without his walking frame. Bailey's family said: "We are extremely honoured to receive the Richard Whiteley award for Bailey's efforts and it makes it all the more special with being proud northerners." Sheffield-born Root became the leading batsman in the ICC world rankings after helping England beat Australia to regain the Ashes. The 24-year-old has established himself as one of England's key performers and is closing on 3,000 test runs. Root said the award was a "real honour" and he wanted to thank everyone who had supported him. TV chef Rosemary Shrager, who has worked and lived in Yorkshire for many years, was presented with the Woman of the Year award, while Rotherham-born William Hague was named Man of the Year. Mr Hague, former MP for Richmond, said: "Whatever I have done, and wherever I have been in the world, I have never stopped being a Yorkshireman, and never will." Sir David Wootton picked up the Lifetime Achievement while Huddersfield-born poet Simon Armitage won the Arts and Entertainment award. Mr Armitage's numerous accolades include a BAFTA winning film Feltham Sings for which he received an Ivor Novello award. The Business Enterprise award was given to timber company Howarth Timber. Starting in Leeds in 1840, it has expanded from a one-man business to an employer of more than 1,000 people. North Yorkshire famer Gareth Barlow was presented with the Countryside award while junior football coach Stephen Shipley won the Community Hero award.	An eight-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who was filmed completing his first triathlon unaided has been honoured at the Yorkshire Awards.
Zaneta Krokova, 11, and Helina Kotlarova, 12, who were "holding hands" as they crossed the road, died after the crash on Ashton Road. Four men, aged 59, 48, 38 and 18, remain in custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. A fifth man, aged 23, has been de-arrested, police said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he was initially arrested for the same offence but was now assisting police with enquiries. Greater Manchester Police said it had identified the car involved in the collision as a Blue Peugeot 807. The dark blue vehicle, which had evidence of previous damage to its rear window, was found abandoned on Honeywell Lane. Nigel Whittle, principal of Oasis Academy, Oldham, said the school was "deeply saddened" by the news of the deaths of Zaneta, who was a first year student, and her cousin Helina Kotlarova, a former pupil. He said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends at this extremely distressing and difficult time. "We are a very closely-knit school community.  As our students return following the Christmas break, I know that they will care for one another, and our staff will be available to offer the support and time necessary as we all come to terms with this awful loss." He said with the agreement of the Krokova family the school would join together to pay tribute to Zaneta in the coming weeks. A book of condolence would be opened on Thursday, he said.	Police have been given more time to question four men held over an apparent hit-and-run crash in Oldham on New Year's Eve in which two cousins died.
The cameras will be operated by the Canadian Urthecast company, which intends to stream high-resolution video of the planet to web users. Russian cosmonauts completed the attachment in a six-hour spacewalk on Monday. It followed an aborted installation attempt in December. On that occasion, there was a difficulty in getting telemetry through to Moscow mission control. In a statement on Tuesday, Urthecast confirmed that both cameras were passing data to the ground following the latest effort. "During the installation, we were able to complete all of the intended tests during the spacewalk," the statement read. "At this time, all telemetry received and analysed is within our expected results." The cameras were made for Urthecast by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire, UK. The high-resolution video unit should provide a resolution on the ground of about 1m per pixel. Large crowds and moving vehicles would be visible on this scale. The second camera will provide static imagery at a medium resolution of 5m per pixel. "Testing of every part of the camera system will now follow. Once that's completed, we can expect the first imagery to be released publicly," said Prof Richard Holdaway, the director of RAL Space. "We'll be helping Urthecast. We'll be checking the optical alignment and focus, to see that it is everything we expected," he told BBC News. Urthecast hopes to build a business around space station imagery. One of the customer sectors for the hi-res video, for example, is likely to be news organisations that want moving pictures of major events, such as war zones and regions of the Earth hit by natural disasters. It is hoping also to generate social media buzz around its imagery products, by enabling people to tag and share pictures through a special web portal. Urthecast is one of a group of Earth observation start-ups currently in the process of launching and commissioning space hardware. Skybox Imaging of San Francisco has already started to showcase video of Earth acquired by its small, free-flying SkySat-1 satellite.  And Planet Labs, another San Francisco venture, has a "flock" of 28 nano-satellite imagers that are about to be released out of the airlock on the ISS. The station itself is increasingly becoming a platform for Earth observation. This is quite a challenge, however. The movement of the astronauts inside the ISS makes it flex, and there is a constant vibration from onboard equipment. All this requires cameras to have dampers built into their rigs to maintain a steady shot. The US space agency (Nasa) will be launching another two Earth-observing instruments to the station this year.  One will study ocean winds and storms; the other will examine small particles in the atmosphere that can influence the climate.	Two British-built Earth-observation cameras have been successfully installed on the outside of the International Space Station (ISS)
Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea, had been missing since the collapse in February. His body was found on Wednesday and workers who carried out the search formed a guard of honour as it was driven from the site in the early hours of the morning. Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, remain missing. The body of a fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, was previously recovered from the site. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris, who has been involved with the family since the incident, said they still did not know all the facts about the collapse. She said: "I feel very sad. My heart and my prayers go out to the family who have waited desperately for Christopher's body to be found. They can finally have closure, and say goodbye to him and grieve his loss. "But let's not forget that there's two other families who are still waiting for their loved ones to be returned." The building was due for demolition when it partially collapsed in February.	A body found in the ruins of a collapsed building at Didcot Power Station has been identified.
An effort to raise cash for a role-playing video game was exposed as a fraud by users of Reddit, Something Awful and other sites. The project             had $4,739 (Â£2,922) in pledges  out of a target of $80,000 at the point it was pulled by its creator. Kickstarter could not provide comment at this time. The site has successfully funded             nearly 22,000 schemes  since it was created in 2009. Mythic: The Story of Gods and Men had promised "gameplay characteristics will be similar to that of World of Warcraft and the graphics quality should be up there with Skyrim". The commitment to compete on an equal footing with big budget titles and a claim that "animations will be done via motion capture thanks to some friends at Disney/Pixar" raised suspicions. The scheme also offered supporters the chance of being motion captured so that they could appear as a "god" in the game, a life-sized sword and a copy of the soundtrack recorded "at the Disney Studios" if they gave enough money. Internet users subsequently reported that teaser screenshots had been copied from unrelated concept art and graphic design tutorial websites. No money transferred hands as Kickstarter only charges backers' credit cards if a project attracts enough support before a time limit expires. However, some users have raised concerns about whether the site was doing enough to vet applicants. "What worried me the most is how Kickstarter allowed this to be posted in the first place," wrote David Kononen on the site's comments page. "A simple Google search, and I found out for myself this was very shady." The person responsible for the scam may have been trying to capitalise on the success of another video game. The studio Double Fine recently raised over $3.3m from more than 87,000 backers to develop a new point-and-click adventure. That sum has since been eclipsed by Pebble, an effort to build an e-paper based watch which has raised close to $7.7m in pledges, smashing its $100,000 goal with more than a fortnight to go before its deadline.	Crowdsourced funding site Kickstarter has suffered its first publicised scam.
Twenty-four buildings at Stow Maries Aerodrome, near Maldon, have been Grade II star-listed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The airfield site, which was used as a base for the 37th Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, is one of the few remaining of its kind in the country. It was listed for its "rarity" and "historical importance", Heritage Minister John Penrose said. The aerodrome was created in 1914 by the forerunner to the Royal Air Force. It was one of several in the south east of England used to defend London from German Zeppelin airship and bomber raids during the conflict. It ceased being used by the military in 1919 and was returned to agricultural use. Its buildings remained and, according to English Heritage, is now "the largest known surviving group of Royal Flying Corps buildings on a WWI aerodrome". In recent years the aerodrome was bought by private owners, who have had the buildings restored, and created a museum to tell its role during the war. In 2010, a war memorial commemorating the 10 pilots of 37 Squadron killed in action during WWI was erected on the former parade ground. Among the 24 surviving buildings are the officers' mess, accommodation huts, ammunition store, workshops, blacksmiths and mortuary. On granting the listed status, Mr Penrose said the aerodrome was a "poignant reminder of the conditions in which they were working". "I am listing Stow Maries for its rarity, its architectural interest, its value as a group and also of course for its historical importance as the first line of defence against German air raids," he said. English Heritage chief executive Simon Thurley said: "The importance of Stow Maries is amplified by the approaching 100th anniversary of the Great War. "It's in a remarkable state of preservation, full of historic interest and of great educational potential."	A World War I airbase in Essex has been granted listed status.
Lancashire batsman Livingstone, who scored 129 from 83 balls for England Lions against South Africa A last week, is one of five uncapped players named. Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Tom Curran and Craig Overton are the other four players yet to make their debut. The three-match series starts in Southampton on 21 June. England lost their last Twenty20 series 2-1 to India in February. Moeen Ali, Jake Ball, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Ben Stokes have been rested and will instead play for their respective counties in the inaugural day-night round of the County Championship, which starts on 26 June. This will allow them to gain experience of playing with the pink Dukes balls that will be used for the first day-night Test to be played in England, against West Indies at Edgbaston in August. Sussex fast bowler Tymal Mills, meanwhile, has been ruled out with a back injury, but Durham seamer Mark Wood returns after missing the India series through injury. Middlesex opener Malan, Surrey paceman Curran and Somerset all-rounder Overton have previously been included in England squads, while Hampshire leg-spinner Crane is called up after impressing in the North-South series in March. Overton will replace Wood in the squad after the first match, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow will be available for the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire. Jason Roy, who has managed just 18 runs in three innings for England in the ongoing Champions Trophy, is named in the squad. Chairman of selectors James Whitaker said: "The squad has an exciting blend of youth and experience and we are looking forward to a competitive series against strong opposition. "With five uncapped players selected, there is undoubted talent coming through the system and we are excited to see some of these players showcase their skills at the highest level." BBC Radio Lancashire's Scott Read There is a touch of Kevin Pietersen about Liam Livingstone when he gets onto the front foot to pull through mid-wicket. He is a powerful, destructive batsman who in white-ball cricket has the ability to take games away from the opposition and is great fun to watch.	Liam Livingstone has been given his first senior international call-up as England rest five players for the Twenty20 series against South Africa.
Silcox Coaches is a private coach hire and tour operator with bases in Pembroke Dock and Tenby, and has a contract with Pembrokeshire council to provide school transport. Letters have been sent home to staff this week explaining the situation and that a buyer is being sought. Silcox has been asked for a comment. It is understood customers enquiring about trips they have booked have been told the company has taken this action in order to protect the business as it seeks a new owner. The company was founded in 1882 and has run bus services around Pembrokeshire since 1932.  It is also one of the main suppliers for local sport teams. Pembrokeshire council said it was waiting to hear how a potential sale of Silcox would affect school transport. A council spokesman said: "We are aware of the possible restructuring of the company and we will work with all interested parties. "We anticipate a clearer picture of the situation emerging next week." He added: "At this time, Silcox continues to operate and the council will continue to pay the company for the work it is carrying out in accordance with our contractual obligations."	About 100 jobs could be at risk at a Pembrokeshire coach company which intends to file for administration, BBC Wales understands.
The company's management team says the internet means that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. Playboy's circulation has fallen dramatically from its peak in the mid-1970s. We have been asking what you think of this change; on Twitter, on Facebook and on our story. Many of you think it is a most welcome move and might even help encourage a more respectful portrayal of women in the media. Others think it is simply a smart marketing choice. Some, rather wistfully, see it as the "end of an era". Other people say that without the nudity, it is the beginning of the end of Playboy. However, many others are pointing out that if you want to see naked people, you can just go online. As Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders put it: "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free." Quite. Maybe there is a bigger problem. Is the magazine itself outdated as a form of media? Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000. Finally, some people are simply very happy that a certain well-known trope will now be true.	Playboy magazine has announced it is to stop publishing pictures of fully naked women.
Kirsty McGuire, from Dover, Kent, said her son Codie McDowell was left screaming with pain. The accident in East Sussex has led his family to warn of the dangers of barbecues on beaches to prevent it happening to anyone else. But Rother council said disposal barbecues were banned from the beach. Ms McGuire said: "He stood on it, yelped 'just get it off me, get it off me'  and that's when my brother's picked him up and all the bottom of his foot's just blistered." She said when they looked at the sand they first realised it was bright red and then they saw the barbecue underneath it. "How someone could just be so selfish and not put their rubbish in the bin," she said. "It doesn't take long to put a barbecue out especially with the amount of sea that's there and dispose of it properly." She added: "I felt helpless. He was in so much pain and screaming and there's nothing that I could have done to prevent it and when he's laying there in hospital and he's 'mummy take the pain away', obviously it breaks my heart." She said her son now needed hospital visits every three or four days for his injuries. Councillor Simon Elford, tourism portfolio holder at Rother District Council, said:  "We were very sorry to hear at the injuries received by this young boy and wish him a speedy recovery. "To ensure the safety of everyone using this popular beach, disposable barbecues are banned and our officers carry out regular checks of the beach during busy periods."	A four-year-old child has been badly burned after he stepped on a disposable barbecue that was buried at Camber Sands while it was still alight.
The main feature was a drop in bank shares. That came after the news that Deutsche Bank faces a $14bn penalty to settle an investigation by US regulators into the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities. Shares in RBS fell by 4.4%, Barclays by 2.8% and Standard Chartered by 2.7%. Neil Wilson, from ETX Capital, said the Deutsche case could have serious implications for RBS which was "among a number of European institutions that could face similar claims from the US Department of Justice", he said. "RBS could have to pay up to $13bn to settle the claims. "Even a third of this figure could deliver a crippling blow to the lender, making its return to profitability even further off. It would also derail plans to return the bank to private ownership any time soon," Mr Wilson added. Among the main risers in London were TUI, up nearly 4%; Shire, up 3.2%; and Burberry, up 3%. On the currency markets, the pound fell 1.2% against the dollar to $1.309 and dropped 0.4% against the euro to â‚¬1.1730.	(Close): London share prices fell back slightly, with the FTSE 100 index closing 20 points lower at 6,710, a fall of just 0.3%.
"The rules of the game are changing," the prime minister declared. And he launched a 12-point plan of tough measures to deal with the threat of terrorism. I can remember writing them all down in my notebook and wondering when this bewildering list of policies was going to end. Chaos ensued. Opposition parties protested they had not been consulted. The then Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee dismissed the policies as "half-baked". And Mr Blair went on holiday leaving his Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, to pick up the pieces. Day after day, there were emergency news conferences as the policies were clarified, rewritten and embellished. Some were quietly forgotten - such as new powers to close mosques - and others provoked divisive parliamentary battles, such as allowing the police 90 days to detain terror suspects without charge. The attacks transformed the politics of the summer. But the key point is this: Mr Blair had already won his third election in May with a healthy majority of 66. In contrast, Theresa May is dealing with her terrorism while the election campaign is still going on. For the prime minister, there are several lessons she could take from the experience of her Labour predecessor. Anti-terror laws made up on the hoof in the heat of the moment are not always the best ones. And laws do not always help. Since 2000, there has also been a lot of counter-terrorism legislation passed by Parliament and yet the threat is still there and very real. Yet Mrs May clearly felt the need to say something in Downing Street in response to the London Bridge attack that went beyond the usual condemnation of the violence, sympathy for the victims and their families and praise for the security forces. The fact that she announced some policy prescriptions showed that, in her mind, the need to be seen to being doing something outweighed the inevitable criticism of politicising the reaction to the incident. And, of course, a four-point plan was better than Mr Blair's 12. This was a recognition by the prime minister that security is now a significant issue in this election. Long after the rows of this campaign are over the government that is elected will still be facing the threat of Islamist terrorism. Where once the last few days of the election might have been focused on Brexit or tax or spending, much time and space will now be devoted to police numbers, intelligence capacity and extremist ideology. It is a political truism that security issues tend to favour the incumbent, allowing the prime minister of the day to look and be prime ministerial. It lifts them temporarily from the petty partisan point-scoring to the Olympian heights of statesmanship and all that a Downing Street podium can confer upon them. In times of uncertainty, the status quo looks attractive. As Belloc rhymed, "Always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse". Yet for Mrs May this is a double-edged sword. Her security background gives her the experience and knowledge to sound convincing and credible on counter-terrorism. Yet it also gives her opponents a record to attack and ask what on earth she has been doing as home secretary over the past seven years to tackle the threat. Has she, for example, been increasing or cutting police budgets? Security is also double-edged for Jeremy Corbyn. These attacks have allowed his opponents to revive past comments revealing his reluctance to use armed force, to accuse him of consorting with members of the IRA, and to remind voters of his opposition to many counter-terrorism laws. But the issue also allows the Labour leader to surprise voters with a counterintuitive promise to give the police full authority to use force. It also gives him space to question some of Britain's alliances with countries in the Middle East from where some Islamist ideology originated. The truth is that the impact of such incidents on elections is not straightforward. In Israel, for instance, what are considered to be terror attacks tend to favour parties of the right over parties of the left. But the evidence elsewhere appears inconsistent and sketchy. The terror attack in Paris this April did not help the Front National leader, Marine Le Pen. But in Spain in 2004, the attack on Madrid's commuter trains that killed 192 people - just three days before polling - did not help save the ruling centre-right Popular Party from defeat. The bottom line, perhaps, is that many voters in Britain will have seen terrorism before. And they will see it as just one issue among many on which they can base their vote. They also know that elections are about choosing a government for potentially five years and knee-jerk decisions are not always best for the long-term.	After the bomb attacks on London in July 2005, Tony Blair summoned the media to Downing Street for a news conference.
The 20-year-old striker was sent off by Mike Jones in Blues' 2-0 win on Saturday. But an FA Regulatory Commission upheld Blues' appeal for wrongful dismissal. Adams is now free to play against Bristol City on Sunday, with Harry Redknapp's side needing victory to secure Championship safety. Blues are 20th in the table and go to Aston Gate two points clear of the relegation zone but with an inferior goal difference to Nottingham Forest and Blackburn immediately below them.	Che Adams will be available to play in Birmingham City's final game of the season after his red card against Huddersfield was rescinded.
Gwent Police was called to the incident near Raglan Services at about 11:30 BST on Sunday. The ambulance service said a patient had been taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary. The road was closed in both directions between Monmouth and Raglan for about four hours but police said traffic was now moving freely.	A person has been taken to hospital by air ambulance following a serious crash on a major road in Monmouthshire.
Media playback is not supported on this device Like Cook before him, Root has been promoted from vice-captain, an elevation such a formality that the anointing of another leader would have come as a seismic shock. But an expected coronation does not guarantee that the crown will sit right, especially when Root is such an inexperienced skipper. Why is he the man for the job? What type of leader might he be? And how will it affect his batting? Root has long been tipped for the top job. As a 13-year-old playing club cricket for Sheffield Collegiate he was nicknamed 'FEC', for 'future England captain', a title once bestowed on Michael Atherton with similar accuracy. Since he made his debut at the age of 21 in December 2012, no batsman on the planet has made more than Root's 4,594 Test runs and only India's Virat Kohli has a better tally in all international cricket. He is perhaps the most complete three-format player that England have ever produced. The English way is to push the batting totem towards leadership - it was the same with Atherton, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Cook, with varying degrees of success. Now it is Root's turn. Although his leadership experience amounts to only four first-class matches, the tiny glimpses offered when he has briefly deputised for Cook hint towards an enthusiasm and dynamism for the job. At 26, he is a year older than Atherton when he took charge, but a year younger than Cook was. With 53 Tests to his name, he has 22 more than Vaughan when he was named skipper in 2003. "He's the obvious candidate," said England pace bowler James Anderson. "The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected. "He is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man. "Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man." Root hasn't quite been named captain by default, but it's not far off. Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler were all consulted after Cook's resignation, but it always seemed incredibly unlikely that any would beat Root to the job. Still, there is the suggestion that Root's carefree, jovial approach might not be best suited to leadership. "Root is the outstanding candidate, but you wouldn't want it to be a case of making your best player captain, only for it to backfire on you later," said former England off-spinner Graeme Swann. "I'm still not convinced Root is the right man for the job. I want him to concentrate on being the best player we have ever had, rather than having his talent curbed by the pressures of captaincy. "He has tried to be more sensible later, but part of his cheeky chappy persona makes him the player he is, and I don't want to see that taken away." And although Cook proclaimed Root to be "ready" for the captaincy during the tour of India, it was Root himself who said that he needs to "start growing up a bit" after an angry reaction to a dismissal in the fifth Test in Chennai. Fatherhood should help, a first-born son having arrived on 7 January, but if it is a different Root who leads England out against South Africa at Lord's on 6 July, will he have the same success that brought him to the captaincy? "It's hard to say how ready I am," said Root in January. "I've got quite a lot experience in Test cricket now, but it's one of these things where you have to learn on the job. "Being a dad you don't know what to do, you just have to go with it and see how it goes. I imagine being captain would be very similar." It is a downside of central contracts that England players have little or no opportunity to learn captaincy in the county game. Arguably, another related negative is that a player can only ever be schooled by the limited number of captains he has played under. Root, for example, has never played a Test under anyone other than Cook, while Cook's style of leadership was heavily influenced by predecessor Andrew Strauss. With just those four first-class matches under his belt, Root is one of the most inexperienced captains ever appointed by England - at least Cook had benefited from 18 months in charge of the one-day side. Root's style of leadership is therefore something of a mystery. The perception is that he will be more adventurous than Cook - but so is popping to the corner shop in your slippers instead of your shoes. "Joe will know what he would like to improve or what he would like to do differently," said former England captain Vaughan. "When all the speculation over Cook's future began, he will have gone home at night and thought 'what if I do get the job?' "But you're never too sure how you're going to be as a person until you get it. You can think you're going to be X or Y, but you can't be 100% sure." Of the four times Root has led in the first-class game, one match was in charge of England Lions, with the other three as Yorkshire skipper. In each of Root's matches as Tykes captain, fast bowler Ryan Sidebottom was part of the Yorkshire team. "I get changed next to him and he can be a scruffy little git, but when it comes to cricket knowledge he's very clued up and knows everything about the game," said Sidebottom. "If you look at the way he bats, he's got all the shots. He works hard on innovation, so I think he will be a creative captain. "When he plays, he takes the game to the opposition. The English way can be quite conservative; I'm sure he'll change that for the better." Media playback is not supported on this device It is incredibly English to fret over how taking on the responsibility of captaincy might affect the new leader's batting (they are almost always batsmen, after all). However, of the seven men with the most Tests as England captain, only one - Vaughan - has an average significantly worse as captain than when in the ranks. The batting records of Cook, Strauss and Nasser Hussain are similar whether captain or not, while Atherton, Peter May and Graham Gooch saw their runs increase with responsibility, the latter two dramatically so. It is not just English leaders with lengthy tenures who have seen a spike in their scoring. Of Root, India's Kohli, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson - widely regarded as the four finest batsmen on the planet right now - the Englishman is the last of the quartet to take over as his nation's Test captain. Each has seen an improvement in his batting average, Williamson by a small amount, Kohli and Smith by more than 20 runs each. Realistically, though, England would probably settle for Root's record to hold steady. His batting average of 52.80 is the highest by any England player to have played at least 20 innings since 1968. Any improvement on that would be pretty remarkable. The status quo of Cook leading the Test side and Eoin Morgan taking charge of the one-day and Twenty20 outfits worked well for England because neither was a threat to the other. Both were miles away from getting into the teams they did not lead. Three-format man Root's elevation to lead the Test side poses a problem for the England and Wales Cricket Board. Do they leave Morgan, who has presided over an incredible improvement in England's one-day cricket and guided them to the World Twenty20 final, in charge, or give Root three sets of reins? Those in favour of change will say there are very few examples of a Test captain playing for too long under a different limited-overs skipper, while any dip in results or form could increase pressure on Morgan. However, director of cricket Strauss' crusade to bring limited-overs success to the England side has seen greater and greater separation between the red-ball and the white-ball teams. One skipper for all could be seen as a return to a uniform approach that had largely been abandoned. And the relentless scheduling of international cricket more than justifies two skippers, particularly if resting Root from the shorter formats helps him cope with the mental and physical demands of Test leadership. Consider the winter schedule of 2017-18. The five Ashes Tests that begin at the end of November are followed by an ODI series against Australia, which rolls into a T20 tri-series also involving New Zealand. After that, England play five more ODIs and two Tests against the Kiwis, which might not conclude until the end of March. A player involved in all parts of that tour could be on the other side of the world for five months or more. Even two captains might not be enough. England captains have a natural shelf-life. Of the seven skippers with the most Tests, discounting any time as a stand-in, only May's reign spanned more than five years - and that ended in 1961. Of the longest-serving skippers since the late 1980s, Gooch managed five years, Atherton four, Hussain four, Vaughan five (with an enforced 18-month break because of a knee injury), Strauss four and Cook just over four. From the seven longest serving of all-time, Cook has taken charge of most matches thanks to the Test-hungry nature of the ECB's scheduling department. That Root's tenure begins with five Test-free months is an anomaly, but one that will soon be compensated for. Over the succeeding 14 months or so, England will cram in 21 Tests. If we take July to be the proper start to Root's reign and assume that the fickle mistresses of form, fitness and results allow him to be in charge for four and a half years, then his spell as skipper could end with the 2021-22 Ashes in Australia. By then, he could have been at the helm for more than 60 Tests - an England record - and, at his current rate of scoring, will have become the second Englishman to reach 10,000 runs. He will have just turned 31, so will still feasibly have half a decade of Test batting left in him, much like Cook does now. At the point, a 25-year-old Haseeb Hameed could be the next unsurprising candidate to be given the keys to the kingdom.	In the least surprising move since England last needed a new Test captain, England have appointed Joe Root as the successor to Alastair Cook.
Ball, who featured against Pakistan A in Dubai, has taken six wickets in each of Notts' first two games and is the leading wicket-taker in Division One of the County Championship so far in 2016. Read said of the 25-year-old: "Last winter he got fitter and stronger. "Now he's genuinely lively and he does plenty with the new ball." Read said Ball's assured early showings have demanded he lead Notts' bowling attack with the new ball alongside England's Stuart Broad. "Jake is in fantastic form with the ball," continued Read. "He's had a great winter having been in Dubai with the Lions and has had a taste of what life is like with the ECB set-up. He's really keen to progress that side of his career." Notts director of cricket Mick Newell said Ball, who was their second-highest County Championship wicket taker with 39 last season, said he has been "terrific" so far in 2016. "That's a fantastic start to the season and he's setting a great example," added Newell. Despite Ball's efforts against Lancashire, Notts suffered an eight-wicket defeat in their second Country Championship match of the season on Wednesday, having beaten Surrey in their opening fixture.	Pace bowler Jake Ball has made a "lively" return following a winter playing for England Lions, says Nottinghamshire captain Chris Read.
The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index grew to 50.1 from 49.4 in April, which had been the lowest reading since early 2013. The 50 mark separates manufacturing growth from contraction, with the sector now just on the positive side. Manufacturing failed to boost overall UK growth during 2015 and early 2016. UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compilers Markit, said: "The manufacturing sector looks likely to act as an increased drag on the economy in the second quarter. "There are also signs that increased client uncertainty resulting from slower growth and the forthcoming EU referendum are weighing on investment spending and business decision-making in general." The report found that more than a third of manufacturers surveyed believed uncertainty over the EU vote has had an impact on their business, with 8% saying the effect was "strongly detrimental". The survey showed the investment goods industry experienced a difficult month, with production falling at the quickest pace since early 2013. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the manufacturing sector was "essentially at a standstill in May". Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the small improvement for manufacturing in May did little to change the fundamental picture of a struggling industrial sector. "Granted, the headline PMI index recovered from its three-year low in April, ticking up from an upwardly revised 49.4 to 50.1 in May, above the consensus expectation of 49.6," she said. Ms Miller said this was still far below the average since the economic recovery picked up at the start of 2013. However, she thought the situation would "improve for UK manufacturers later this year". Overall new orders rose in May. Meanwhile, some firms said they were already pricing in the expectation that inflation will rise. Annual consumer price inflation currently stands at 0.3%.	UK manufacturing activity rose slightly in May, raising concerns over the economy's strength in the run-up to the 23 June European Union referendum.
The final member of the family, a male marmoset called Gomez, was found by police on Monday, having been abandoned on a vets' doorstep. A female and a baby were retrieved on Sunday, and are already back at Symbio Wildlife Park, south of Sydney. Two men have pleaded guilty to charges of dealing with proceeds of crime. Brothers Jesse and Jackson George are not believed to have snatched the monkeys from their enclosure, but they were charged with trying to profit from the theft. Pygmy marmosets - the world's smallest monkey species - command up to A$5,000 (Â£3,000, $3,700) on the black market. Police found the men after a tip-off from the public. A desperate appeal for information had been launched by the zoo, amid fears that the baby marmoset would die within 48 hours if unable to feed from its mother. The four-week-old was found when the Georges' car was pulled over at Appin, southwest of Sydney. The female marmoset was found about 20km (12 miles) away in the Campbelltown area. Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph said the brothers had exchanged marmoset pictures with a third person via mobile phone, along with messages about how much a monkey could sell for. "Ay, check out my monkey," wrote the third person, according to court documents. "That's mad bro. Wanna sell it bruh?" Jackson George replied. The baby marmoset is now home and well, said Symbio Wildlife Park, after they reunited it with its mother. "Mum cradled the baby straight into her arms and bub immediately began to feed," the zoo wrote in a statement on Facebook. Police say they are continuing their investigation into the theft.  The zoo said the marmoset enclosure is currently closed "to give the family privacy".	Three rare pygmy marmosets have been rescued and are set to be reunited, after being stolen from a Sydney zoo at the weekend.
Barcelona said it paid €57m (£43m) for Neymar in 2013 but investigators say the fee was closer to €83m and Barcelona concealed part of the deal. Neymar spent an hour and a half before the judge. He has previously denied wrongdoing, in an interview with Brazilian media. Leaving court, the football star signed autographs for fans. Barcelona FC says his parents, Neymar da Silva Santos and Nadine Goncalves da Silva Santos, received €40m and his former club, Santos, was paid €17m. Neymar's father, who arrived at court with him on Tuesday evening, acts as his agent. The case was brought by Brazilian third-party investment fund DIS, which owned 40% of the Brazilian player's sports rights. DIS alleges it was financially harmed by the transfer when it received €6.8m of Santos's €17m fee and argues it was deprived of its full share. Barcelona FC President Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor, Sandro Rosell, were called to give evidence at the court in Madrid on Monday, but they refused to testify. They insisted instead on the version of events they had given at a previous hearing. In a statement on Monday, the club said: "They are not worried and said they have confidence in justice." The pair are also accused in a separate case of defrauding the Spanish tax office of an estimated €13m. They deny the allegations. Neymar's move to Barcelona FC has been a big success on the pitch. The striker became part of a goal-scoring trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. In 2015, Neymar helped the club win five trophies and came third in the Fifa Ballon d'Or competition. He also scored in the Uefa Champions League final against Juventus. But the 23-year-old has also encountered legal difficulties in Brazil, where a court has frozen $47m (£33m) of his assets in connection with suspected tax evasion between 2011 and 2013.	Brazilian football star Neymar has appeared in court in connection with allegations of corruption and fraud surrounding his transfer to FC Barcelona.
The runaway critter was spotted on top of the house in Cambridgeshire. Fenland Animal Rescue was called in, but it was "a bit of a wrestle as he was not the friendliest of raccoons", said the charity's Josh Flanagan. "That said, I've never met one before, and we don't train in raccoon rescue techniques," he added. They are hoping to locate the animal's owner. Click here for more news from Cambridgeshire "Raccoons aren't native to this country, so he must have escaped from somewhere," Mr Flanagan said. "You can imagine their surprise when the householders saw one on their roof. "The woman thought her husband had lost the plot, but when she looked out, there it was, staring back at her through the window." With the animal jumping from the house to a garden shed roof, it was a short game of "cat and mouse" as Mr Flanagan tried to catch him. "At one point I was sat on the rooftop with him, and we were both eating bananas. I don't think I'll ever experience anything like that again, but it's why I do this job," he said. Eventually the animal was brought down safely, using a control pole. A few days after its ordeal, the racoon is settling in - but "causing havoc" - at the rescue centre's Whittlesey base. "He's a devilish boy, a bit vicious," Mr Flanagan said. "They look all cute and adorable, but they're not." If no one comes forward to claim him, he will be moved to a specialist rescue centre "where he can live his life in a safe and secure environment with other raccoons to call friends".	A woman thought her husband had "lost the plot" when he woke her up to tell her there was a raccoon on their roof.
The Premier League club say the 22-year-old left-back is expected to be sidelined for "up to eight weeks" after the knock in a 6-1 loss to Bournemouth. "The Scottish international damaged his calf during the second half of the defeat," said a club statement. Scotland will face England in World Cup qualifying Group F on 11 November. Gordon Strachan's side sit three points behind leaders England after three games. The Scotland head coach had remarked before this month's 1-1 draw with Lithuania that his squad had "incredible" strength in depth at left-back. Robertson started at Hampden but picked up a knock and Celtic's Kieran Tierney took over for the 3-0 defeat in Slovakia. Hull were 3-1 down at the Vitality Stadium when they lost Robertson to injury after 63 minutes, defeat knocking them down to 16th, two places and one point above the relegation spots. The game was Mike Phelan's first since his appointment as head coach until the end of the season following a spell as caretaker. The left-back said on Twitter: "Looks like I'll be a supporter for the next few weeks! Hopefully the lads can kick on." Robertson's Scotland team-mate, goalkeeper David Marshall, has endured a miserable spell since his transfer from Cardiff City, conceding 15 goals in his first four outings for the Tigers.	Andrew Robertson will miss Scotland's trip to Wembley to face England and up to 10 games for Hull City after suffering a calf injury.
Andrew Barrett, 32, from Norfolk, worked for the East of England Ambulance Service but resigned when he was charged. The girl was aged 14 and 15 when she was sexually assaulted in summer 2013 and May last year. Barrett, of Rayners Way, Mattishall, who was not on duty when he committed the offences, was jailed for 16 months. Norwich Crown Court heard the father of one met the girl while doing voluntary work and began sending her sexually explicit messages on Whats App and by text. He also texted the girl naked photographs of himself and became "persistent in his requests" for her to do the same, the court was told. Martin Ivory, prosecuting, said she eventually sent him five pictures. During the first sexual assault, he hugged her when she became upset and touched her indecently. The second took place while he was driving and she was in the passenger seat. He again touched her indecently. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the girl said she became anxious every time she heard an ambulance siren and at the prospect of ever having to call an ambulance. She said she had nightmares and had self-harmed. David Wilson, defending, said Barrett had been a man of "exemplary conduct" and had worked for the ambulance service for 13 years. Disregarding Mr Wilson's call for a suspended sentence, Judge Antony Bate said: "I would be failing in my public duty if I didn't send you to prison immediately today."	A paramedic who admitted sexually assaulting a teenager and possessing indecent images of her has been jailed.
US media report that Tori Castillo, 39, is facing child abuse charges and the children are now with their father. Onlookers in the car park instructed the five-year-old on how to open the boot from the inside, reports say. Passersby had noticed the car shaking and noise coming from inside where it was parked outside a Walmart. The incident happened on Thursday in Riverdale, Utah. It is not clear how long the children were in the boot. Local police officer Casey Warren told KTVX: "It's never right to lock a child inside of a vehicle, let alone a trunk of a vehicle. "Obviously there's a lot of things that could go wrong." He praised the "good Samaritans" who helped the children get out. Under Utah state law, leaving a child under the age of nine unattended in a vehicle is punishable by a fine or jail time. The law was enacted in 2011 after repeated cases of children dying unattended in hot cars.	A woman has been arrested in the US after allegedly locking her children, aged two and five, in the boot of her car while she went shopping.
Australian ship Ocean Shield is first investigating a possible third signal elsewhere in the massive search zone. None has been confirmed as coming from the flight recorders of MH370. Meanwhile families of the missing passengers have attended a prayer service in Kuala Lumpur. By Nick ChildsWorld affairs correspondent, BBC News Pursuing those pulses The plane disappeared four weeks ago with 239 people on board. Investigators believe it crashed in the Indian Ocean although no confirmed debris has been found. Australian co-ordinators said on Sunday that new analysis of satellite data meant efforts would now focus on the southern part of the search zone, near where China's vessel is located. Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said China's Haixan 01 had redetected a signal for about 90 seconds on Saturday, within hours of it being heard earlier. He said the latest discovery was about 2km (1.2 miles) away from the original pulse, and that China had also reported spotting white objects on the surface of the water about 90km away. "The fact that we have two detections - two acoustic events - in that location provides some promise," he said. However he said these signals were "fleeting encounters" that could not be verified until the arrival of British naval ship HMS Echo and Australian defence vessel Ocean Shield. Both vessels have technology able to detect underwater signals emitted by "black box" data recorders. HMS Echo arrived around 15:45 GMT on Sunday. The depth of the water in this zone is said to be about 4.5km (2.8 miles). Ocean Shield - described by officials as the best equipped vessel taking part in the search - will head there once it has investigated a third acoustic detection about 300 nautical miles away (560km). It is not expected to reach the southern area for over a day. As crews began day 30 of the search on Sunday, Air Chief Marshal Houston told reporters investigators were "running out of time" in the search for the flight's "black box". The battery-powered signal from recorder can begin to fade after 30 days. Thousands of people, including families of the missing passengers, attended the prayer service in the Malaysian capital on Sunday. "This is not a prayer for the dead because we have not found bodies. This is a prayer for blessings and that the plane will be found," said Liow Tiong Lai, the president of the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), one of the parties in the governing coalition. A dozen military aircraft and 13 ships are searching three areas about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) north-west of the Australian city of Perth. What we know The search for flight MH370 Pursuing those pulses The areas cover a total of 216,000 sq km (560,000 square km). Haixun 01 picked up the first so-called "ping" signal at about 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, state-run Xinhua news agency said. The signal reportedly had a frequency of 37.5kHz - the same as that emitted by the flight recorders. Three people on board the boat were said to have heard the pings, which were not recorded as they came suddenly. Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March. Malaysia earlier announced it had set up three ministerial committees to help co-ordinate the search, and a new investigation team which would include members from Australia, China, the US, the UK and France.	A UK ship with sophisticated detection equipment, HMS Echo, has arrived in an area where a Chinese vessel searching for the missing Malaysian plane has twice detected a pulse signal.
Hampshire, who chose to bowl, had Essex 0-1 when Nick Browne was caught off the bowling of Fidel Edwards. Rain then caused a lengthy delay, but Cook (114 not out) and Westley (111) dominated when play resumed. Kyle Abbott finally ended their stand, bowling Westley with the last ball of the day as Essex closed on 243-2. England opener Cook's ton was his second of the season, with the former Test captain averaging 81.75 with the bat through five first-class innings this season. He was ably supported by Westley, whose century was his first of the season in first-class cricket. Hampshire could take few positives from a difficult first day, especially after a shoulder injury to fast bowler Edwards, but Abbott's late removal of Westley will leave them with some hope of limiting the hosts' score. Essex batsman Tom Westley: "It's good to get that first score out of the way. That first Championship hundred of the season is always nice. It was tough going, but it's pleasing to get some runs. What's most pleasing is the position we're in after being put in to bat. "We would have wanted to bowl first in those conditions. It did nip around in the first hour and a half. It's a good cricketing wicket, but there is definitely a bit in it for the bowlers, but also if they miss their length you feel you score. "I don't think Cookie will mind me saying we both played and missed. On another day you can nick them and we can be 100 for three or four. But sometimes you have to ride the luck and Cookie's was a chanceless hundred. They bowled well at him, so it wasn't easy going. It's great having him at the other end. He just loves scoring runs. He's a huge asset for the club." Hampshire coach Craig White: "We'll assess Fidel Edwards' injury in the morning, but it looks a bit sore and he'll struggle to take a further part in the game. "Every game it seems this year we've had a bowler go down. It's not ideal, it's just frustrating. Injuries happen I know but when it happens every game and you're a bowler down you wonder if you're doing something wrong." "It was a frustrating day. At the start we wouldn't have thought they'd only be two wickets down at the end of play. I'm a little bit shocked really. It was great conditions to bowl in and we probably early on didn't get enough balls consistently in the right areas. But you have to take your hat off to those two. They played really well."	Alastair Cook and Tom Westley both hit centuries as Essex took charge on a rain-affected first day against Hampshire in the County Championship.
The 21-year-old is eligible to face Macclesfield on Saturday. Former Port Vale player Jefford has made 27 appearances for Welling this season. "Ben is a good young player that we potentially feel is a league player," Rovers assistant boss Jamie Day told BBC Wiltshire. "He has gained some good experience."	National League side Forest Green Rovers have signed defender Ben Jefford on an 18-month contract from Welling.
George Verrier was treated by officers who were called to an altercation involving about 20 people in Bromley in the early hours of Sunday. He did not want to be taken to hospital, said police, but was found unconscious several hours later in nearby Ferndale. He died in hospital. A 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail. The Met said it had voluntarily referred the actions of officers who went to the scene to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for assessment. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: "At this early stage it appears the victim suffered a head injury as a result of the altercation. "Inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident." George, a trainee electrician, was injured in Southborough Road at about 00:45 BST, while on his way home from the party in adjacent Blenheim Road. Police were called at about 09:30 BST to a home in Ferndale - about a mile away - after he fell unconscious. He was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he died at about 18:00 BST. He had been due to have his first driving lesson on Tuesday. Cornelius Moran, whose 16-year-old daughter was having the party, said: "He was a good friend of my daughter's. A lovely boy from what she tells me. "My thoughts are with the family." A woman who lives near the party venue, but did not wish to be named, said: "It looked like a very well-organised party - it was noisy, that's all. "The family who had the party are such a nice family." Another neighbour said some partygoers had been turned away from the house. He said: "We were very much aware of the noise. That stopped at about 12.30am when the music stopped. "My wife was looking out of the window and she could see three large adults leading a group of youngsters up the road, turning them away from the party."	A 17-year-old boy has died of head injuries following a fight after a party in south-east London.
Protesters have been on the the streets since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April - a week after a police encounter where he sustained unexplained injuries. Shops have been looted and objects thrown at police, injuring several officers. It was the first time in the history of professional baseball that fans had been locked out of a game. The game at Camden Yards started at 14:05 EDT due to the city's 22:00 curfew in the wake of the riots, with Baltimore winning 8-2. Among the few able to witness the match were those who had paid for balcony rooms in the nearby Hilton Hotel, which overlooks the stadium. Journalists accredited to cover the game reported that the voices of players on the infield could be heard clearly. "Attention media: For record-keeping purposes, today's official paid attendance is ... zero," an announcement made over the press box public address system said. Other reports said the stadium still played the traditional US baseball anthem - Take Me Out To The Ballgame - during the traditional seventh-inning stretch. The Orioles and Major League Baseball officials had said the decision to shut out fans had been taken for safety reasons. But Brendan Hurson, one of the 40 spectators gathered by a fence near the stadium's main gate, said it was a missed opportunity and held up a sign reading "Don't forget Freddie Gray". Six police officers have been suspended following Gray's death and an internal investigation is under way. On Sunday, more than 1,000 protesters were on the streets of Baltimore and at least 12 arrests made. Gray, who was 25, is the latest of a series of black Americans to die in police custody in recent months, triggering angry protests accusing the police of brutality.	Fans were locked out of Baltimore Orioles' game against Chicago White Sox following violent protests in the city.
Tory sources have said Mr Reckless, the AM for South Wales East, has held talks with Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives. An announcement is due on Thursday which would see Mr Reckless join the Tory group in Cardiff Bay. It is understood Mr Reckless will be an independent AM rather than re-join the Conservative Party. There is resistance to re-admitting Mr Reckless following his dramatic defection from the Conservatives to join UKIP in September 2014. The then-MP fought and won a by-election in his Rochester and Strood seat in November that year, but lost his seat in the May 2015 General Election. He was elected to the Assembly in May 2016 as UKIP won their first seats in Cardiff Bay, and he is currently chairman of the Climate Change, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee. He had also worked as a researcher for MP Douglas Carswell, who left UKIP last month. The move would mean the Conservative group would become the second-largest, with 12 seats to Plaid Cymru's 11.	UKIP AM Mark Reckless is set to quit the party and vote with the Conservative group in the Assembly.
The beach where Seifeddine Rezgui stood on Friday, pulled a Kalashnikov from his parasol and unleashed Tunisia's worst ever terror attack, has already reopened. Camera crews capture the spot; passers-by pause for a moment. But the emotional scars of the tragedy that took place will live on for a generation. For 57-year-old Sabi, they're still raw. He runs the boat club on the beach, used principally by customers of the Hotel Imperial, targeted that day. He points to the spot where the gunman opened fire, appearing first to make a phone call, before throwing his mobile into the sea and beginning his killing spree. "People all around me were falling", he recalls, "and I just grabbed as many customers as I could and ran." They went through a staff gate to a basement of the hotel - but Sabi returned to bring more to safety. "I saw six of our loyal customers die, people who always came to this hotel. They were like brothers to me. This beach should be full of life now. But it's deserted." Sabi pauses, looking at the rows of empty sunbeds. "We will fight", he says, his lip quivering, tears welling up. "At least we can still smile". Tunisia is a nation in shock - and its tourism lifeline is under serious threat. Thousands of holidaymakers have already left on emergency flights laid on by tour operators. I watched as another busload from the Hotel Imperial arrived at the local Enfidha airport on Saturday night, heading for Manchester. Among them was one man whose fiancee had died in front of him. Most were too traumatised to talk. But in the hotels beside the Imperial, dozens are staying put. "I wanted to leave early", says Isabelle Campbell from Gateshead, "but my husband said: if we go, they win. I'm not relaxed though, I'm nervous about going to the beach." Her husband, Bob Taylor, says they ventured down earlier and saw a speed-boat manoeuvring in the water, revving its engines towards them. "For a moment, we thought: Oh God, something is going to happen again. We used to go to Egypt but changed to Tunisia because of the security threat there", he adds. "Now we don't know what'll happen here." One in ten Tunisians works in the tourism industry. It took a hit after the attack on the Bardo museum in March - and is now widely expected to plummet. The fear of that has only added to Tunisians' anguish over a worrying rise in Islamist attacks. The birthplace of the Arab Spring, which was widely praised for its largely peaceful transition to democracy, now has more people fighting in Syria and Iraq than any other country: an estimated 3,000 Tunisians are thought to be there, many feared to have joined so-called Islamic State (IS). A once peaceful Arab democracy has been shaken by the chaos and civil conflict of neighbouring Libya, where IS has taken root and is thought to train increasing numbers of Tunisians crossing a porous border. It is all a vast challenge for Tunisia's new coalition government, which has scrambled to announce a security clampdown, including the closure of 80 mosques suspected of being breeding grounds for radical Islam. Critics say the reaction has been too late. "These people want to destroy Tunisia," says Dorra Brahem, a local student, walking on the beach with her sister Aisha and friend Fatma. "They have misunderstood Islam. Something serious is happening here". Has the joy of Tunisia's revolution died, I ask? "Yes", says Dorra. "At least now we can wear headscarves and go to mosques - with the old dictator, it wasn't like that. But we miss something. We miss peace." 6.1 million the number of tourist arrivals to Tunisia in 2014 15.2% the total contribution of travel and tourism to Tunisia's GDP 473,000 the number of jobs supported by travel and tourism (13.8% of total employment) We are seeking your stories relating to the Tunisia attacks.

The space agency has set out a three part plan, which it hopes will eventually lead to humans living on Mars by the 2030s. Unlike the Moon, humans have never physically set foot on Mars, we've only ever used robots like the Curiosity Rover. By exploring Mars with robots for the last 40 years Nasa has found out lots about our neighbouring planet, including the recent discovery that there is flowing icy water under the crust. They hope that this huge mission will help us to learn even more about not just Mars, but Earth as well. So, how will they do it? Since 2010 Nasa has been testing out the effects of what living in space can do to the human body, to prepare them for the journey to Mars, and also for living there. They have done this by sending astronauts to live onboard the International Space Station for long periods of time. Nasa also sent a team of scientists to live in a "Mars-like" dome for a year near a volcano on Earth, to see if the team can live happily on their own, away from everyday human-life. They are also doing a number of tests on Mars spacesuits and are currently trying out technology which could be used on the planet. In the "Proving Ground" part of their plan, Nasa hope to be able to do experiments in a "deep space" environment which will allow scientists and astronauts to return to Earth in a matter of days. Most of these experiments will take place in the Moon's orbit. Some of their plans include teaming up with the European Space Agency as part of their Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission in 2020, which aims to take a large asteroid from a near-Earth orbit, and move it to travel around the Moon instead. Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft will then explore the asteroid in the 2020s, and return to Earth with samples. NASA will also be testing out its powerful new systems such as the Space Launch System rocket and Solar Electric Propulsion, which would be used for sending supplies to the team, and also for long space travel. Nasa will build a new rover robot to join the Curiosity rover in 2020. It will have lots of new gadgets to test out on Mars. One of these gadgets is called MOXIE, and will be trying to make oxygen, which is an important part of the air we breathe here on Earth, from carbon dioxide, which is in the atmosphere on Mars, Researchers will also be investigating ways astronauts can recycle better in space. In the "Earth Independent" phase of Nasa's plan, they hope to be able to send humans to Mars, using all the research and new technology they discovered in the previous phases. At the moment it takes around eight months to travel to Mars, but scientists are looking into ways to reduce this time. By 2030 Nasa are hoping they will be able to send people to the edges and surface of Mars, not just to visit, but also to live there for a long period of time. They will be looking into ways to make fuel, water, oxygen and building materials on the Red planet. Nasa will also be looking into improving their communications systems with Earth, to allow for quicker exchanges of research and data For years scientists have been curious about the Red planet, and whether or not humans would be able to live there. Recent research has proved that there is water on the planet, and that at one point Mars' climate was perhaps similar to that on Earth. Robot rovers are also looking for the possibility of whether there is alien life there too. Sending humans to the planet could help speed up the research and allow us to better understand the history of Mars. Nasa are also curious to find out if studying Mars could help us find out more about our own planet, and even how our solar system was born. However Nasa could be pipped to the post in the race to Mars, as a non-profit organization based in the Netherlands has said they will land humans on Mars by 2027.	Nasa has revealed its plans to try to get humans living on Mars in the next few decades.
It will be the first concerted use of an emerging technique called Crispr to "snip out" specific disease genes in order to discover drugs. The technique is cheaper, faster and more accurate than current methods. The research will be carried out with four leading academic and industrial gene-research centres across the world. AZ vice-president Dr Lorenz Mayr hopes it will speed the development of medicines for illnesses including diabetes, heart disease and many cancers "You can't stop the science," he told BBC News. "It is one of the biggest developments in the area of biotechnology in decades." Many serious illnesses occur when genes in the human body go wrong. The human genome project determined that humans had about 24,000 genes. These are found along the DNA double helix in every cell in the body. The decoding of the human genome 15 years ago led to the hope that doctors would eventually identify faulty genes responsible for specific diseases and eventually develop medicines to treat them. The principle is simple - drug companies would "snip out" the gene responsible for the disease from the patient's DNA, then use it to test drugs to see if they could fix the problem. At the time, US President Bill Clinton said: "Our children's children will only know cancer as a constellation of stars," and hailed the completion of the project after a 10-year race that cost billions. And Tony Blair, then UK Prime Minister, who joined the Mr Clinton by satellite from Downing Street, added: "Every so often in the history of human endeavour, there comes a breakthrough that takes mankind across the frontier and into a new era." Fifteen years on, one could wonder: "What new era?" There are only a handful of new medicines based on the human genome project, and, although Mr Clinton may eventually be proved right, cancer is still known as "cancer". Progress has been hampered by two main factors. First, researches soon began to realise that most common illnesses were caused by any combination of tens of genes. Second, the genetic techniques to snip out specific genes are expensive and take a long time. Researchers have to make what are in effect "genetic scissors" tailor-made to the gene they want to snip out. This process can take months for each and every gene. But in recent years, scientists have developed a set of genetic scissors that can be quickly and cheaply tailored to cut out a specific gene. And this technique, called Crispr, will be the focus of the research programme. Dr Kosuke Yusa, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, one of the academic organisations involved in the project, said "this powerful technology" would enable "researchers to target genes with incredible specificity". Also involved are the Innovative Genomics Initiative, a joint venture between the University of California, Berkeley, and University of California in San Francisco, the Broad Institute/Whitehead Institute and Thermo Fisher Scientific, which are both based in  Massachusetts.

The shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore city. Police say the alleged gunman, identified as Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school. Incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are very rare. It is not clear what prompted the shooting. Police said on Thursday that Mahesh had been remanded until 12 April. Mahesh is alleged to have barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on on Tuesday evening. He then shot another student, Sirisha, who suffered severe injuries but is believed to be out of danger, say police. He was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt. India has strict control laws, although a large number of feuds are settled with firearms. In 2007, a 14-year-old schoolboy was shot dead by two fellow students at a school campus near the capital, Delhi.	A man arrested on suspicion of shooting a female student dead and wounding another at a school in India has been remanded in custody.
Tenants cleared from Glancalvie Estate set up a camp in Croick Churchyard, near Ardgay, 170 years ago. Some who camped scratched their names into the glass of the church windows. The names are still visible today. A descendant of one of the infants fed from the decanter has handed it into the care of Inverness Museum. Donald MacMillan's grandmother Christina Ross was the daughter of John Ross, a shepherd who with his family and others was cleared from the estate. They set up a temporary camp at Croick Church in Sutherland in May 1845. The families later left to settle in other parts of the Highlands. With help from High Life Highland, which runs Inverness Museum, Mr MacMillan researched his family's history and was able to add new details to what he already knew about his grandmother. She and various members of her family went on to settle in and around Kilmorack, near Beauly, and Achnagart in Glen Shiel. Those who worked with Mr MacMillan in the research were Anne Fraser, family historian at the Highland Archive Centre, and Cait McCullagh, curator at the museum. Jim Hunter, emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an author of books on the clearances, also assisted in researching the significance of the Croick Decanter. To mark the relic's donation an event will be held at Inverness Museum and Art Gallery on 27 August. Prof Hunter will deliver a talk called Indelible Characters: Relics and remnants of Highland Clearance times. Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer. Landowners were seeking to "improve" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. The clearances have influenced the stories of two new films. Slow West, a Western starring Michael Fassbender and Kodi Smit-McPhee and written and directed by Scotsman John Maclean, opened in UK cinemas in June. Its plot features a clearance based on forced evictions in Wester Ross. The second film, a new short, will tell the story of Kate McPherson, who was among 80 people cleared off land in Sutherland and emigrated to Canada where they were settled in the Red River colony. Once in Canada, they had to walk 100 mile (161km) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes. Sutherland-born composer Robert Aitken is in the process of making the short film, Last Footsteps of Home. It will be free of dialogue.	A wine decanter taken from a church during the Highland Clearances and used by evicted families to feed milk to babies has been gifted to a museum.
Newport's win over Accrington sees the Exiles leapfrog Pools, putting them two points in front with two games remaining. Victory for Barnet, under caretaker boss Rossi Eames, was only their second win in 13 games. But they controlled the match throughout against a side lacking in confidence, belief and ability. John Akinde was denied an opener after 12 minutes when his angled header was tipped over for a corner. From the set-piece Michael Nelson, the Barnet skipper, fired a shot against a post, while Jack Taylor's goal-bound shot was deflected wide. Nathan Thomas got Pools' first shot on target after 64 minutes, failing to test goalkeeper Josh Vickers. And the Bees went ahead in the 66th minute when Akinde turned and powerfully fired an angled drive past goalkeeper Joe Fryer. Simeon Akinola made it two five minutes later, the Bees racing away down the left side and Jamal Campbell-Ryce setting up the substitute. Akinde also missed a penalty, Fryer saving his weak spot kick with nine minutes remaining. Match report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Hartlepool United 0, Barnet 2.

Many more are feared trapped under rubble after hundreds of buildings collapsed. Thousands of people have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters and mosques. Some have been left homeless after their houses were destroyed, others have fled their homes amid fears of aftershocks and a possible tsunami. Rescue workers used diggers to remove rubble in their search efforts overnight on Wednesday. Others used their bare hands and shovels to find people. A few survivors were pulled out alive on Wednesday. More than 200 buildings were either seriously damaged or toppled in the earthquake. The Pidie Jaya region, on the north Aceh coast, was the hardest hit. The tremor hit just offshore early on Wednesday morning. Many of the homes in the area have corrugated tin roofs which collapsed. Hundreds have also been rushed to the sole functioning hospital, which has been overwhelmed by patients. Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was one of the worst hit areas by the 2004 tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake.	A 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Aceh province in Indonesia on Wednesday, killing at least 97 people.
Sean Earle snatched the bag of Linda Clarke, who had cut her wrists and walked out of hospital before sitting on a ledge over the M602 in Salford. After she fell to the ground, the 26-year-old "saw his opportunity" to steal her bag before running off, Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court heard. Earle, of Trevelyan Street, Salford, was bailed until sentencing on 17 July. Mrs Clarke, who had two daughters and was a full-time carer of her autistic son, walked out of Salford Royal Hospital in the early hours of 17 April. CCTV footage showed Earle walking the same way before approaching her as she made her way to the bridge nearby. A driver, who saw Mrs Clarke and Earle on the bridge, decided to turn back to check on her welfare. He saw Earle running away and realised the 55-year-old woman had "gone over the wall and is lying on the carriageway", prosecutor Shazia Aslam said. Police were called but Mrs Clarke, who was also a grandmother, was pronounced dead in hospital. It was then discovered that her handbag was missing and a policeman identified Earle from the CCTV footage. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Clarke's husband Gary said his wife's death had devastated the family and Earle had "added to our pain" with his "despicable" theft. Lorna Wincote, defending, said Earle was not charged with anything related to Mrs Clarke's death after an "extensive" police investigation. "He is also a person who suffers from his own mental health issues," she added.	A man has admitted stealing the handbag of a female carer after she fell to her death from a motorway bridge.
BBC Sport takes a look at five things you might have missed in the EFL on the last full match day before the festive season. There were six late winning goals in the Championship on Saturday, all with ramifications in the race for promotion and the bid to avoid relegation. Brighton's Glenn Murray headed home in the fifth minute of stoppage time against Birmingham City to ensure the Seagulls will spend Christmas eight points clear of third-placed Reading. Jaap Stam's men had looked like having to settle for a point at Blackburn before George Evans hit an injury-time winner to move them back up to third. Yorkshire rivals Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday ensured they would spend Christmas in the top six thanks to winners in the 89th minute and stoppage time against Brentford and Rotherham respectively. Meanwhile, 23rd-placed Wigan were set to take a point from their home game against Ipswich before David McGoldrick popped up with an 88th-minute winner for Mick McCarthy's men. Match of the day in the second tier must go to Barnsley's 4-3 win at Cardiff. The Bluebirds led in the third minute before trailing 3-1 at half-time. Peter Whittingham and Antony Pilkington's 89th-minute strike seemed to have given Neil Warnock's side an unlikely point but Ryan Williams scored in the fifth minute of injury time to make it a happy journey back to South Yorkshire for the Tykes. Well, maybe not quite miracles but it's probably fair to say neither Wes Brown nor Isaiah Osbourne would have been fancied by many to get on the scoresheet today. Former Manchester United and Sunderland man Brown, 37, scored on his Blackburn Rovers debut to level the match against the Royals. It counted for nothing in the end thanks to Reading's late winner but it was Brown's first goal since netting for Sunderland in December 2011. Walsall midfielder Osbourne only had to wait a shade over three years to end his scoring drought. The ex-Aston Villa player opened his account for the Saddlers to give them a point against Bradford City. He'll probably be pleased this goal meant a little more than his last one which opened the scoring for Blackpool against Derby in December 2013. The Rams went on to win 5-1. Yeovil boss Darren Way, assistant Terry Skiverton and the 18-strong match-day squad put £300 behind the bar at Carlisle as a 'thank you' to fans for making the long trek north. "Special mention must go to the supporters because how far they've travelled to watch this game is unbelievable commitment," Way told BBC Somerset. "This is beyond the end of the Earth. I just hope they feel that the players gave everything and they can be proud of their team." Travelling Glovers fans certainly seemed appreciative as they tweeted the club with pictures of pies and pints. Sadly for the 96 Yeovil fans who made the 660-mile round trip to Brunton Park, the hosts were not in such a generous mood, with the Cumbrians claiming a 2-1 win. Roll the clock back to 27 September and Bury are celebrating their sixth league win of the season and sit second in League One. The following 16 games have brought a sum total of zero victories and the Shakers have slumped into the relegation zone. David Flitcroft was sacked after presiding over seven consecutive league defeats but replacement Chris Brass, given the job until the end of the season on Thursday, has fared little better, losing his first five matches. Bury twice took the lead at home to Oxford on Saturday but were pegged back on each occasion by a Chris Maguire free-kick before a Greg Leigh own goal gave the U's victory. "We've got to dig in and fight a little bit harder than we are right now to keep the ball out of the net," Brass told BBC Radio Manchester. It's been a tough start to the season for Exeter City and their match-going regulars. Going into today's game against Mansfield, the Grecians had claimed a healthy seven wins away from home but were the only team in the EFL yet to taste success on their own turf. Paul Tisdale's side ended their wait for a win at St James Park, which dated back to April, with a 2-0 win over the Stags thanks to a double from Ollie Watkins. "I'm delighted," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon. "It had to come at some point and we did it today. It was hard work and the boys have deserved it against a really strong team. "They put us under pressure in the second half and in many respects outplayed us but we stuck to it and 2-0 is a great feeling."

They say that Christmas is the time for charity but there are going to be a few football managers across the country wishing their players had not been quite so generous this year.
Thomas Baker, known as Tommy, was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool on 27 January. The 44-year-old, from Everton, had been shot in the head and chest. He died later in hospital. The three Liverpool men arrested - two aged 29 and the other 32 - remain in police custody for questioning. Merseyside Police said Mr Baker had left Phoenix Gym at the market shortly before he was shot while getting into his car. Detectives believe those involved in the shooting had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour. Det Ch Insp Bev Hyland said officers were still searching for a silver VW polo, which "left the scene at speed" and travelled along a number of roads including Balmoral Road, Molyneux Road and Queens Road. She added that a number of people captured on CCTV near the meat market had yet to come forward and while "they may not think what they saw would be of any significance, they could have information which is key to our inquiries".	Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murder over the shooting of a man at a meat market.
The Commons' Home Affairs Committee said the UK Border Agency should challenge unacceptable behaviour by some of its contractors. The report comes 15 months after a deportee died on a flight. A spokesman for the UKBA said that all private security escorts are trained in approved restraint techniques. Jimmy Mubenga, 46, fell ill and collapsed on a British Airways plane bound for Angola on 12 October 2010. The MPs did not comment on the case, which is still being investigated by the police, but said that Mr Mubenga's death had triggered their own investigations into the way that the UK Border Agency managed the deportation of people on flights from the UK. The UKBA contracts out the job of escorting people to their deportation flight. The contract has been held by Reliance since May 2011 and previously by G4S. The MPs said found: "It is a matter for serious concern that contractors should use racist language among themselves," said the report. "That they were content to do so in front of not only UK Border Agency staff but also inspectors from HM Inspectorate of Prisons is shocking. It is possibly the result of a relationship between the Agency and its contractors which had become too cosy." Restraint techniques The MPs said that the UKBA's own staff should feel that they can properly challenge any bad behaviour by contractors - but it also criticised the practice of taking "reserves" to airports - people who may then find that they are not being removed from the UK after all. It called on the government to allow independent monitors, people allowed into prisons and removal centres, to board removal flights. The MPs said that they were not convinced that a potentially harmful head-down restraint position was never used, even though it was not authorised. A recent expert report found that such techniques could lead to death. "We recommend that the Home Office issue urgent guidance to all staff involved in enforced removals about the danger of seated restraint techniques in which the subject is bent forwards. "We also recommend that the Home Office commission research into control and restraint techniques which are suitable for use on an aircraft. The use by contractors of unauthorised restraint techniques, sanctioning their use, or failing to challenge their use, should be grounds for dismissal." Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the committee, said: "The UK Border Agency must not wash its hands of responsibility for detainees just because the service is contracted out. "People who are not entitled to remain in the country must be removed and there may be occasions when it is necessary to use physical force, but this must always be done only when absolutely necessary, and with proper respect for the dignity of the detainee." A UKBA spokesman said: "All escorts on flights are trained to use restraint techniques approved by the Prison Service. "We have no evidence contractors use head-down restraints and would take strong action against them if their conduct does not meet our standards. "We are currently working closely with Noms (National Offender Management Service) to develop specific techniques appropriate to confined spaces."	Private security guards employed to forcibly remove people from the UK have used racist language and inappropriate force, a report by MPs has said.
No demos on the streets of Athens - even though the Syriza government is poised to agree and implement yet more austerity and liberalisation measures, mandated by creditors and of the ilk that till recently it characterised as hateful. And Greece's resorts are teeming: Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year, up from 21 million; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels, Frankfurt and Washington (home of the IMF). Maybe holidaymakers were hoping to be on the ground for euro break-up history. Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State. But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â‚¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country. Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year. Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA ("there is no alternative"). What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity. Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend. Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me). There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people. So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead. Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half. So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.	I haven't been in Greece for three weeks but I am told it is eerily quiet and - in respect of tourism - surprisingly busy.
Five Give Up the Booze, Five Go Gluten Free, Five Go On A Strategy Away Day and Five Go Parenting will catch up with the sleuthing children as adults. The series, written by Bruno Vincent, follows on from the success of the recent Ladybird book spoofs for adults. The original 21 books featured Julian, George, Dick, Anne and their dog Timmy. Their escapades, set during the '40s and '50s, saw the children having virtually adult-free outdoor holidays where they solved mysteries while drinking lashings of ginger beer. Famous titles include Five on a Treasure Island and Five Go to Smuggler's Top. A film parody, Five Go Mad in Dorset, was also made by the Comic Strip team for Channel 4 and featured Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French and Adrian Edmondson. They went on to make another film called Five Go Mad on Mescalin. The books have also been made into films, TV series and cartoons, as well as audiobooks, comics and video games. Publisher Quercus said the five's grown-up adventures will "remind older readers of the unbreakable bond" between the children and "introduce newer readers to the spiffing time you can have with a few friends and a dog". It added the series brings characters - who are "posher than us and holidayed more than us" into our "baffling adult world". Their adult adventures will involve trying to give up alcohol, finding themselves on a puzzling "strategy away day", hunting for a good gluten-free cream tea and, "most perilous of all", preparing for parenthood. Anne McNeil of Enid Blyton Entertainment added they were "thrilled" with the new books, adding: "We are certain Enid Blyton would have delighted in the gentle parody of her characters - characters which have helped to create a multi-million-selling global brand." The books will be released in hardback on 3 November. The Famous Five series is among some of Blyton's most famous books, which also include Noddy and The Faraway Tree. In all, she produced more than 700 books, writing one a week at the peak of her powers. The British writer, who was born in 1897 and died in 1968, has sold more than 600 million books in total, which have been translated into 90 languages. In 2008, a survey by the Costa Book Awards saw Blyton voted the "most-loved author", beating Roald Dahl, JK Rowling and Jane Austen. Michael Joseph's Ladybird Books for Grown-Ups series, which includes the Mid-Life Crisis and The Hipster, has sold 1.74 million copies grossing Â£10m to date, according to The Bookseller.	A spoof series of four books called Enid Blyton for Grown-Ups, which reimagines the Famous Five as adults, is to be published.
Centre-left candidate Daniel Scioli led exit polls, and just edged centre-right Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri with most votes counted. Many had expected Mr Scioli to lead by a greater margin. The run-off on 22 November will be the first time an Argentine election will be decided by a second round. With 96% of the votes counted, Mr Scioli was marginally ahead with 36.7% of the vote, while Mr Macri had 34.5%. To win outright in the first round, a candidate needed 45% of the vote or a minimum of 40% as well as a 10-point lead over the nearest rival. "What happened today will change politics in this country," Mr Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, told supporters. Sergio Massa, a former ally turned rival of outgoing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, came a distant third with 21.3% of the vote and admitted defeat. Mr Massa has not said who will get his backing in the second round next month. With Mr Macri and Mr Scioli neck-and-neck, Mr Massa's support could prove crucial. Mr Scioli was handpicked as candidate by President Fernandez, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term. The governor of Buenos Aires province, he is a former world powerboating champion who lost his right arm in a race in 1989. Late on Sunday, he spoke before thousands of his supporters, saying: "United together we will triumph. I call upon the undecided and independent voters to join this cause." Last week, Mr Scioli pledged tax cuts for workers earning under a certain income, a move expected to affect half a million people. He has also vowed to bring down Argentina's inflation to single digits in less than four years and promises to introduce policy changes to invigorate the economy. Ms Fernandez, who stands down after eight years in power, says she leaves Argentines a better country. "We are voting today in a completely normal country," said Ms Fernandez said after casting her vote in the Patagonian town of Rio Gallegos. In previous decades, Argentines always went to the polls "in the middle of a serious crisis," she added. Ms Fernandez said achieving stability and leaving Argentines "a normal country" was the promise made by her late husband, Neston Kirchner, when he took office in 2003. He died in 2010, three years after handing over the presidency to his wife. Argentina elections: All to play for 14.5% Official, but disputed, inflation level 28.2% the inflation level in 2014, according to the World Bank 0.7% amount IMF predicts the economy will shrink in 2016 Whoever wins the presidency faces significant economic challenges. While the country gained strength after a financial crisis in 2002, its economy, the third-largest in Latin America, has slowed in recent years, with GDP growing by only 0.5% last year. The government is also locked in a battle against American hedge funds who disagree with how it wants to restructure $100bn (Â£65bn) of debt on which it defaulted in 2001. While the firms successfully sued Argentina for repayment, Ms Fernandez refused to pay.	Argentina will face a run-off election next month after neither presidential candidate gained enough votes to win the poll outright.
Sofia Legg's family was told there was a six-month waiting list for therapy despite an urgent GP referral for help. The inquest coroner in Taunton recorded a conclusion the 14-year-old had taken her own life by hanging. Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said it had apologised to the family and improvements had been made. The inquest heard Sofia, a student at Kings of Wessex Academy in Cheddar, had been suffering from low moods, was self-harming and was expressing thoughts about taking her own life. She was referred to the Child and Adolescent Mental Services (CAMHS) in March 2015, but did not meet the criteria for specialist support. In February 2016, her GP made an urgent referral to CAMHS, after Sofia confessed to having suicidal thoughts. But after being seen twice by CAMHS in July 2016, she was told there was a six-month waiting list for cognitive behaviour therapy. Her family found her body when they returned home on the evening of 20 September. On the day before she died, a CAMHS worker met Sofia and her mother, giving a crisis plan stating her mother Sandy Legg needed "to watch her and keep a close eye on her". But investigation reports stated Sofia had to be "supervised at all times". "If constant supervision was necessary then this should have been stated directly to me before I left with Sofia," her mother told the hearing. Speaking after the inquest she added: "As a family we will forever mourn the loss of our kind, bright, beautiful daughter. "Sofia was failed by the system and we, as a family, feel badly let down." Somerset coroner Tony Williams said he would be following up his concerns about the death with the trust.	Mental health services failed a teenage girl who had suicidal thoughts, her family has said following an inquest into her death.
Following the revelations of inappropriate relationships, the home affairs select committee has called for an urgent review of laws governing undercover policing. Here are the women's accounts of how they felt when it emerged that their relationships, which lasted from two to six years, were based on deception. These are not their real names. "I was absolutely shocked and devastated," she told MPs. Lisa had a six-year relationship with former PC Mark Kennedy, who posed as long-haired dropout Mark "Flash" Stone to infiltrate a group of environmental protesters. "You imagine that somebody may be in public meetings that environmental groups have. You imagine there might be somebody listening in there. You could even imagine that your phone might be tapped or that somebody might look at your emails. "But to know that there was somebody in your bed for six years, that somebody was involved in your family life to such a degree, that was an absolute shock. "Well, 'shock' is an understatement. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me and my sense of what was reality and what wasn't was completely turned on its head." During the hearing she was asked whether she had any sympathy for Mr Kennedy, who is suing the Metropolitan Police claiming he had been traumatised by what had happened. "As a human being it is very difficult not to have sympathy for somebody that I cared about deeply, but it is also important to remember that that person that I cared about deeply did not in fact exist," she replied. She adds that she still has questions about what happened. "Who was listening in to our most intimate phone calls? Who saw our holiday photos? Was there anybody following us when we were on holiday? "Who made the decisions about what happened to my life, where I was allowed to go, who I was allowed to see, which I thought was my free will but actually was being manipulated by this person who was being controlled by other people?" "We weren't married, clearly, but we shared the same flat. He was completely integrated into my life for five years and then one day he disappeared," she said. Alison had a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy, who she met through a group she was involved with in 1994. But he was in fact an undercover police officer. She told MPs the revelation had an "enormous impact" on her life. "The experience has left me with many, many unanswered questions, and one of those that comes back is: how much of the relationship was real?," she told MPs. "Some of the consequences of that have meant that I have, for the last 13 years, questioned my own judgment and it has impacted seriously on my ability to trust, and that has impacted on my current relationship and other subsequent relationships. Alison, a peaceful campaigner involved in left-wing political causes, believes she inadvertently provided him with "an excellent cover story", helping persuade other activists he was genuine. She said he became totally integrated into her family, appearing in her mother's wedding photograph, accompanying her on holidays and supporting her through the bereavement of a close friend. "This is not about just a lying boyfriend or a boyfriend who has cheated on you. It is not even about a boyfriend who is having another relationship with somebody else. It is about a fictional character who was created by the state and funded by taxpayers' money." "You do not know who you can trust any more. It destroys everything," she said. When the boyfriend Clare knew as John Barker disappeared two years into their relationship, she was determined to track him down. She found a death certificate for his name, and discovered he had been using the identity of a child who had died of leukaemia aged eight. She visited the child's house, but their parents no longer lived there. "He had told me that his parents were dead when we were in a relationship, so I wasn't expecting to see the parents, but I thought that if I went there... he had been a missing person for however long and I was desperate to find him. I was really concerned about his welfare," she explained. "Nothing made sense of what had happened, and so I went there desperate, thinking I have to follow every clue that I have, and I thought maybe some other members of the family may still live there or somebody might know where he was." She said people trying to justify the practice saying things like it prevented terrorism, was very distressing. "This is not about a need to do it. It is about a desire to do it. They have the power and they think they can get away with it. That is what it is about. "It is deeply distressing, and I do not think it should be allowed in any circumstances. It is so intrusive into people's lives, and, as my friends have said, it turns your life upside down. "Everything that you thought you knew suddenly becomes unreal; everything changes," she said.	The stories of women who were unknowingly involved in relationships with undercover police officers are revealed as their testimonies to MPs are made public.
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics while many clinics provide a good service, some give too little advice and support. It says some fail to make it clear that non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) can offer only an estimate of Down's risk and is not diagnostic. One private clinic said counselling was a vital part of the test. NIPT involves taking a blood sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood. This is how doctors can gauge the risk of possible genetic conditions affecting the baby, such as Down's. Doctors can also use NIPT to determine a baby's sex. This isn't something NHS England will be advocating when it rolls out the test to high-risk women next year, but it is already big business for some private clinics in the UK. Most private NIPT providers offer their tests to women through hospitals and healthcare clinics, although some clinics are located in retail chains on High Streets. NIPT is also available on some websites for women to order directly. The Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, says the information currently offered to women and couples accessing NIPT outside the NHS can sometimes be poor and incomplete. It says some providers are not telling women enough about the limits of the test. Advertising by clinics can fail to point out that NIPT can vary in its accuracy, and that it may give a reading that turns out to be false. This is important because women use the test result to decide whether to have more risky, invasive diagnostic tests that pose a chance of miscarriage. The report says there have been instances where the NHS was "left to pick up the pieces" after women had been told that they had a high chance of carrying a baby with a genetic disease based on their NIPT result but had not been given sufficient follow-up. One woman who used a private testing service told the Nuffield Council: "My results were delivered via a telephone call on a Friday teatime. I was then told if I needed to know more to phone back on Monday. In the meantime arrangements would be made to facilitate a termination." Dr Louise Bryant, who helped write the Nuffield Council report, said: "We are concerned that some women are not being supported well enough to make informed decisions." Judith Pilling, from the private provider This is my: Health Screening & Ultrasound Centres, said trained genetic counsellors should be accessible for patients when queries or concerns arise - something her company offers. Many groups have welcomed the Nuffield Council report, but some have criticised parts of its content, including a call for a ban on the use of NIPT for determining the sex of an unborn child. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said: "We should be absolutely clear that there is no peer-reviewed evidence of sex-selective abortion taking place in the UK. "Where any woman is under pressure to produce a male child, the ethical answer is not to deny every pregnant woman the right to find out information about her own pregnancy, but to do our utmost to ensure gender equality and access to comprehensive women's support services so that women can make their own choice about their pregnancy free from coercion."	Pregnant women are being urged to ask questions of private providers offering a new test for Down's syndrome.
I remember to this day the feeling of freezing rain blinding me and the extreme cold wind causing my ears to hurt. However, that did not bother me at this time. What was the occasion? Well, this was Hogmanay and the boys of the township were carrying out the traditional ritual of going from house to house on this special evening. What is the tradition behind it? It is widely thought that some of these island traditions came from the Vikings who were settlers in the Western Isles in particular, during past times. To be honest, that did not matter to me. I was out and about having fun. This traditional event, which happened in the Uists throughout the centuries, was also practised in many other places, but with differences in format depending on where you lived. On these nights it was the young males that went round the township with permission given to boys as young as five to go out with the big boys. The upper age limit was normally 17. My township was North Boisdale and I would say there were about 25 houses to visit and a few not so friendly dogs to dodge. The start time was 19:00 and all the boys would meet up at one end of the township and begin to visit each house. Each person had a pillow case or bag that would be filled with goodies received from householders. As you walked between each house the boys would shout in Gaelic "Hogmanay and New Year Hooray". This alerted the folk, especially on a clear calm night, that the Hogmanay boys were on their way. Outside each house one person would recite the Hogmanay poem and at the end of the poem ask the man of the house for permission to enter. Once inside the house a candle would be lit by the eldest boy in the group and then the candle would be passed round all family members starting with the householder. There was superstition involved with this as it was thought that when the candle was being circled above each individual's head, if the candle was to go out it meant that individual would have a year of bad luck. Of course jokers within the family would try and blow the candle out when this was taking place. Once every member of the family had been passed the candle, the mother of the house would bring out the gifts. Loafs of bread, sugar, fruit, biscuits and of course sweets. Sometimes folk would offer meat or fish. The man of the house would give money, as would older males in the family. Older men in the township would offer a dram to the senior boys, which would of course be refused. On leaving each house the oldest boy in the group would wish luck on the family for the coming year. After being to each house the pillowcases would be full and heavy and it was at the last house that the fun began. The pillowcases would be emptied and the goods shared out evenly. It did not matter how old you were - the boys all got their share. The hosting house would also provide a small party that would finish before midnight so all the boys were home before the bells. On the way home the blinding rain or freezing conditions did not bother me as I now had a pillowcase full of goodies, a full belly, and money in my pocket. A great start to the New Year. Dr Ragnhild Ljosland, a lecturer at Centre for Nordic Studies in Orkney, confirms the Hogmanay Boys tradition has connections to Norse culture. She says: "As a child in Norway in the 1980s, I remember dressing up to gÃ¥ julebukk (go Yule-goating). "Julebukk involves putting on a mask and going to people's doors to chase Christmas out around New Year. You sing and carry a sack to collect cakes and sweeties - ah, the joy of ending up with a huge sack of goodies. "If we go a couple of hundred years further back in time, Norwegian people used to walk in a group around the farms in the parish, dressed up so that nobody would recognise them. "These costumes could be rather frightening and represent fantastical animals, such as an effigy of a billygoat's head on a stick. The guisers would be offered food and drink at each farm. "These customs are extremely old, going back to pre-Christian beliefs. "Folk belief had it that supernatural beings were extra active at this time of year. "Interestingly, similar traditions are also found in Iceland, the Faroes, Shetland and Orkney. In Shetland today, for example, guisers travel around and are offered food and drink at Up Helly Aa in January."	With Hogmanay looming, DJ MacIntyre, Gaelic officer at the University of the Highlands and Islands, highlights a tradition once popular on South Uist in the Western Isles and with a connection to Norse culture - Hogmanay Boys.
Simon Dredge suffered life-threatening injuries in the crash on Wednesday. He was travelling in the boat along with three other professional crew including his father Peter, a champion powerboat racer. Powerboat company, Vector World said the boat was on its first test run when it overturned just after 08:20 BST. A spokeswoman said: "We are encouraged to hear that Simon is stable and improving." Peter Dredge, Simon Wood-Power, a powerboat racer and Lee Hurst, a powerboat engineer were all taken to Southampton General Hospital with non life-threatening injuries. They have since been discharged. Eyewitnesses described seeing the high-powered vessel come out of the water "like a rocket" before flipping over. In a statement following the crash, Hampshire Constabulary said it appeared the powerboat "lost control" just before it collided with the Hamble Point cardinal mark. The large metal buoy marks the entrance to the Hamble River. A joint investigation into the crash is being carried out by Hampshire Police Marine Unit and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.	A teenager is "stable and improving" in hospital after the prototype powerboat he was training in crashed and overturned in the Solent.
It emerged that the wife of former Ulster Unionist MLA Neil Somerville has a wood pellet boiler under the scheme in a family business. The boiler is used to power a horse solarium. "My wife runs the business which also includes the grooming and clipping of horses, but due to the type of work she does, it wasn't possible to carry it out all year round," Mr Somerville explained. "The installation of the wood pellet boiler has meant that my wife is now able to carry out her work on a year-round basis and a horse solarium has been installed. We are happy for an inspection to take place." But perhaps the question many people asked - as images of goggle-wearing dobbins tanning themselves leapt into their minds - is just what exactly is a horse solarium? David Kirkpatrick, of the Equine Council for Northern Ireland, who has one, said they are the "same as what a physio would use for the human populace". While the solariums can differ, Mr Kirkpatrick's consists of three rows of 500 watt bulbs which the horse stands under. "I would use the solarium for my own horses after work. The whole purpose of it is that the heat gets into the muscles," he said. "You put your horse in for probably half an hour a day maximum, or maybe half an hour twice a day, it's not a continual process, at least I've never heard of anyone using it on a continual basis. "You can also use weaker solariums in stud farms to falsify the length of the day - you're encouraging your mare to come into season, to think it's spring." He added: "They are becoming more and more common equestrian wise. Ten years ago they were unheard of. But it is something that is becoming more and more common and more equestrian people are starting to use them." The horses seem unfazed and no goggles are required. "My fella just stands and eats hay, he just goes to sleep underneath it," Mr Kirkpatrick said. "The only welfare issue is to make sure that if he throws his head up, he doesn't smash a bulb." Fiona Parker, who works for a West Midlands-based company which sells horse solariums to both Northern Ireland and the Republic, said they have two main uses. "Number one, if you wash a horse, it can dry them and it keeps them nice and warm," she said. "The other thing that people use them for, is that when you ride a horse you have to spend so much time warming it up - like you would, you wouldn't go straight out there and sprint you would do a few warm-up exercises to loosen up the muscles. "So if you've got a competition yard and you've got a lot of horses to ride, what a lot of people do is put them under the solarium and it just warms their muscles slightly. "It's just a preventative thing to prevent injury." So as the RHI scandal continues to burn, if someone asks you what's the most surprising use for one of the scheme's boilers, you can reply "there's neigh contest".	While the the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme has lurched from controversy to controversy, one of the more unusual uses for an RHI wood pellet boiler came to light on Monday.
Williams driver Felipe Massa suffered two left-rear wheel failures and Renault's Kevin Magnussen a suspected broken left rear suspension. The session was stopped for 30 minutes as officials launched an investigation and cleared the track of debris. Williams had a wheel problem. Renault's turned out to be a suspension failure. Williams driver Valtteri Bottas said the team had found a problem with the "rim clearance" - the distance between the wheel and the wheel assembly - and that he had had the same problem as Massa but had been "more lucky". "If there is something under the rim too close, that can cause problems," the Finn said. Both Massa's failures happened on his first lap out of the pits on the entry to the Turn Six hairpin. On the first, Massa was pitched into a spin. On the second, he did not lose control, but the tyre appeared to simply pop off the rim. There were no clear television pictures of the failure on Magnussen's car. Williams did not send either of its cars out again when the session was re-started with eight minutes remaining. Magnussen, who had broken rear suspension, was also consigned to the pits. In a busy final few minutes of running, Rosberg supplanted early pace-setter Hamilton at the top of the times with a lap of one minute 38.037 seconds. The world champion was 0.146secs behind in the second Mercedes. Rosberg returned to the pits at the end of the session in "limp-home mode", his engineer telling him over the radio that he thought there was "an engine issue". Mercedes later diagnosed it as an ignition problem and said they hoped it would be solved for second practice. Hamilton already knows that he has a five-place grid drop from wherever he qualifies because of a gearbox change after the team discovered a potential problem and decided not to risk a retirement. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third quickest, 0.628secs off the pace and 0.396secs quicker than Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in fourth. Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fifth, ahead of Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat, Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz and the McLaren of Jenson Button. Fernando Alonso returned to the McLaren after being forced to miss the last race in Bahrain because of a broken rib sustained in his high-speed crash at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The Spaniard faces further medical checks after the first session to establish whether he will be allowed to continue for the rest of the weekend but he made no public reports of any physical discomfort. Alonso was 12th fastest, 0.564secs slower than Button. Chinese Grand Prix first practice results Chinese Grand Prix coverage details	Nico Rosberg headed Lewis Hamilton as first practice at the Chinese Grand Prix was disrupted by three failures on two separate cars.
Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak was handed over to a delegation of tribal leaders. He was meant to be released last week as part of a deal agreed with President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to end a violent stand-off in the capital, Sanaa. Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a "manoeuvre". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. "We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership," he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. "Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling." A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed. They seized Mr Bin Mubarak on 17 January to stop him attending a meeting to discuss the draft, saying they had become aware of "irregularities" in the text.	Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen have freed a senior presidential aide who they abducted 10 days ago.
But many people will be asking this weekend if the 28-year-old is really worth all that money? To answer that you need to separate his value to United right now from how some might view his broader value in the transfer market. For all the income they generate, United are a club going through a difficult transition. They are way off the pace in the Premier League and struggling to qualify for the Champions League next season. The financial impact of failure this season will not dent the money making machine that is Old Trafford, but long term decline? That's a very different proposition. All of this has placed huge pressure on the club's new manager David Moyes and executive vice chairman Ed Woodward to show the club is still a force to be reckoned with despite the retirement of the formidable Sir Alex Ferguson. The record signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea in the January transfer window was the first part of what Woodward and Moyes hope will be a three-step strategy back to the top. Rooney's new deal is part two while the summer is phase three. That's when we will really be able to judge how serious the club's American owners, the Glazer family, are about rebuilding United's under-powered squad. Mata's arrival and Rooney's decision to stay - having been courted first by Manchester City and more recently Chelsea - will surely help the club attract top talent before the start of next season. The other thing to consider is that Rooney had just 18 months remaining on his previous deal. United knew they faced the possibility of him leaving for nothing. By signing him up for five and-a-half years, they have protected the value of arguably their most valuable and recognisable playing asset. So while the £85m agreement up to 2019 looks exorbitant, it's probably cheaper than United having to find a replacement in the transfer market and pay his wages. The total cost would have probably been much higher. It leaves United free to spend their money elsewhere - with midfield and defence arguably a greater priority. The deal Rooney has signed is, I am told, worth around £250,000 a week in basic salary. What makes the new contract potentially much more lucrative to the England striker is an agreement with the club to market and exploit his individual commercial rights around the world. This obviously has benefits for both the club and the player but there is no doubting United's hugely successful commercial operation could help take Rooney to a new financial level and certainly on a par with Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. In playing terms it would be hard to argue Rooney is in the same league as those two. But as things stand he is United's most marketable brand and that is ultimately why the club couldn't afford to let him go.	With projected revenues of £420m this year, there is no question Manchester United can afford to make Wayne Rooney the best paid player in the Premier League.
Born at Alltnacaillich, Strathmore in 1714, Rob Donn could not read or write and dictated his poetry from memory in later life. A wall hanging depicting scenes from his life and work is to be created in a project led by Strathnaver Museum and Mackay Country Community Trust. People living in and around Strathnaver are to be invited to help make the piece of craftwork. Donn's poetry continues to be celebrated and studied today. Some of his work has turned into music and performed at Glasgow's Celtic Connections Festival. Strathnaver Museum has been awarded Â£5,400 from the Heritage Lottery Fund's Stories, Stones and Bones programme towards the project.	A Gaelic bard is to be remembered in needlework.
The Ayrton Light, located above the Great Bell - known as Big Ben - needs to be fully dismantled and restored. A temporary light will replace it. Installed in 1885, it was previously turned off only during both world wars. Big Ben will not chime regularly until 2021 because of repairs to the tower. The light is said to have been installed at the request of Queen Victoria, so that she could see from Buckingham Palace when members of either the Commons or the Lords were sitting after dark. It is named after Acton Smee Ayrton, a Liberal politician who was First Commissioner of Works between 1869 and 1873. It is not yet known when the light will switch off, or how long it will be off for. Big Ben will not be heard from midday on Monday. The House of Commons has said it will look again at the length of time it will be silenced after "concerns". Parliament said it had to protect workers carrying out the renovations. But Prime Minister Theresa May said "it can't be right" that the bell will not chime regularly again for four years. It will still sound for important events including New Year's Eve and Remembrance Sunday.	A lamp at the top of Elizabeth Tower - which is switched on in the evening whenever Parliament is sitting - is to stop shining for the first time in more than 70 years.
John Stevenson Wright was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court to 18 months for sexually abusing Darren Kenny. The court heard the offences took place when Wright worked at a pub run by Mr Kenny's parents in Rochdale. Wright, 68, abused Mr Kenny as a teenager when he used to sleep over at the pub. He was convicted of gross indecency, indecent assault and inciting a child under 16 to engage in a sexual act between 1978 and 1981. Wright's sentence will be added to the 22 years he is already serving for sexually abusing boys. Mr Kenny, 50, an officer with Greater Manchester Police in Tameside, was repeatedly abused as a teenager and thought Wright was dead until he typed his name into an internet search engine. While looking for his abuser's obituary, he was "horrified" to learn Wright had been jailed for child sexual abuse in Rochdale. He added: "We had been told he had died - I had my closure and then when we found out he wasn't dead I had no closure any more and I needed it back." Mr Kenny, who has waived his right to anonymity, contacted the officer who had investigated Wright and said: "I've got another victim - me. "Even if wasn't a policeman I would have come forward. "The length of sentence isn't important... returning the guilty verdict is what is important." Mr Kenny encouraged other abuse victims to speak out. "Look at me - I'm here, I'm a 50-year-old cop, and if I can do it I'm sure they can."	A police officer who thought his childhood abuser had died before he chanced across him online has said the man's conviction brought him "closure".
It began on Friday when Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of the southern Russian republic, labelled opponents of President Vladimir Putin "enemies of the people" and called for such "traitors" to be prosecuted for subversion, claiming they were working in league with the West. Mr Kadyrov has now re-asserted his claims and gone even further in an online editorial for pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia. Referring to a "half-witted rabble", he offered opposition activists the services of a Chechen psychiatric hospital to treat their "mass psychosis". "I promise we won't spare the injections. We can do double," he wrote. A boxer-turned-insurgent and now a self-styled "foot soldier" of President Putin, the man known simply as Ramzan is not someone many in Russia dare criticise openly. Human rights groups have long accused him of presiding over widespread abuses in the Russian republic, and the key suspect in last year's shock shooting of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov beside the Kremlin walls had been deputy commander of one of his elite battalions. He was referred to by Ramzan as a "true patriot". This time, the Chechen leader's comments appear to have touched a nerve. The most dramatic response came from a little-known independent politician in Siberia, who raged against Ramzan on his Facebook page as the "shame of Russia". "Why don't you get lost?" Konstantin Senchenko told him, and let "normal, honest people" work for the good of the country. But the Siberian was soon eating his "hasty" words. The next day, he apologised profusely on Facebook for his "discourtesy", apparently after multiple calls from Chechnya. Cartoons of his sudden change of heart soon spread on social media, depicting him begging forgiveness with a gun to his head. In an ultimate humiliation, the shamefaced politician was seen in a video clip apologising personally to Ramzan for his "emotional outburst". Activists on Twitter then took up the Siberian's insult with the hashtag #KadyrovshameofRussia. Well-known opposition journalists followed that by filming themselves making fake, grovelling apologies to Ramzan "for existing". One was filmed running on a treadmill with no trousers, just as a young Chechen man was forced to do recently after criticising Ramzan Kadyrov on Instagram. Meanwhile, a group of prominent Russian liberals has begun gathering signatures demanding his resignation, and a St Petersburg politician has called on prosecutors to examine his statements for extremism. But the backlash has only increased the tirade from Chechnya, where local politicians have been falling over themselves to express devotion to their leader. None has outdone the speaker of parliament, Magomed Daudov, who posted a photograph of his boss holding back his huge, fierce dog on a leash and warned that Tarzan's teeth were "itching" - naming four well-known opposition figures whom the hound would presumably love to sink them into. "Tarzan has become very frisky. We can barely restrain him," wrote the speaker in an Instagram post that attracted over 6,000 likes. "Just imagine what would happenâ€¦ If it weren't forâ€¦ Democracy." There is some talk that this is all a show of strength by the Chechen leader: a reminder of the considerable forces at his disposal amid talk of a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow. But the Kremlin has remained tight-lipped throughout, prompting others to conclude that it more likely endorses Ramzan's actions. Parliamentary elections are due later this year and, with an economy battered by falling oil prices, there's concern that opposition groups could capitalise on potential social unrest. "It's a message to all of those who don't agree with what's happening," argues former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now an opposition activist in exile and himself one of the obvious targets of Ramzan Kadyrov's ire. "The authorities are afraid and they decided to frighten society," wrote Mr Khodorkovsky on his blog. Another commentator has suggested that the Chechen leader simply wants to underline his loyalty to Moscow ahead of a wave of forced budget cuts and to ensure that the generous flow of federal subsidies to Chechnya does not stop. Whatever the motive, the practice of singling out traitors is seen as particularly dangerous in the wake of Boris Nemtsov's murder. A year ago, Putin loyalists were still beating the drum of patriotism following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine; state TV was lashing out viciously at Kremlin critics; warnings that Ukraine-style revolutions would not be tolerated were rife. Ramzan Kadyrov's latest outburst has resurrected the idea of an enemy within and the search for a scapegoat. "The situation is very tense now," Mr Senchenko, explained by phone from Krasnoyarsk, pointing to Russia's mounting economic problems. That concern is what motivated his own Facebook rage against Chechnya's leader. "Some people really think there are enemies of the state and it's not clear what can enter their heads," he warned.  "So we need to be careful."	Traitors, jackals and vile liberals are just a few of the choice descriptions of Russia's opposition emerging from Chechnya in recent days, in a war of words that threatens to escalate.
Wasps goalkeeper Neil Parry had already denied Dobbie three times before the striker curled in a drive off a post. Parry saved again from Dobbie after the break, but the 33-year-old would not be denied his fifth goal in three Challenge Cup outings and 12th goal of the season for the Championship side. His close-range header killed off the lively League One visitors' hopes. And it ended a run of eight games without a victory for the Dumfries side - a sequence that had ended with Gavin Skelton standing down as manager earlier this week. The side under caretaker Jim Thomson, who had been football development manager, for the first time became the second into the last four. Dundee United had earlier beaten Dunfermline Athletic 1-0 at East End Park. League One leaders Livingston host Welsh champions The New Saints, while Ayr United visit Championship rivals St Mirren, in two Sunday quarter-finals. A Grant Anderson header had grazed the Alloa crossbar before Dobbie made the breakthrough at Palmerston Park. The Wasps had their moments, with Jamie Longworth being denied by goalkeeper Lee Robinson and Greig Spence going close with an overhead kick with Jim Goodwin's part-time side only one goal behind and looking the more likely to score. However, after Parry prevented Derek Lyle extending the lead, Dobbie provided the finish from Dean Brotherston's cross 14 minutes from time. Queen of the South caretaker manager Jim Thomson: "It was a shock to myself. On the Monday, Gavin just decides to resign. I think it was a combination of things. "It has been a terrible run and hopefully that brings a bit of confidence to the squad. "It has been a hard week for everybody, but the way the boys trained during the week, the tempo they took into the game. "I thought in the first half we were excellent. Some of their play was brilliant. "It is a break from the league for the boys and it's a national cup semi-final so you always want to progress." Alloa Athletic manager Jim Goodwin: "We came here to be positive and to take the game to Queen of the South. I thought we done that for large spells of the game. "They're very lucky to have Stephen Dobie, who's a top player. "He's the type of player who could easily be playing in the Premiership. "I'm proud of the players. We didn't just come down here and look to hang on. Overall, there's a lot to be positive about."	Stephen Dobbie's double took Queen of the South into the Challenge Cup semi-finals at Alloa Athletic's expense.
The men from the 1st Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment sat on the floor when ordered to stand to attention. The protest by 16 soldiers was sparked by grievances with their captain and colour sergeant.  It took place in February while on exercise in Kenya. Fifteen were sentenced to detention, one of whom was dismissed from the Army. A 16th was also dismissed. All the soldiers pleaded guilty to disobeying a lawful command - an offence that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. The soldiers complained of being "led by muppets", the court martial heard. The prosecutor at the court martial said members of the platoon had been seething at the way they were being managed, and felt that they were "not appreciated". The court heard a captain and sergeant apparently got drunk before a lengthy training march in the Brecon Beacons last winter. The troops were said to have been furious at finding their two commanders asleep, rather than greeting the soldiers as they crossed the finish line. Tensions came to a head at the end of a training exercise in Kenya in February, when 16 soldiers decided to protest. Ahead of a parade, a ringleader shouted "sit down" and members of the platoon did so. The commanders ordered each man in turn to stand up, but were ignored. Corporal Anthony Brown, said to be the ringleader, was stripped of his rank, dismissed from the Army and sentenced to 60 days' detention. Two lance corporals were reduced to privates and sentenced to 60 days' detention, while a third was reduced to private and dismissed without detention. Twelve privates were sentenced to 40 days' detention. The soldiers were in the 1st Battalion at the time of the protest. However, the 1st has now become the 2nd, following Army restructuring. John Wilson, a retired colonel and former editor of the British Army Review who lectures in military history, described the nature of the soldiers' protest as "unprecedented". The sentences given to the troops at the court martial were "strong enough to make the point", added Col Wilson. "I don't think a corporal, whatever his grievances, can expect to orchestrate such a public protest in front of the entire battle group parade and get away with it." An Army spokesman said it was "not appropriate" to comment on the sentencing.	Fifteen soldiers have been jailed after a court martial for staging a "sit-in" in protest at being "led by muppets".
Security consultant Paul Moore examined the publicly available information of the UK's six biggest ISPs. He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers. But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues. The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed. More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen. Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes. "There have been a couple of incidents where I had to contact ISPs to report things that were serious," he told the BBC. The audit found a variety of problems, including passwords stored in plain text, exposed code that would allow hackers to inject their own code on to ISPs' websites and, potentially load malware on to them, and issues with encryption certificates that meant Mr Moore could apply for them from the certificate authority and pose as the webmaster for a set of ISP-owned websites. Mr Moore said he was impressed by most of the ISPs's responses when he raised the issues with them. "Ordinarily they would not be so open and honest with me but, after what happened at TalkTalk, they have been stepping in quickly," said Mr Moore. "On one occasion I notified BT and PlusNet about a bug at 14:00 and they kept people back until 22:00 to fix it." But, he added, TalkTalk was yet to contact him. TalkTalk did supply a statement to the BBC saying it had "integrated Paul Moore's comments into an ongoing programme of work". "We constantly run vulnerability checks using industry-standard third party tools. The vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not picked up by this testing, and if it had been, we would clearly have acted on that information straightaway to secure our system," it added. Sky told the BBC: "We take our customers' security very seriously. We constantly review our systems and we have robust, independently assessed protocols in place to make sure customer information is as secure as possible." Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at Surrey University, said he was shocked by the findings. "TalkTalk still has problems and others have not dissimilar ones," he said. "I find it very surprising that after the TalkTalk hack, they [the six ISPs] still appear not to be attending to the basics. He added: "ISPs are the single biggest handlers of our personal data and I would expect them to get this right."	The security of the UK's biggest internet service providers needs "major improvement", according to one expert.
The former army officer promised to be "even more dangerous than when I was in uniform". He also vowed to turn his tiny West African nation into an "economic superpower" over the next five years. President Jammeh first seized power in 1994 but was re-elected in December in a widely criticised poll. "You cannot be in your offices every day doing nothing... and at the end of the day you expect to be paid," he said on a televised address on Wednesday. "This has to stop. You either do your work or leave or go to jail," the president said. "I will wipe out almost 82% of those in the workforce in the next five years starting this Friday unless they change their attitudes," he said - without elaborating. Mr Jammeh also promised "zero tolerance" on corruption and drugs. The Gambia - a popular destination for foreign tourists - has recently become a key transit point for cocaine trafficked from Latin America. The president also promised to focus more on the empowerment of women and create more jobs for the youth. Mr Jammeh - who first came to power in a bloodless coup in 1994 - has been criticised by international rights groups for suppressing any dissent. On Tuesday, former Information Minister Amadou Scatred Janneh, a US citizen, was sentenced to life in jail for plotting a coup and distributing T-shirts with the slogan "End to Dictatorship Now".	Yahya Jammeh has been sworn in for a fourth term as Gambia's president and promised to "wipe out 82%" of workers, accusing them of being lazy.
Chasing 273, England collapsed from 100-0 to 164 all out, with Mehedi Hasan taking 6-77 and Shakib Al Hasan 4-49. They earlier dismissed the hosts for 296 after dropping four catches. Bangladesh had only beaten Zimbabwe and a weakened West Indies team in 95 previous Tests, but the 108-run win means the series finished 1-1. England needed their highest successful run chase in Asia and looked well set after a century opening partnership between Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett. But they lost all 10 wickets in 22.5 overs in the final session as Bangladesh secured the biggest win in their history. Bangladesh had lost 72 of their previous Tests and last played in August 2015 because of security concerns in the country. Duckett (56) scored his first Test half-century but was bowled by 19-year-old off-spinner Mehedi with the first ball after tea, prompting the stunning collapse - the third worst in history by a team who had been 100 without loss. Joe Root was lbw in the following over to Shakib, before Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were dismissed in the same Mehedi over shortly afterwards. Cook made 59 but, despite successfully overturning one dismissal, the England captain was caught off Mehedi by Mominul Haque at silly point. Shakib then dismissed Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Zafar Ansari in quick succession. Fittingly, Mehedi took the final wicket of Steven Finn to finish with six in the innings, 12 in the match and 19 in the series. Openers Cook and Duckett, who batted together for the first time in the first Test in Chittagong, had only managed a best partnership of 26 in their previous three innings. Duckett, 22, impressed with an aggressive 56, hitting seven fours and a six, and played a number of reverse sweeps and pull shots. Bangladesh bowled all four spinners in the session leading up to tea but they took no wickets in helpful conditions. Cook had scored four, 12 and 14 in the series but also batted fluently in a period that seemed to swing the game in England's favour. England will rue their failure to take early wickets as Bangladesh added 116 runs in the morning session and Cook's side dropped four catches. Imrul Kayes scored 78 but was dropped at leg slip by Cook off Ansari, and then by Root off Moeen in the first 10 overs of the day. Both were difficult catches but Duckett dropped a simple chance at deep mid-wicket later in the session with Shakib the batsman to benefit. Finn also put down a difficult diving chance, while England chose not to review the umpire's decision on two occasions when replays showed the batsman would have been given out had they done so. Kayes' innings and 41 from Shakib helped Bangladesh to 268-7 at lunch, but Stokes (3-52) and Rashid (4-52) helped England knock over the tail in 26 balls after lunch. Media playback is not supported on this device Former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special That was extraordinary. I don't think I've seen a series where it's been impossible to know who's winning. At tea time we were praising Duckett and Cook, but less than two hours later the match was over. I've not seen the mood change between sessions like that before. Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent I feel emotional for Bangladesh. There were all these issues about security and there were doubts about the series taking place. The people here were all so happy that England came. This is unbelievable. Former Bangladesh all-rounder Athar Ali Khan That was a very special win for Bangladesh. I think 160 million people in Bangladesh will have been glued to the TVs, radios and phones. I feel privileged to be here to have seen it.	Bangladesh claimed their first Test win over England as the tourists lost 10 wickets for 64 runs after tea on day three of the second Test in Dhaka.
Convicted murderer Sweat, 35, was shot twice and captured less than two miles (3km) from the Canadian border. His prison-break partner Richard Matt, 49, was killed by police on Friday. The two murderers escaped three weeks ago from the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora through the sewer system after using power tools to break out of their cell. The spectacular escape set off a massive manhunt. Sweat was shot and seized in the town of Constable on Sunday, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference. He said Sweat was shot twice in the torso and was now in hospital in stable condition. The convict was spotted by a police officer on patrol and shot when he tried to run away. "The nightmare is finally over," the governor said. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote on its Twitter page: "#DavidSweat of the #PrisonBreakNY captured. Sleep peacefully New York." The Buffalo News website earlier quoted a source who said that the convict's wound were "life-threatening" and he was bleeding badly. Matt was shot dead near the town of Malone. The pair had been making their way through rugged forests in upstate New York, stealing food and guns from woodland cabins along the way. US officials have charged prison worker Joyce Mitchell with aiding the two inmates in their escape. Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through. Ms Mitchell denies the charges. Clinton correction officer Gene Palmer is also accused of aiding the convicts. Officials allege that he gave Sweat and Matt the frozen hamburger meat Ms Mitchell had used to hide hacksaw blades and a screwdriver. Mr Palmer's attorney said his client had no knowledge that the meat contained the escape tools. Matt was serving a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss. Sweat was serving a life sentence for murdering a sheriff's deputy. Manhunt timeline	Second New York State prison escapee David Sweat is in custody after being shot by police, US officials report.
"I'm a progressive who gets results and I will be a progressive president who gets results," she said. The two Democratic contenders took questions from an audience in New Hampshire, which will pick its presidential nominees in a few days. Iowa kicked off the state-by-state election earlier this week. The former secretary of state, Mrs Clinton, was declared the winner in Iowa by a whisker after a prolonged count. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator with a big lead in New Hampshire polls, listed issues upon which he thinks Mrs Clinton was not liberal enough - trade agreements, Wall Street regulation, climate change and her backing for the war in Iraq. "I do not know any progressive who has a super PAC and takes $15m from Wall Street," said Mr Sanders. Mrs Clinton, who followed him on to the stage in Manchester, said she was not bothered by his accusation but it was not helpful because they shared the same aspirations. Under the senator's definition, President Barack Obama would not be a progressive, she said. The former first lady was also on the defensive for her speaking fees paid by big businesses, which amount to $9m, according to the Associated Press news agency. When asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper why she was paid $675,000 for one event, she said: "I don't know. That is what they offered." The tone is definitely rising between the two Democratic opponents. All day, by e-mail, on Twitter, they sparred about who is the real progressive. On Tuesday, Mr Sanders had said that his opponent was a progressive ''on some days''. Mrs Clinton called it a low blow. And they went at it again in the evening, during the town hall. This isn't just about semantics: it's about who has the ability not only to build on President Obama's legacy, but to take it much further and, by doing so, inspire voters frustrated by the slow pace of change. Mr Sanders is promising a revolution and dismissing those who say that's pie in the sky. Change always happens bottom up, he said, during the town hall. Mrs Clinton, who comes across mostly as a pragmatic doer, hasn't yet managed to capture the imagination of young voters and she admitted she had work to do on that front. This was a format that brought out the best in both candidates - they took turns on stage, and interacted with voters who asked very considered questions. The candidates gave thoughtful answers. This was probably one of Mr Sanders' best performances so far - he did less shouting and arm-waving than usual. Prodded by questions about faith and humility, Mrs Clinton opened up in a way she usually reserves for small settings, not national television, but which always works well with voters. Earlier on Wednesday, in response to the same accusation about not being a progressive, Mrs Clinton listed her accomplishments in helping minorities and the disadvantaged. She mentioned her efforts in expanding access to children's health insurance and her push to support women's rights and gay rights. The tensions between the two come as they prepare to debate each other on stage together on Thursday night, five days before the New Hampshire primary vote. Both Republican and Democratic parties will formally name their presidential candidates at conventions in July. Americans will finally go to the polls to choose the new occupant of the White House in November.	Hillary Clinton has defended her progressive record after Democratic rival Bernie Sanders mounted an attack on her links to Wall Street.
Media playback is not supported on this device Pakistan were bowled out for 234 after Alastair Cook (76 not out) and Joe Root (71 not out) helped England declare on 173-1 to set a target of 565. James Anderson and Chris Woakes took 3-41 and Moeen Ali 3-88 as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 89 runs to lose on the fourth day. Victory was England's second-biggest against Pakistan in terms of runs. However, all-rounder Ben Stokes will have a scan on Tuesday after injuring a calf while bowling in the afternoon session. Pakistan's highest stand was the 58 Mohammad Hafeez and Younus Khan put on for the third wicket, but both fell to Moeen in the space of six overs. Mohammad Amir was last man out, removed by Woakes for 29. The third Test at Edgbaston begins on 3 August. England, who opted against enforcing the follow-on on Sunday, added 75 runs in nine overs in the morning after resuming on 98-1. Root hit 10 fours in his 48-ball 71 to go with his first-innings 254, while Cook - 49 overnight - brought up his fastest Test half-century, off 55 deliveries. Anderson, on his home ground, made early inroads as he had Shan Masood caught in the slips for the second time in the match before trapping Azhar Ali lbw, but Hafeez and Younus resisted for 15.1 overs. With Stokes, who was injured during his follow-through, off the field, Moeen struck twice. He had Hafeez caught at short leg for 42 and Younus at long-on for 28. Woakes then bowled Misbah-ul-Haq for 35, the skipper having put on 43 with Asad Shafiq. After Sarfraz Ahmed became Woakes' second victim, Anderson and Moeen completed their three-wicket hauls by trapping Shafiq and Yasir Shah lbw respectively. Part-time spinner Root then took a wicket with just his second ball, having Wahab Riaz caught at short fine leg. Amir struck five fours in his 43-ball resistance, but Woakes finished things off by having him caught at mid-off when trying to drive. Man of the match Joe Root on Test Match Special: "It's a great feeling. It's about contributing to wins. It's the most controlled I've played. "The bowlers grafted really hard today and last night. It was a really good effort from all of the team. It sets it up nicely for the series." England captain Alastair Cook: "I was surprised the decision not to follow-on caused such a stir. To me it was a bit of a no-brainer. I think everyone else wanted a day off." Former England captain Michael Vaughan: "It's an absolute hammering. It's been very similar to the Sri Lanka series, where England dominated with this kind of performance." Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq: "We have to improve in every department. We could not build pressure and let them score a massive total in the first innings. "If we had restricted them to 350, we had a chance. But it was difficult to come back from 600."	England thrashed Pakistan by 330 runs in the second Test at Old Trafford to level the four-match series at 1-1.
For 70 years, my father has lived with the shame of what happened to his ship, HMS Hebe, in June 1940. During the evacuation of Dunkirk, he was the chief engine room artificer on board the Hebe, a minesweeper deployed to Dover as a control vessel. The Hebe crossed the Channel to Dunkirk three times during those chaotic days between 27 May and 4 June. "It was torrid, dangerous and nerve-wracking with all-day long German air attacks", says Harold Biles who marked his 28th birthday during the height of the bombardment. "The Hebe was lying about 200 metres off the beach at Dunkirk, and there was just a seething mass of soldiers. All we knew was that we were on the water, they were on the beach and were trying to get to us. "There was constant bombing and shellfire.  We just used to wait for nightfall when there was a relaxation, and we could perhaps get some sleep." In the early hours of 29 May 1940, the captain of HMS Hebe sent a gig ashore to the beach at Dunkirk. It was to collect Lord John Gort, the commander-in- chief of the British Expeditionary Force and take him to England. "As we sped back to Dover, I remember seeing Lord Gort standing in the waist of the ship, holding the guardrail to offset the rise and swell of the waves. He was resplendent in his red-trimmed uniform, but he was motionless, with his head sunk to his chest". "It was not for him to receive any acclaim for the evacuation of some 330,000 men and saving them from Nazi POW camps. In his eyes, there was only defeat. He had lost an army." The German bombardment, the trauma and the fatigue were taking a toll on the crew of HMS Hebe, and no doubt other ships involved in the evacuation. My father describes how on the morning of 1 June, he witnessed the first signs of what we now know to be post-traumatic stress, but in those days was sometimes referred to as a "lack of moral fibre". "We were embarking more stores and ammunition back in Dover. An RAF plane flying low overhead was the starting point. A seaman looked up, screamed and fell into convulsions with hysteria. It was contagious and he was joined by three or four others. "Later in the day an order was issued, amazing and ill judged. Anybody feeling the stress of the last week was told to leave the ship and assemble on the dockside in preparation for going to hospital. "About 20 men left the ship and I can still see their grins as they trooped over the gangway. The majority were malingerers but in fairness, the prospect of that final trip was frightening as the Germans were almost on the French beaches." The captain of the Hebe sent for Harold Biles as the Chief Engineer, and the Coxswain. "We both had to tell him that the ship was so depleted of crew that a further sailing was impossible. And so we remained alongside while other craft made the trip, some never to return." To my father's dismay, HMS Hebe played no further part in Operation Dynamo. "This was the greatest blow which sometimes I feel to this day," he says, on the eve of his 98th birthday.	BBC world affairs correspondent Peter Biles has been talking to his father, Harold, about his recollections of the Dunkirk evacuation.
Soon he won't need a book to learn more about this tiny British overseas territory in the Mediterranean, just south of Spain. Following the lead of the UK town of Monmouth, Gibraltar is aiming to spill the content of the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia into the real world. To do this, it is equipping Gibraltar's tourist attractions with QR codes - "quick response" barcodes that can be scanned with a mobile phone. These black-and-white pixelated images have been around for more than two decades but have started to gain mainstream acceptance only in the past few years, appearing on everything from walls and billboards to newspapers and detergent packs. As well as other technologies such as near-field communication tags (NFC) and augmented reality (AR) apps, they give mobile phone users information about a particular object. QR codes store text, phone numbers, email addresses and calendar events, and once scanned, create links to websites or generate some interactive content on your smartphone's screen. Tourism is a big part of Gibraltar's economy, with more than 11 million visitors spending Â£280m last year, and the authorities are keen to seize any opportunity to increase revenue. The QR codes take users directly to a Wikipedia page of the relevant tourist attraction, says Clive Finlayson of the Gibraltar Museum. "Gibraltar is a multi-layered cake of historical events, starting with the Neanderthals of 50,000 years ago through to modern humans," he says. What are QR codes' chances? QR codes have been around for years, but only 11% of UK smartphone users scanned one in July 2012, according to data agency Comscore. Some analysts have been saying that other technologies such as NFC, which lets you get information wirelessly just by waving your phone in front of the chip, may eventually replace QR. But QR supporters argue that NFC is not quite there yet - it is expensive to create tags, and for now, not many phones can scan them. QR codes are free to create, cheap to install and nearly all modern smartphones have apps that can read them. Augmented reality apps are also a potential threat - they allow information to appear on your handset's screen simply by pointing the phone towards an object of interest. Google Glass headset could even take this one step further, and make information appear right in front of the user's eyes. But QR is far from being dead - and recent moves by the electronic giants Apple and Microsoft could give it a push. The technology will be integrated into Apple's Passbook ticket/coupon wallet service, available on the forthcoming iOS6 operating system. It will allow users to get into a cinema, check in for a flight, or redeem a coupon via their phone. Microsoft has recently signed a licensing agreement with NeoMedia, one of the pioneers in the mobile barcodes field, to acquire all of the firm's QR code patents. "Our own caving unit has now catalogued over 200 caves in Rock, with many being rich in archaeology but inaccessible to most people. "Here we have another way of getting all this information across to the world." "Gibraltarpedia" organisers want their QR codes to communicate with the user's phone to determine its set-up language, so a Brazilian tourist can be taken to a page in Portuguese, a Turk to one in Turkish and so on, says Roger Bamkin, a consultant to the Gibraltar government and a volunteer from Wikimedia UK, the charity that supports the online encyclopaedia. "By scanning QR codes around them, tourists will be to able to find out about the place they are visiting in their own language, with the description written by a volunteer speaking that language," he says. Volunteers have been producing up to 20 articles a day in various languages, and Mr Bamkin has been in Gibraltar this week seeking more people to contribute photos, maps and information on the territory's history. But once all the landmarks are equipped with codes and all the articles are written, other factors need to be dealt with for the project to take off. Roaming charges may deter visitors from connecting to the web - and the government of Gibraltar says it is considering the possibility of free wi-fi. Also, tourists should be familiar with QR codes and be willing to use them. Although people may be used to seeing them, not many in the Western world actually scan them. On the other hand, in Japan and South Korea many use them on a daily basis. Tesco Korea lets consumers shop in a virtual supermarket while standing on a subway platform. They scan images of groceries with a QR code reader and buy them with a click. But Gibraltarpedia organisers say that they realise QR codes may be replaced by other technology - just as DVDs replaced CDs, says Mr Bamkin. However, he believes that the project will be a success - and be it QR, NFC or any other future tech, Wikipedia is aiming to bridge online and offline worlds. "Projects like Gibraltarpedia are a test of our mission," says Mr Bamkin, adding that the next target is expansion into northern Africa. "Africans have a great need of free information - there are many more Wikipedia articles in the UK or France than there are in Morocco, Algeria, or Mali."	Driving along a sunlit road along Gibraltar's western slopes, a tourist stops by one of the city's top attractions - St Michael's Cave - and consults his travel guide.

The man dialled two taxi firms from the landline in the house at Wodecroft Road, Luton, but hung up after he was asked for his phone number. Bedfordshire Police asked anyone who recognised the man's voice to contact them. A flat-screen television and other electrical items were stolen from the house. The calls were made in the early hours of Saturday 25 October using a cordless telephone, which was then left on a table in the garden, police said. The man called two Luton taxi firms which were both dealt with by the same control office. In the first call, the suspect was asked to leave his landline number, but said he did not know it. He was then asked to leave his mobile number and he started to, but then stopped, claiming he did not know it. Police said he then made a second call and got through to the same controller, who explained the office handled calls for more than one taxi firm. The force hopes the suspect, who almost revealed his mobile phone number, can be identified from the recordings, which were made automatically. Det Con Scott Hannam said: "We are keen to identify the man as we believe he may have important information which could assist our investigation. "I would urge anyone who recognises his voice, or for the man himself, to contact police. "I am also keen to hear from anyone who has any information or saw a large television being carried around this area on the night in question."	Police have released recordings of a suspected burglar phoning for a taxi from the house he had just broken into.
Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order. When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case. It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education. Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled. According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17% between July 2013 and July 2014. Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential. Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels. Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction. "I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him," she says. "I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like.  It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick." Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him. "Freedom is what makes learning still fun," he says. "In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker." Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children. Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum. "A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change.  I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime." Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children. "I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life." These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education. They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong. But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do. Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis. It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information. The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy. But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos. In a statement, Kensington and Chelsea Council acknowledged the right of parents to educate their children at home. But it said "when this happens we believe that we have a duty of care to establish that the child is receiving a suitable education".	A London council has withdrawn an order forcing a mother to send her home educated child to school.
He said he wanted to act "in the best interests" of the university where he studied as an undergraduate. The resignation comes after several of his Bill Cosby shows have been axed in the US. The 77-year-old entertainer has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women. The comedian has not directly addressed the accusations, but his lawyers have described them as "discredited" and "defamatory." Mr Cosby said in a statement on Monday that he had "always been proud" of his association with Temple University, where he had been a trustee for over 30 years. "The Board of Trustees accepts Dr Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university,'' the university said in a statement. More than a dozen women, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson, have come forward claiming that Mr Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them. Some of the accusations date back to 2005 and 2006. A woman from Florida has also accused Mr Cosby of raping her backstage at a show in Las Vegas in 1976. Mr Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Several broadcasters have decided not to continue projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix.	US comedian Bill Cosby has resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia amid ongoing allegations of sexual assault.
This weekend's match is the centenary of the first meeting between the two sides, and with Leicester arriving as champions there is no doubt which club is in the ascendancy at the moment. During Guscott's time at The Rec it was the West country club that ruled the roost - and he believes they are potentially on the cusp of a revival. This game is big in a lot of different ways for different generations of families and supporters, and the players that have represented both clubs through the years. Those that have followed and played for these two clubs over many years will remember the times they have been successful and the times they have not. Bath took over from Tigers as the dominant English club around 1983-84 and maintained that until the early-to-mid 1990s. Since that time Tigers have been there or thereabouts, often battling for supremacy with Wasps and have been the most consistent English club for 25 years or so. This particular fixtures is given an extra edge because of the anniversary. It evokes memories of all the great games of the past but, looking to the future, Bath are potential challengers to a Tigers team that will want to put down a marker. Throughout my career, games against Leicester - as well as local rivals Gloucester and Bristol - were the biggest games that Bath played in, perhaps because of three cup finals Bath won in 1989, 1994 and 1996. At the time, both teams were used to winning and were full of current or previous internationals players. Who wouldn't want to be involved in those games? The contests were always full of tension, particularly the 1996 final when we got a penalty try to win 16-15. At the end of the game Leicester's Neil back mistook team-mate Steve Lander for Bath's Andy Robinson and pushed him over. With a comfortable win at Newcastle on the opening weekend, Bath have got off to a good start. However, the visit of Leicester is one of the biggest tests of the season and it is good that it arrives early. The Tigers challenge will show this relatively new Bath team where they are and how much further they need to go. Fly-half George Ford ran the game well against the Falcons last week in poor conditions, he was tactically good and nailed most of his kicks. The Tigers know him well and I'm sure the likes of Julian Salvi and Jordan Crane would like the opportunity to get some tackling practice in on their former team-mate. Individually, Bath have exciting backs like Kyle Eastmond, Jonathan Joseph, Nick Abendanon, Tom Heathcote, Anthony Watson, Tom Biggs, Semesa Rokoduguni, Gavin Henson and more. We await to see what they can collectively produce, especially as there are high expectations to deal with. You have to admire the Tigers - the club, supporters, playing squad and management. Friday Harlequins v Northampton - Quins win Sale v Newcastle  - Sale win Saturday Exeter v London Wasps - Exeter win Worcester v London Irish - Warriors win Bath v Leicester - Bath win Sunday Saracens v Gloucester - Sarries win This weekend's full fixture list Over the years they have been brilliant at maintaining their values by recruiting the right players. By that, I mean they have signed players that aren't always the best in their position but are seen as the right fit for the Tigers culture. That's very important. The Tigers expects nothing less than 100% commitment on and off the field and expect their players to abide by the culture and code of conduct set out. You may think that's the case at every club. It's not - and that is one of the reasons that the others have struggled to match Leicester. Leicester ran over Worcester last week and they will look to power through Bath with more aggression and precision at the breakdown. They will look to make Bath players ask themselves whether they have what it takes to be a top-four team. Have they got the heart and soul for the fight? Fly-half Ryan Lamb had a mixed game last weekend but that's what you get from a player who tends to play what he sees rather than what might have been planned. He does the unexpected, which is different to Toby Flood. Flanker Tom Croft, who is out for the season with a knee injury, is a huge loss and we all wish him a speedy recovery. Bath want to change from last season's defensive displays and test themselves with a more balanced style. This new game plan will be given a severe test against the Tigers. Outside the clear colossal forward engagement that will take place, Bath's most important player will be Ford. If he has the clear mind to make the right decisions and produce a big-game performance, Bath will win. Media playback is not supported on this device Bath have been starved of success for some time now, but they have begun a journey under new owner Bruce Craig, who has arrived with ideas that are ambitious, but certainly not impossible. Before Craig arrived, Bath had, in my opinion, lost their on-field identity, with no recognisable style. Only under Steve Meehan did they give the impression that something was building, but that ended and another unsuccessful period started. For quite some time Bath haven't had enough quality players or guys who have wanted to work hard enough to earn success. Gary Gold, Mike Ford and their team of coaches have to create that environment. Off the pitch you can see the changes, the club's administration and training facilities all under the same roof at Farleigh Manor, providing a great working habitat. It's hoped the Recreation Ground could house a new stadium for 2015. Maybe Bath will have a winning team by then.	Jeremy Guscott fought many battles with Leicester during his years in the centres for Bath, so he knows just how strong the rivalry is between the two clubs.
Syd's Garden will be "laced with little clues" about the singer, according to Stephen Pyle. Designed as a restful area for patients and staff, it will open in the grounds of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in 2018. Barrett, a founder member of Pink Floyd, died in 2006 after living locally as a semi-recluse. Read more Cambridgeshire stories here The garden has been designed by sculptor Mr Pyle and Paul Herrington, a garden designer. Their charity, Art Garden Health, creates and maintains green spaces for NHS hospitals at no public cost. Addenbrooke's offered them a plot a year ago - and fundraising got under way. Mr Pyle knew Barrett as a young man when the two began Saturday art classes at Cambridge's Homerton College. They were also members of band Those Without, which toured Cambridge youth clubs and pubs between 1963 and 1965. They studied together at the Cambridge School of Art before Barrett left for London - and Mr Pyle began a career in theatre set design. "Syd's sister said he liked roses," said Mr Pyle. "And there'll be a striped colour theme, which fans will recognise. "The artwork on his first solo album is turquoise and orange, and Paul worked with those colours. "There's also a nod to Abbey Road's crossing." The centrepiece will be a circular sculpture, depicting a teenage Barrett on a bicycle, armed with a guitar and a paint palette. "This was the Syd I knew at art school," said Mr Pyle. "The 18-year-old, the free wheeler. "He wasn't ambitious for glory, just very creative and anarchic. He was very charismatic - and very, very talented." He described Barrett as a "celebrated son of Cambridge", who returned to the city and lived as a recluse until his death in 2006. In October 2016 a specially-designed artwork unveiled in the foyer of the Cambridge Corn Exchange in October 2016, where he played his last live gig. A blue plaque was also dedicated to him in Cambridge as part of BBC Music Day 2017.	A childhood friend of Pink Floyd legend Syd Barrett is developing a hospital garden in his honour.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Great City Games, an open and free event for the public, is due to take place in Manchester on Friday. Organisers said the event will go ahead as planned, but a decision on Sunday's Great Manchester Run "is expected in the next 24 hours". The FA Cup final, EFL play-offs and the PGA Championship are also this week. An eight-year-old girl was among those killed in Monday's suicide bombing at Manchester Arena, at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK terror threat level has been raised to its highest level of "critical", meaning further attacks may be imminent. Manchester United cancelled a news conference on Tuesday, due to be held prior to their Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday, and will wear black armbands for the match. The club said: "Our thoughts are with the victims and their families at this terribly difficult time." United's players held a minute's silence at training on Tuesday, and the club closed its megastore, museum, cafe and stadium tours to the public. A staff event scheduled for Wednesday has been cancelled by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. Manager Jose Mourinho said: "We are all very sad about the tragic events; we cannot take out of our minds and our hearts the victims and their families. "We have a job to do and we will fly to Sweden to do that job. It is a pity we cannot fly with the happiness that we always have before a big game. "I know, even during my short time here, that the people of Manchester will pull together as one." Ajax manager Peter Bosz said: "What happened yesterday evening in Manchester is something we all feel in Ajax and on behalf of all of us at Ajax we express our sympathies with the victims that fell. The feeling that prevails is the final does not have the glow it should have. "Tomorrow evening should be a football feast but because of the events in Manchester we are affected. It is horrible. My sympathies are heartfelt." Football's European governing body Uefa announced a minute's silence will be observed prior to the final. The opening ceremony will also be considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. Aleksander Ceferin, president of Uefa, said he was "deeply saddened" and shocked that "so many innocent people lost their lives". A Uefa statement said there was "currently no specific intelligence" to suggest Wednesday's game could be a target for further attacks. "Uefa has been closely working with local authorities and the Swedish FA for many months and the terrorist risk had been taken into account since the very beginning of the project," it said. "Furthermore, a number of additional security measures were implemented following the attacks in Stockholm last April." There will be a minute's silence observed at Headingley cricket ground before England's one-day international against South Africa on Wednesday. Both sets of players will also wear black armbands during the game. The South Africa team have been told there will be extra police officers on duty at the ground and increased security at team hotels and practice. There will also be a minute's silence before Saturday's Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen at Hampden Park. The Scottish FA's security and integrity officer, Peter McLaughlin, said: "We remain vigilant to the threat posed by global terrorism and are engaged in constant dialogue with colleagues at Police Scotland and the National Counter-Terrorism Security Office. "This ongoing communication and intelligence-sharing is part of our operations protocol for all events at the national stadium, including the forthcoming Scottish Cup final." A number of leading athletes are scheduled to participate at the Great City Games on Friday, while a public half marathon and 10km run are due to be staged in Manchester on Sunday. Wembley hosts Saturday's FA Cup final between Arsenal and Chelsea, and the League Two and Championship play-off finals on Sunday and Monday respectively. A Football Association spokesperson said: "Fan safety is of paramount importance and we have robust security measures in place at Wembley Stadium. "In collaboration with the Metropolitan Police and the local authorities there will be an enhanced security operation for all upcoming events. "All supporters are encouraged to arrive for events at Wembley Stadium as early as possible for security checks and to avoid any delays in entering the stadium." The English Football League (EFL) added it "takes security issues extremely seriously" and urged supporters travelling to Wembley to "be vigilant of their surroundings at all times, stay alert and not be alarmed". The Metropolitan Police says extra armed officers will be deployed at this weekend's major sports events in London, with a full review of the security and policing operations under way. "Over the coming days as you go to a music venue, go shopping, travel to work or head off to the fantastic sporting events you will see more officers - including armed officers," said commander Jane Connors. Golf's BMW PGA Championship starts at Wentworth on Thursday. "As with any major event, security is the highest priority," said European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley. "It was before Monday night and it remains so. "We're in constant dialogue with the police and security services. We are comfortable we will react in the right way if in fact we need to significantly increase our security." Cricket's Champions Trophy will take place from 1-18 June at venues in Birmingham, London and Cardiff. A statement from the International Cricket Council [ICC] read: "The ICC and ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] place safety and security at the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Women's World Cup this summer as the highest priority. "We operate on advice from our tournament security directorate - in conjunction with the ECB and relevant authorities - to ensure that we have a robust safety and security plan for both tournaments. "We will continue to work with authorities over the coming hours and days and review our security in line with the threat levels." England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said his team had met their security advisers on Tuesday morning before Wednesday's match against South Africa. "On behalf of the England cricket team, I'd like to offer our thoughts and prayers to everybody in Manchester affected by the tragic events," said Morgan. "I'd also like to give our support to those in and around things and those most affected and those who helped out and continue to help out." The domestic rugby union finishes this weekend, but the National Counter Terrorism security office has been in touch with Sale Sharks and every other Aviva Premiership club asking for details of any events planned by them over the next couple of weeks. There will also be tighter security at horse racing's Epsom Derby on 3 June, with Surrey Police announcing firearms officers on patrol around the grounds. Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman said: "The Epsom Derby is a fantastic event which attracts thousands of people and spectators from around the world and I am confident that this year's festival will be no exception." England Women's cricketer Danielle Wyatt was at the Ariana Grande concert and said: "Thank you for all messages - I'm safe. Was at the concert enjoying myself like many others - thoughts with victims & families." Manchester United and Spain goalkeeper David de Gea tweeted: "Much rage, much pain. My condolences to the victims' family members involved in the atrocious attack to the heart of the city." Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard said the "beautiful city" of Manchester "will stand together in this dark hour", captain Wayne Rooney said he was "devastated" by the news and winger Ashley Young said he was "absolutely shocked". Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand: "My thoughts & prayers are with all the families & friends affected by last night's attack in Manchester." Former Lancashire and England cricketer Andrew Flintoff: "In the toughest of times the people of Manchester showing why this is such a great city, standing together in the face of such evil." Manchester City players - including captain Vincent Kompany, goalkeeper Willy Caballero, forward Leroy Sane and defender Pablo Zabaleta - also tweeted their support for those affected. Lucy Bronze, from City's women's team, said her "thoughts are with those affected" and urged people to "stick together". Olympic and world 100m champion Usain Bolt tweeted: "Thoughts & prayers goes out to people of Manchester and all those who are affected."	Sporting events and venues in England are conducting major security reviews after 22 people were killed in an attack at Manchester Arena.
The Communication Workers Union said the walkout would start on Monday 19 December and include Christmas Eve. It will involve thousands of workers from the Crown Post Offices. The Post Office said despite the walkout it would be "business as usual" with "at least" 97% of its 11,600 branches not involved. Crown Post Offices are the larger branches that are usually located in High Streets. In April 2016, the Post Office announced plans to transfer up to 61 branches into WH Smith stores over the following year. It said the move was part of a 10-year plan to cut costs and save cash, and would act as a way of "safeguarding the future of the network." "Our members want the Post Office management to pause its closure and privatisation programme, hold off on its planned pensions changes, and commit to sitting down with us and with the other key stakeholders of this Great British institution and, together, construct a lasting vision," said CWU assistant secretary Andy Furey. The Post Office said it was "extremely disappointed" by the CWU's action. "Just today, we agreed with the CWU that we would resume talks, which have been ongoing throughout the summer, on Wednesday," added Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's network and sales director.	Post Office workers will stage five days of strikes from Monday in a continuing dispute over jobs, pensions and branch closures, their union says.
Wales wing Hallam Amos scored two fine tries in the second half while Dorian Jones kicked five points for the hosts. But Hamish Watson's touchdown, plus eight points from Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and a penalty from Blair Kinghorn, proved enough for the visitors. Edinburgh move to within four points of rivals Glasgow in sixth, though the Warriors have a game in hand. The Dragons had 20-year-old Wales centre Tyler Morgan and fly-half Dorian Jones back from long-term injuries, while Taulupe Faletau returned from Wales duties. Edinburgh scrum-half Hidalgo-Clyne was making his 50th appearance while the visitors also paraded their Scotland front row. On a muddy surface, the first half produced only penalties, with two from Hidalgo-Clyne and one from Kinghorn on target for the visitors, while Jones kicked one for the Dragons. Flanker Watson wasted a golden chance for the Scots after 24 minutes as he went for the line rather than using the men free outside. The Dragons started the second half at a higher tempo and after barely a minute, Amos sprinted through a gap to score with Jones' conversion giving them the lead. But Edinburgh struck back in their next attack as Watson wrestled his way over from a line-out drive and Hidalgo-Clyne put over the angled kick. Amos then produced a superb finish from 30 metres out when given an overlap from man-of-the-match Faletau's pass. But that unconverted score after 53 minutes proved to be the last of the match. Edinburgh kept the Dragons pinned in their own half in the final quarter but Hidalgo-Clyne was off target with two more penalty attempts as they failed to make their pressure pay. It was the Welsh side's ninth losing bonus point of the season, including five in the last six matches. Dragons host Ospreys on Friday in their final game at Rodney Parade this season, before their European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Gloucester on 9 April, while Edinburgh host Zebre on Friday.

The paper claims London-based private doctor Mark Bonar prescribed banned performance-enhancing drugs to over 150 British athletes including footballers. Arsenal said they were "extremely disappointed" by the publication of the claims, "which are without foundation". Chelsea said the claims were "false and entirely without foundation" while leaders Leicester also denied them. Bonar himself broke his silence on the matter on Sunday evening, writing on Twitter that the newspaper's claims were "false and very misleading". "I have never had a relationship with any premier football club or player," he added on his unverified account, @ZenGrifter. Read more: Footballers 'doped by London doctor' Chelsea added they have "never used the services of Dr Bonar and have no knowledge or record of any of our players having been treated by him or using his services". Leicester denied the allegations and added: "We are extremely disappointed that The Sunday Times has published unsubstantiated allegations referring to players from clubs including Leicester City when, on its own admission, it has insufficient evidence to support the claims." Championship side Birmingham City said: "The club have not used the services of Mark Bonar and has no knowledge or record of any of our players, past or present, doing so." The Sunday Times says it has secretly filmed Bonar claiming he has prescribed drugs such as EPO, steroids and human growth hormone to elite sports professionals from the UK and abroad over the past six years, including: The Sunday Times says it has no independent evidence Bonar treated the footballers or the other sportspeople. Bonar told the Sunday Times he treated the athletes for medical reasons and not to enhance their performance. There is no suggestion the substances were illegal, but they are banned by sporting bodies. Bonar had his professional services agreement with the Omniya Clinic terminated on Friday, after it emerged he does not have a licence to practise medicine in the UK. The Football Association released a statement regarding the claims, saying: "These are very serious allegations. As such, The FA welcomes UK Anti-Doping's decision to immediately launch an independent review into the matters raised by the Sunday Times. "The FA is fully committed to maintaining the integrity of English football and will work with Ukad and other relevant agencies in seeking to do so. The FA urges anyone with information that may be relevant to come forward as soon as possible." The case is now the subject of a government investigation, following claims made by a whistleblower athlete who was banned for breaching anti-doping rules in 2014. According to the newspaper, the sportsman - who wishes to remain anonymous - approached Ukad with evidence that alleged Bonar had prescribed him performance-enhancing drugs. Ukad says it did begin an investigation into Bonar but decided he was outside of its jurisdiction as he was not governed by a sport. Ukad also decided not to pass the case to the General Medical Council (GMC) or to contact the doctor. Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said the organisation was "deeply concerned and shocked by the allegations" and it would conduct an independent review into the case. World Anti-Doping Agency president Craig Reedie told BBC Radio 5 live it was "pretty dreadful news" and backed calls for an inquiry, but added: "It is best to wait for Ukad to do their own investigation, then we have full knowledge of the facts to work with. "My own guess is if they had sufficient evidence then they would have acted." Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

9 March 2017 Last updated at 17:03 GMT The 19-year-old from Dublin is a competitive runner - but her chronic epilepsy means she has around 16 seizures a day, often during races. When other competitors see her fall to the ground, they naturally believe she needs to go to hospital - even though she normally recovers immediately and in her case, there's no need for medical intervention. Even though she's grateful for the public response, all Katie wants to do is carry on running. When she told the neurologist who's treating her condition, he offered to become her running partner - and together they've become a marathon-running team.

SKN Heritage Museum is showing the type of belongings brought by African-Caribbean immigrants in the 1940s and 50s. The Windrush generation responded to adverts to work in Britain but were only allowed to bring one suitcase. Organisers said the display gives a unique insight into important part of Nottingham's history. The Windrush was named after the first boat which brought people from the Caribbean to Britain in 1948. The exhibition, called 'From Caribbean Isles to the British Isles -Home to Home', aims to give an insight into people who travelled across the Atlantic to seek a better life in what was still the Empire's "mother country". Item include photographs, clothes, records and games - as well as beauty products designed for black skin and hair when none were commercially available. Catherine Ross, the museum's founder, cameto Nottingham from St Kitts when she was just seven years old. She said: "Our aim is to let everyone know about the contributions that Caribbeans have made to British society and Nottingham and commemorate these achievements. "There'sno better place tostart than Nottingham Carnival, as it's such awell known and celebratory event in Nottingham's calendar." The carnival is taking place for the first time take in two sites - the Forest Recreation Ground on Saturday and the Victoria Embankment on Sunday.	A unique perspective on a landmark social event is to be unveiled as part of Nottingham's Caribbean Carnival.
Peter Bunyan, 53, of Brooklands Road, Cosby, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Derby Crown Court. The court heard a witness saw him forcing entry into 84-year-old Brian Robson's house on 23 February. Police then found Mr Robson with fatal head injuries. Bunyan will be sentenced at a later date. Police told the court they arrived at the address to find Mr Robson in the hall and attempts to revive him failed. Bunyan had returned to his house next door and was arrested there. Det Insp Chris Barratt, from Leicestershire Police, said: "Bunyan's actions on that tragic day led to the death of a very much loved family man and devastated a family. "I would like to offer my condolences to the family and thank them for their co-operation and understanding throughout our investigation and subsequent court proceedings."	A Leicestershire man has admitted killing his neighbour after kicking down his front door.
The Lucky Country by Donald Horne, which came out in 1964, has gone on to become a cult classic, as well as saddling this land with an entirely misappropriated nickname. On arriving in Australia just over a year ago, it was the first book I read having received a recommendation from my predecessor. "That sounds upbeat," I thought, seeking inspiration for my new life down under. It is, however, a thoroughly depressing read. A damning and bleak assessment of Australian society in the early 1960s. "A bucket of cold saltwater emptied onto the belly of a dreaming sunbather," is how one critic described it at the time. The opening words of its final chapter sum up the book's thesis: "Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise." Essentially, Horne painted a picture of a deeply conservative and unambitious country that had got to where it was by luck rather than merit, riding on the coat tails of its historical ties to Britain. "In the lucky style we have never 'earned' our democracy. We simply went along with some British habits," Horne wrote in his 1976 follow-up, Death of a Lucky Country. The fact that the book's title was ironic and that most people referring these days to Australia as The Lucky Country do so in a positive light, drove Horne round the bend. "I have had to sit through the most appalling rubbish as successive generations misapplied this phrase," Horne later went on to say. In 1964 though, despite being unoptimistically received by its publisher, The Lucky Country clearly touched a nerve with the Australian public. It sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year, an Australian record for a book of its type. It's now in its sixth edition. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently described the book's publication as one of the defining moments in Australia's history. The question for many is whether Donald Horne's assessment still applies. Does Australia remain the Lucky Country? It is undoubtedly a successful and prosperous one. When the world's leaders come to Brisbane in a few weeks for the G20 summit, with an agenda including trying to lift more of the global population out of poverty, they will be doing so from the five-star comfort of an incredibly affluent society. A study by investment bank Credit Suisse recently judged Australians to be the richest people in the world, with a median Australian adult worth more than US$225,000 (A$258,000), most of that due to high property values. Research by the Economist Intelligence Unit listed Australia as the second best country in the world to be born, beaten only by the high-flying Swiss. Australian cities regularly pepper the top 10 of best places to live. Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Adelaide all made it into the business end of the Economist's latest liveability index. And before the rest of the world gets too green with envy, those cities are also among the most expensive places to set up home. As in most wealthy countries, however, there are pockets of extreme poverty here. Australia's indigenous population fares especially badly. Life expectancy, a key economic indicator, for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population is more than 10 years less than for the non-indigenous population. A recent study by the Australian Council of Social Service showed that one in seven Australians live below the poverty line. But the poverty line is Australia is considered to US$350 (A$400) a week for a single adult and US$740 (A$840) a week for a couple with two children. That's not a lot of money to live on in Australia but it compares pretty well to the world's other wealthy nations, let alone the poor ones. The US Census Bureau considers the poverty line to be just US$228 (A$260) a week for a single adult and  US$454 (A$515) a week for a family of two adults and 2 children. In Australia, the average wage in May 2014 before tax was US$51,383 (A$58,239) a year and US$69,413 (A$78,701) for full time workers. In 2013 the average wage for an US individual was just US$43,041 (A$48,784) and the median wage was just US$28,031 (A$31,757). An Australian friend of mine joked to me the other day: "Forget the whinging poms, we've become a nation of whinging Aussies." He suggested people in Sydney regard A$100,000 (US$88,0000) as a normal wage for a relatively successful person. Australia has enjoyed 23 years of consecutive economic growth. It has been one of the world's few developed economies to avoid the global financial crisis. Much of that success has been built on the country's vast mineral wealth, a mining boom that has lasted more than a decade and which arguably is still going, be it at a slower pace. Some might argue that mineral wealth again makes Australia a lucky country; one which hasn't got rich through innovation but rather through the good fortune to sit on huge piles of coal, iron ore, copper and uranium. Of course that's not to say that many other countries haven't profited from similar good fortune. Saudi Arabia must surely be the luckiest of them all. But in the innovation stakes, Australia still fares pretty badly. The Economist's Economic Innovation Index has Australia ranked 22nd, way behind the likes of Japan, the US, Germany and Sweden. Similarly on the magazine's Technological Readiness Index, Australia again fails to get into the top 20 - trailing behind the likes of Portugal, Belgium, Israel and Iceland. Anyone who's experienced Australia's mind-numbingly slow internet connections can testify to that particular low score. Australia has long been promising to embrace "the Asian Century". The country once faced the "tyranny of distance" in terms of European export markets but now finds itself practically on the doorstep of the fast growing economies of East Asia. Yet successive governments have still not managed to meet their pledges to increase the teaching of Asian languages in Australia's schools. Donald Horne died in 2005 as Australia entered the peak years of its prosperity. We'll never know if he would still consider his homeland to be the Lucky Country. All this is not to say that Australia is not a wonderful place to live. I, for one, can vouch for Sydney as being one of the world's coolest and most fabulous cities. I feel lucky to be here.

The stormy weather made for treacherous racing on slippery roads but Team Sky's Froome survived the final descent into Morzine to maintain his overall lead. Froome's lead over Romain Bardet of four minutes five seconds will not be tested on the final stage in Paris. Stage 20 was won by Spanish Movistar rider Jon Izaguirre. He rode clear of fellow breakaway riders Jarlinson Pantano of the IAM Cycling team and 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali to win the 146km stage in four hours, six minutes and 45 seconds. Froome, who crashed on a rainy descent on Friday, was more cautious on Saturday's drop into Morzine and finished more than four minutes behind Izaguirre but only a few seconds adrift of his rivals in the overall standings. "I still need to get the yellow jersey to Paris tomorrow but certainly the racing side is done and dusted," said Froome, who won the 2013 and 2015 editions of the three-week race. "It's an amazing feeling of relief, just coming over the last line today. Thank you to all my team-mates, they've really been there for me every step of the way and I couldn't ask for more." Frenchman Bardet finished six seconds ahead of Froome to cement second place, while Quintana, who said he "suffered from allergies" during the race, will finish third. Tradition dictates that the man in the race leader's yellow jersey is not challenged during Sunday's largely processional final stage in Paris which is expected to end in a bunch sprint. The 113km route from Chantilly will start in pedestrian fashion with Froome posing for photographs with his team-mates, sipping the obligatory glass of champagne. The stage finishes with nine laps around the centre of Paris and Froome still has to race on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees and make it across the finish line to be crowned champion for a third time. In doing so, he will become just the eighth rider to win three Tour titles, following legendary five-time winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, while joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond who have all won three. Froome is also set to become the first man since Indurain, who won his five titles consecutively from 1991, to successfully defend the title. Tour director Christian Prudhomme said it was Froome's incredible attacks on stages eight and 11 that were the stand-out moments for him. "There was no surprise because Chris Froome won. But for me it was not the same as in previous years," he said. "When he attacked in the Peyrsourde descent it was such a surprise. And he did it again when he went with Peter Sagan in Montpellier. I liked it very much. Chris Froome was very good, his opponents less good." Britain's Adam Yates will finish a terrific fourth overall and in possession of the white jersey as the best rider under the age of 25. The 23-year-old from Bury was second from stages seven to 12, and only lost third place to Nairo Quintana, one of the pre-race favourites, on Friday's penultimate stage in the mountains. However, his initial nine-second deficit became 19 when he was penalised 10 seconds for receiving a push from an Orica BikeExchange team-mate. That gap was extended to 21 seconds as he finished Saturday's stage behind Quintana. Yates' consolation was retaining the white jersey, which he won by two minutes and 16 seconds ahead of South Africa's Louis Meintjes. Froome knew only too well how easily a slip could have cost him dearly on the wet descents in this undulating stage, with his right knee bandaged from a fall in similar conditions on the previous day. He had also suffered road rash on his back and, with the road damp and the downhill finish looking dangerous, he was mindful to stay safely around his team-mates. Geraint Thomas, who handed over his bike to Froome on Friday to let his team leader complete the stage, did the job of guiding the yellow jersey up and over Col de Joux Plane, the final mountain of this year's Tour. All of the general classification front runners remained in the peloton with Froome, and the pace was only increased when Roman Kreuziger had leapt from 12th to second overall, causing slight concern among the podium contenders. In the end, Czech Kreuziger was unable to maintain the pace and a large breakaway was whittled down to the pairing of Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe, who were soon joined and passed by 2014 champion Vincenzo Nibali. Nibali, a favourite to win road race gold at the Olympics next month, was caught by Pantano and a resurgent Izaguirre, and the Basque-born rider descended impeccably to claim his first Tour de France stage win and Movistar's first of this year's Tour. "I think my parents must have been scared watching at home," he said. "I wanted to drop Nibali because I was worried about him in a sprint. Beating Nibali in a downhill is something that counts in a career." General classification after stage 20: 1. Chris Froome (GB/Team Sky)     86hrs 21mins 40secs 2.

The teenager was arrested outside a takeaway in Heywood in August 2008 for being disruptive. She alleged one of the workers had groomed and then raped her. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) investigated Kabeer Hassan and another man, aged 59, but it was nearly a year later when a CPS lawyer decided to drop the case. According to Nazir Afzal, chief prosecutor for the North West, the lawyer had viewed six hours of video testimony from the girl and also had DNA evidence, but decided "she would not be viewed as a credible witness by a jury". Hassan and the other man, who cannot be named, have been convicted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court with seven others, all from Greater Manchester, who groomed young girls for sex by plying them with drink and drugs. The file of the girl's allegations was one of the first on Mr Afzal's desk when he started his new job in the summer of 2011 and he took "an immediate decision" to prosecute Hassan and the 59-year-old man. By then GMP's Operation Span, launched in December 2009, was under way investigating allegations from other under-age girls in the Rochdale and Heywood areas relating to the other defendants. However, Mr Afzal maintains he would have charged both men even if the only evidence available had been that which led to the original case being dropped. "I took the view that a jury would have found her a credible witness," he said. "I regret that the wrong decision was made." Mr Afzal said his decision to prosecute was based on 20 years experience including expertise in rape cases. The CPS's dropping of the original case led police to stop all investigations, a decision that is now the subject of separate inquiry. The original lawyer, whose decision was reviewed and backed by a CPS unit manager, has been taken off rape cases and is undergoing retraining. The way GMP treated the 2008 allegations is at the centre of a managed investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). It was only after a second girl made similar claims in December 2009 that detectives began Operation Span. Police went on to find more than 40 vulnerable and at risk girls across Rochdale and Heywood subjected to on-street grooming by a network of men, mostly takeaway employees and taxi drivers. All five girls who were witnesses in the gang's conviction were known to social services at some stage in their lives. GMP is not commenting directly on the IPCC inquiry, but Assistant Chief Constable Steven Heywood concedes the force has made mistakes. "We apologise to anyone that has suffered due to any failing on our part, " he said. "We probably could have done things better. "We and other agencies are on a journey, we know more about this kind of crime than we did in 2008."	Three years ago, a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer dropped a rape case involving an under-age girl which could have left a sex grooming ring undetected for years.

Observations with Japan's Subaru telescope reveal the likely icy body to be some 15.5 billion km from the Sun - about three times further away than even far-flung Pluto. Scientists say their initial studies suggest that the object - catalogued as  V774104 - is some 500-1,000km across. It will need to be tracked over time to learn the shape and extent of its orbit through the Solar System. The discovery was announced at the 47th annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences, taking place in National Harbor near Washington DC. The team behind the find is led by Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, and Chad Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. They specialise in detecting Solar System outliers. The previously recognised most distant object is the dwarf planet Eris. This body, which has a moon, Dysnomia, moves between 5.7 billion km and 14.6 billion km from the Sun. To put some of these numbers in context: Earth is 149 million km from the Sun, and even the most distant major planet - Neptune - seems close at 4.5 billion km, by these standards. That said, the Voyager 1 probe is further away - just. The epic robotic explorer has now ventured 20 billion km from home. The big question is whether V774104 sweeps inwards from its present location, like Eris, or outwards, like the objects known as 2012 VP113 and Sedna. These bodies are currently slightly closer in than Eris, but investigations of their orbits show they will reach far deeper into space, out to 66 billion km and 140 billion km, respectively. Models for Solar System formation suggest that such objects were probably not created in these weird, eccentric orbits. One explanation is that they have been perturbed gravitationally and pulled on to their strange trajectories by a passing planet - perhaps one that was expelled from our Solar System early in its history. Some scientists even speculate that such objects could have been stolen from a star that formed from the same "nursery" of gas and dust as our Sun 4.6 billion years ago.

He died in a Dublin Hospital at 06:40 GMT on Friday. Fr Reid, 82, a  member of the Redemptorist order, secretly acted as a conduit between the republican movement and the SDLP. He was one of the witnesses who confirmed the decommissioning of IRA weapons. In recent years, he was involved in talks with Basque nationalists seeking independence from Spain. In 1988, Fr Reid was pictured praying over the bodies of Army corporals Derek Wood and David Howes who had been dragged from their car, beaten and shot by the IRA. The corporals had inadvertently driven into the midst of a republican funeral in Belfast. The photograph of the bloodstained priest crouched praying over one of the soldiers was one of the starkest images of the Northern Ireland Troubles. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "Fr Alec Reid's intervention to administer last rites epitomised his enormous faith and strength of conviction. "His comfort was given amidst the enormous fears and tension on that terrible day in March 1988." Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said Clonard monastery, Fr Reid's base in west Belfast during the Troubles, was "the cradle of the peace process". He told RTÉ Radio he was with Fr Reid on Thursday night in St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, and had been due to visit him again on Friday. "What Alec Reid did was, he lived the gospel message. He developed a view which was contrary to the official view, that there had to be dialogue, and he was tenacious." Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, said: "I heard with sadness of the death of Fr Reid. "We all owe a debt of gratitude to him for the role he played in the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland." Former SDLP leader John Hume said Fr Reid was "not simply a go between" in the early days of negotiating for peace. "He was an active player in fighting for an end to violence," Mr Hume said. "Without his courage, determination and utter selflessness, the road to peace in our region would have been much longer and much more difficult to traverse. "While we mourn the loss of a great man, we must also celebrate the legacy of peace and an opportunity to reconcile our people that he gave to us. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to waste." Michael D Higgins, the president of Ireland, said: "His ministering of the last rites to the two British corporals brutally killed in 1988 offered us an image of decency struggling to assert itself amidst brutality." There were tears and tributes in west Belfast as news broke of the death of Fr Alec Reid. "He should have got a Nobel Peace Prize," said one man. "But maybe he turned it down. The only prize he wanted was peace." One elderly woman, tears streaming down her face, said: "He should be remembered with respect. "He was someone who children should aspire to be like." Fr Reid's funeral will take place at 12:00 GMT on Wednesday after requiem Mass in Clonard church in west Belfast.	Fr Alec Reid, who was a key figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, acting as a go-between between the IRA and politicians, has died.
Students were asked to trace Arabic calligraphy in an exercise some parents said amounted to indoctrination. Officials said the schools were closed out of an "abundance of caution" and there were no specific safety threats. School administrators say a different lesson will be used in the future. One week ago, students at Riverheads High School were studying the Middle East and were asked to trace a piece of Arabic calligraphy that translated to: "There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah". Some pupils refused the assignment and parents accused the teacher of indoctrination. Officials with the Augusta County school district were quick to point out that the study of a region's religion and language are included in geography lessons. However, anger built up and by Wednesday complaints had become so numerous that the school's doors were locked and monitored. By Friday, the messages - described as profane and hateful - had increased and the decision was made to close the schools. Officials said that no specific threats were received, but law enforcement officials and the school district board recommended the closure because they were being cautious. The lesson was intended to illustrate the complexity of the Arabic language, they said, and not meant to promote any religious system. But future classes will use a different, non-religious example of Arabic. The decision to close the schools has drawn criticism as well. "It looks like fear wins again," a resident told the News Virginian newspaper. On the paper's Facebook account, locals have been debating the closure with one man saying, "our patriot forefathers are rolling in their graves," and another rhetorically posting, "how do these terrified people leave their houses every day?"	A school district in the US state of Virginia has closed all schools on Friday after a geography lesson that included Islam sparked vociferous complaints from around the country.
Jhanvi Ahuja was visiting the India Gate monument in Delhi on the night of 28 September with her parents and other relatives when she disappeared. She was found on Sunday night with a placard around her neck with her name and her uncle's telephone number on it. A passer-by who found her called her family and informed the police. After the child went missing, her family launched a campaign - Bring Back Jhanvi - on Facebook, Twitter and the instant messaging service WhatsApp to find her. "She was found standing on a road outside a gurudwara (Sikh temple) in Janakpuri area in west Delhi," Jhanvi's uncle Gaurav Chopra told the BBC. "She had a little board hanging around her neck. It gave her name and her father's name. It said she was lost at India Gate and asked anyone who found her to call her father. The board had my mobile phone number written on it." Mr Chopra said he asked the caller, a teenager, to sit with the child while he drove to the area. "The people who had taken her had shaved her head but I immediately recognised her. I started crying, she also started crying. I gave her some chocolates. She looked a little tense, but she was fine and in good health." Mr Chopra took her to the police station where Jhanvi's parents also arrived and identified her. Her father Rakesh Ahuja told reporters that it was like "a rebirth of a daughter". It is not yet known who took away the child but police say they suspect her kidnappers panicked and abandoned her following a widespread media coverage of the case and the social media campaign. Some suspect that her head was shaved to change her appearance. Child rights organisations says nearly 96,000 children disappear in India every year and that most of the missing children end up as labour, in brothels or in other exploitative situations. Activists say the authorities are not doing enough to stop child trafficking but officials claim a lack of resources and co-ordination on a national level makes tracing missing children difficult.	A three-year-old Indian girl who went missing a week ago has been found after her family launched a massive social media campaign.
Mr Newman was detained in Melbourne on Thursday after entering Australia without a visa. Australia had cancelled his visa while he was still in the US on the grounds that his presence in the country could incite violence. Mr Newman has previously called for the execution of abortion doctors and said women who have abortions are murderers. On Friday, Justice Geoffrey Nettle in Melbourne ruled that the cancellation of Mr Newman's visa was justified, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. While Mr Newman may have had a case to challenge the cancellation, he should not have boarded a plane to Australia without a visa, said the judge. "Acting as he did means he does not come to this court with clean hands," he said. Mr Newman, also known as Troy Newman-Mariotti, had been due to speak at events run by the group Right to Life Australia. But he was prevented from boarding a connecting flight in the US city of Denver on Tuesday after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton cancelled his visa. It came after it emerged he had called in a 2000 book for doctors who perform abortions to face execution . His wife Mellissa had presented his appeal to the high court in Melbourne. "I don't know what they're afraid of. I don't know what they think he's going to do here," she was quoted as saying earlier by ABC News. In a posting on Facebook ahead of his arrival in Melbourne, he said the decision to revoke his visa "was based on a pile of lies, including the idea that I promote violence". "My 25-year history of peaceful, prayerful action speaks for itself," he said. Earlier this week, Australian Labor MP Terri Butler wrote to Australia's Mr Dutton to ask that Mr Newman's visa be denied, calling him an "anti-choice extremist". But the website for Mr Newman's organisation, Operation Rescue, insisted that he "has never advocated violence and in fact, urges pro-life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change".	US anti-abortion campaigner Troy Newman is to be deported from Australia after losing a high court appeal.
Paul Good, 53, and Darryl Shellard, 45, both from Liverpool were convicted of fraud and jailed for eight and seven years each. Lee Doran, 45, of Huyton was sentenced to 16 months for admitting fraud. Merseyside Police said one businessman even lost his home as a result of the scam. The fraud involved sales staff, such as Doran, posing as cold callers from the emergency services to sell advertising for non-existent publications, said police. Shellard, and Good of Knight Street, Liverpool, targeted small firms and start-up businesses sending a sample copy to their clients who were then given 28 days to pay in full. Det Con Clare Walsh from the force's Economic Interventions unit said some offences dated back 10 years with victims spread across the UK. "This type of fraud is not a victimless crime - while initial amounts taken were often small, in some cases bills eventually ran to thousands of pounds, which had a devastating effect on the business and individuals involved, with one business owner even losing his own home as a result of their actions." Shellard, of Tancred Road, also admitted perjury in a civil court.	Three conmen have been jailed for a £4.5m fraud selling bogus advertising space to small companies who were taken to court if they did not pay up.
The 400-member Santee Sioux tribe already runs a casino, hotel and ranch and hopes the resort will be a new revenue generator. Marijuana is not legal in South Dakota but the tribe has been permitted to grow and sell pot since June. It will open on New Year's Eve and only be sold on the reservation. Sioux leaders would grow the marijuana to be offered in a smoking lounge. The lounge would have games, food and a bar, and eventually slot machines and a music venue. "We want it to be an adult playground," tribal president Anthony Reider told the AP news agency. "There's nowhere else in America that has something like this." Tribe leaders predict the resort would make up to $2m (Â£1.3m) per month. Marijuana is growing at a facility on the reservation now and they hope to sell it for the first time on 31 December at a New Year's Eve party. The Justice Department put out a new policy allowing Native American tribes to grow and sell marijuana in a similar way to some US states like Colorado in 2014. The strict provision does not allow tribes to sell marijuana to minors or grow it on public land. Marijuana will be sold in sealed one-gram packages for $12.50 (Â£8.27) to $15, and people will only be able to buy one gram at a time. "[The tribe] must look at these opportunities because in order to preserve the past we do have to advance in the present," said Mr Reider.	A Native American tribe in the US state of South Dakota has said it plans to open what would be the first marijuana resort in the US.
The evacuation of the Jet2 plane at East Midlands Airport was hampered when one of the escape chutes did not work. It came after the pilot was unable to check whether landing gear had deployed and the failure of the cabin PA system. The initial fault was caused by a loose connection the Air Accident Investigation Branch concluded. Because of the landing gear problems, the pilot - flying from Ibiza last September - was forced to fly over the airport at 1,000 ft (300m) so ground crew could check if it had come down, the report said. But it was too dark to tell and the co-pilot had to look out of windows in the main cabin, before the pilot was cleared to land. As the plane taxied on the runway, passengers reportedly panicked when the smoke began to seep into the cabin. Because the PA system was not working, cabin crew tried to use a loud hailer to tell passengers but the volume button had fallen off. The escape chute then failed to deploy effectively, forcing some of the passengers to run out on to the wing before leaping onto the ground. One member of cabin crew only realised the plane was being evacuated when she saw passengers on the wing. According to the report, a problem was first spotted when the pilots realised the address system was not working. Several other failures were noticed including an equipment cooling fan, a radio, weather radar, the autobrake, power to the standby altitude indicator and compass. It was realised there was a problem with a battery connection, known as a busbar, forcing the pilots to request a quick landing at the airport. After a successful landing, passengers and crew could smell smoke but the commander could not announce a full evacuation. Since the incident, Jet2 has included a procedure within its manual which will better-prepare pilots in the event of a repeat and also reduce the chance it will result in an evacuation, the report said. The AAIB concluded all the problems - bar the escape chute - stemmed from the loose connection possibly caused by the over-tightened nut. It also noted smoke started to seep into the cabin because a fan stopped working creating a build up of dust and oil in the air conditioning. It was suggested the problem with the escape chute could be because a crew member was more used to opening a door on the opposite side of the plane.	Passengers escaped a smoke-filled plane by jumping from the wing after a series of problems caused by an electrical fault, investigators say.
His daughter said he had died at Val de Grace military hospital in Paris on Tuesday evening. Raymond Aubrac and his late wife Lucie became important members of Jean Moulin's underground Resistance movement in 1942. Aubrac was arrested in June 1943 with Moulin, who died after torture. In a recent BBC interview, he described how their arrests by the Gestapo at a doctor's surgery in the suburb of Caluire in Lyon had come as "a shock but not a surprise". Jean Moulin, who had been sent by Gen Charles de Gaulle to organise the underground resistance to Nazi occupation, was tortured, taken to Paris and later died on a train to Berlin. But Raymond Aubrac escaped when a group of fighters including his wife attacked a lorry moving him and other members of the Resistance from jail in Lyon. Born as Raymond Samuel in 1914, Aubrac was Jewish. He studied engineering and married Lucie Bernard after war broke out. After his escape from jail, the couple reached London in February 1944. Their story and their Resistance work with Jean Moulin became legendary in France and the couple gave a number of talks to schools and colleges about their experience. After France was liberated, Aubrac was given the task of supervising reconstruction efforts in the port city of Marseille. From 1964-75 he served as a director at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. He twice gave evidence after the war against Rene Hardy, a fellow Resistance member who was accused of betraying his colleagues but was later acquitted. In 2010, he travelled to London with President Nicolas Sarkozy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Gen de Gaulle's appeal to the French people after the country had fallen to the Nazis. Raymond Aubrac remained politically active until he died and gave his backing to Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande. In tribute, President Sarkozy described him as an "heroic figure" whose "escape, thanks to the courage of his wife Lucie Aubrac, has entered into the legend of Resistance history". Centrist presidential candidate Francois Bayrou praised him as a "major emblematic figure".	One of the leading figures of the French resistance against the Nazis, Raymond Aubrac, has died aged 97, his family says.
Carmarthenshire council funded chief executive Mark James in his case over remarks made on Jacqui Thompson's blog. Mr James said in 2012 he would not keep any damages he won. Mrs Thompson, of Llanwrda, must pay Mr James damages of £25,000 in instalments but Mr James's lawyers would not say if this had been or would be given to the council. As well as the damages, Mrs Thompson must also pay about £5,000 in interest and nearly £15,000 in costs for March's enforcement hearing - all the money is due by 2032. BBC Wales understands the legal fees paid by the council on Mr James's behalf were in excess of £35,000. The authority's pledge to cover these fees was found to be unlawful by the Wales Audit Office. Mr James said in 2012 he was not motivated by money and vowed any damages he won would "be paid over to the authority". When asked if this was still the case, his solicitors, Acuity Legal, said Mr James "did not intend to give any further statements or any interviews on this subject". At a hearing at Carmarthen County Court on 23 March to determine a possession order on Mrs Thompson's house, Mark Spackman, on behalf of Mr James, said this was his intention "on a voluntary basis" but was "irrelevant" to the hearing. Judge John Parsons said: "Mr Spackman has told us he's entitled to change his mind... and it appears he has." The council is not seeking to recoup the money it paid for Mr James's legal fees but is pursuing £190,393 owed by Mrs Thompson. A High Court ruling said the blogger's "unlawful campaign of harassment and defamation" against Mr James meant she was "the author of her own misfortune". Mrs Thompson said it would be "completely unacceptable" if Mr James had changed his mind and chosen to keep the money A council spokesman said: "The council's position on this matter is well documented and subject of public record. There is nothing further to add."	A council boss has refused to say if he will honour a vow to repay compensation won in a libel case to the authority.
The plans would allow victims to ask for a case to be reviewed when police identified a suspect but did not pass a file to the Crown Prosecution Service. The policy would begin with rape and child sexual exploitation cases. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it was time to "put victims in the driving seat". The CPS already has a right to review scheme in place, where victims can request a review of their case if it is dropped by prosecutors before reaching the courtroom. Labour said it intended to extend this to decisions by the police. Ms Cooper said: "Rape and child sexual exploitation are vile crimes that ruin lives and destroy families. "Too often victims and survivors aren't listened to and aren't heard, especially children. "And although reports to the police have gone up, arrests and prosecutions have gone down. "But right now if the police decide not to pursue a crime, there is little more victims or their families can do. That's not good enough. "We'll change the law so that if the police decide to drop a case after a suspect has been identified, victims will have a new right to challenge their decision. "It's time to change the culture, stop these awful crimes being hidden away and put victims in the driving seat." Main pledges Labour said that of 16,300 complaints of rape made to the police in England and Wales in 2012-13, 5,400 were passed to the CPS. The party said a decision to drop a case when a suspect had been identified would follow the process used by the CPS, of local resolution followed by independent review. Under the plans, the decision to drop the case would be first be checked by a prosecutor who has not been involved with the case previously. Labour said it would ensure victims were provided with a clear and detailed explanation of the decision and the local resolution would normally be completed within 10 days of the receipt of a request for review. If the victim were not satisfied with the local resolution, the decision would be independently reviewed by another prosecutor. Former Thames Valley Chief Constable and head of the National Policing Improvement Agency, Peter Neyroud, said: "It is critical that victims have a right to review decisions all the way from the duty to record and allegation, through to decisions on whether to pursue a prosecution. "Not only does this put the spotlight of accountability on the police, but it also gives the victim an important additional opportunity to influence their case and understand the decisions. "Sometimes this will encourage a fresh angle to the case; sometimes there will be no new avenues. But there should always be a full and frank explanation of the steps taken to bring an offender to justice and the rationale for police decision."	Labour has said it would give victims of sexual offences the right to challenge decisions by police not to prosecute suspects.
The 39-year-old, who goes by the name Mick Fett, was born the year the first film in the series came out. Since the 1990s, Fett has amassed a vast collection of action figures, costumes and other merchandise. His collection fills the five-bedroom home he shares with his girlfriend and is estimated to be worth A$500,000 (Â£300,000; $370,000). "I mentioned that I had some Star Wars stuff when we first got together," he told the BBC. "She was a bit overwhelmed at first and then she sort of adapted." The suburban house is filled with a life-size Han Solo carbonite statue, priceless vintage toys and a vast collection of creatures from across the galaxy. There's an entire room dedicated to arcade games and even a pod-racer in the backyard. Only one room does not have Star Wars memorabilia in it - the main bathroom.

"It's two different worlds. The guys at work can't believe what I do in my Star Wars time and all my Star Wars friends can't believe I'm a police officer." The idea to redecorate the Darth Vader costume began when he attended an overseas Star Wars convention. He originally intended to attend the event as a Stormtrooper with an Australian flag cape. But at the suggestion the idea evolved. "One of my mates said: 'Why don't you go out and spray paint the entire costume?' I thought - instead of doing a Stormtrooper why not Vader?" The Down Under alter ego of the Sith Lord has since become a huge hit - at home and abroad. "I don't know whether Aussie Vader is a villain or a Rebel," he laughed. "I'm a bit of a Rogue One myself." "One of my favourite sayings is 'May the Force be with you, mate,'" he said. "The cape is an Australian flag. I've got beer cans on my belt and blue flames airbrushed onto my helmet and chest piece. I've even made a custom light-sabre with a didgeridoo handle." He has already seen the new Star Wars film Rogue One, once at the red carpet premiere and again at a midnight screening with fans. "It definitely beat all my expectations," he said, adding that the latest blockbuster is a great tribute to the original trilogy. "Empire Strikes Back was dark and gritty. Rogue One has a lot of those elements too." Reporting by the BBC's Greg Dunlop	A Sydney police officer and huge Star Wars fan has become a local hit after creating a Darth Vader costume painted with the Australian flag.
Traditionally it's always been much less good at keeping secrets. Journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip. So, it was highly unusual that BBC bosses had managed to keep the launch of a whole new BBC Scotland channel entirely secret until it was announced to staff on Wednesday morning. Staff, viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a "Scottish Six" had been shelved. No one knew that there would be an hour-long news programme with Scottish, UK and world news at 9pm instead. Already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel, new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes. The announcement of new nightly news programme at 9pm does mean that the idea of a "Scottish Six" is now dead. So people who had been campaigning for that will be frustrated. Already the First Minster Nicola Sturgeon has said there is lots to welcome in this announcement but that it doesn't deliver everything she wanted. Saying it's disappointing that there is no Scottish Six - but "progress and hopefully sign of new thinking". Another SNP politician told me that the decision not to put a Scottish news hour on BBC One looks "entirely political". Saying that viewers accustomed to getting their news at tea time may not immediately develop the habit of watching a digital channel at 9pm. But for those who wanted a news programme reflecting the world from a Scottish perspective, produced and presented from Scotland - the BBC is now delivering what they asked for. The Scottish Six is dead. Long live the Scottish Nine.	The BBC is very experienced at broadcasting news to as many people as possible.
Lachie Stewart, 30, from Easter Ross, was thought to have been travelling to Delhi when he lost touch with his family earlier this month. However, a Facebook page set up as part of efforts to find him, said he had been found on Saturday. Mr Stewart had been working on a contract in Bhogpur in India before his disappearance. His family and friends had made contact with the Foreign Office after becoming increasingly concerned when he failed to make contact by his  birthday on Thursday. Details about his whereabouts have not been released.	A Scottish architect who had been reported missing in India is understood to have been found.
The Washington Post demanded impeachment, followed by a Senate trial. Time magazine, deeming it necessary to publish its first-ever editorial, thundered: "The president should resign." Outside the White House, protesters waved placards at passing motorists: "Honk for Impeachment." Even Washington's most influential columnist, Stewart Alsop, who was normally supportive of the president, called him an "ass." The president had lost his moral authority, argued his critics, and with it, his ability to govern. The country faced a constitutional crisis. The republic was imperilled. Such was the feverish reaction to the events of 20 October, 1973, a date remembered in the national memory as the "Saturday Night Massacre" - a pivotal moment in the unfolding Watergate controversy. With scandal engulfing the White House, Richard Nixon decided to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor appointed to investigate "all offenses arising out of the 1972 election â€¦ involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments". Nixon's Attorney General, Elliot Richardson, and his Deputy Attorney General, William Ruckelshaus, resigned rather than carry out the president's order. Eventually, the Solicitor General Robert Bork, who was third in command at the justice department, was prepared to fire Cox. The White House announced the news at 8:22pm that Saturday evening. Yesterday, almost as quickly as the news that he had been sacked as head of the FBI reached James Comey in Los Angeles, these two dramatic episodes were being described as historically analogous. The president had fired the lead figure in an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by members of his own team. The Nixonian parallels were obvious. Roger Stone, a Trump associate who also worked in 1972 for the notorious Committee to Re-elect the President, told the New York Times: "Somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling." The Nixon presidential library even trolled the White House on Twitter: "FUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonian." Democrats insinuated that Comey was fired for similar reasons to Cox, because he was closing in on the truth. There were other resemblances, too. In the lead-up to the Saturday Night Massacre, the Nixon White House was still reeling from the resignation of the president's chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, a central figure in the Watergate scandal, just as the Trump administration continues to be buffeted by the swirl of controversy surrounding the forced departure of General Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor. There's the suspicion now, as there was four decades ago, that an embattled White House has something to hide. So is this truly a re-run of the events of 1973? Is the past repeating itself? Even by the standards of the Nixon presidency, the autumn of 1973 was unusually chaotic. It saw the resignation of Vice-President Spiro Agnew because of fraud, tax evasion, bribery and extortion allegations. The Middle East was in the grip of the Yom Kippur war, a conflict between US-backed Israel and Arab forces armed by the Soviets that threatened to blow-up into a broader conflagration between Washington and Moscow. In Washington, Nixon was fighting a pitched battle with Archibald Cox and the courts. Cox, a Harvard professor who had been appointed as special prosecutor in May that year, had issued a subpoena ordering the White House to hand over nine tapes of phone calls and West Wing conversations in connection with the Watergate break-in. Nixon's legal team argued the principle of executive privilege should apply, and the tapes should remain private. On 12 October, however, the Court of Appeals in Washington upheld a lower court's ruling granting Cox's request. Rather than comply, Nixon decided to fire the special prosecutor, something his Attorney General Elliot Richardson had promised Congress would never happen. A president stood in defiance of the courts, putting himself above the law of the land. It was a textbook constitutional crisis. Donald Trump's sacking of his FBI director, while highly unusual and deeply controversial, is constitutionally permissible. No court orders have been flouted. The president, while breaking with the norm of allowing FBI directors to serve out their ten-year terms unimpeded, is not putting himself above the law. Trump's motivations may also be different. Nixon sacked Cox through fear his criminality was about to exposed. Within the FBI, agents believe that Trump sacked Comey primarily out of pique and spite because of his refusal to publicly exonerate Trump against allegations of collusion with the Kremlin, and also because Comey refused to back up Trump's unsubstantiated claims that Barack Obama ordered the wire-tapping of Trump Tower. Unlike the Saturday Night Massacre, the president is at one with the most high-ranking figures in the Justice Department rather than at odds with them. The president, the attorney general and the deputy attorney general together they made the case that Comey should go - not purportedly because of his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but because of the former director's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The politics is also very different. Back in 1973, the Democrats controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives. That put the investigative machinery of Congress in their hands. Senate hearings were already underway, and the Saturday Night Massacre gave them fresh impetus. Nixon also faced an acid shower of criticism from Republicans on Capitol Hill and around the country. "Clearly we face a constitutional crisis," lamented the Republican governor of Michigan. There have been Republican critics of Trump's decision to fire Comey. But so far they haven't been so vehement. Crucially, the Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell is resisting demands from the Democrats, and some in his own party, to back calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 2016 election. Politically, Donald Trump remains strong, because of the support of the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill and his grassroots supporters in the American heartland. Nixon, by contrast, was politically weak. This became apparent only a few days later when the White House indicated it would hand over the tapes, which included a recording of the infamous conversation between the president and Haldeman, eighteen and half minutes of which were missing. Nixon was also forced to appoint a new special prosecutor. And eventually, of course, the push for impeachment gathered unstoppable momentum, and he was forced to resign as president. In 1973, Democrats were hollering impeachment. In 2017, the party's congressional leadership has not publicly uttered that explosive word. What maybe similar between now and then is the intemperate mood of the president. As demonstrated by his Twitter tirades, Donald Trump is lashing out publicly against his critics, much as Nixon did privately in his final months in office. Politico is reporting that Trump shouted at the television over the Russian investigation, which again has echoes of Nixon's executive mansion tantrums. Curiously, both presidents also saw Florida as a bolt-hole from the pressures of Washington, Nixon opting for Key Biscayne, Trump regularly visiting Mar-A-Lago - although a key difference is that Nixon medicated himself with alcohol, while Trump is famously teetotal. But the Saturday Night Massacre and the Tuesday Night 'You're fired" are not directly comparable. The sacking of Archibald Cox contributed heavily to Nixon's forced departure from the White House. It was widely seen as an impeachable offence. The removal of James Comey, in and of itself, does not pose such an existential threat to the Trump administration.	The New York Times called for the president to leave office immediately, describing it as "the last great service" he could perform for the country.
What did the court say? Until now, those employing mobile workers who had to travel to get to or from their first or last appointment of the day were not required to count that time as work. On Thursday, the European Court of Justice judgement ruled those without a fixed or habitual office should consider the time they spend travelling between their homes and the premises of their first and last jobs as part of their hours for the day. The ruling relates to the Working Time Directive - the European initiative which caps the working week at 48 hours. In the UK, employees have the option of opting out of the directive. I'm a care worker who travels to different patients' homes. Am I affected? Possibly, yes. Employees who fall into the category loosely defined as "mobile workers" - those who habitually travel to different places of work - could be affected. Simon Bond, an employment specialist at Higgs and Sons solicitors, says the most obvious group to fall under this definition is carers not already paid for travelling to their first and last jobs. Sales people who travel between sites and employee workmen and women, such as plumbers or electricians, could also fall into this category. As many as 975,000 people in the UK could fall under the remit of the ruling, says Paul Sellers, a policy officer at the TUC. And some employees could be working an extra 10 hours a week once travelling time is counted, Chris Tutton, an employment lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, adds. I travel a lot for work, but I have a permanent office The ruling is less likely to affect people who work both in an office and remotely. If your contract includes a permanent base, you are unlikely to be able to successfully argue you are a mobile worker, Mr Sellers says. There may, however, be cases where it is possible to argue that a permanent base is meaningless because of the length of time spent outside the office. I have to commute two hours every day to my office For those with a permanent office (however lengthy your commute), this ruling will not have an effect. Mr Sellers says this final group is the "overwhelming majority" in the UK. I think I'm affected. Should I expect a pay rise or a change in my hours? The ruling could eventually affect pay. Unions say the ruling does not directly deal with remuneration, focussing instead on working hours and conditions. But it is possible the European judgement will be used in UK courts to challenge employers who pay an average hourly rate under the minimum wage (once travelling time is taken into account). That could mean employers facing increased wage bills and raises an outside chance costs for some services, such as cleaners who have to travel and are paid a low wage, could go up. It could also lead to a change in working patterns - especially for those who do not choose to opt out of the 48-hour maximum. "I think some employers will look at where they're sending staff - they might try to make sure that the first and last shifts are as close to home as possible because they don't want to eat into that working time that they have," Mr Tutton said. We have been contacted by BBC News website readers in response to the European judges' ruling. Here is a selection of their comments: This is great news for the likes of me and my engineers. We work in the telecoms industry visiting multiple sites daily. We don't get paid travel time but are expected to be onsite for 9am and leave the last site at 5pm wherever that may be. If the sites are two hours away from home this adds four hours to our day that we don't get paid for, so we do a 12-hour day for eight hours work. Steve Carroll, Manchester I am a sales rep. My hours of work are 35, working nine to five. I leave my house most days at 6am as I work on the M25 strip so it takes three to four hours to get to my first appointment. I might get home at 7pm with no lunch break. I can drive for seven hours total per day, that's before my day working. I feel fed up, very tired and underpaid. I don't know what my rights are! Erica, Cambridge I am a pest control technician. My colleagues and I sometimes end up doing 11 or 12-hour days. These lost hours travelling can take its toll on missed family time. The amount of time driving both during the working day and the travelling time to and from work can sometimes be as much as six hours a day depending on where our jobs take us. Paul Godfrey, Swindon I currently leave for work - as a service engineer - earlier than my first job to ensure I'm at my first site by 10am. It's wrong that I should use my time as the further away it is the more my own time is used. We also do not have a structured break time and I've worked over 11 hours without a break and it's a constant driving service job. Barry Corbett, Glasgow I am a mobile gas fitter and I am expected to travel to my first appointment and from my last appointment in my own time which can add 10 hours to my working week. Mark Hannon, Castleford I'm a gas repair engineer. We have no offices. Our policy is to be on the patch of work or at our "pickup" point by 8am. With heavy traffic I leave home at 7.20am. This leaves me with 40 minutes of extra travel time. Also I could be working miles away from home at the end of day resulting in a huge variance of time out. Daniel Richards-Smith, Dorset I am a homecare worker, taking care of people in their own home. I do not get paid for travelling to work or in between appointments. Sometimes I can travel up to 50 miles a day. We get paid 30p per hour of care delivered in a day. This is not petrol money as the carers who walk between calls also get paid this. Sometimes we have to sit in our cars because it is too early to go in to the client, anywhere from 10 minutes to up to and hour as we often are too far away from home to make it feasible to travel home. Susan Turnbull, Barnsley I'm a healthcare assistant and while I agree with being paid for time it takes to travel I can also see this as having a knock on affect to the clients as the money to pay us would have to come from somewhere. Susan Bird, Kent	Time spent travelling to and from first and last jobs by workers who do not have a fixed office should be regarded as work, European judges have ruled.
The partially-dismembered body of David Miller, 56, was found at his flat in Patterdale Walk in Boothville, Northampton, on 14 June 2016. He had been stabbed multiple times and "crude attempts" were made to destroy his body, a court heard. Ian Cuthbertson, 49, Michael Hallett, 37, Joseph Catlin, 30, and Zena Kane, 35, of no fixed address, deny murder. At the start of their trial, Northampton Crown Court heard police officers had forced entry into the flat and found Mr Miller's remains in the bedroom. Several items were found at the property including knives, scissors and a rolling pin which had been used as weapons during the attack on 10 June, and an angle grinder which had been borrowed to try and destroy the body. A post-mortem examination found he had substantial facial injuries and had been stabbed fifteen times in the back and in the chest. Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said that Mr Catlin had been living with Mr Miller in the two months before his death and that the pair had known each other for years. The court heard that Mr Miller was "well known and well liked" in the area but had long-standing issues with drink. Mr Joyce said the four defendants were part of the "Northampton street drinking fraternity". "They lived chaotic lives with long periods of homelessness and regularly used Mr Miller's flat as a place to drink, " he said. "These four defendants all took part in the murder of a vulnerable man in his own home and then spent days trying to cover up what they had done," he added. The trial, expected to last for four weeks, continues.	A jury has heard how a "vulnerable" man died after a "sustained attack" with knives and scissors in his own home.
It follows the arrest of an former ombudsman investigator over an alleged theft of sensitive security documents. It is understood the documents contained information the police and security service MI5 believe could put the lives of individuals at risk. The PFNI said it was an "astounding and very worrying state of affairs". A 69-year-old man was arrested in Dartford, Kent, on Sunday after detectives from the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch conducted a joint search with local police. It is understood he retired from the ombudsman's office a number of years ago and that the documents do not refer to any case currently being investigated by it. Mark Lindsay, chair of the federation, said there had to be an element of fairness for police officers under investigation. "They need the same protections that a normal member of society would have and that doesn't exist at the moment with the ombudsman's office," he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. "There is a real role for the Police Ombudsman's office, but that office has to hold the confidence of police officers." The police have begun a criminal investigation into the issue and have also suspended the release of any further sensitive material to the ombudsman's office until a review of security protocols is carried out. The Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott said the ombudsman's office had serious questions to answer. "When there's alleged wrongdoing, the PSNI should be called in at an earlier stage to investigate these matters so that they can be independently investigated," Mr Elliott told the BBC. "There is a failure and a gap there that needs to be resolved." In a statement to the BBC, a spokesman for the ombudsman confirmed he was alerted by police last week about the theft of sensitive material originating from the office. The office of the Police Ombudsman said it was anticipated that this suspension of the sharing of sensitive material "will be temporary."	The Police Federation of Northern Ireland (PFNI) has called for a "full inquiry" into the operation of the police ombudsman.
Mrs Merkel said she wanted friendly relations with both countries as well as Russia but Europe now had to "fight for its own destiny". Her comments come after Mr Trump refused to re-commit to the 2015 Paris climate deal at the G7 summit. Mrs Merkel is on the campaign trail ahead of elections in September. "The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I've experienced that in the last few days," Mrs Merkel told a crowd at an election rally in Munich, southern Germany. The relationship between Berlin and new French President Emmanuel Macron had to be a priority, Mrs Merkel said, adding: "We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands." On Saturday, the German leader had described climate change talks at the G7 group of rich nations as "very unsatisfactory". Leaders from the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan had re-affirmed their support for the Paris accord - but Mr Trump said he would make a decision in the coming week. Mr Trump has previously pledged to abandon the Paris deal, and expressed doubts about climate change. Speaking in Brussels last week, Mr Trump also told Nato members to spend more money on defence and did not re-state his administration's commitment to Nato's mutual security guarantees. Mrs Merkel's latest comments are partly a move to appeal to German voters first and foremost, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Polls suggest Mrs Merkel is on course to be re-elected for a fourth term as German chancellor at elections in September. It might have been thanks to the beer, pretzels and Bavarian brass-band enlivening the crowd. But Mrs Merkel's words were uncharacteristically passionate and unusually forthright. By all means keep friendly relations with Trump's America and Brexit Britain, was the message - but we can't rely on them. Rapturous applause greeted her fiery calls for Europeans to fight for their own destiny. No wonder she's sounding confident. France has a new president who shares her pro free-trade, Europhile values, so there is a positive feeling in Europe that the EU's Franco-German motor is back in business. With four months to go before elections, Angela Merkel's position also looks stronger than ever domestically. Initial enthusiasm for her centre-left rival Martin Schulz has fizzled out. And Sunday's beer-tent event underscored her strength by marking an end to a potential split with her Bavarian sister conservative party. She might not have welcomed Brexit or Trump. But it seems that Mrs Merkel has decided that standing up for the EU will only strengthen her chances of winning another term in September.	Europe can no longer "completely depend" on the US and UK following the election of President Trump and Brexit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel says.
The West Indian Carnival in Leeds was launched in 1967 and once again will take over Potternewton Park for the August bank holiday weekend. An exhibition recording its heritage, political and cultural legacy is planned for the city's Tetley gallery. There will also be a week of new plays commemorating carnival at West Yorkshire Playhouse. Live updates and more from Yorkshire Additionally, it has been announced that an illuminated night carnival will kick-off the annual arts and light festival Light Night in October. A recreation of the Sun Goddess, the first Leeds Carnival Queen costume, will be featured at the exhibition from August to October. The celebration of food, music and culture will culminate again in a parade through Chapeltown and Harehills. An estimated 160,000 revellers attended last year's carnival, organisers said. Arthur France initiated it after becoming homesick for his native St Kitts and Nevis. Mr France, head of the organising committee, said: "When you come to carnival it is electric, so many things going on, beautiful costumes, beautiful colours, beautiful music." However, attempts to bring the parade into the city centre have been shelved. Mr France said he was "very sad and upset" at the council decision but added that it would not "dampen my spirits". Councillor Judith Blake, leader of Leeds City Council, said: "A lot of events are happening on the bank holiday weekend and with the advice it just wouldn't be possible." Ms Blake added: "The oldest carnival in Europe is here in Leeds. We are so keen to make sure as a city we come together and everyone celebrates an incredible achievement." She praised Mr France as a "legend" that had made "an absolutely fantastic contribution heading up a brilliant team of people".	Plans have been announced for the "oldest carnival in Europe" to celebrate its 50th anniversary.
Ahead of talks with his US counterpart James Mattis, Sir Michael said too few of the 28 members were meeting Nato's annual 2% defence spending target and countries needed to "raise their game". The Trump administration has said other countries must bear more of the cost. Sir Michael said UK spending was rising but the armed forces must continue to ensure they were "fit for purpose". Gen Mattis said Britain was an example to other states and its "global leadership is needed today as much as at any time in history". The Times has reported that the Ministry of Defence is facing a Â£10bn budget shortfall in the next decade, suggesting this could lead to further cuts in personnel. At the moment, only five of the 28 Nato members - including the US and the UK - spend 2% of their annual income on defence. The White House has warned that the US could "moderate" its commitment to the 70-year-old defence partnership if other countries don't commit more resources. Sir Michael, who is holding talks with the retired Marine Corps general, said the US had always been the financial mainstay of Nato and no-one wanted to see it retreat from this. He said the UK had always met the 2% target but too many others did not and this was no longer acceptable. "There are five members of Nato who don't even spend 1% and I will be working with Jim Mattis on persuading them that they have to raise their game," he said. "We want other countries to shoulder a fairer share. For instance, getting them to commit to annual increases, and putting the 2% target into their policy documents." He suggested that publishing a table every year of the progress countries were making towards the 2% target would "shame the others into increasing their defence spending." Speaking at a joint press conference in Lancaster House, Sir Michael said Nato was the cornerstone of Western security but needed to be "fitter and faster". Gen Mattis said the two countries were on an "equal footing" in terms of confronting the threat from terrorism, standing together as "bulwarks against maniacs who think by hurting us they can scare us". Their "special relationship", he argued, was "not a historical artefact but a source of strength today for our two nations". The two are discussing measures to modernise Nato, including streamlining command structures, as well as progress on a series of joint equipment projects including the F-35 Lightning joint strike fighter. Sir Michael announced Â£90m investment at RAF Marham in Norfolk to support Britain's consignment of the new aircraft. But the defence secretary is facing questions about the UK's own future capability amid reports that financial pressures could result in cuts to personnel, including to the Royal Marines. The defence secretary said the UK had the fifth largest defence budget in the world and the government was committed to increase defence spending ever year up to 2020, including building many new warships. But he said the armed forces were not immune from having to become more efficient and to adapt to changes in what was being asked of them. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that the "balance" of resources within the Royal Navy was a matter for the First Sea Lord. "What I am saying to you is we have 7,000 Royal Marines... and I have not agreed any cut in the size of the Royal Marines," he said. He added: "What we are looking at is the way in which our armed forces work, the different tasks that they have and we are constantly looking to see that they are fit for purpose in what we do. "So if something is no longer needed, if it's redundant, we need to make sure that we can put the savings back into new equipment. "That applies to buildings, it also applies to the way we work and the efficiencies we need." But Labour said "mistakes and poor decisions" since 2010 were now coming home to roost and ministers must be clear about where future savings would come from. "Further cuts of Â£1bn each year, to make up for this mis-management of the defence budget, will do yet more severe damage to our Armed Forces," said shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith. "Reports that the Royal Marines could be cut are particularly concerning...The defence secretary kept referring to investment in equipment but he needs to be investing in our forces personnel to ensure that professional standards remain high."	Nato members will be "shamed" into spending more on the alliance, defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said.
Barnsley's Ryan Kent almost caught keeper Chris Maxwell out at the near post with an inswinging corner. Striker Jordan Hugill pulled Preston's best first-half effort just wide from a tight angle from Paul Gallagher's pass. Tom Bradshaw had an effort blocked on the line for Barnsley and Adam Davies clawed away Hugill's header in added time to deny Preston a winner. Barnsley dropped a place to ninth, but only four points behind Sheffield Wednesday in sixth, while Simon Grayson's Preston also slipped one to 11th, three points further back. The home side gave a debut to loan signing Callum Elder at left-back, with Alex Mowatt suspended after being sent off against Wolves, while Preston recalled 6ft 6in Simon Makienok to spearhead their attack. An early header apart, Makienok was well marshalled by Marc Roberts and Angus MacDonald, and was eventually replaced by Jermaine Beckford. Bradshaw was denied by a defender on the line after sliding in to meet Kent's cross, but Davies pushing away Hugill's header as it flew towards the top corner was as close as either side came to breaking the deadlock thereafter in a game of few clear-cut opportunities. Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:  "I was pleased with how we coped with their threats but I didn't feel that we did enough to win the game. "There were not enough crosses into the box, not enough efforts on goal. "I said at half-time I was conscious that I didn't want Preston to grind us down, because the team they picked and the message from Simon (Grayson) at the start of the game was that he wanted a tougher, more aggressive performance. "I don't even speak about the top six. It is about winning the next game, so it has not even entered my head. Preston boss Simon Grayson: "There are plenty of games still to go and there will be so many twists and turns from now until the end of the season. "We have aspirations to try and get there (the play-offs), but obviously we will need to turn these draws into wins if we are going to make up the ground on teams that are up there already. "Neither team really had that cutting edge to go and break down two resilient defensive performances today. "These games just hinge on a little bit of magic from somebody, and from our point of view we never really had that little bit of quality. Match ends, Barnsley 0, Preston North End 0.

Pedro, 25, had been training with the Cumbrians and impressed in reserve games against Barrow and Burnley. The Angola-born wide-man has spent much of his career in the Dutch league with teams such as Feyenoord and Heracles, plus stints in Bulgaria and Romania. "We've seen enough to know that he adds something different to the group," said head of recruitment Lee Dykes. He told the club website: "This is a chance for him to show everyone what he can do."

7 July 2016 Last updated at 09:49 BST Speaking to Today programme presenter John Humphrys, he accepted that in retrospect it would have been better to challenge the intelligence used to justify the war, but stood by his decision to join the invasion.	Tony Blair says people will not accept that he means his regret over mistakes in the Iraq war until he disowns the decision to join the US coalition to topple Saddam Hussein.
Photos on the internet appear to show Diouf in a nightclub, just hours before the match at Southampton on 24 March. "I've made some inquiries and I've asked him about it and he denies he was there," Saunders told Radio Sheffield. "It's still ongoing and I want to get to the bottom of it. It's something I can't comprehend if it is true." Rovers lost the match at St Mary's 2-0, with Diouf playing the full game, and are currently six points adrift of safety with six matches to play. Diouf has scored six goals in 22 games since joining the club in October.	Doncaster Rovers boss Dean Saunders says the club are continuing to investigate claims that forward El-Hadji Diouf breached club discipline.
The 65-year-old was found dead in the garden of his gated home in South Weald in June 2015. Although Essex Police originally thought he died of natural causes, it emerged he had been shot six times. Police said they had questioned a man originally from Tyneside but currently living in southern Spain. The force says the man was not arrested but volunteered to be interviewed at a police station in the UK. The force did not specify which police station he was interviewed at. The interview took place on Saturday morning. An inquest into Palmer's death concluded he was unlawfully killed. Police have said his shooting had "all the hallmarks of a professional hit". Palmer, once described as Britain's richest criminal and thought to have been worth £300m, got his nickname after he was arrested on suspicion of melting down gold from the Brink's-Mat robbery, although he was never convicted. The robbery in 1983 took place at Heathrow Airport when £25m worth of gold was stolen. At the time it was the biggest robbery to have ever taken place in the UK. The former scrap metal dealer, from Olton, near Birmingham,  who was one of seven children, was said to have melted the metal down in the back garden of his mansion at Lansdown near Bath. However, he denied knowing it was stolen and was acquitted in 1987, blowing kisses to the jury from the dock when the verdict was delivered. Worth about £500m in today's prices, most of the gold has never been recovered and the case remains open. In 1997 Palmer was arrested in Tenerife, and returned to the UK to face charges related to a large-scale timeshare fraud. In May 2001 he was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay a record confiscation order of £33m.	A 50-year-old man has been questioned on suspicion of the murder of notorious criminal John "Goldfinger" Palmer, detectives have said.
Lawnmowers, a scarifier and a turfer were taken from the Lockerbie site some time between 09:00 on Thursday and the same time on Friday. Det Con Scott Barr said it appeared to have been a "targeted raid" with a vehicle needed to remove the property. He appealed for anyone who may have seen anything suspicious in the area to contact them as soon as possible.	Grass cutting equipment worth about £20,000 has been stolen from a south of Scotland bowling club.
It's an ambition voiced by many children. That is not surprising given that pretty much every one of them plays games on tablets, phones, consoles and PCs when they have a spare moment. It is certainly my son's goal. And like any dutiful parent, I'm keen to help him realise his ambition - or at least help him find out early on if it's not for him. I am also conscious that my lack of a formal technical background means that, at home, he'll struggle to get to grips with the core technical skill game making seems to demand - coding. This is a problem. What I know about the history of video games suggests many of those that made it in the industry started young. So, there was no better place to get answers about how to become a game maker than at Frontier Developments. The firm was founded by David Braben - the archetypal child programmer who, while still a teenager, co-wrote the legendary game Elite. The latest version of Elite was released late last year and Frontier is now almost fully occupied with maintaining and expanding the space trading and combat game. Frontier employs a lot of programmers, says Adam Woods, a producer on Elite, and it has a well-established career path for them all the way from graduate-entry through to head of technology. However, he says, there are plenty of other people at the firm that went via other routes. The studio's audio head, Jim Croft, started out as a musician and composer creating tunes for TV ads. Make Games. The best thing you could possibly do is start making games today. The reason I got my first job in the industry as a game designer was entirely down to the fact I was the only person who had his own finished video game to show off at interview. Not only did this demonstrate my ability, knowledge and experience far better than anything else I could show or say, but it shows an ability to finish what I start, and that I have a natural drive to develop video games. If you want to be a part of making games, make games today, and finish them. As many as you can. Show them to everyone you can and learn from everything you do wrong, which when you start off, will be almost everything. Nothing else you do is more important than this when it comes to succeeding as a game developer. Mr Woods knows his way around code but started out in QA - quality assurance - which involves playing Frontier games as they are being developed documenting bugs and crashes. "Now, as a producer, I help define the road map for the game for a set period of time - it could be for the next year or the next couple of weeks," he says. His job involves making sure the various teams at Frontier - coding, art, design, user interface, etc - are all on track to finish work on the next expansion or fix big bad bugs. "I break down the work that needs doing and get estimates about how long it is going to take," he says. "Towards delivery date I will chase bugs and make sure it all comes together." The producer role is just one of many that surrounds the programming heart of a game such as Elite Dangerous. Many of the people in those jobs are familiar with technology but coding is not essential to their day-to-day work. Frontier has product managers that help co-ordinate the overall direction of the game, community managers who handle player feedback, and lots of graphic designers who work on creating and animating all the bits that make up a modern title. That kind of diversity is to be expected in a sizeable studio such as Frontier, says Dr Jake Habgood, a former game-maker who now heads the software and games development degree course at Sheffield Hallam University. "If you have more than 150 people in a team you get roles that are very specialised," he says. For Dr Habgood, aspiring game makers would do well to grasp the difference between playing and creating. "One of the common misconceptions that people who to this have is that making and playing games is synonymous," he says. However, he adds, experts make what they do look easy while hiding what it took to master a skill. A game that is easy and fun to play would not necessarily have been as much fun, or as easy, to code and create. For Dr Habgood, coding is the key skill to master for any aspiring game maker and the Sheffield course emphasises hands-on programming skills. For youngsters, such as my 11-year-old, getting to grips with proper programming might be formidable but there were plenty of other ways to get a taste of game making without having to learn C++ or grapple with a command line. Tools including Scratch, Kodu from Microsoft, Game Maker by YoYo and even Unreal Engine 4 make it more straight-forward to make games. The most basic of these involves snapping virtual coding blocks together and even the more advanced ones, such as Unreal, conceal a lot of the in-depth coding. That hands-on experience is key to understand the game-making process, says Dr Habgood, for no other reason than it will bestow an understanding of what is special about the craft. "If you can find the creativity in programming and games you may see how compelling it can be," he explains. Creative breakthroughs aside, seeing a game through to completion is quite an achievement for anyone at any age. It involves real work and exposes one other truth about the industry. "It's very competitive and you have to be prepared to work hard and put a lot of hours in," he says. "If you don't, you won't make it." "It's you that matters, not the degree," he adds. "The degree will help but if you are not committed it will not help you get into the industry."	"I want to make games when I grow up."
Complaints have been made across the UK about the fad, which sees people dress up in order to frighten passers-by. Dyfed-Powys Police received about 30 reports over the weekend and North Wales Police said it was aware of incidents. Gwent Police had 18 reports, including clowns "peering through windows". South Wales Police put out a warning at the weekend after receiving complaints about people dressed as clowns "frightening others intentionally". Chf Insp Paul Staniforth of Gwent Police said: "Some of the reports have included, clowns running through gardens and peering through windows, lurking around shopping centres, parks and schools and jumping from trees. "Fortunately, to date, we've had no reports of anyone being harmed during these reports." He said people could be arrested for a public order offence - causing harassment, alarm or distress. The culprits are said to be following a trend that started in the US. Sgt Rhys Williams of Dyfed-Powys Police said while dressing up was not a criminal offence, "deliberately scaring someone, causing harassment, alarm or distress could lead to arrest". Officers were looking into some of the reports, but no arrests have been made. Sgt Williams added: "Please be mindful that what seems like a bit of fun to you, could not be seen the same way by those on the receiving end of this prank. "There is also the possibility that you could attempt to scare the wrong person and they could retaliate. "Anyone who commits a criminal offence should be aware that dressing as a clown does not make them exempt from being investigated and dealt with through the Criminal Justice System." North Wales Police said officers were aware of incidents, but no offences had been reported.	Sightings of "creepy clowns" have been reported across Wales, with police warning people they could be arrested for scaring others.
A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it "will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review". Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value). Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%). Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.	Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU.
Generations of James Bond fans have cheered 007 as he shoots and sleeps his way through a world of sinister villains and exotic women. The image is hi-tech, violent, romantic and more than a little cynical. It's a world-beating brand, but one today's spymasters are doing their best to keep at arm's length. And so, for the first time, MI6, officially known as the Secret Intelligence Service, is taking on the Bond image on 007's home turf - the silver screen. On Monday, MI6 launches its first ever cinema advert, aimed at attracting different types of candidate. A young woman of ethnically indeterminate background is shown demonstrating people skills and emotional intelligence in a range of everyday situations. This woman, we're told, does not work for MI6. "But she could," the advert concludes. Steely-eyed, white male killers, it seems, need not apply. "There is a perception out there that we want [Bond actor] Daniel Craig, or Daniel Craig on steroids," the SIS' current head of recruitment told the Guardian. "He would not get into MI6," says the recruitment chief, identified only as Sarah. Recruiters have long worried about the pervasiveness of the image first portrayed in the pages of Ian Fleming's novels and then seared into public consciousness via the biggest movie franchise of all time. The aim of the advert is to wean the public off this grotesquely misleading stereotype. According to the accompanying press release, the advert aims "to attract people who rule themselves out of a career in MI6 based on their misconceptions about the agency." It sounds like a long shot, but those behind it seem optimistic. "The whole point," Sarah says, "is about getting people who would never, ever think of joining." "People tend to deselect themselves," adds Mark, head of HR. "We want to prevent that. We want the service to be representative, but also to draw in the capabilities of the workforce at large." It's part of a continuing drive to recruit from the widest, most diverse cross-section of society, with a particular focus on women and ethnic minorities, both still under represented in the service. Another aspect of new effort sees a return of the old "tap on the shoulder" method employed for decades, mostly in the cloisters of Oxford and Cambridge universities. But if the method will be the same, the locations will be different. "Diverse organisations," is how Mark puts it, without elaborating. Some say that the agency's elite image may be punctured by the revelation that a 2:2 degree will make you eligible. Mark says work experience in other sectors is sometimes just as important as a good degree. Other recruiting tactics display a little playfully appropriate subterfuge to seek out those with interpersonal skills and the ability to influence people. Unbranded fliers invite you to click on goodwithpeople.uk and take a series of tests. Only those who succeed in the online games find out that they have what it takes for a life in the intelligence services. This correspondent scored well on the "emotion detector", but not so well on the "human polygraph". And when it came to the "mind changer," I failed a text message exercise designed to persuade a friend to attend a surprise party. I have not been invited to join MI6. The advert will run for a month, in cinemas in London, the West Midlands and north west England, partly reflecting the sort of urban areas recruiters look to but also the fact that MI6 can't afford a nationwide release. And will it be shown in cinemas where Bond or similar spy capers are showing? Emphatically not.	Cinemagoers may think they already know what it takes to be a spy.
Barry McGivern, Scott Fryer and Troy Lacey were travelling to work at Dereham along the A47 Acle Straight, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. They jumped into cold chest-high water to free the man from the crushed car and helped to resuscitate him. Mr Lacey, 23, said: "I'm just glad we could give him a fighting chance to see his family again." The victim is in a stable but critical condition at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, police said. The men stopped when they saw what they thought was a broken-down car and some people running along the road at about 21:00 BST on Saturday. A blaring horn then alerted them to a car upside down in a dyke where they could see a man struggling inside, said Mr Fryer. The unnamed victim, believed to be in his 40s, was trapped by his seatbelt in the crushed car and had his head in water. Mr McGivern, 28, of Great Yarmouth, said he was the first to enter the "freezing cold" water which was chest-high. Mr Lacey, from Martham, said their experience as security staff helped them to keep calm and they had freed the victim as a paramedic arrived. "The car was that crushed that at one point I didn't think we would get him out, but I managed to get under his legs and get them free and Barry snapped the seatbelt," he said. "His pulse was slow so I pumped his chest a few times." Mr Fryer, also 28, a retained fire-fighter at Gorleston, then gave the victim the kiss-of-life. "I'm just pleased we were there and we could help a fellow human being who was dying in front of us," said Mr Lacey.	Three nightclub doormen have told how they helped rescue a man trapped in an upturned car in a water-filled ditch.
The Tinbergen Building, which houses the departments of zoology and experimental psychology, will be closed from Monday. A university spokesman said it was not believed there was a health risk to regular users of the building. He said asbestos was found last year, but it was not in "accessible" areas. A total of 750 staff are based in the building and it is used by 900 students. A statement said: "We do not believe there is, or has been, a health risk to regular users of the building, and more than 200 air quality readings, taken since September 2016, support this belief. "But this asbestos cannot be removed while the building is occupied, so we have decided to close the building while expert contractors carry out remedial works. "We apologise to staff and students for the inconvenience that this unprecedented situation will cause, and we will do all we can to support them so that research and teaching can continue." Prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibres can cause illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis.	About 1,650 staff and students will have to move out of an Oxford University building for up to two years after asbestos was discovered.
The report was commissioned by Stormont's Department for Social Development (DSD) and the Department of the Environment (DoE). DSD had proposed an "affordable housing contribution" would apply to all developments of five homes or more. Similar schemes operate in the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The departments commissioned the research from Heriot Watt University and Three Dragons Consultancy. It concluded that introducing a scheme "with a single percentage of affordable housing across Northern Ireland will not work given current market conditions". It added that a scheme could be considered for greater Belfast but that "timing, percentage target and form of provision is best left to local decision makers". That suggests that it would be decision for councils on whether to implement a scheme. Social Development Minister Lord Morrow said: "This research report will make a valuable contribution to our evidence base on this issue. "My department, along with the Department of the Environment, will now reflect on the findings and recommendations detailed in the report."	A scheme to compel private developers to contribute towards building social housing is "not realistic" for most of Northern Ireland, a report has found.
The star wore a Gary Barlow mask as he began playing Could It Be Magic on a piano at Cabot Circus shopping centre. Shoppers watching the mystery performer were astonished when he revealed his true identity and sang the hit song. The 45-year-old entertainer is known for surprising fans - in 2015 he "crashed" a number of weddings. Hundreds of people had soon gathered to watch the former X Factor judge at the city centre mall, with many posting videos and photographs of the performance on social media. As news of the concert spread, people around the UK tweeted the star to ask him to attend weddings, birthday parties - and other shopping centres. In 2015, Barlow promised to sing at the weddings of three fans - but went on to sing at more. Among them was Natalie Purkis, who was stunned when the star turned up at her wedding reception in Oxfordshire at the request of her husband Martin. Barlow later tweeted: "I'll look back fondly at 2015 as the year of the wedding crasher!"	Take That star Gary Barlow surprised shoppers in Bristol with an impromptu concert - which started with him wearing a disguise... as himself.
Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - "Hell, no" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. "She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. "And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' "And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the "conflict of the human soul" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a "fuzzy-cheeked young preacher" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. "The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book," the Rev Butts told me. "The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. "Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice." But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. "Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old," the Rev Butts says. "She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity."	It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.
The typical home in the East increased in cost by 8.3% in the year to the end of July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Prices in London, which saw big rises last year, rose by 5.5%, slightly lower than the average in England of 5.6%. Overall, UK house prices increased by 5.2% in the year to the end of July. The other area to see significant price growth was Northern Ireland, up 7.4%. Property values in Northern Ireland are recovering from a massive fall during the financial crisis, and remain 42% below the peak of August 2007, the ONS figures show, Prices rose by 6.7% in the South East of England, the ONS figures show, although here - as in the East and in seven other regions - the pace of price rises has slowed. Analysts suggest that the time of double-digit price rises in London is over for now. "There is very much a ripple effect - the action has moved out from prime central London to the outskirts and those commuter areas where there is better value to be had, although not as much if prices continue to rise as they have been," said Jonathan Adams, director of central London estate agency Napier Watt. The 5.2% average price increase in the UK was down from the 5.7% rate recorded in the previous month. Prices in Scotland fell by 1.3% and were 0.7% lower in the North East of England. Excluding London and the South East of England, UK house prices increased by 4.4%. The average home cost £295,000 in England, £173,000 in Wales, £154,000 in Northern Ireland and £196,000 in Scotland. In England, the highest average price was paid in London (£525,000) and the lowest in the North East (£156,000). The average price paid in the UK was £282,000, and analysts expect this to continue to rise, not least as a result of a lack of properties in the market. Writing in the Guardian, Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst for Savills, said that the cost of buying a property, rather than the cost of owning it, is the biggest barrier to people buying their first home. That is because a large amount is needed for a deposit, while mortgage costs are well below the norm. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the number of homeowners remortgaging - in order to take advantage of low rates - rose by 26% in July compared with the same month a year earlier.	House prices are rising fastest in the East of England, official figures show, as analysts suggest property market "action" has moved out of London.
Kent County Council said the continuing flow of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children (UASC) from across the English Channel had left it with no choice. The authority currently has 924 such children in its care, compared with nearly 630 at the start of last August. Councillor Peter Oakford said it was "not a position we want to be in". The cabinet member for specialist children's services said Kent County Council had seen a 30% rise in looked-after children in the past seven months. Other authorities elsewhere in the UK have accepted full responsibility for 56 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Mr Oakford told the children's social care and health cabinet committee: "This has affected our ability to place citizen children within Kent ourselves. "We have had to place Kent children outside of Kent due to the influx of UASC, which is not a good position to be in and is not a position we want to be in. "It's actually costing us more financially because we have had to place, I think, six children into residential care either short-term or longer term, which is far more expensive than normal foster care." The council's services have been stretched since the start of the migrant crisis last summer as Kent is the closest British county to Calais and Dunkirk. The number of child asylum seekers coming into its care has slowed to about 15 a week during the winter, but Mr Oakford said if that increased with the arrival of the warmer months the authority would be "in significant difficulties".	Vulnerable children are being placed in care outside their home county of Kent due to the influx of child asylum seekers, according to council chiefs.
New research suggests the Cornish Black honey bee is better at dealing with varroa mites, which carry a strain of a disease called deformed wing virus. The virus has killed vast numbers of the world's bees. Scientists at Paignton Zoo are researching how the breed has survived the mite. The zoo hopes its findings will help protect colonies and encourage more bee keepers to take on the Cornish breed. Colonies of the bees have been moved to the zoo to monitor their health over the summer. The mites act as tiny incubators of one deadly form of the disease, and inject it directly into the bees' blood. Michael Bungard from the zoo said: "It's important that zoos look in our own backyard. "Our bee project is predominantly education, so we can get the message across about the Cornish black bees and the varroa mite."	A rare Cornish bee species could save dwindling populations from a disease that has wiped out millions of colonies worldwide, scientists have said.
Smith, 34, lost WBO title bouts with Arthur Abraham in 2014 and 2015, and trainer Joe Gallagher said Saturday's fight was a "last roll of the dice". The Briton has now been beaten seven times in his 45 professional fights. The three judges in Wetzlar, Germany, each ruled the fight 119-108 in Zeuge's favour. It was Zeuge's third defence since he won the WBA title from Italian Gioavanni de Carolis in November 2016. In a largely one-sided contest, Smith was given a count by the referee in the closing seconds of the final round despite appearing to slip. "Is it the end at world level for him? 100%. Is there another level he wants to compete at? That is one for Paul Smith," promoter Eddie Hearn said on Sky Sports. "We talked about last-chance saloon before the fight, he left it much too late. I think he will be kicking himself for that. "He had a good spell in the third round when he wobbled Zeuge, and he did in the 11th and 12th rounds too. We would have liked to see that earlier, but it's easy for us to say. Zeuge was very good and countered well."	Paul Smith lost a third attempt to win a world title as Tyron Zeuge retained his WBA world super-middleweight belt with a unanimous points decision.
Andrew Virco, 50, and Katharine Walker, 51, from Cambridge, died with two other Britons when the aircraft crashed into a glacier on South Island, on Saturday. Ms Walker's daughter, Rebecca, 22, said the couple were on a "big adventure" that had been planned for some time. "They do holidays but this was the big one... they had waited for," she said. "New Zealand was her dream. Her and Andy had been planning it for a long time. It was what they would do for their 50th birthdays. "It was their celebration together." Ms Walker was head of radiotherapy at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Her daughter, a university student, said: "She was everything. She had a special spin on life. She worked hard and she played hard. That's the way she lived her life. "She affected so many people in so many good ways. The things she did at work were incredible. "You just walked through town and everybody would be like 'hi, hi'. I couldn't go shopping without her seeing someone she knew. Cambridge is a big place but she affected so many people. "Not having her here is just going to break so many people. It hasn't sunk in yet." She described Mr Virco, an award-winning photographer, as "amazing". "He took me into his world," she said. "He treated me like his daughter and you can't say much more than that. He's going to be missed." Nigel and Helen Charlton, aged 66 and 70, from Hampshire, also died in the crash, along with Sovannmony Leang, 27, and Josephine Gibson, 29, both from New South Wales, Australia; and pilot Mitchell Gameren, 28, from Queenstown, New Zealand. The recovery operation has been halted for the day after weather conditions at Fox Glacier deteriorated. Three bodies have been recovered. The cause of the crash is being investigated.	A couple who died in a helicopter crash in New Zealand were on a "dream" holiday to celebrate their 50th birthdays, their family has said.
A recent programme in Algeria earned fierce criticism for fooling a renowned communist novelist into believing he had been arrested for "atheism and espionage". During the segment, 75-year-old Rachid Boudjedra was forced by fake police officers to repeat the Islamic proclamation "God is Greatest" and utter the two Islamic testimonies of faith. The programme, called We Got You was later suspended amid a wave of criticism from civil society. TV has become an important part of the Islamic holy month, and broadcasters will often commission special programmes to draw audiences in as they break their fast in the evening. Prank TV shows have risen in popularity, but have also earned criticism in recent years for taking things too far. Egyptian actor Ramez Galal has established himself as a major TV prankster, with a series of programmes featuring celebrities in increasingly extreme scenarios. In one edition, he fooled celebrities into believing they were on a sinking ship, surrounded by floating body parts and an approaching shark. In another, victims were locked inside a supposed ancient Egyptian tomb containing bats, insects and a mummy rising from the dead. In 2013 during a programme entitled Ramez, the Fox of the Desert, guest celebrities were fooled into believing the bus they were travelling on had been intercepted by militants. The mock militants pretended to shoot the driver dead and then blindfolded and handcuffed the guests. This was aired at a time when Egypt was witnessing a surge in terror attacks, particularly in the region of Sinai, where military convoys were often attacked by armed bandits in desolate areas. Galal revels in the controversy. In a trailer for his show, he admits to "torturing his friends and fellow actors because he loves them". And it may be that only the audience is being fooled. Sharp-eyed viewers often find clues signalling that the guests are in on the prank. Some celebrities have confirmed that this was the case. Tunisia's The Earthquake is another controversial programme which fools guests into believing they are experiencing a violent tremor. In one episode, an elderly religious leader insisted on continuing to pray despite the ongoing quake. The show was widely criticised on social media for disregarding the age and health conditions of the guests, who seemed genuinely scared. Similar charges were levelled at Algeria's We Got You. Following the episode featuring Mr Boudjedra, one Algerian novelist said it was "unbelievable that a famous writer was ridiculously pranked with no regards to his age or fame". Religious bodies in the region have recently issued fatwas (religious edicts) asserting that terrorising people for any purpose is religiously forbidden. The shows are also criticised, like the slew of entertainment programmes aired during Ramadan, for being a distraction from spiritual dedication during the holy month. Egyptian media expert Yasser Abd-al-Aziz told the BBC that the prevalence of TV pranks has forced production companies to push the boundaries of good taste in order to attract audience and advertising revenue. But one popular show entitled The Shock appears to buck this trend, with more traditional pranks, rather than terrifying ordeals. The show is filmed in a number of Arab countries, capturing reactions to staged situations such as a man violently scolding his wife, a student insulting his teacher or a child standing helpless in the cold weather asking passers-by for a coat. It has won over audiences across the the region by exploring how strangers interact in dramatic but everyday situations. As Twitter user @Nooruldeen89 put it: "Despite the acts being staged, The Shock awakens the human in you and makes you rethink your perspective."

From shipwrecks to terror attacks to an air disaster involving Paris Hilton, it seems that almost nothing is off-limits for the prank shows that have become a staple of North African TV during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
They argue that the total volume of water in aquifers underground is 100 times the amount found on the surface. The team have produced the most detailed map yet of the scale and potential of this hidden resource. Writing in the journal Environmental Research Letters , they stress that large scale drilling might not be the best way of increasing water supplies. Across Africa more than 300 million people are said not to have access to safe drinking water. Demand for water is set to grow markedly in coming decades due to population growth and the need for irrigation to grow crops. Freshwater rivers and lakes are subject to seasonal floods and droughts that can limit their availability for people and for agriculture. At present only 5% of arable land is irrigated. When water falls as rain or snow, much of it either flows into rivers or is used to provide moisture to plants and crops. What is left over trickles down to the layers of rock that sit beneath the soil. And just like a giant sponge, this ground water is held in the spaces between the rocks and in the tiny inter-connected spaces between individual grains in a rock like sandstone. These bodies of wet rock are referred to as aquifers. Ground water does not sit still in the aquifer but is pushed and pulled by gravity and the weight of water above it. The movement of the water through the aquifer removes many impurities and it is often cleaner than water on the surface. Now scientists have for the first time been able to carry out a continent-wide analysis of the water that is hidden under the surface in aquifers. Researchers from the British Geological Survey and University College London (UCL)             have mapped in detail the amount and potential yield  of this groundwater resource across the continent. Helen Bonsor from the BGS is one of the authors of the paper. She says that up until now groundwater was out of sight and out of mind. She hopes the new maps will open people's eyes to the potential. "Where there's greatest ground water storage is in northern Africa, in the large sedimentary basins, in Libya, Algeria and Chad," she said. "The amount of storage in those basins is equivalent to 75m thickness of water across that area - it's a huge amount." Due to changes in climate that have turned the Sahara into a desert over centuries many of the aquifers underneath were last filled with water over 5,000 years ago. The scientists collated their information from existing hydro-geological maps from national governments as well as 283 aquifer studies. The researchers say their new maps indicate that many countries currently designated as "water scarce" have substantial groundwater reserves. However, the scientists are cautious about the best way of accessing these hidden resources. They suggest that widespread drilling of large boreholes might not work. Dr Alan MacDonald of the BGS, lead author of the study, told the BBC: "High-yielding boreholes should not be developed without a thorough understanding of the local groundwater conditions. "Appropriately sited and developed boreholes for low yielding rural water supply and hand pumps are likely to be successful." With many aquifers not being filled due to a lack of rain, the scientists are worried that large-scale borehole developments could rapidly deplete the resource. According to Helen Bonsor, sometimes the slower means of extraction can be more efficient. "Much lower storage aquifers are present across much of sub-Saharan Africa," she explained. "However, our work shows that with careful exploring and construction, there is sufficient groundwater under Africa to support low yielding water supplies for drinking and community irrigation." The scientists say that there are sufficient reserves to be able to cope with the vagaries of climate change. "Even in the lowest storage aquifers in semi arid areas with currently very little rainfall, ground water is indicated to have a residence time in the ground of 20 to 70 years." Dr Bonsor said. "So at present extraction rates for drinking and small scale irrigation for agriculture groundwater will provide and will continue to provide a buffer to climate variability." The publication of the new map was welcomed by the UK's secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell. "This is an important discovery," he said. "This research, which the British Government has funded, could have a profound effect on some of the world's poorest people, helping them become less vulnerable to drought and to adapt to the impact of climate change."	Scientists say the notoriously dry continent of Africa is sitting on a vast reservoir of groundwater.
Greater Manchester Police spoke to the 42-year-old in Failsworth on Saturday after an abandoned 999 call. The woman had minor facial injuries and a 57-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault. Police later returned to the property in Oldham Road to take a statement from the woman but found her dead. A post-mortem examination found that the cause of death was "not suspicious", a Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said. A mandatory referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was made because police had been in touch with the woman prior to her death. Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said: "First and foremost I would like to express our most sincere condolences to the woman's family for their tragic loss. "In line with our usual policy when an incident such as this occurs, we have made referral to the IPCC and we await their decision on whether or not they wish to investigate." He added: "In the meantime, we are continuing to investigating the circumstances surrounding the initial call that was made to police which prompted officers to attend and arrest a 57-year-old man on suspicion of assault."	A police force has referred itself to the watchdog over the death of a woman hours after she spoke to officers about an alleged assault.
Media playback is not supported on this device The 18-year-old, who is from Blackwood, took home gold at Saturday's German Open in Hamburg, Germany. Williams performend well and won the -67kg division taking an impressive 112 points from just four fights. "At the Euros nobody really expected me to medal. I just tried my best but now there's added pressure to perform," Williams told BBC Wales Sport. "The German Open was vital for me as I needed points to go to the Grand Prix. Winning gold really was a big bonus. "I've medalled consistently at competitions. I feel I have to maintain that reputation and keep medalling at these competitions but I try to not think about it too much and put my best into everything. "The high scorings make it more exciting. Being able to pull off matches with high scores is a massive bonus as it shows the kicks I'm throwing are working and it's given me confidence to throw high-scoring kicks." Williams first considered taking up taekwondo after watching fellow Welsh fighter Jade Jones win gold at London 2012. She now trains alongside Jones with the British squad in Manchester and says the double Olympic champion is a great inspiration. "It's amazing to train with Jade herself. Jade and Bianca [Walkden] are both Olympic medallists," Williams continued. "To be able to train with them everyday and really push myself gives me great confidence that when I do go out into the ring and fight, they're not going to be much better than Jade and Bianca, so it's a massive confidence boost "My next big aim is the senior World Championships. I'm hoping to be selected for that. If I can medal at that competition it will put me in a really good place and make qualifying for the Olympics a bit more accomplishable."	European Taekwondo champion Lauren Williams says she feels under pressure to keep up her winning record.
LL Camps in Bushey, Hertfordshire, was closed by Ofsted last week and director Ben Lewis has been charged with possessing indecent images of children. Following the closure, parents vented their anger on the firm's Facebook page at the initial lack of information. But camp co-founder Tal Landsman has now said refunds will be issued. Ofsted closed the camp on 6 August and the company's website was taken down soon after. One parent whose child was due to attend the US-style day camp wrote it was an "utter disgrace". Another was concerned about parents who "could not afford alternative care without the refund". A man whose children had gone to the camp told the BBC: "Fortunately, for us they were only going for one further day, and then they were going to a different camp. "Had it been the situation that they were due to be there this week and all of next week, we'd be in a bit of bother." But on Wednesday, Mr Landsman confirmed parents would be able to fill in a refund form which has been placed on a holding page on the company's official website. Mr Lewis and Mr Landsman opened the holiday club in 2010.	Parents of children due to go to a summer camp whose director has been charged with possession of indecent images have been offered refunds.
Councillors have discussed plans aimed at improving the city's transport network and changing its image as what a report calls a "motorway city". City Square could be closed off to through traffic by 2021, as could Neville Street that runs past Bridgewater Place into the city centre. The move forms part of the city's 2023 European Capital of Culture bid. The plan was to get more people cycling and walking around the city, the report said. Cycles, buses and taxis would still be allowed in City Square that lies close to the railway station. Councillor Richard Lewis said: "It's about how me make the city both liveable and prosperous in the future." An upgrade of Armley Gyratory, one of the busiest junctions in the city, was also in the council's plans, he said. There were still many details to be worked out and there would be feasibility studies and consultations, Mr Lewis added. The plans are part of a discussion on a 20-year vision for the city. The HS2 high-speed rail network is planned to stop at a new city centre station in Leeds by 2032/33. The council must register its capital of culture interest by December 2016 and submit a final bid in 2017. The winning bid is expected to be announced in 2018.	Parts of Leeds city centre could be closed to traffic in a bid to make the city less "road heavy".
The images of Europe taken from the International Space Station (ISS) have notched up tens of thousands of reactions on Facebook. Belgium can be seen glowing more brightly than its neighbours. The country's dense road network enjoys near-total streetlight coverage, with lights kept on throughout the night. It uses about 2.2 million bulbs to illuminate Belgium's roads - with 186 bulbs per square mile, the New York Times reports. The 39-year-old French astronaut posted an image on Twitter showing the Aurora Borealis - also known as the Northern Lights - visible towards the north of the globe, and also noted that Belgium "stands out as usual". In another, on his Facebook page, he said London, Paris and Brussels "form a very European triangle". The photos are taken from the "cupola" - a module of the ISS built by the European Space Agency. In his blog, Mr Pesquet says he likes to look out on the Earth while working out on an exercise machine positioned there. "There are not a lot of gyms with such a view!" he writes. He describes in detail life on board the space station, explaining - among other things - that tortillas are better than bread in space, as they don't leave crumbs to plague the astronauts in their weightless environment. Most social media responses to the images marvelled at the beauty of the Earth viewed at night from some 400km (248 miles) above. But some complained about the wasted power and light pollution: "We can see very well the glitz and wasted electricity! Awful for lovers of the sky!" wrote Christian Cellier on Facebook. And one user, Michel-L Saucy said, was more concerned about extra-terrestrial visitors: "Hope that the aliens are not too attracted to light... We cannot accommodate them all once!"	Belgium's penchant for extravagant motorway lighting is suddenly in the spotlight thanks to pictures posted by French astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
Media playback is not supported on this device Stokes, 25, was ruled out of the 2014 World Twenty20 after punching a dressing room locker in Barbados. He was hit for four sixes in the last over of last year's World Twenty20 final as West Indies won the title. "I'll still have that same desire and hunger and want to get into people's faces," he told Test Match Special. Stokes was named vice-captain of the Test team under Joe Root last month, after deputising during England's one-day tour of Bangladesh in October. "I like to think I've grown. I think that's just from playing more and getting a few demerit points and a few tellings-off after games," he said. But the Durham man, who famously clashed with Marlon Samuels during England's Test tour of the West Indies in 2015, and again during the World T20 final, added: "That's what makes me the cricketer I am and I don't want to lose that. "I'm probably going to have to take maybe a step back a few times." Stokes is playing in his first series since he became the Indian Premier League's most expensive foreign player in February. He was the subject of a bidding war between five IPL sides before Rising Pune Supergiants bought him for £1.7m. Stokes says his England team-mates have joked about the fee paid for him. "I found it tough to talk about but the group that we have, it's funny to be around them because it's just taking the mickey out of everyone," Stokes said. "Everyone gets brought back down to earth. It's just the way we operate, which is why it's such a good environment to be in at the moment." England have won nine of their past 10 ODIs against West Indies and secured a 25-run victory when the two sides last met at the same venue in 2014. West Indies are ranked ninth in the world in 50-over cricket, a standing that denied them a place in this year's Champions Trophy, and will field an inexperienced side after changes to national selection. Players can only appear for the international side in limited-overs cricket if they have played the relevant format domestically in the Caribbean since 2010. "We can't be going into this game thinking it's just going to be a walk in the park," Stokes added. "We know how talented the West Indies team are - their batsmen can hit the ball out of the ground whenever they choose to and they've always had good quick bowlers." England captain Eoin Morgan confirmed that fast bowler Steven Finn will start Friday's match in place of Jake Ball, who suffered a knee injury in a warm-up game on Monday in St Kitts, and ahead of recent call-up Tom Curran. Sam Billings is also expected to open the batting alongside Jason Roy, with Alex Hales not yet match-fit despite joining up with the squad after recovering from a hand fracture. Morgan said his side "have one eye on the Champions Trophy" on home soil in June but added that West Indies could prove as tough a challenge as the  2-1 series loss in India in January. "The way we play, aggressively and positively, isn't the easiest to adapt to West Indies conditions with slow, turning wickets," he said. "The wickets here will be more challenging here than in India - those wickets were a lot more batter-friendly than we thought they were going to be." England probable XI: Sam Billings, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn.	England all-rounder Ben Stokes says he has grown up as his side prepare to start their one-day series against West Indies in Antigua on Friday.
People started fastening the padlocks to cables on St Botolph's Bridge, Boston, in Lincolnshire, after it opened in 2014. The locks supposedly symbolise the everlasting bond between two lovers. In recent years, the trend has spread across many parts of the UK - with bridges in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire targeted. Lincolnshire County Council said it had to remove the locks because they could potentially damage the stainless steel cables. A spokesperson for the authority said: "Unfortunately, some are starting to rust and it has become necessary to take them off to prevent further damage. The trend has met with some criticism, with the No Love Locks campaign calling it "an epidemic". One local woman also questioned whether the town was an appropriate place for such acts of love. She told BBC Radio Lincolnshire: "I'm not sure Boston would be the romance centre of the UK." The locks are being removed exactly a year after the bridge over the River Haven opened. They will be kept at Boston Borough Council's headquarters in the town for 21 days if anyone wants to claim them back.	Love locks on a new river footbridge are being removed because of fears they are damaging the structure.
Two reports, published in November, criticised the regulator at the time for failing to take action. One of those reports, by barrister Andrew Green QC, said regulators should consider banning 10 former HBOS executives. A new investigation has now been announced by regulators. "The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers," the regulators said. "These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers." No details are being given as to the exact nature of the investigations, who is being investigated, or the timeframe of the inquiry. A Bank of England/FCA report examined the failure of HBOS, while Mr Green examined decisions taken by the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator at the time of the HBOS demise. Both were published in November. So far the only person to have been banned is Peter Cummings, who was previously the head of corporate lending at HBOS. In 2012, he was fined Â£500,000, and banned from senior positions in banking. In his report, Mr Green suggested that the Bank of England's PRA and the FCA should consider prohibition proceedings against former executives. That included Andy Hornby, HBOS chief executive from 2006 to 2009. Mr Green said the FSA was "misguided" when it took the decision not to take action against Mr Hornby. Other former HBOS executives named in the report included Lord Stevenson, and Mike Ellis, the former group finance director at HBOS. Lindsay Mackay, the head of HBOS's Treasury division from 2004, could also be banned, November's report said. James Crosby, HBOS chief executive from 2001 to 2006, has retired. He gave up his knighthood in 2009, and surrendered part of his pension. Eight former non-executive directors of HBOS were criticised in the report, although they said they disagreed with its findings. The eight, including Lord Stevenson and Carphone Warehouse founder Sir Charles Dunstone, said the report had downplayed the "unforeseeable" effects of the financial crisis.	Regulators are to begin investigations into senior managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis.
The 30-year-old midfielder moved to McDiarmid Park for a second spell in February 2016 after a frustrating five months with Hearts. He has scored 14 goals in 48 appearances since then, having netted twice while on loan in 2015. "The pull of Hibernian was too much for me," said Swanson. "It's always been an ambition of mine to play for the club and I am looking forward to this new challenge and to help achieve their goals back in the Premiership." The Championship winners are yet to reveal details of the contract agreed with the former Dundee United, Peterborough and Coventry City player. Saints offered the midfielder new terms, with Swanson adding: "The decision to leave St Johnstone has been a difficult one for me. I've felt settled at the Saints and really enjoyed my football, and my period at the club has been the most enjoyable and satisfying time of my career. "So, it goes without saying, my decision to leave McDiarmid Park was not taken lightly. "I want to thank the manager, Tommy Wright, who has supported me in so many ways, on and off the field. "His trust in me on the football park allowed me to flourish. The way he treated me like an adult off the park also helped me to mature and develop as a person. "Now that we are in the top six yet again, which is yet another fine achievement, for the next five games it's my focus to make sure I play my part in helping St Johnstone qualify for a European place." Saints are currently fourth in the top flight, five points ahead of Hearts in the race for the final Europa League spot. Asked what Swanson would bring to his Hibs team, head coach Neil Lennon told his club website: "Goals from midfield, hopefully, creativity, "He's had a great season, into double figures. "I think he sees a pass, he's a fit lad, he crosses the ball well. And, whenever I have seen him play for St Johnstone, he has probably been their best player and more likely to create something. "And, allied to that, he is a Leith boy. He gets the club and that's always important as well." Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.	Danny Swanson has confirmed that he is leaving St Johnstone to join Hibernian, saying he could not resist the lure of his boyhood favourites.
The barrister turned politician led the Home Office at the time of the poll tax riots and the Strangeways prison disturbances in the spring of 1990. On the right of the party, he entered Parliament in a by-election in the 1960s and served as chief whip and other roles under Margaret Thatcher. After leaving the House of Commons, he served as leader of the House of Lords and latterly as governor of Bermuda. Prime Minister Theresa May paid tribute to Lord Waddington's "long and distinguished career in public service", saying he would be sadly missed. "He combined the sharp intelligence of a Queen's Counsel with the wit of a proud Lancastrian," she said. The Oxford-educated David Waddington served in the army in the 1950s before going into politics and first being elected to Parliament in 1968. He represented a number of different seats in Lancashire between 1968 and 1974, when he lost his seat, and again between 1979 and 1990. After rising through the ministerial ranks, he became chief whip - in charge of party discipline - before succeeding Lord Hurd as home secretary in October 1989. A supporter of capital punishment, he took a tougher line on law and order issues than his predecessor, piloting legislation through the Commons in 1990 to ensure serious criminals served longer sentences. He stood down after John Major became prime minister in November 1990 and accepted a peerage soon afterwards. He retired from the House of Lords in 2015.	Former Conservative Home Secretary Lord Waddington has died at the age of 87.
The Euro 2016 semi-finalists initially faced spirited Moldovan resistance but led 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from Sam Vokes and Joe Allen. Gareth Bale seized on a woeful pass for the third, then netted a last-minute penalty for his second of the night. Wales' win puts them top of Group D on goal difference ahead of Austria. Chris Coleman's men travel to Vienna for their next World Cup qualifier on Thursday, 6 October. As the group's top seeds, Coleman's side had been expected to make light work of Moldova, who are ranked 154 places below them in the world rankings. After a cagey first half hour they eventually did so with a flourish, becoming the first team to score three or more goals against the eastern European minnows since England's 4-0 victory in 2013. Having led Wales to a first major tournament semi-final at Euro 2016, Coleman said he was "desperate" to follow that achievement by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The former Fulham manager and his players want to ensure their summer exploits in France were not a one-off but a springboard to sustained success. They were backed by a typically vociferous Cardiff City Stadium crowd of 31,731, close to capacity once again as a nation basks in its greatest footballing era. And although it came against limited opposition, this opening victory was an encouraging start as Wales aim to end an absence from World Cups that stretches back to 1958. "That was the perfect start," former Wales international John Hartson said on Radio 5 live. "Moldova were awful, it was a comfortable win as you will see and great start to the qualifying campaign." There was a familiarity to Wales' initial inability to break Moldova down; struggling to unlock a deep and tenacious defence as they had done against Andorra and Israel during their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Moldova had lost 14 of their past 20 games but they are seldom pushovers and have conceded only 26 goals in the process. However, Wales' domination of possession and territory eventually paid dividends after 38 minutes when Bale's arcing cross was headed in by Vokes. Five minutes later, a weak attempted clearance from Moldova goalkeeper Ilie Cebanu found its way to Allen, who scored his first goal for Wales with a drilled half-volley from the edge of the penalty area. Bale claimed Wales' third goal in comical circumstances, as he latched on to a terrible backpass from Moldova's Ion Jardan before clipping the ball neatly beyond Cebanu. The Real Madrid forward scored his second in added time, converting a penalty after he had been brought down to move within four goals of Ian Rush's Welsh record of 28. Wales' next fixture could be the toughest of their qualifying campaign, away against Group D second seeds Austria on 6 October. Austria won 2-1 in Georgia on Monday and, with Serbia and the Republic of Ireland drawing 2-2 in Belgrade, this group is expected to be wide open. Sterner challenges await Coleman's side but this victory - their biggest winning margin in a competitive game since 2003 - will lift hopes of qualifying for a first World Cup in 60 years.

The Fraser of Allander Institute reckons that growth this year will be 1.9%, the same as its forecast for last year, for which official data has not been finalised. That is a reduction on the 2.2% forecast for 2016 that it published in November. For 2017, the forecast has fallen from 2.5% to 2.2% in those past four months. The economists at the Strathclyde University institute warned that growth was too dependent on household spending based on credit, which they said was unsustainable. They explained that the benefits of cheaper oil had not fed through to the economy as strongly as the harm it had done to the energy sector itself. The sustained low price was further pulling back on investment plans. The economists argued that this month's Westminster budget should avoid a further squeeze on spending, as tax revenues appeared to fall short of previous expectations. Prof Brian Ashcroft, author of the regular Fraser of Allander reports, said that would slow growth further and worsen the flow of tax revenues to the exchequer. The report said that job creation should continue but forecasted a slower rate of growth. The central forecast for net employment increase was 36,800, whereas in November, it was 45,000. The report also warned of the effect of the UK being taken out of the European Union, following the referendum in June. It claimed the uncertainty about the outcome of the vote would have a negative effect on investment. Its analysis of the European choice was that "it is difficult to imagine that it would help improve Scotland's competitive position to our trade with the EU". It noted that the fall in electronics and other manufacturing exports had meant Scotland already found it hard to penetrate open EU markets. The Strathclyde report said Scottish exporters would find it more difficult if the trade arrangements were changed. Also, productivity could be slowed, when it was already relatively weak. The latest report from Fraser of Allander noted that the Scottish economy still benefited from low inflation and low interest rates and earning power had been increasing slowly. However, it reflected on the strength of Sterling, making imports cheaper and exports more difficult. That factor had weakened in recent weeks, though trade had been slowing globally. It said growth had been depending too much on rising and unsustainable household debt. Paul Brewer, a senior partner at PwC which sponsors the Fraser of Allander reports, said: "The potential for the forthcoming budget to exert further fiscal tightening, oil price uncertainty and the uncertainty surrounding the potential outcome of the EU referendum, together create a difficult environment for business and investor confidence." He suggested the UK Chancellor could help the economy with a further cut in tax on oil producers. At sector level, the analysis said the service sector was the driver of growth, although financial services showed little sign of recovery to pre-recession levels. The production sector had contracted in the most recent official data, and construction had ceased to be the driver that it was of Scottish growth.	Growth in the Scottish economy is failing to pick up pace, according to one of Scotland's main forecasters.
The 42-year-old man was discovered in wetland at the Medmerry Nature Reserve, in Earnley, on Tuesday by Coastguards. Sussex Police said the incident, which took place in the Selsey area at about 17:00 GMT, was being treated as a "tragic accident". The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and British Hang Gliding Association have been informed. A spokesman for Sussex Police said they believed the AAIB would be "leading on the investigation into the cause of the crash".	A hang gliding pilot has died in an accident at a nature reserve near Chichester in West Sussex.
He told a rally in Columbus, Ohio, that he had heard "more and more" that the contest would be unfair. He offered no immediate evidence. At another event he called Democratic rival Hillary Clinton "the devil". Mr Trump has come under fire from across the political divide for remarks he made about the parents of a US Muslim soldier killed in action. On the forthcoming vote, he told supporters "I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest". He later repeated the claim on Fox News, adding "I hope the Republicans are watching closely or it's going to be taken away from us.". Mr Trump has made similar comments before in relation to the Democratic race, suggesting the party fixed its system to favour nominee Hillary Clinton over her challenger Bernie Sanders. Earlier this year, he also complained the Republican primary system was also "rigged" amid party efforts to stop his march to the candidacy. Correspondents say Mr Trump could be trying to capitalise on voters' distrust of establishment institutions, or lay the groundwork should he lose the election. At another rally in Pennsylvania, he took the unprecedented step of directly calling Mrs Clinton "the devil". He attacked Mr Sanders for capitulating in the Democratic race, saying he "made a deal with the devil. She's the devil." Democrats and Republicans alike have condemned Mr Trump for his remarks about the parents of US Army Capt Humayun Khan, who was killed by a car bomb in 2004 in Iraq, at the age of 27. Former Republican presidential candidate John McCain became the latest senior figure in the party to criticise Mr Trump for his attacks. Senator McCain, a veteran of the Vietnam War, said in a strongly worded statement that Mr Trump did not have "unfettered licence to defame the best among us". The soldier's parents, Khizr Khan and his wife Ghazala, told the BBC it was time to stand up to Mr Trump but he accused them of "viciously" attacking him. Mr Trump had caused controversy by suggesting Ghazala Khan had been prevented from speaking alongside her husband at the Democratic convention last week. In another development, American billionaire businessman Warren Buffett challenged Mr Trump to release his tax returns. Mr Trump has said that they cannot be made public until the financial authorities have completed an audit. But Mr Buffett said there were no rules against showing tax returns and allowing people to ask questions about them.	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has suggested that the November election could be "rigged".
The West Ham striker is charged with driving a car while a baby was being held by a passenger. Snodgrass, 29, is alleged to have driven on Duke Street, Glasgow, on 17 April with too many people to fit a baby seat in. The baby is alleged to have been in the arms for a rear seat passenger. Snodgrass, originally from Glasgow, was not at the city's Justice of the Peace Court when the case called. Defence lawyer Martin Black told the court "he didn't think he had to be" when asked why his client was not present. The Crown requested a warrant which was granted by JP Eunice Paton.	A warrant has been issued for Scotland international footballer Robert Snodgrass after he failed to turn up for his court trial.
Knight Frank found transaction volumes in the Granite City fell from over £600m in 2014 to only £55m last year. Investment in offices alone slumped from £500m in 2014 to £30m in 2016. Knight Frank said the low oil price "continued to take its toll" in the north east, with few deals going through in 2016. But it added that market conditions could improve in the year ahead, with crude prices making a recovery. The report found investors spent nearly £1.8bn last year across all sectors in Scotland, including offices, hotels, shops, student accommodation and industrial units. The figure was 12% down on the previous year but above the 10-year average of £1.72bn. Edinburgh registered a particularly strong year for investment, with almost £1.2bn transacted across all sectors - 92.5% up on 2015. But Glasgow saw a "more muted" 12 months, with transaction volumes down by 59% at £280m. Alasdair Steele, from Knight Frank, said: "Overall, the Scottish commercial property market remained resilient, despite an unstable 12 months. "Across the country, political uncertainty has influenced investment levels over the last year. "However, there's a general feeling beginning to emerge that Scotland offers good value and strong fundamentals - an attractive proposition for investors seeking solid returns at an especially turbulent time. "We'd hope to see that reflected in transaction volumes picking up in 2017, provided the political climate remains stable." Meanwhile, a separate report has suggested that investor interest in Scotland's commercial property market has failed to pick up despite an increase in occupier demand. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said both domestic and foreign investment inquiries stayed in negative territory in the last quarter. At the same time, the supply of property for investment purposes fell across all sectors. Some surveyors described market conditions as "challenging". The latest Rics UK commercial market survey suggested increased demand from occupiers in the office and industrial sectors. But it was a different story for retail in the fourth quarter, with a net balance of 14% more chartered surveyors reporting a fall in demand for retail space. Gavin Anderson, from Montagu Evans in Glasgow, said: "The current economic outlook isn't looking great and consumer spending on the high street is feeling the effect of growing fears about the economy. "Hopefully, the anticipated reduction in the rateable value of retail premises from April 2017 will act as a catalyst to help retailers' profit margins across their shop portfolios and increase their confidence to expand and take more stores next year." Rics chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said: "The results for the survey suggest that the commercial property market in Scotland has failed to attract investor interest despite an increase in occupier demand for commercial property in the last quarter. "This may be due, in part, to the prospects for the economy and the political situation more generally."	Investment in commercial property has plummeted in Aberdeen in the last two years, according to a report by a consultancy.
Former MEP turned AM Eluned Morgan spoke a year on from the referendum when Wales voted to leave the EU. Hard and soft Brexit relates to the type of relationship with the EU single market after the UK leaves the bloc. UKIP MEP Nathan Gill warned against a "con" of a Brexit, saying there were only two options - to leave or to stay. Meanwhile Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said his family faced "abuse" after he decided to campaign for Leave. On June 23 2016, 854,572 people in Wales - 52.5% of those who took part in the referendum - voted for Brexit, compared with 772,347 (47.5%) who said the UK should stay. The figures were in line with the UK result and came despite First Minister Carwyn Jones and the then Prime Minister David Cameron campaigning for a Remain vote. Asked how parties that campaigned for Remain should learn from the referendum, Ms Morgan said: "We should probably stop talking about the EU in terms that people don't understand. "Not many people I know understand hard and soft Brexit, and those are the experts. "If we really want to connect with the people we have to start talking about a jobs Brexit, or a Brexit that means you can still go out to a cafe and be served because actually we [could] lose so many people." Soft Brexit is sometimes used to refer to the UK maintaining some kind of relationship with the single market in return for concessions on freedom of movement, while hard or clean Brexit suggests leaving the single market entirely. There is no agreed definition of either. But Mr Gill, former UKIP Wales leader, told BBC Wales: "There's only one type of Brexit - you leave or you stay." He says Britain has to leave the single market and the customs union "otherwise we haven't left - it has to be that way". "We have to give the public some credit. They understood these things," Mr Gill said. He suggested that anything else would be a "con". Andrew RT Davies- another leading Brexit campaigner - told BBC Wales last year he suffered "brutal" treatment from senior Tory party figures after he announced his preference for leaving the EU. In an interview he said said his family "received quite a bit of abuse around the decision that I took".	A prominent Welsh Labour EU supporter has said the public largely do not understand what is meant by the terms "soft" or "hard" Brexit.
Board members are believed to have wanted bigger cost cuts and more focus on the investment bank's performance. Chairman John McFarlane said the bank needed to become more efficient: "What we need is profit improvement. Barclays is not efficient. We are cumbersome." In a statement, Barclays said a "new set of skills" was required at the top. Mr Jenkins has been Barclays' chief executive since 2012. The bank said a search for his successor was under way. Barclays' chairman John McFarlane has been named executive chairman until a new chief executive is appointed. In a conference call, Mr McFarlane said the board had decided the firm needed to change its strategy in order to boost revenue growth. Barclays needs to be "leaner and more agile" to improve the firm's capital performance, he said. Investors welcomed the news of the change, sending shares in Barclays up more than 2% in London. Mr McFarlane applauded Mr Jenkins' role in steering Barclays through the aftermath of the financial crisis, and through the fallout of Barclays' management shakeup three years ago. But he also said: "There is no question that cultural change was urgently required." Mr McFarlane told BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed that Mr Jenkins' skill set had been suitable when he took the top post, but that the firm's needs had changed. When the BBC asked him about future job cuts, he did not rule them out. Nor did he rule out the possibility of branch closures. "Inevitably, banks are going to have fewer branches than they have now," Mr McFarlane said. He also told the BBC that Barclays would not renew its sponsorship of the Premier League when it expires later this year. Make no mistake, Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, has been fired after falling out with the board over the size of the investment bank and the pace of cost cutting. Mr Jenkins, who became chief executive in 2012, was told in the last few days that the board no longer had confidence that he was the right man to lead the organisation. Senior sources have told me that Sir Mike Rake, the deputy chairman of Barclays, approached the new chairman, John McFarlane, to say that a number of board members were unhappy with the speed of change at the bank. They wanted cost cutting to go further and more attention paid to the investment bank which is seen as under-performing. It is thought that Sir Mike wants Barclays to retain its global presence as a major investment bank whilst Mr Jenkins felt it should be cut back. It has been made clear to me that Mr Jenkins was seen as having done a good job steadying the bank after the previous chief executive, Bob Diamond, resigned. But it is now time for a new person at the top. Whilst that search continues, Mr McFarlane will become chairman and chief executive, a similar role to the one he held at the insurance giant Aviva. In Barclays' statement, Mr McFarlane said the bank needed to boost returns to shareholders. "We therefore need to improve revenue, costs and capital performance." The board said it recognised the contribution Mr Jenkins had made over the past three years, and was "extremely grateful to him for bringing the company to a much stronger position". But the bank said its non-executive directors had "concluded that new leadership is required to accelerate the pace of execution going forward". Mr Jenkins took over at Barclays in the summer of 2012 following the departure of Bob Diamond, who left in the wake of the Libor scandal. The bank said Mr Jenkins had inherited a situation which "would have challenged anyone facing the same issues". Mr Jenkins said that when he had taken over as group chief executive in 2012 it was a "particularly difficult time for Barclays". "It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us.  I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then," he said.	Antony Jenkins, the chief executive of Barclays, has been fired after falling out with the board over the bank's cost cutting and profitability.
The 21-year-old, who has also played on the wing, has progressed through Wigan's youth system. Tierney is the son of former England dual-code international Jason Robinson, who also played for the Warriors. "It is a huge achievement for me to agree this contract extension and I'm very happy to be staying at my hometown club," said Tierney. His new deal also includes the option of a further year. "Lewis is a good young Wigan kid who knows what it means to play for this great club," added head coach Shaun Wane. "He has improved a greatly in the last few years and it excites me that there is still a lot more improvement to come."	Wigan Warriors full-back Lewis Tierney has signed a new three-year deal with the Super League side until 2019.
Councils in England, including Bradford and Birmingham, will trial the pilot scheme at local elections in 2018. The government said it would "ensure the integrity" of the electoral system. But campaigners said levels of fraud did not justify the move and one Labour MP said it would hit poorer voters. A full list of the participating councils has not yet been drawn up, but 18 council areas in England identified by the Electoral Commission as being most susceptible to voter fraud will be invited to take part in the pilot. The 18 also include Luton, Slough, Woking, Coventry and Bristol. Different local authorities will trial different types of ID, including driving licences, passports and utility bills. The creation of a new form of ID specifically for voting has been ruled out by ministers. Northern Ireland already requires voters to show ID before casting their vote. Constitution minister Chris Skidmore said fraud of any kind was unacceptable and dismissed suggestions that the plans, which could be rolled out across the whole country if successful, could disenfranchise poor people who do not have ID. He told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "Voting is one of the most important transactions you can make as an individual. In many transactions you need a proof of ID." "I'm determined to ensure, when it comes to groups who are under-registered, that they get the opportunity to exercise their vote," he added. "Ensuring those communities are protected, that the risks of electoral fraud are diminished, will ensure those individuals are represented fairly across this country." The reform was first touted by former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles in August, when he released recommendations amid growing concerns about electoral fraud. He tweeted that the government was "right to give greater powers to electoral officials and the police to deal with intimidation and other unwanted behaviour". In his report, Sir Eric cited research suggesting certain Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities could be more vulnerable to fraud due to a lack of understanding of the voting process. He highlighted "kinship" traditions, saying they emphasised collective over individual rights and made it more likely that people would "hand over" their vote over to others. Mr Skidmore dismissed suggestions the new measures were targeted at any "particular community" but said it was essential people across the UK were able to fulfil their democratic rights "regardless of their race or their religion". The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for changes to the electoral system to make it "fairer", said the move was a "blunt instrument" that could deter people from voting. "While we should take all instances of voter fraud very seriously where they occur, mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut," chief executive Katie Ghose said. "The government should think very carefully before introducing barriers to voting. "There is simply no evidence to suggest that electoral fraud is widespread across the UK. Where it has occurred it has been isolated and should be tackled locally." Labour said it supported the idea in principle but views varied among its MPs with Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, suggesting it was a "retrograde step" that was "more about combating low income voting" than tackling fraud. Jim Fitzpatrick, MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said he didn't have an issue with the idea as "most people carry ID". Former London mayor Ken Livingstone, who was suspended from the Labour Party and is currently an independent, said it was a "political" move and would make life more difficult for most people because of a handful of crimes. "The real problem is the people most likely not to have a passport or a driving licence are going to be the poorest and that I suspect will basically hit the Labour Party," he told Today. As well as the trials, election officials and police will be given new powers to tackle intimidation of voters by activists, who will also be banned from collecting postal votes for submission - a practice known as "harvesting". The government said it was considering plans to check the nationality of voters to stop fraudulent registrations. There will also be reforms to improve the security of the postal ballot system, including requiring postal voters to re-apply every three years.	Plans to demand proof of identity before voting in a bid to combat electoral fraud have been defended by ministers, amid criticism the move is a "sledgehammer to crack a nut".
After a dreadful first-half showing, Spurs improved and the Wales left-back found the breakthrough against their Championship opponents with a deft header. Son Heung-min then wrapped up the victory when he converted Moussa Sissoko's pass to put Mauricio Pochettino's side in Monday's fourth-round draw. Tottenham have moved into third place in the Premier League on the back of a five-match winning run, but their second string struggled to click against a Villa side set out to frustrate. Without the rested Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen, the hosts were short of ideas and the tie looked destined for a replay until unlikely goalscorer Davies arrived inside the penalty area. Villa mustered one shot on target all game and Steve Bruce will now turn his attention to overhauling a seven-point gap to the Championship play-off places. Tottenham were excellent in beating Premier League leaders Chelsea 2-0 in midweek, but perhaps unsurprisingly were nowhere near that level in the opening hour. Of the XI who started against Chelsea, only Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier kept their places - and it showed. Alli, Kane and Eriksen had contributed 30 of Spurs' 51 goals this season, and 11 of 33 assists, before kick-off and without them Pochettino's side looked toothless. Stand-in striker Vincent Janssen, who has scored just three penalties in 23 appearances now, was particularly lightweight and it was only when Alli finally replaced him after an hour that Tottenham found a way through. It was another replacement, Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, who crossed for Davies to head home before Son - who had moved up front once Janssen went off - buried the second. A top-four finish remains Pochettino's most pressing assignment, but after a dismal Champions League campaign a first FA Cup win since 1991 should also be high on his list. More to follow.

The body of Peter Wrighton, 83, was found three miles south of East Harling in Norfolk on 5 August. He had been repeatedly stabbed. Norfolk Police said they wanted to trace three men seen around the woodland close to the time he died. The force said a man in his 50s seen changing into a t-shirt has been found. Police say they still want to speak to two other men; one aged 25 to 30, with tanned skin, wearing a grey or blue t-shirt, grey gym shorts and heavy-duty flip flops; the other aged 30 to 50, wearing dark clothing and seen walking without a dog to the north of the heath. Det Supt Andy Smith added: "We have already heard from more than 220 people but we will be exploring all avenues in our enquiries and we are still keen to hear from more. "We also want to hear from delivery drivers who might have travelled through or have been in the area on Saturday and who could have important dash cam footage for us to review. In addition, anyone else with images or footages of the area should contact us." There have been no arrests and no weapon has been found. Mr Wrighton was pictured on CCTV using the post office in Kenninghall at 10:10 BST, about 35 minutes before his body was found near to Fiveways Junction. "His car, a red Skoda Fabia, was parked close to The Street, the road close to the heath land where he was walking his dogs Dylan and Gemma," Det Supt Smith said. The force said it has more than 100 officers and staff working on the "significant murder investigation".	One of three "vital" potential witnesses to the murder of an elderly dog walker in woodland has been traced, police have said.
Adrian Bayley was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for killing Jill Meagher, an ABC Radio employee. On Thursday, it was announced he had been found guilty of three more rapes, of a Dutch tourist and two sex workers. The three trials were the subject of a suppression order to ensure fairness, but this was lifted after a verdict was returned in the third trial. Bayley was described by a judge in 2013 as a "recidivist sex offender". He was on parole for previous rape convictions when he killed Ms Meagher. Ms Meagher, originally from County Louth, was attacked in Melbourne in September 2012 as she walked home. Her body was discovered six days later buried on the outskirts of the city. The new convictions relate to two attacks in 2012 and one in 2000. All the women came forward after recognising Bayley during the investigation and subsequent court proceedings over the killing of Ms Meagher. The defence argued that the women had wrongly identified Bayley because of his prominence in the media, but juries in three separate trials disagreed.	An Australian man jailed for the rape and murder of an Irish woman has been convicted of three more rapes.
3 April 2017 Last updated at 09:17 BST Demand for property in China's top cities is so red hot, some couples are even undergoing fake divorces in order to buy additional homes. China's central bank has tried to clamp down on rising prices but that has done little to allay the woes of young workers who earn low wages. The BBC's Stephen McDonell reports on one of the world's most unaffordable property markets.	If you're young, Chinese and living in Beijing, you're probably locked out of the property market.
Bethan Rhys Roberts hosts Ask the Leader on BBC One Wales at 19:00 BST on Wednesday. Kirsty Williams has been a member of the Welsh Assembly since it was created in 1999 - at 28, she was one of the youngest AMs elected. After the 2007 election, she successfully opposed her party entering into a so-called rainbow coalition with the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru in Cardiff Bay. The episode caused divisions in the party - which she ended up leading some 18 months later. Early on in her leadership Ms Williams launched Project 31 - a plan which would see the Welsh Liberal Democrats aim to win a majority of seats in Cardiff Bay. However, in her only assembly election campaign in charge so far - 2011 - the Lib Dems lost one of their six seats, and polls suggest they have a fight to keep the rest this time around. Despite leading the smallest party in the assembly, Ms Williams can take credit for getting Welsh Labour ministers to deliver Lib Dem policies such as increased school funding for poorer pupils as part of a deal to support the government's budget. Her reputation as a party leader may be enhanced - but the biggest challenge for Kirsty Williams is making sure that there are enough Lib Dem AMs re-elected to ensure that she has a party group to lead for the next five years. Thursday 14 April - Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Aberystwyth Friday 15 April - Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones in Llangollen Monday 11 April - Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies in Swansea Tuesday 12 April - UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill in Swansea Ask the Leader can be seen on BBC One Wales at 19:00 each day and on the BBC iPlayer.

Spireites midfielder Gary Liddle was sent off after only 16 minutes for a foul on Kane Vincent-Young. Chesterfield kept the U's out until Drew Wright broke free with 20 minutes remaining, cutting the ball back for Bonne to strike right-footed. However, three minutes later Lee Novak converted from the spot after he was felled by Richard Brindley. Colchester's winless run in League One stretched to 17 matches as they remain rooted to the foot of the table while a point was enough to take Chesterfield out of the relegation places.	Macauley Bonne scored his first goal in 11 games but Colchester were held to a draw by 10-man Chesterfield.
But the Taliban has been regaining ground in Sangin and is now poised to recapture the district from Afghan forces. Why is this part of Helmand so important to both sides? Regaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC late on Monday that the district administrative office had been abandoned by government forces. But Taliban fighters are cautious about entering it, he said. The Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied, as they have done in the Musa Qala and Nowzad regions of Helmand - where 90% of the districts are said to be under Taliban control but the centres are with the government forces. The Taliban intentionally avoids centres of the districts, where they can easily be targeted. Keeping control of the centre of Sangin would not be easy for the militants, but they may have an advantage among the local population. Many locals are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year which they say wrought unwarranted destruction to homes, farms, and other property. The Taliban will probably seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible, as they did in Kunduz where fighters could be seen posing for photos with civilians. If the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, it should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country. It should deploy troops who do not bear the grudges of those who fought in the civil war in 90s, soldiers who are not trying to settle old scores. Above all, it should do all it can to avoid perpetuating a cycle of violence in which the biggest victims are the local civilians.	Sangin was once the centre of operations for international forces in Afghanistan, a key district that linked Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, to the province's northern districts.
Rebel fighters have agreed a ceasefire and will leave Homs to President Bashar al-Assad's tender mercies. Yet in just a few weeks' time - by the New Year at the latest - President Assad is meant to be talking peace with some of the leaders who have suffered this reverse. It doesn't seem very likely - not with Russian President Vladimir Putin behind him. For its part, the fractured and disparate opposition wants President Assad not across the table but at least out of power and, better still, dead. Like some sick version of a knockout league, the opposition is arguing, and in some cases fighting, among themselves about who should play-off against President Assad. There is a conference in Saudi Arabia designed to sort this out. But some significant players are absent. The Kurds aren't there, despite being, by most accounts, the most effective and efficient fighting force. The jihadists aren't welcome, of course. The Western priority is to crush so-called Islamic State (IS) before there can be serious progress towards peace. This determination is most often justified by the threat IS poses to Europe and the US. But the British government argues it also directly relates to keeping alive a moderate opposition. The rather mysterious force of 70,000 fighters talked about by David Cameron as "troops on the ground" morphs before our eyes into a vulnerable but essential group to be preserved. I was watching a crucial but largely ignored Defence Committee meeting just before last week's Commons vote. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told the committee the 70,000 "are fighting Assad, and one of the reasons for us getting more involved in tacking Isil [a longer acronym for Islamic State] in Syria is so that they are not being squeezed by both sides". The deputy chief of the defence staff, Lt Gen Gordon Messenger, helpfully spelt out the need to "preserve them as part of a future political process". He added: "Nor are we saying they are ready to advance to Raqqa - but we are saying they are a really important group to preserve. "Because we see them as being a vital part of the political process, critical to preserve to prevent Syria becoming a choice between Assad or Isil, so they are a very important part of the dynamic." The West's hopes for an alternative Syria seem based on crossed fingers rather than serious analysis. The survival of a moderate opposition may depend not on British bombs but Russian ones. If Russia continues to target it, it will not be a force at the negotiating table, and there will be no real reason for President Assad to come to the table. It is very unpalatable for the West, but President Putin's military intervention means he holds the key to Syria's future. Syria, the US and the rest of the Western alliance hangs on his next move. Is this a victory for President Bashar al-Assad? The withdrawal of the last remaining rebels from al-Wair is a blow to the opposition because it gives the government complete control over what was once the centre of the uprising against the president. Has it come about because of Russia's intervention? The Syrian military launched an offensive on rebel-held areas outside Homs after Russia began its air campaign two months ago. But al-Wair fell because its residents were besieged for almost three years, coming under continuous and heavy bombardment and receiving only limited and irregular supplies. Does this offer hope for a wider peace deal? Local ceasefires such as the one that allowed the al-Wair withdrawal - negotiated by Syrians, rather than involving outside states - may be the most effective way of gradually bringing peace to the country. Why are rebel and opposition factions meeting in Saudi Arabia? Leading opposition politicians and rebels are for the first time meeting in an attempt to agree a common position ahead of peace talks with the government, which world powers want to start in Vienna next month. Will those talks lead to peace talks with the government? Analysts say trying to get the disparate factions to agree to the same platform and negotiate as one unit will prove very difficult, if not impossible.	The Syrian city seen as the capital of the revolution has fallen, by agreement.
Emergency teams are searching for another 15 people who are missing. Rivers burst their banks, destroying buildings and roads after more than 50cm (20in) of rain fell over a 12-hour period on parts of the south-western island of Kyushu on Wednesday. Rescuers are working through thick mud to try to reach stranded survivors. Hundreds have already been evacuated. The worst-hit areas are in Fukuoka prefecture. Announcing the revised death toll, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the region was expected to see further heavy rain on Saturday. About 12,000 police, military, firefighters and coast guard personnel have taking part in the rescue operation.	The death toll from flooding caused by recent heavy rain in southern Japan has risen to at least 15, officials say.
Kingfisher House, near the domestic airport in the western city of Mumbai (Bombay), was being sold by lenders to recover losses. However, bidders appeared to be deterred by the asking price of 1.5bn rupees ($22m; Â£15m). The businessman is said to have some $1.4bn of unpaid debts after his Kingfisher airline collapsed in 2013. Speculation rose about his whereabouts after a consortium of banks and creditors approached the Supreme Court over  unpaid debts. They demanded that his passport be impounded, and that $75m in severance pay he was to receive from Diageo be blocked and used to repay them. The payout was blocked, but it emerged that Mr Mallya had already left India. Later in a series of tweets he denied that he was "absconding" as was being alleged in India. Media reports say Mr Mallya is currently living in London. Opposition MPs have demanded that the government bring him back to face the law. Mr Mallya, who is a household name in India, sold a large chunk of United Spirits, which he inherited from his father, to Diageo in April 2014. He was to receive the $75m payout as settlement after being ousted from the firm in February. Mr Mallya, once dubbed by Indian media as "India's Richard Branson" and the "King of Good Times" for his lavish lifestyle, also owns a stake in the Formula One team Force India.	An auction to sell a property belonging to Indian drinks baron Vijay Mallya has failed to attract any bidders.
The 26-year-old Samoan, who started his career with Manly Sea Eagles, made six appearances for the NRL champions last season. He told the club website: "I'm ready now to take my game up to a new level and Castleford sounds perfect for me. "I'm looking forward to playing for a club that plays such a big part in the community."	Castleford Tigers have signed Cronulla Sharks forward Jesse Sene-Lefao on a two-year deal.
Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel is accused of murdering the beautician, while her father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid is being held as an accessory to murder. The men's lawyers, however, say they will apply to have the case dismissed due to a "complete lack of evidence". Ms Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died in July in Pakistan. Live updates and more from across West Yorkshire Following a court hearing in Jhelum, in the state of Punjab, both men were remanded into custody ahead of their next appearance on 20 October. The judge ordered that Ms Shahid's second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazim should also appear on that date. Mr Kazim, who married Ms Shahid in Leeds in 2014 before the couple moved to Dubai in 2015, claims his wife was murdered because her family disapproved of their marriage. It is thought Ms Shahid had travelled to Pakistan to visit family in the village of Pandori after being told her father was ill. Her relatives in Pakistan initially said she had suffered a heart attack but a post-mortem examination confirmed she died as a result of being strangled.	Lawyers representing the first husband and father of alleged "honour killing" victim Samia Shahid say they will seek to have the case thrown out.
There have been calls for reform of the system, which often sees highly-paid council chiefs get extra payments of tens of thousands of pounds. Holyrood's local government committee is to examine how the payments are made and how appropriate they are. Convener Bob Doris said there was "understandable public concern" about the sums being paid out. Returning officers have been in high demand in recent years, with Scotland going to the polls for five elections and referendums across three years. It is estimated that almost Â£500,000 was shared between the 32 returning officers inside a matter of weeks in 2016, due to the Holyrood election and the EU referendum. Mr Doris said the total sum may stretch to Â£1m over two years when the 2015 general election is taken into account. The SNP MSP said: "The level of payment varies for different elections and different councils, and we're also aware some returning officers claim their payment, while others share payments with their staff. We want to find out more about how these payments operate, what their uptake is and whether they remain appropriate." Returning officers are responsible for ensuring the smooth running of elections at a local, national and European level, as well as referendums. The role is often carried out by council chief executives on top of their normal duties. MSPs will hear from electoral law experts and local government officials, trade unions and academics as well as returning officers across two meetings in November.	MSPs are to examine the payments received by election returning officers in Scotland.
Casey posted a one-under 71 to move to seven under, while Fleetwood and Americans Brian Harman and Brooks Koepka signed for 70s at Erin Hills. For the first time since world rankings began in 1986, the world's top three have missed the cut at a major. Defending champion Dustin Johnson (+4), Rory McIlory (+5) and Jason Day (+10) finished above the one-over-par cut. Overnight leader Rickie Fowler was going on serenely at nine under until three successive bogeys from the 11th saw him drop back into the pack. The American recovered to post five pars and salvage a one-over 73 to sit one off the lead, with Jamie Lovemark and JB Holmes who both shot 69s. World number one Johnson, who recorded his first major victory in this tournament at Oakmont a year ago, flirted with the projected cut mark all day. He opened on three over but birdied the first two holes. However, he was unable to build on that momentum and was still one over par after a birdie on the 12th. Bogeys on the 13th and 14th dropped him back to three over and a further shot went on the 17th. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, who was playing his first tournament after a month out injured and only his seventh of the year, signed for a one-under 71, after knocking in four birdies in his final six holes, but the damage was done by his six-over 78 in round one. "I showed up for the last six holes at least," joked world number two McIlroy, who misses his second successive US Open cut. "I saw some positives on the back nine to take into next week and, even though this is disappointing, the last two rounds will serve me well in this busy summer." World number three Day followed his opening 79 with a 75 to limp out on 10 over. "It's been the best preparation going into a major in my career," said the Australian, who conceded: "I was in the hay too much over the last couple of days." After opening with a six-under 66, Casey was one off the overnight lead as he went out among the early starters on Friday. He started on the 10th, birdied the 11th but bogeyed the 12th before coming unstuck on the 14th. He was within 100 yards of the green after two shots but hit his third in to deep rough and took five from there to post a triple-bogey eight. A bogey on 15 dropped him to two under but a run of five birdies followed to catapult him to the top of the leaderboard. "It's very difficult to get through a major championship, let alone a US Open, without a blemish on your card," the 39-year-old told BBC Sport. "I made a complete mess on the 14th. It's how you react to it. I tried to take my medicine and then messed up the next hole. But I got on a wonderful birdie streak. "It was important to do that. I didn't change the game plan. John, my caddie and I kept communication great. We talked it out and got back to hitting the fairways and doing the basics and that led to some birdies on the front nine. I'm really, really happy with it." Southport's Fleetwood said it would be "nice to sit down to dinner knowing you're top of the US Open leaderboard" after overcoming "a ropey start" to his second round. The 26-year-old bogeyed the first hole but had three birdies and 12 pars before dropping his next shot on the 17th. However, he finished his round well with a birdie at the par-five 18th. "I was enjoying it," he told BBC Sport. "I had a couple of bad drives early in the round and I had to focus on my rhythm and slow things down but as I got into the round it became more natural and I hit a lot of good shots and felt comfortable out there. "I've never led a US Open, so it will be a very cool experience." Japan's Hideki Matsuyama posted the joint-lowest round of the day, a seven-under-par 65 to move into a tie for eighth on five under. The world number four knocked in six birdies on the front nine and one more on the back nine in a bogey-free round. However he missed an opportunity to tie Jonny Miller's US Open single round record of eight under when his nine-foot birdie attempt at the last stayed up. Matsuyama is joined on five under by, among others, amateur Cameron Champ who had three-under-par 69. American Chez Reavie also leapt up the leaderboard with a 65 to get to four under - he had eight birdies and one bogey - and missed a 25-foot putt to tie Miller's 1973 record on the short ninth. Masters champion Sergio Garcia kept his challenge on track with a solid one-under-par 71. He signed for three birdies and two bogeys to finish three under, alongside 2014 US Open winner Martin Kaymer (69) and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger (72). American Jordan Spieth, winner in 2015, birdied two of his first four holes to get to one under but a bogey on the sixth checked his progress as he posted a one-under 71 to move to level par. With the cut coming at one over, the joint-lowest 36-hole mark in US Open history, the 68 players who will contest the final two rounds are all within eight shots of the lead - the same number of shots Matsuyama made up on playing partner Fowler in round two. Olympic champion Justin Rose is another who will be heading home early after carding a two-over 74. The Englishman, champion in 2013, birdied the par-five seventh to move to level par but bogeyed the next two to finish the tournament on two over. In fact, of the 14 Englishmen, three Scots, two Northern Irishmen and one Welshman who started on Thursday, only seven will play the weekend. Andrew Johnston is five off the lead after a 73, while fellow Englishmen Eddie Pepperell (71) and Matt Fitzpatrick (73), and Scotland's Martin Laird (71) are in a group on one under. Lee Westwood had a three-over 75 to drop back to level par. Among those missing the cut were Bradley Dredge of Wales and England's Chris Wood on three over while 2010 champion Graeme McDowell closed on five over. England's 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett, who posted a nine-over 81 in round one, withdrew before the start of his second round with a back injury.	English duo Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood are in a four-way tie for the lead after two rounds of the US Open.
The 21-year-old, who has appeared 82 times for Brighton, played five games on loan at Karl Robinson's Championship strugglers earlier this campaign. The England Under-21 international is eligible for Saturday's FA Cup third-round match against Northampton Town. "I've been here before, I know what the club is all about and I just can't wait to get started," he said. Robinson added to the club website: "I felt he was a real success in his first spell with us earlier this season and this was highlighted when we looked back and saw he was the top of our attacking stats for a midfield player. "When he was here before, Darren Potter wasn't fit and Samir Carruthers wasn't playing in central midfield and, as a group, this time around I'm sure they will offer good balance."

Media playback is not supported on this device Mignolet struggled as the Reds twice gave away the lead in a thrilling 3-3 draw with the Premier League leaders. "For the second goal he needs help from all the players," said Klopp, in reference to Mignolet scrambling as Olivier Giroud scored from a corner. The Belgium goalkeeper, 27, is set to sign a new five-year contract. Mignolet, who joined the Reds from Sunderland in a £9m deal in June 2013, was also beaten at his near post by Aaron Ramsey for Arsenal's first equaliser. Klopp, who has consistently backed Mignolet, added: "On the second goal, on a perfect day he can make a save but there were a lot of mistakes before. "We have to defend this better." Liverpool's goalkeeping weaknesses have been exposed by errors from Mignolet's deputy Adam Bogdan in the 3-0 defeat at Watford and the 2-2 FA Cup draw at Exeter. That has prompted Klopp to recall 22-year-old Welshman Danny Ward, a substitute on Wednesday, from a successful loan spell at Aberdeen. Liverpool snatched a deserved draw with Arsenal thanks to Joe Allen's late equaliser. Roberto Firmino twice gave Liverpool the lead in a breathless first half, the second a spectacular 20-yard drive, but Arsenal levelled through Ramsey and Giroud. Giroud's second-half strike - his 18th goal of the season - looked to have put the Gunners on course for a crucial victory, but substitute Allen rewarded the hosts for a display bursting with energy and spirit with a low 90th-minute finish. Media playback is not supported on this device Klopp was delighted with the performance of Brazil forward Firmino, who has struggled to live up to his £29m transfer fee since arriving from Hoffenheim in the summer. The German said: "I could talk about this for half an hour. He doesn't know how good he is. If you are good, you have to show it. "He had a really good game but he was not the only one. I could talk about special performances - we had a lot of other players." Klopp was also involved in an angry first-half exchange with fourth official Robert Madley and was calmed down, amiably, by his opposite number Arsene Wenger. He said: "I told Arsene why I was a little bit emotional. It was a clear throw-in for us in a good moment, a good phase. I said what I said, he said what he said. "We had nothing, it was friendly."	Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp defended under-fire goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after his latest uncertain display in the draw with Arsenal at Anfield.
The poll was held as former Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies stood down to run for - and win - the Welsh Assembly election in the same area, part of Bridgend county borough. In the 2015 General Election, Labour won the seat with 52% of the vote and the Conservatives came second with 15%. UKIP came second this time around.	Labour's Christopher Elmore has become the new MP for Ogmore after winning the Parliamentary by-election with 52% of the vote.
Mansfield District Council stopped people riding around the market place to combat "anti-social" cycling. However, it said "responsible" cyclists were welcome in the same place for the Tour of Britain on 6 September. Campaign group Cycling UK said Mansfield hosting the race was illogical. The group is currently supporting six cyclists who are challenging the council over a public spaces protection order (PSPO), issued a year ago, which prohibits people from cycling in the pedestrianised market place area. Anyone who fails to dismount when asked could be fined. Cycling UK spokesman Duncan Dollimore said: "They are marketing the town as cycle friendly, but not to people who want to shop there. "We would never defend cycling anti-social behaviour, but why not deal with those being stupid and not responsible cyclists. "They are effectively saying cycling is anti-social." He also criticised the council's own promotional video showing a cyclist riding through areas which are prohibited. In a statement, Mansfield District Council said it welcomed responsible cyclists to the town to view the race, but with care and consideration. Riders have been encouraged to dismount, but "normal" rules concerning the PSPO will not be in operation for the "special event". Mansfield's mayor Kate Allsop said: "This is about safety. This event will be properly monitored and managed. "What we don't want is people dashing through the town centre on their bikes frightening or upsetting people. "This is a special event and it would have been a dreadful shame if we were so inflexible that we would not host this amazing opportunity."	A council has been accused of double standards for allowing a stage of a major cycle race to start in a town centre where cyclists have been banned.
Benchmark Brent crude hit $50.22 per barrel at one stage on Thursday, its highest level since early November. The rise followed US data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in Canada. Brent crude has now risen 80% since it hit 13-year lows of below $28 a barrel at the start of the year. US crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to May 20, according to US Department of Energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the US and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between Opec and Russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from Iran and Saudi Arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in Canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in Nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as China, India and Russia. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: "We do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in US output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing." Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit $50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $60 by the end of 2017. The US bank said: "The oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in Nigeria, higher output in Iran and better demand. "With each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected." In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. BP said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017. And last month US oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $50. Adam Laird, an investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC: "This is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of $50] could be enough to make some executives reassess." However, Mr Laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. "It's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound," he said. Abhishek Deshpande, an oil markets analyst at Natixis, agreed and said: "We believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections."	The price of oil has gone above $50 a barrel for the first time in 2016 as supply disruptions and increased global demand continue to fuel a recovery.
The Green Lions, hosting the first ever cup match on the island, forced the preliminary qualifying round tie to a replay with a 2-2 draw on Saturday. Guernsey, who often struggle for player availability, now travel to London. "Okay we got something out of the game, but more so it is a game we could have done without from a financial and logistical point of view," Vance said. Guernsey, who play in English football's eighth tier, battled back from two goals down in front of a crowd of 1,142. Dave Rihoy scored both goals for the hosts after the break, helping makeup for what Vance said was an "awful and lifeless" first-half performance. "It wasn't good enough, we didn't have the right energy or movement. We were reactive and not proactive and put ourselves in a situation where we had to try do something. "As much as I'm frustrated with the players for first half, I'll give them loads of credit for the second half. I'm proud."

Guernsey boss Tony Vance admits their FA Cup replay against Thamesmead Town on Tuesday will be a costly burden.
The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time. Around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees are to transfer to the new business as part of the deal. Tesco said in a statement that this is an "orderly and efficient exit from the US market". Under the terms of the deal, Tesco will loan the new business around Â£80m. Fresh & Easy, which operates 200 stores across California, Nevada and Arizona, has lost money since opening in 2007. Tesco did not specify which stores are being transferred to Yucaipa, but it is understood the remaining 50 shops will be closed. It will cost Tesco Â£150m to dispose of the Fresh & Easy brand, but part of that is a loan which may be paid back. Also, if Yucaipa is sucessful and the business becomes profitable, Tesco has the option to buy a stake. Yucaipa is a Los Angeles based private equity company focused on supermaket and restaurant businesses and is run by billionaire investor Ron Burkle. In April of this year, Tesco reported its first fall in annual profits for 20 years.	Tesco has agreed to sell 150 of its Fresh & Easy stores to the investment company Yucaipa Companies.
General Vladimir Padrino tweeted that the "leaders and masterminds of the paramilitary and terrorist assault" had been arrested. The suspects are a 38-year-old former captain, Juan Carlos Caguaripano Scott, and a lieutenant, Jefferson Garcia. Two of the rebels were killed and eight seized after the incident in Valencia. Venezuela has seen four months of violent anti-government protests, and almost 130 people have died in clashes. Just before the barracks attack, a video released on social media showed the uniformed men saying they were rising against the "murderous tyranny of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro". "This is not a coup but a civil and military action to re-establish constitutional order," said the leader, who gave his name as Juan Caguaripano. Venezuelan officials say Mr Caguaripano was discharged from the army in 2014. They claim he commanded around 20 uniformed men during the attack. He then escaped with Lieutenant Garcia and some stolen weaponry, they say. The 6 August incident raised tensions in the divided country, where critics of President Maduro say he is trying to cement a dictatorship. Mr Maduro insists his actions - which include creating a pro-government assembly with the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution - are the only way to re-establish peace. The US has led a chorus of international alarm against the Maduro government in recent weeks, and has imposed sanctions on several high-ranking Venezuelans - including the president. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he had not ruled out "a possible military option if necessary" against Venezuela. Gen Padrino dismissed the claim as an act of "craziness". He told Venezuela's state television: "It is an act of supreme extremism. There is an extremist elite that rules the United States. "As a soldier, I stand with the Venezuelan armed forces, and with the people. I am sure that we will all be on the front lines of defending the interests and sovereignty of this beloved Venezuela." The White House said Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with his US counterpart on Friday. It said President Trump would speak to Venezuela's leader "as soon as democracy is restored in that country".	Two renegade officers who attacked a Venezuelan army base last weekend have been captured, the country's defence minister has said.
Noel Conway, who is 67 and has motor neurone disease, wants a doctor to be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose when his health deteriorates further. He said he wanted to say goodbye to loved ones "at the right time, not to be in a zombie-like condition suffering both physically and psychologically". Any doctor who helped him to die would face up to 14 years in prison. Mr Conway was too weak to attend the court in person. His lawyer, Richard Gordon QC, told the High Court in London that Mr Conway faced a stark choice either to seek to bring about his own death now whilst still physically able to do so, or await death with no control over how and when it comes. Mr Gordon said the change to the law that Mr Conway wanted would apply only to adults who are terminally ill with less than six months to live and who have a settled wish to die. Mr Conway, of Shrewsbury, told the BBC: "I will be quadriplegic. I could be virtually catatonic and conceivably be in a locked-in syndrome - that to me would be a living hell. That prospect is one I cannot accept." MPs reject 'right to die' law British man dies at Dignitas centre Assisted dying debate: The key questions Mr Conway, a retired college lecturer, was once fit and active but motor neurone disease is gradually destroying all strength in his muscles. He cannot walk and increasingly relies on a ventilator to help him breathe.  As his disease progresses, he fears becoming entombed in his body. Mr Conway is being supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, but the issue polarises opinion. Baroness Jane Campbell - a disability rights campaigner - says changing the law would send all the wrong signals. The last major challenge to the law was turned down by the Supreme Court three years ago. It ruled that while judges could interpret the law it was up to Parliament to decide whether to change it. In 2015 MPs rejected proposals to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, in their first vote on the issue in almost 20 years. Supporters of the current legislation say it exists to protect the weak and vulnerable from being exploited or coerced. The case is expected to take up to four days. Assisted suicide - helping or encouraging another person to kill themselves - is illegal under English law. Under the terms of the Suicide Act (1961) for England and Wales, it is punishable by up to 14 year's imprisonment. In Scotland, helping someone take their own life could lead to prosecution. There have been several unsuccessful attempts to change the law, as well as some high-profile cases that have challenged it. 2001: Diane Pretty, who had motor neurone disease, fought a long, and unsuccessfully, legal battle to win the right for her to end her life. She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that her husband should be given immunity from prosecution should he help her to die. She lost and died at a hospice near her home in 2002. 2009: Debbie Purdy, who had multiple sclerosis, won a landmark ruling in 2009 when the courts agreed that it was a breach of her human rights not to know whether her husband would be prosecuted if he accompanied her to a Swiss clinic where she could end her life. That prompted Keir Starmer - the then Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales - to publish guidelines setting out what was taken into consideration when weighing up a prosecution. Debbie died in a hospice in England in 2014. 2012: Two men suffering from locked-in syndrome lost their legal fight to be helped to die. Tony Nicklinson and a man known only as Martin - both left paralysed after a stroke - had argued that doctors should be allowed to end their lives without punishment. Martin argued that the DPP policy on encouraging or assisted suicide was not clear enough for people such as carers to know how they could provide assistance without the risk of being prosecuted. Tony Nicklinson died in August 2012 after refusing food. 2016: The family of deceased locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson and paralysed road accident victim Paul Lamb lose their right-to-die challenges at the European Court of Human rights. They campaigned that disabled people should have the right to be helped to die with dignity.	The High Court has begun hearing the legal challenge of a terminally ill UK man who wants the right to die.
The hosts closed on 152-3, a lead of 128, after 10 wickets fell in the day. Mehedi Hasan Miraz (6-82) reduced England to 144-8 but Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid put on 99 to give England a first-innings lead of 24. However, Imrul Kayes hit an unbeaten 59 and Mohammad Mahmudullah made 47 as Bangladesh regained the initiative. Mahmudullah was bowled by England debutant Zafar Ansari with the final ball of the day after the left-arm spinner had earlier dismissed Tamim Iqbal for his first international wicket. Bangladesh's only victories since their first Test in 2000 have come against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew Another fluctuating Test sees England on the back foot and Bangladesh once again contemplating victory. England's bowlers created little pressure and it isn't immediately obvious who will step up tomorrow morning to bowl Bangladesh out. What is certain is that 250 would take some getting and Bangladesh are well on course for setting England a real challenge. Mehedi, 19, tormented England in the first Test in Chittagong and became only the third spinner to take five wickets in the first innings of each of his first two Test matches. Having taken two wickets on day one to reduce England to 50-3, off-spinner Mehedi bowled Moeen Ali in the third over of the day, with the England all-rounder playing an ill-advised sweep. Ben Stokes was out in the following over, caught off Taijul Islam, bringing Jonny Bairstow to the crease. He put on 45 with Joe Root to steady the visitors after they had slipped to 69-5, but Mehedi returned to trap Bairstow lbw for 24 with his first ball of a new spell - and then had Ansari caught at gully for his fifth wicket of the innings. Media playback is not supported on this device Root batted well to score his 23rd Test half-century, but when Taijul took his wicket England were rocking at 144-8. However, Woakes (46) and Rashid (44) excelled as Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim rotated his bowlers, their partnership of 224 balls and 127 minutes taking England from a deficit of 76 into the lead. The stand was England's highest for the ninth wicket in Asia and was in stark contrast to the Bangladesh innings, where they fell from 171-1 to 220 all out. The partnership perhaps should have been cut short, though. Woakes, on 38 at the time, hit a high full toss from Sabbir Rahman straight to the mid-wicket fielder, but he was given a reprieve when TV umpire Chris Gaffaney judged that the ball had reached the batsman above waist height and gave a no-ball, despite later replays suggesting the wicket should have stood. Woakes was eventually out when Mehedi returned with the new ball and claimed his sixth wicket, while Steven Finn was the last man out for 0 off the bowling of Taijul. Bangladesh's openers Tamim and Kayes batted positively in the final session to wipe out England's lead, reaching 65 before Ansari dismissed Tamim to claim his first Test wicket. England captain Alastair Cook then caught Mominul Haque at slip off Stokes in next over and the tourists seemed to have the momentum. However, Kayes and Mahmudullah played freely to put on 86 before Mahmudullah played a loose attacking shot and was bowled by Ansari with what turned out to be the final ball of the day. Bangladesh scored at almost five runs per over in the final session as Finn and Rashid, both wicketless in the first innings, went at six runs per over, while Woakes conceded 14 from his two overs. England all-rounder Chris Woakes on BBC Test Match Special: "That wicket at the end gives us a bit of hope going into tomorrow. I think we've had a reasonably good day. "We'd have liked to have got a few more runs early on this morning but the partnership between myself and Rash got us up ahead of them. "I don't think the pitch will get any better - it will only get worse, if anything. We've got a long batting line-up but we don't want to chase too many. "It's important when we come out tomorrow we firstly try to keep the run rate down so they don't get away from us, but also look to take wickets. It's a tricky thing to do. "If we can pick up a few early ones, we know they can roll easily."	England face a battle to prevent Bangladesh earning their most famous Test victory after an absorbing second day of the second Test in Dhaka.
Sandwell Councillor Mahboob Hussain is accused of six alleged council code of conduct breaches, according to solicitors Gowling WLG. The law firm was brought in 15 months ago to investigate alleged irregularities in the sale of the authority's former properties. Mr Hussain, now suspended by Labour, denies any wrongdoing. Gowling investigated alleged irregularities in sales from 2011-2013, including three old public toilet blocks and a former coroner's office in Smethwick. A parallel police investigation ended in March with no further action. Publication of Gowling's report had been delayed after legal action by "one of the parties named", the council said, but was published on Friday "in the public interest". Documents leaked to the BBC earlier had shed light on its findings. The authority's chief executive Jan Britton said the "next step" was to refer allegations to its internal disciplinary watchdog-  the standards committee - to consider. Mr Britton said a review would take place to "tighten up council procedures on land sales" and it would "consider if any disciplinary action against employees was required." The allegations set out in the report include: Former economy chief councillor Mr Jones and Mr Hussain stood down from the ruling cabinet after investigations began, but both had their suspensions from the Labour party lifted before elections on 5 May. Mr Hussain has now been suspended afresh, the party confirmed. Tipton Green ward councillor Mr Jones, whom the report said faced no misconduct issue, said he was "pleased" to see the report published and with those conclusions. He added: "Throughout this matter I have always protested my innocence of any wrongdoing and I have always fully co-operated with all investigations." Oldbury ward councillor Mr Hussain gave evidence to the report that he did not know who was buying the toilet blocks because the purchase was through a company name, not the name of his friend. He said he had not been consulted and had not been aware of the price. Mr Hafeez, who was arrested last year, provided no evidence despite requests, the report said. He has not yet responded to further questions from the BBC. Police told him in November 2015 he would face no action. He said in November his arrest "did not relate to the sale or purchase of any former Sandwell Council properties" and he was "considering taking legal action against a number of individuals and organisations". Analysis Behind this saga is no little irony. The council introduced its so-called asset management strategy, under which it planned to streamline its operations into fewer buildings, to reduce its overheads and bring in some money by selling off property it no longer needed, it said to mitigate government cuts. In the months since these investigations began, the council has spent thousands of pounds on solicitors to investigate these serious allegations â€Žand commissioning James Goudie QC to advise the council on whether it could publish the solicitors' work, putting a big dent in any money it might have made on these sales.	Misconduct alleged against a former deputy council leader will be pursued, the authority says.
The Handlebar Club, which is holding the contest as it celebrates its 70th year, first met on 1 April 1947, and according to club secretary Steve Parsons "nothing has changed since then". "There aren't many rules," he said. "But you have to have a moustache of graspable extremities." The club specifies that beards are not allowed, and on its page of FAQs - which provides advice on issues ranging from moustache curlers to moustache cups - it advises people whose interest lies more in beards to contact The British Beard Club. About 100 people are expected at this year's Handlebar annual meeting which takes place at the Dover Marina Hotel. They have travelled from across Europe and from as far afield as the US, Mr Parsons said. On a more serious note, Mr Parsons explained the club, which has monthly meetings in London, raises money for charity. Hirsute conversation lasts for about an hour, and members gather to have a laugh about their "silly moustache", but the club was set up for social reasons. Founded by comedians and broadcasters including Jimmy Edwards, Frank Muir and Raymond Glendenning, the club first met in the dressing room of the Windmill Theatre, London, and was about preserving wartime camaraderie, Mr Parsons said. "It was set up on April Fool's Day just after the war. "Most had been in the RAF and wanted to keep the camaraderie," Mr Parsons explained. "It's a tradition and it's about the Britishness of it all."	The title of best moustache is up for grabs as top lip titans clash in Dover for the honour of being crowned owner of the world's wackiest whiskers.

It is hoped the sale, to be handled by estate agent Knight Frank, will cover the Â£502m debts accrued by a firm which tried to redevelop the landmark site. The 39-acre property is on the Thames and a new public park is planned there. Chancellor George Osborne has confirmed government backing for plans to extend the London Underground's Northern Line into the heart of the area. Stephan Miles-Brown, head of residential development at Knight Frank, said: "This is the first time Battersea Power Station has ever been offered for sale on the open market. "As one of the UK's most recognisable landmarks, Knight Frank anticipates considerable interest in a scheme that is among the most exciting in the world today. "Battersea Power Station is as iconic as the Chrysler Building in New York or the Eiffel Tower, and familiar to people who may have never even been to London." The Grade II listed building opened in 1933 and generated power until 1983. As such any building work would require listed building consent - even minor works, such as painting. It was acquired by Real Estate Opportunities, the majority owner of the holding company, in 2006. Last year its debts on the project were called in by creditors.	Battersea Power Station is being offered for sale on the open market for the first time.
Special Report: The Technology of Business The workplaces that build Africa's future Is teleworking driving us crazy? The tech getting disabled people into work Recruitment robots need impressing Is technology killing the lure of company heritage? If you're not at work catching up when you think the boss isn't looking, you're quite likely to be on the sofa in front of the television. If so then you're not alone. According to research by Nielsen 88% of US tablet owners use them while watching TV at least once a month, with 45% using them several times a day. In the UK, that figure is 80%, with 24% using it daily. These countries may be at the top of the list - but the figures point to a growing trend. Rather than resign themselves to audiences watching with half an eye, while posting pictures of kittens on Facebook, broadcasters are looking for ways to harness this trend to keep viewers engaged. No verifiable eyeballs on your content leads to dwindling advertising income. At IBC, the annual gathering of the broadcast industry in Amsterdam, the rise of the second screen, or companion device (that's a tablet or smartphone to you and me) was the topic of the moment. If the idea of a coming zombie apocalypse keeps you up at night, you may have found yourself watching The Walking Dead for tips. So many of us tuned in that its broadcaster, FX UK, decided to create a companion app for series two that would appeal to viewers, but that would keep those precious eyeballs glued to the screen during the important bits. "It was fascinating to tie [the app] with the idea of gamification with that particular programme, with that fanbase, which seemed to make sense," says Steve Plunkett, chief technology officer at broadcast technology and service provider Red Bee. "But we had no idea how it was going to play out with the public. So we were delighted to see the take-up rates which were great." As well as being popular with audiences, it has also won an IBC innovation award. A bit like Cluedo for the undead, the app lets you predict how many zombies will bite the dust during each episode, who will despatch them, and the most common weapon of choice. As each member of the undead hordes meets their maker, the app notes the kill, who was responsible and how they did it. At the end of the episode viewers discover how close they got, and can then share the results on Facebook and Twitter. "What's interesting is that we can now accurately tie together the two screens," says Mr Plunkett. "We knew exactly what episode you were watching, you just switched on and it figured everything out, and knew exactly where you were in the programme." It uses technology known as audio watermarking, which lets the app work whether you watch live, time-shifted or recorded on your DVR. Tiny chunks of data that are inaudible to humans are embedded in the soundtrack of the show. The device running the app then "listens" as the episode starts, works out which one you are watching and synchronises with it. For content where it's not possible or practical to embed data, audio fingerprinting can be used, where specific audio triggers the synchronisation of an app. For devices that don't have microphones, signals sent via the internet can also be used. Another show with a cult following that has its own companion app is US biker gang saga Sons of Anarchy. The app has evolved over two seasons, according to Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan. "[In our proof of concept app] you see a character you like, you want his hat, you want his jacket. They had all the items already on the website, but by presenting it on this app they really saw a huge uptake of sales. "This year we have a full application that has trivia that gets people really engaged in the show, exclusive on-set photos and some of the writers on the show have contributed to the content in the application." The app also synchronises with each episode, letting viewers track the conversation about episodes on social media - regardless of when they're watching. "We built something called the social timeline so you can actually follow the show through tweets that are happening as things happen specifically in the show. "This really works well in times-shifted environments - different time zones, catch-up TV situations where you still want to follow along the conversation." The next step for Magic Ruby is looking at new ways of making money from these apps. "It would probably be difficult to do the traditional or banner advertising in this space," he says. "So it's how do we get advertisers to do interactive advertising, get involved in the show, it's not just your watching the show and this car commercial that has zero context comes up." John Stoneman of mobile advertising specialists InMobi agrees. "For it to be effective, it needs to be complementary to the user's experience and not obtrusive... and that's one of the great things about the second screen. The consumer has the option to engage if they want to, but it's not forcing them to sit through something they don't want." Mr Stoneman believes broadcasters need to come to terms with second screen devices, and how they're being used. The chief executive of online video platform Brightcove, Jeremy Allaire, believes there's a more radical shift taking place. The company recently launched their app creation platform AppCloud, aimed at letting broadcasters and other content creators build companion apps. "In my mind I think that the current effort is sort of a band-aid or a hack, and the real opportunity is when the full content experience and the applications that interact with that content are all delivered over the internet to tablets or smart TVs." he says. The company is also creating full screen TV apps aimed at content far beyond regular programming. "Dual screen TV apps are about really using the TV set as the second screen. "The tablet becomes the primary screen you interact with, you make choices on, and discover on and the large display is where you have rich media and consume content and information." Perhaps unsurprisingly he has strong views on the future of television. "Linear television is not going to be saved by companion second-screen applications, that's for sure. I think you know more likely 90% of the content that's on linear television should really just be content that's published on demand." Not everyone agrees. Magic Ruby's Robert Gekchyan sees things differently. "I think people still love TV, they love the content, and now they can have the interactivity and the interactivity with their friends. "You're by yourself on the couch and you're watching with multiple people. It's perfect for live events, for sports, for reality shows, water-cooler-type TV shows." No knows what lies ahead - but maybe there's room for something in between. One of the most popular demonstrations at IBC is broadcast software experts NDS' video wall. In their conception of the future the walls of our home become a giant television screen, that integrates with the wallpaper. Content selection is done from a tablet device, and is "thrown" to the wall you want to view it on. This can be anything from movies, television, radio, social media and news to the family calendar, the view from your nannycam, or family photos and videos. It can be any size you want, with as much or as little content on display. Audio is directional, and advertising and other broadcast furniture can be arranged around the picture, leaving the image clean. At the moment screen technology means the bevels are clearly visible between panels. But it doesn't take much imagination to picture technology like Sony's new 4k ultra-high definition television, also on show at the exhibition, or NHK's 8k super hi vision, or even Dolby's glasses-free 3D making the experience even more immersive. Whatever the future holds, one thing is clear. As a species we are likely to become ever more addicted to vast amounts of content - wherever it comes from. As long as the zombies don't get us first...	Where are you reading this?
Devon and Cornwall Police were called to the statue of General Buller in Exeter at 23:40 BST on Saturday. The 18-year-old, from the Exeter area, was climbing on the 15ft (4.5m) statue - a well known landmark which depicts General Redvers Buller on horseback, mounted on a large granite plinth - when he fell. He suffered serious neck and back injuries and died in hospital. More on statue fall and other Devon stories	A man has died after falling from a city centre statue late at night.
The 26-year-old German tore cartilage in his knee during the Premier League defeat by Chelsea on 14 December, coming off after 57 minutes. Kirchhoff was making only his eighth appearance of the season, and had two months out with a hamstring injury. Sunderland, who visit Manchester United on Boxing Day, are 18th in the Premier League and one point from safety. Black Cats forward Duncan Watmore is out for the season with a cruciate knee ligament injury.	Sunderland midfielder Jan Kirchhoff is expected to be out for 12 weeks after having knee surgery.
The sum is on top of more than £1.2bn set aside in previous years' provisions. Parent company National Australian Bank (NAB) said between £350m and £500m more would be set aside this year, but added that the final cost remained uncertain. The move was announced in its third quarter results on Monday. Up until the end of March, NAB had set aside £806m to compensate customers for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). A total of £325m has already been paid out. NAB's cumulative provisions relating to interest rate hedging products amounted to £431m, about half of which has been paid out. This year's extra funding will come from a £1.7bn mis-selling fund, which the bank is being required by UK regulators to make available after the Clydesdale is floated. NAB is in the process of demerging and floating Glasgow-based Clydesdale, which includes the Yorkshire Bank. It intends to complete the break-up by the end of this year. In a statement, NAB said "substantial progress" had been made on the demerger and stock market sale. It will provide more detail with full-year results in late October. The Australian banking group has been working hard to offload the Clydesdale, which amassed a large portfolio of bad property loans. It has also been facing high costs of redress for mis-selling payment protection insurance and complex systems for business customers to protect against interest rate changes.	Clydesdale Bank is to set aside as much as £500m in extra funding this year to compensate customers for mis-selling of financial products.
Mr Gove, the UK environment secretary, said British fishermen would not have the capacity to land all of the fish in British territorial waters. And he said that some access would therefore be granted to vessels from other countries. He was speaking during a fact-finding mission to Denmark, which was largely focused on the Danish food industry. The Danish fishing industry is currently highly-dependent on fish caught in UK territorial waters. The meeting was attended by Niels Wichmann, chief executive of the Danish Fishermen organisation, who told BBC Scotland that there was no suggestion from Mr Gove that Denmark would receive preferential treatment. And he said Mr Gove "did not say numerous countries, he just said other countries" would be granted access. Mr Wichmann added: "The thing is he was just being realistic and he was saying that we need, within the Brexit negotiations phase, to find out where the final goal is, the final solution to the fisheries. "The fisheries will be outside the common fisheries policy and we need a transitional period. In that transitional period we will have to have access from other countries." Mr Wichmann also said that the Danes were seeking a deal that would effectively mean "business as usual" with regard to access to UK fisheries after Brexit. Mr Gove's remarks in Denmark follow an appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr show last month, when he said no foreign boats would be allowed to fish within six to 12 miles of the UK coast. But he said the UK would become an "independent coastal state" after leaving the EU, which would allow it to extend control of its waters up to 200 miles from its coastline. Mr Gove said this would allow the UK to "take control" of its waters, and then negotiate with other countries to allow them access to British fisheries. He also described the EU's common fisheries policy as an environmental disaster, and said the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future. The common fisheries policy has been extremely unpopular among Scottish fishermen, who are said to have overwhelmingly backed Brexit. Anger has generally been focused on quotas for fishing catches and on other European fleets being given equal access to fishing grounds in Scottish waters. Responding to Mr Gove's remarks, Bertie Armstrong of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said: "It is clear from our meetings with the government that control over our waters will be in our hands after Brexit. "We will be out of the Common Fisheries Policy and we will decide who fishes where and for what. Our position is straightforward: we must have first call on quota." But the SNP claimed that the "startling revelations on the Tories' true position over fisheries post-Brexit" showed that "you cannot trust the Tories to stand up for rural Scotland's interests". SNP MSP Stewart Stevenson said: "Michael Gove must immediately make absolutely clear what the UK government's real position on the future of fisheries is. "He could start by confirming that devolved powers over fisheries will transfer to Scotland so that we can get on with developing our own management policies which put Scottish fishing interests, offshore and onshore, first." A spokesman for the UK's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "Leaving the EU means we will take back control of our territorial waters, and for the first time in 50 years we will be able to grant fishing access for other countries on our terms. "We will allocate quotas on the basis of what is scientifically sustainable, making sure we have a healthy marine environment and profitable fishing industry."	Michael Gove has confirmed that some foreign trawlers will still have access to UK waters after Brexit.
In particular, she likes fancy china and plates, and is happy to show off her latest purchase. She ordered a platter online, and took it out of the bubble wrap excitedly. She bought that item, and some more china, toiletries and a bike, on a cashback website so she is expecting about £14 to be paid back to her. But Ms Sen might have to be patient. It will take up to four months for her to be paid. Cashback sites are a simple idea. Instead of going directly to a shop, you access a retailer's online store through a link from a cashback website. You still receive your item directly from the retailer, but you also get some money from the cashback website. It is often a percentage of the total price you paid. The sites have links to retailers of everything from groceries and toiletries, to insurance policies and broadband deals. But Ms Sen has not actually had any money back yet. "I thought it was going to be as easy as one-two-three, just make the purchase to the website and get the cash back the next day," she said. "But that didn't happen. It's been well over a month and I'm still waiting for it." Ms Sen thinks the website is not clear enough about how long that wait will be. "I have no idea how long it's going to take me to get the cash back," she said. She went through one of the biggest cashback sites, Quidco. It says it has more than 2 million members in the UK, and that the average user can make £262 a year. That is small change for its more committed users. Quidco says more than a hundred of them have made over £10,000. But, like all cashback websites, its customers can face long waits for their money to start coming in. Andy Oldham is the company's managing director and said every attempt is made to be clear and transparent. "That's the whole ethos of the site," he said. "On every single merchant page, we've got statistics that show the time it takes for those transactions to be paid out." For example, with the bike Ms Sen bought, the information about the length of time is displayed underneath the deal. We pointed this out to Ms Sen, who said she had never noticed the warning before. She thinks that four months is too long to wait for her money. "It's right down the bottom of the page," she said. "Look how light the shade of the font is. It's just not prominent enough. They need to make it clearer," she added. Despite all this, she says she will carry on using cashback websites. "My attitude is, it's better than getting no money back at all," she said. Quidco's Andy Oldham said he would take Ms Sen's feedback on board. He admitted there was "quite possibly" an argument for rethinking how this information is shown on the website. Mr Oldham maintains that it is impossible to give an average waiting time, because it depends on different retailers and products. So, if you are buying something like food, that will be consumed quickly, you should be paid relatively quickly. On the other hand, if you book a holiday six months in advance, you will not be paid until after you come home. Mr Oldham says it was important that customers realised that cashback arrangements do not pay out immediately. "We're very much dependent on the retailer paying us the advertising commission before we pay it back to the consumer," he pointed out. Another site, TopCashBack, says it works hard to manage consumers' expectations about how long it takes to get their money. But on average, those customers may have to wait 12 weeks for their money to clear into their accounts. There are other things to be aware of if you sign up to a cashback website. Some, like Quidco, charge an annual fee while others take a cut out of your commission. Personal finance expert Sarah Pennells, from the website Savvywoman, says there are dozens of sites to pick from, so it is important to shop around to find the best one for you. "The first thing is to look at how much cash you're going to get back on the various deals and secondly, look at how they're going to pay you," she said. "Some pay by cheque, others by bank transfer, some ask you to set up a PayPal account. "The last thing, and possibly most important thing, is don't just focus on the cashback deal. It's got to be the right deal or buy in the first place," she added.	Swagata Sen likes her home to look good.
The incident was reported near junction 16 at Johnstonebridge at about 14:20. Police said that six vehicles had been involved and lanes on the southbound carriageway were blocked for a time but the route was subsequently cleared. In another incident a car was reported to have ended up on its roof on the northbound carriageway. It follows a string of incidents on the motorway on Sunday in similar weather conditions. Policing units attended about 40 crashes - primarily on the A74(M) - throughout the day. A number were also reported on the A75 near Carrutherstown. "Thankfully the majority of the crashes were fairly minor in nature and as a result there were only three persons slightly injured," said a police spokesman. "The crashes occurred as a result of freak hail showers in various locations throughout the region making driving conditions hazardous. "Please remember that although it is now March and temperatures are generally higher, weather conditions are still very changeable so please take time to have a look at the weather forecast prior to your journey so that you may be better informed of the conditions ahead."	A multi-vehicle crash has taken place during a heavy hail shower on the A74(M) after a spate of incidents in similar conditions on Sunday.
Luke Bennett, 20, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago - a form of inflammatory bowel disease. After medication and steroids failed to improve his condition, he decided to undergo surgery six weeks ago. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme, Mr Bennett said he wanted to help other people like him. Talking about his decision to have surgery, he said: "It was very hard. It was quite a long process really. "In my head I was thinking 'why am I going to wait until I'm really ill to go into surgery when it's inevitable?" Mr Bennett posted the picture on the Crohn's and Colitis UK Facebook page to show what "a normal person" looks like with a colostomy bag. "If you have surgery there's nothing really to worry about... it does get better," he added. Dan McClean, director of marketing at Crohn's and Colitis UK, described Luke as an "inspiration". "We are currently seeing this inflammatory bowel disease being diagnosed in about 10,000 younger people a year," he said. "To see Luke's story is very inspiring for a lot of people."	A student from Swansea University has gone viral after a selfie he took with his colostomy bag was viewed by more than one million people online.
One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were "ready to fight" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Koné said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (£6,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouaké to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Koné said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General Sékou Touré, had threatened "severe disciplinary sanctions" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouaké, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouaké in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011. Many of the mutineers in January were thought to be former rebels who joined the army after the conflict.	Angry soldiers have blocked off access to Bouaké, the second largest city in the Ivory Coast, as a revolt over a pay dispute continues.
Mr Maduro said the room would be kept intact and a wing of the presidential palace turned into a monument to Mr Chavez's "Bolivarian revolution". Mr Chavez died of cancer last month. Following his death, presidential elections were called for 14 April, pitting Mr Maduro against main opposition candidate Henrique Capriles. Mr Capriles says that despite Mr Maduro's attempt at portraying himself as Mr Chavez's heir, the acting president lacks the late leader's charisma. "I'm going to look after it for a few years, but it'll always be Chavez's home," Mr Maduro said referring to the Miraflores Palace in Caracas, where Venezuela's presidents have their office. Full of confidence ahead of Sunday's polls, Mr Maduro said he would "occupy a small office in Miraflores in another wing", so that Venezuelans could roam the rooms of the presidential palace and "learn how the commander had lived, and what he had eaten". Fierce battle Since Mr Chavez died on 5 March, Mr Maduro has cast himself as his natural successor in office. He has called himself "Chavez's son" and said that the late president had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. Speaking last week at the official start of the presidential campaign in the house where Mr Chavez was born, Mr Maduro said a small bird had flown around him three times and looked at him "oddly", at which point he he had felt in his soul it was a message from Mr Chavez. "I felt its blessing, telling us: 'Today the battle begins, go for victory, you have my blessing'," Mr Maduro said. Henrique Capriles mocked Mr Maduro saying that he had "not seen a little bird, but swallowed one, the one he has in his head!" He has also questioned Mr Maduro's ability to lead the country saying that "whatever the outcome, I don't see how Nicolas Maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government". Mr Capriles has dismissed polls that suggest Mr Maduro has an unassailable lead over him. "Of course I can win," he told AFP news agency, "Maduro lacks charisma and leadership". Mr Maduro said his rival was "jealous" and promised to beat him by 10 million votes in Sunday's polls.	Venezuela's acting president Nicolas Maduro says he will turn the office where the late President Hugo Chavez worked into a museum.
Activists want to stop the consumption of dog meat at the festival in the southern city of Yulin which is due to begin later this month. Correspondents say animal rights is a growing concern in China. There have been frequent calls to treat animals more humanely. About 24 activists accompanied by their dogs handed in the petition at the representative office of Yulin city in the Chinese capital, Beijing. They unfurled banners with pictures of their pets alongside the message: "I'm not your dinner." The annual festival - due to begin on 21 June - involves the slaughter of thousands of dogs for human consumption. Figures cited by The Washington Post say about 30 million dogs are killed across Asia every year for their meat, with more than a third of that number killed in China. Opponents say many dogs are either stolen or are strays rounded up for the festival. They say many are caged in cramped conditions before being killed. Campaigning group Humane Society International has described the Yulin event as a "nightmare not a festival". Supporters of the festival argue that dog meat is good for people and eating canines is no different from consuming any other meat. In 2014, the Yulin government distanced itself from the festival, arguing it was organised by private business people and did not have official backing. Celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais have criticised the festival along with Chinese pop star Chen Kun and actors Yang Mi and Fan Bingbing. The tradition of eating dog meat dates back four or five hundred years in China, South Korea and other countries, as it is believed to ward off the heat of the summer months, according to state news agency Xinhua. However, the Yulin festival only began in recent years, Xinhua reported last year.	Animal rights campaigners in China have handed in a petition with 11 million signatures calling for an end to an annual dog-eating festival in the south-west of the country.
The High Court granted the adjournment after hearing a share purchase agreement was due to be completed, which meant HMRC would receive £1.4m. HMRC had applied to put the Formula 1 team, based in Enstone, Oxfordshire, in administration over unpaid tax. On Thursday, Renault confirmed it would take over Lotus. The adjournment was granted by Mr Justice Birss until 21 December, with the completion of the purchase agreement due on 16 December. He approved Lotus' application for the adjournment, which was backed by Renault Sport and not resisted, because the proposed deal was the result most likely to be of benefit to the creditors and the best chance of rescuing the business as a going concern. Other creditors, owed in excess of £2m, would be paid by 31 December, counsel Jeremy Bamford told the court. Renault first announced its intention to take over the cash-strapped team in September. HMRC brought the case against Lotus because of unpaid income tax and National Insurance contributions.	Lotus has been given a further two-week breathing space in insolvency proceedings brought by Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
The latest claim came as a female pupil, who alleged she was raped by a teacher in 1990 while attending its former junior school, spoke to the BBC. Kate, who we are not identifying, told her story to the police two years ago but the case collapsed. Gordonstoun said it was committed to assisting the police. BBC Scotland spoke to Kate, who claimed she was raped by a teacher while on a camping trip in 1990 when she was a 12-year-old pupil at Gordonstoun's prep School, Aberlour House. She eventually told her story to the police but the case collapsed after another witness withdrew her statement at the last minute. Kate, who now lives in England, has now joined a group of former pupils who are pressing for a change in Scotland's corroboration laws and asking the school to deal with the many claims of bullying and abuse. She said: "I do remember feeling very isolated, because it was the first night of the trip it happened. I just had no idea what had just happened to me. "I hold the school in great esteem but obviously there were failings at the time. "An apology is always a nice thing to hear. I know it's a different era but it would be nice to hear an apology." Police Scotland confirmed that it has been contacted by another former pupil in recent days concerning what it calls a historical matter at Gordonstoun. In a statement, Gordonstoun said: "We were shocked and saddened to hear of Kate's account of her experience at Aberlour House. "Cases of this kind must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and we are committed to managing any case of historic abuse as openly as possible, assisting the police with any inquiry and, above all, supporting victims in any way we can. "We have given the investigating police unrestricted access to the archive records we hold for Aberlour House. "We were surprised and disappointed that her case did not go to court and remain available to assist future investigations."	Another former pupil of Gordonstoun public school in Moray has contacted police over claims of historical sexual abuse, it has emerged.
The 25-year-old scored 15 goals in 54 appearances for the U's last season, but has not played a game this term. The Stags say the deal contains an option to agree a permanent move. "This is a young man who I first tried to sign when he was scoring goals in the Scottish Premier League for Dundee," manager Steve Evans told the club website.

But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined. The US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it. As news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration. But there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out. The Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football. This is not just about sport of course. The Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call "internationalisation" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa. The issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote. This time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote. "I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers," he told me. "It is our right." The Palestinians believe their case is strong. They complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games. The point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank. It's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained. The match was abandoned. Palestinian territory is divided into two parts - Gaza and the West Bank. Israel controls all movement into and out of the West Bank through a series of checkpoints and it maintains strict controls at its crossing with Gaza through which players and officials have to travel to play West Bank teams. Israeli sports officials argue they have no control over the policies applied at those checkpoints by Israeli security and intelligence agencies. Mr Blatter made a trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories ahead of the Fifa Congress in what appears to have been a failed attempt to stop the issue from being pushed to a vote. Not long after he left an incident at an Israeli-controlled border crossing with Jordan illustrated the problem. The Palestinian national team was leaving through the checkpoint on its way to play an overseas fixture - it flies through Amman in Jordan, a short drive across the desert rather than from Israel's main airport in Tel Aviv. As they were leaving there were reports that one of their players, Sameh Maarabe, had been arrested by Israeli officials. Israel explained later that Maarabe had been convicted last year of using an overseas trip to smuggle money and messages back into the West Bank on behalf of the militant group Hamas. To Palestinians that's a story about the harassment of a footballer - to Israelis it's about issuing a warning about re-offending to someone who has a criminal record and who happens to be a footballer. There are other grievances too - including the presence on Occupied Palestinian Territory of teams from Jewish settlements which are allowed to play in the Israeli league. But Israel feels it has a positive story to tell about sport. There are Arab players in the Israeli national team and at most top-flight clubs - although there is an exception in that Beitar Jerusalem has often attracted criticism for the racism of its nationalist fans. Former English Premier League star Yossi Benayoun, who's arguably Israel's best-ever player, told me: "Sport is one of the only things that brings people together. In my experience I played with Muslims, Christians and any other religion and it's the same in Israel - during my time in the national team we always played with Arab players and it was the same for them. "I hope it doesn't come to this decision, because it's nothing to do with sport." For now the Israeli sports authorities have left their argument at that, but not everyone in Israel has been so diplomatic. The well-connected Israeli legal campaign group Shurat HaDin, for example, has drawn attention to Jibril Rajoub's membership of the central committee of the Fatah movement, which has an armed wing. It has found several militaristic quotes from Mr Rajoub talking about the Palestinian conflict with Israel and has written to Fifa demanding that he should be expelled, instead of the Israel Football Association (IFA). Their letter is an illustration of the fear inside football that giving in to one expulsion request is bound to trigger others - what if Ukraine should demand the suspension of Russia over the annexation of Crimea for example, when the Russians are scheduled to host the next World Cup? Within the world of sport there's always a tendency to keep difficult issues at bay by arguing that sport and politics don't mix - but of course in extreme cases they do. Both apartheid-era South Africa and the now-vanished Yugoslavia led by Slobodan Milosevic were expelled from international bodies - the Palestinian chances of success at Fifa will depend on persuading enough delegates that their case matches those precedents. Israel for now seems confident - partly because Sepp Blatter has clarified that the rules for suspension require a 75% majority, and partly because, in the words of the Israeli expert on international law Alan Baker, this is "a familiar grievance in a new forum". The dramatic arrests which overshadowed the start of the Fifa Congress may have shifted the spotlight from the Palestinian case for now but this is an issue that won't go away. Whatever happens to the proposal in 2015, there is nothing to stop the Palestinians from putting it back on football's agenda in the future.	The football bureaucrats of the world were probably expecting to make global headlines as they gathered for the Fifa Congress in Zurich.
The 53-year-old German was last seen on Saturday afternoon, when he went to cycle part of the South West coastal path between Newquay and Sennen. The search involved the coastguard helicopter, cliff teams, lifeboat crews and police. Devon and Cornwall Police said a body was recovered by the Sennen lifeboat near Land's End. A police spokesman said he was unable to confirm the identity of the dead man.	A search team looking for a missing tourist have found a man's body at the foot of cliffs in Cornwall.
The 40-year-old former New Zealand player is currently forwards coach at Clermont Auvergne and he previously held a similar position at Leinster. Gibbes will work under director of rugby Les Kiss, while current head coach Neil Doak's future is unclear. "The respect I have for Les as a coach and person was one of my main reasons for making this decision," said Gibbs. Ulster are sixth in the Pro12 table and out of the European Champions Cup in what has been a largely disappointing season. "Les sold his vision of where he wants to take Ulster over the next few years," added Gibbes. "Ulster is a team that I know well, having come up against them on a number of occasions. The Clermont-Ulster games this season gave me an insight into the strengths of the squad and it's exciting to think that I'll be part of that environment from next season." Gibbes, who joined Leinster in 2008 and won three Heineken Cups during his spell in Dublin, said: "With six years at Leinster and three at Clermont in the Top 14, I've been afforded many different experiences, working with some very talented coaches and players. "I hope to apply what I've learned to the role at Ulster and my family and I are looking forward to integrating into a strong community in Belfast." He moved to France in 2014 and was part of a coaching set-up that guided Clermont to the Top 14 and Champions Cup finals in his debut season. "Jono's CV speaks for itself and I know that he's looking forward to joining Ulster and working with the team," said Kiss, 52. "Since his retirement from playing, Jono has had an integral role in the coaching teams of two of European rugby's most successful sides. "Jono's expertise as a forwards coach is obvious, however his wealth of knowledge in other areas of the game will be really important for us." "A review of the coaching structure is ongoing ahead of next season and the appointment of Jono as head coach is the first part of that process. "A further announcement will be made in the coming weeks, which will focus on getting the right balance in our coaching team."	Jono Gibbes is to become the head coach of Pro12 side Ulster on a two-year deal in the summer.
Denise Fergus said she had been "let down so many times by the system" but that she would continue to "fight". Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of killing two-year-old James in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993. Mrs Fergus said she believed Venables was capable of harming other people if he was released from prison. He was recalled to prison in 2010. He had been released from prison in 2001, having served seven years of a life sentence, but was recalled when he pleaded guilty to downloading and distributing indecent images of children. Mrs Fergus, speaking to the BBC to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing, said: "Do not release him. I still don't think he's capable of walking amongst other people. "He will do someone else harm. It's in him, and I strongly believe if he's released he will go on to hurt someone else." Thompson, who was also released in 2001 after eight years in detention, was given a new secret identity and address. Venables was aged 10 when he and Thompson abducted and murdered James, beating him with bricks and iron bars and leaving his body on a railway line. James' mother described it as "a stupid, silly little mistake" of hers to let go of her child's hand for a few seconds on 12 February 1993 at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle. She said it "still feels so raw to this day". "I still can't understand how it happened, or why it happened." Mrs Fergus set up a charity, named after her son, to support young people who have become the victims of crime, hatred or bullying. Asked if, after 20 years, she should move on, Mrs Fergus said: "Why should I let it go? They took the most precious thing away from me. I won't let it go. And I've always said if there's a fight there to be fought, then I'll fight it for James. "If I let go of that now I will feel I've let James down.  That is something I'll never do, I'll never let James down. I want justice for James. He's never had justice." She has campaigned to have both men kept in prison, and said: "I did warn [the authorities] that one of them or both of them would go on to reoffend, and I was proven right with Venables." She said her family - her husband and three sons - mention James often. "I think the day I stop talking about him is the day I give up on life, but I'll never stop talking about him, never stop remembering him."	The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger says she still "wants justice" 20 years after her son's death.
Ronan Toolis led the excavation works at Trusty's Hill Fort at Gatehouse of Fleet. It unearthed evidence that it might have been the royal seat of the sixth century kingdom of Rheged. Mr Toolis said it was "pre-eminent among the kingdoms of the north" at that time. The location of Rheged had previously been thought by many historians to be in Cumbria. However, Dr Christopher Bowles, co-director of the excavation work in Dumfries and Galloway, said that may not have been the case. "The new archaeological evidence from Trusty's Hill enhances our perception of power, politics, economy and culture at a time when the foundations for the kingdoms of Scotland, England and Wales were being laid," he said. "The 2012 excavations show that Trusty's Hill was likely the royal seat of Rheged, a kingdom that had Galloway as its heartland. "This was a place of religious, cultural and political innovation whose contribution to culture in Scotland has perhaps not been given due recognition." Dr Bowles said the influence of the kingdom had "rippled through the history and literature of Scotland and beyond". Mr Toolis added that they had not been looking for Rheged when they started the excavations. "What drew us to Trusty's Hill were Pictish symbols carved on to bedrock here, which are unique in this region and far to the south of where Pictish carvings are normally found," said Mr Toolis. "The Galloway Picts Project was launched in 2012 to recover evidence for the archaeological context of these carvings. "But far from validating the existence of Galloway Picts, the archaeological context revealed by our excavation instead indicates the carvings relate to a royal stronghold and place of inauguration for the local Britons of Galloway around AD 600. "The new archaeological evidence suggests that Galloway may have been the heart of the lost Dark Age kingdom of Rheged, a kingdom that was in the late sixth century pre-eminent amongst the kingdoms of the north." The two men have produced a new book which details their findings. The Lost Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged is being launched in Gatehouse of Fleet on Saturday.	Archaeological research at a site in Galloway has suggested it may have been at the heart of a "lost kingdom" from the Dark Ages.
The presenter succeeded Jonathan Ross as host of the revamped weekly show and said leaving "wasn't an easy decision". Winkleman, who also co-hosts Saturday night show Strictly Come Dancing, said the show "simply deserves someone who can give it their all". A new series will return this autumn with the new presenter to be announced "in due course", the BBC said. Winkleman, who lists The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption as her favourite films, said: "I'm incredibly sad about leaving the film show and it wasn't an easy decision. "At this time of year I juggle all kinds of things for TV and radio and the show simply deserves someone who can give it their all." She added that she would miss film critic Danny Leigh, who presents the show alongside her, and the team behind the show. Mark Bell, BBC head of arts commissioning, said: "We've loved having Claudia on Film 2016 and I'd like to thank her for all her hard work and commitment to the show." The long-running film show, first broadcast 45 years ago, was fronted by film critic Barry Norman for 26 years. He was succeeded by Ross in 1999, who stayed at the helm for 11 years. Winkleman will still present the BBC's The Great British Sewing Bee and host a Radio 2 show. After landing the job on Strictly in 2014 when Sir Bruce Forsyth left, the mother-of-three said of her TV and radio commitments, she would "make it work". The 14th series of Strictly gets under way on Saturday evening, with Olympians, actors and singers competing for the glitterball trophy.	Claudia Winkleman has quit the BBC's movie review show, Film 2016, after six years of fronting the programme.
The rail union is calling on the Scottish government to set out an immediate timetable for Abellio to be stripped of its ScotRail franchise. It has said making Scotland's railways safer can only be done with a publicly-owned service. ScotRail said it had invested hundreds of millions of pounds on new trains and improved technology. Protests are being held at railway stations across the country. The RMT claims that Dutch firm Abellio is plundering a Â£1m-a-month profit which Scotland's railways desperately need. A Scottish government spokesman said: "Any notion excessive profits are siphoned off is quite simply a fallacy." Abellio was awarded the ScotRail franchise in 2015 for 10 years but could be stripped of the contract after five years if punctuality falls below 84.3%. ScotRail said the union's comments bore no scrutiny. It accepted that performance had dipped, but insisted it was still around 90%. Almost 20,000 people have signed a petition calling on Transport Minister Humza Yousaf to "make ScotRail bosses improve Scotland's trains or strip them of their contract". ScotRail was recently fined Â£483,000 for failing to meet required standards for trains and stations. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week indicated that stripping the company of its contract to run the railways was on the table if performance failed to improve. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT is campaigning to make Scotland's trains safer, more secure and accessible. "This can only be done with a publicly-owned service where profit isn't the main motive of the operator." He added: "RMT calls on the Scottish government to set out a timetable for bringing ScotRail under public ownership, and with the current level of anger that's reinforced in the petition there can be no excuse for the dragging of heels. "The union is available for talks with ministers to take the issues of safe staffing, investment and public ownership forwards." A ScotRail spokesman said: "These comments bear no scrutiny whatsoever. "Performance has dipped by around 1% - but is still tracking around the 90% mark - and we have a robust performance improvement plan to rectify that. "At the same time, we are investing hundreds of millions of pounds on new trains, refurbishing our existing fleet and introducing queue-busting smart technology to keep people moving." A Scottish government spokesman said: "This government has ensured profits are capped, that this cap is tighter than any previous franchise and that at least 50% of revenue above that cap is reinvested into our railways. "A manifesto commitment was made to facilitate a public sector bid for our railways and ministers remain firmly committed to this. "Currently, 89 trains out of 100 arrive within five minutes of the timetable - our contract demands 91. "That is why we asked ScotRail to implement the improvement plan which looks at addressing service-quality issues and tackling congestion, while minimising 'skip stopping', until new train fleets arrive." The spokesman added: "We fully expect ScotRail to hit their anticipated targets to lift performance. "This contract will deliver very real improvements across the term - new and better trains, improvements at stations, initiatives on fares and a revolution in the end-to-end journey experience."	The RMT union is staging a day of protests in support of "safer Scottish railways".
The incident happened on the 20:14 service, between Keith and Elgin, on Friday 16 June at about 21:20. The suspect - believed to be travelling with about seven other men - then got off the train at Elgin. He was white, about 25, and 6ft tall. He was wearing a black and white top and sunglasses. Det Con Nick Ritchie, of British Transport Police, said: "No-one has the right to treat another person like that. "We're determined to stamp out this kind of behaviour from our rail network, so please, if you know this man, let us know." Anyone with information can text 61016 or call 0800 40 50 40, quoting reference 682 of 16 June.	An appeal for witnesses has been made after a woman was inappropriately touched on a train travelling between Aberdeen and Inverness.
Third seed Murray plays Italian 25th seed Andreas Seppi in the third match on Centre Court at around 17:00 BST. Ward, ranked 110th, takes on Canada's Vasek Pospisil in the second match on court one at around 15:00. "It's great for British tennis and it's great for everyone involved that more people are winning matches and doing well," said Ward. "I've got to worry about my match. Andy worries about his." Media playback is not supported on this device Murray, 28, practised with Ward on Friday and the pair have become good friends over the past two years. "We've done a few training blocks together," said the Scot. "He stayed with me in Miami a few times. "I watch a lot of his matches online when he's playing challengers and stuff. I kind of say, 'Well done,' or let him know what I thought about the match, anything like that. See if I can help in any way." Ward is through to the last 32 of a Grand Slam for the first time and the 28-year-old Londoner has ensured he will break into the world's top 100 for the first time in the next rankings. He will face 25-year-old Pospisil, the reigning Wimbledon doubles champion, for the first time at the top level. "I know him pretty well," said Ward, who will collect at least £77,000 in prize money. "He's a good friend of mine actually. We spend a lot of time together. In the last few years, we've played a couple of times as well in the Challenger tour, a couple bigger matches in the semis and finals in the past. "We both know each other's games, so there's not too many secrets. As I say, it's a great chance for both of us." Murray has won six of his seven matches against Seppi, the only defeat coming on grass in Nottingham eight years ago. The 31-year-old Italian has reached two finals this year and beat Roger Federer at the Australian Open in January. "He has had such good results this year," said Murray. "He made the final a couple of weeks ago in Halle, plays well on the grass. "He won against Roger at the Australian Open this year. He's capable of playing some top tennis."	Andy Murray will have friend and fellow Briton James Ward for company in the third round of Wimbledon on Saturday.
Media playback is not supported on this device After an even first 30 minutes, Danny Wright tapped in from James Dayton's free-kick to put the Robins in front. But Tubbs levelled after the restart, latching onto Maxime Biamou's header and slotting in from 10 yards out. Robert Dickie headed against the bar for the Robins late on, before Deacon fired in to win the game in added time. Sutton have won just one of their past eight games in the National League - including a 6-0 home defeat by Dover on Tuesday - but Deacon's late heroics earned them a place in third round for the first time in 22 years. The U's have twice gone even further in the competition, reaching the fourth round in 1970, and again in 1989 after they famously beat First Division Coventry City in round three. They will receive £27,000 for getting through the second round, and could earn a lucrative tie with Premier League or Championship opposition when the third round draw takes place on Monday.

The charity said the new technology would provide an alternative to road ambulance journeys, offering significantly quicker transport of vulnerable babies between hospitals. The service began carrying Babypods for emergency missions in 2013. But the new incubators will attach to existing equipment in the helicopter, providing warmth and oxygen. They also have a transparent chamber, allowing babies to be monitored during flights. Welsh medics went to Switzerland to help in the design process and, at a cost of Â£70,000 each, two new incubators have been bought by NHS Wales. They will be used on Wales Air Ambulance's newest helicopter, the fourth in its fleet. Weighing 15st 10lb (100kg), the incubators will be fitted to a sled and require two people to lift them into the air ambulance. Since April 2015, helicopter crews have been joined on board by consultant doctors. Dr Dindi Gill, the Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service Cymru interim director, said: "Having the incubator system will further enhance the ability of the EMRTS teams to manage neonates born at home or in hospital. "It is recognised that temperature control is extremely important to this group of patients and, therefore, we welcome the ability to carry the incubator on Wales Air Ambulance's helicopters." Following crew training, the incubator service will run as a trial to the end of 2016.	The most advanced flight incubators in the UK for sick babies will be used by Wales Air Ambulance later this month.
They have since been released but will be charged with public order offences. Holidaymakers ran and hid from presumed attackers in Platja d'Aro after people pretended to be chasing a celebrity, shouting and taking photographs. The panic turned into a stampede as bystanders mistook selfie sticks for weapons. Eleven people were treated for bruising and heart palpitations. Three were taken to hospital. Police were called to the centre of the town following reports that shots had been fired. The reports turned out to be false. Videos on social media showed children in tears as people around them cowered under tables. The German newspaper Die Welt (in German) said that about 200 people took part in the flashmob, which was organised by several Germans. Apparently those taking part were invited on social media to go down to Platja d'Aro on Tuesday evening and behave like paparazzi. The detained women, aged between 20 and 25, were in the Costa Brava town accompanying a youth group trip. The president of Catalonia tweeted that some things should not be joked about. He also praised the reaction from the town council and police.	Five German women were arrested on Tuesday night when a flashmob stunt in a northern Spanish town  sparked fears of a terrorism attack.
A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright. Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues. The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal. The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported. Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation. "Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented," the statement said. Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright. Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are "pervasive" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices. "We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers," said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes. In the wake of the Volkswagen emissions deceit, the EFF said car manufacturers' software should not be protected from independent scrutiny. "When you entrust your health, safety, or privacy to a device, the law shouldn't punish you for trying to understand how that device works and whether it is trustworthy," Walsh blogged. The new rules must be renewed in three years, he said. Some US government agencies expressed serious reservations about the new rules, and the Environmental Protection Agency flatly opposed them. "EPA explained that vehicle modifications are often performed to increase engine power or boost fuel economy, but that these modifications increase vehicle emissions and thus violate the Clean Air Act," the Library of Congress said in its final rule. However, the new rules do not allow vehicle owners to break any other laws, the Library said, and will not take effect for a year so the EPA and other agencies have time to prepare.	Security researchers have been given the green light to hunt for flaws in car software by US authorities.
Tall and like football? Go and play centre-back. Enjoy rugby union and have a bit of pace? Winger. Step forward Somerset's Dom Bess, who took 6-28 on his County Championship debut on Tuesday. How did he come to bowl off-spin? "I was always a little porker when I was younger, so I never took the long run-up," he said. "I always took five or six steps and just trotted in." Bess now has the best figures by a Somerset debutant for 55 years, since Tony Pearson returned 7-63 against Worcestershire in 1961, according to the Guardian. But any 'puppy fat' the 19-year-old may have had has long gone, with the help of strength and conditioning coach Darren Veness. "I met Daz and he made me run a lot, which I'm grateful for now," Bess told BBC Radio Bristol. "Ask Daz about me, I was always a porker." Just a month ago Bess, from Sidmouth, was taking 6-65 for Devon in the Minor Counties Championship as they lost to bottom-of-the-table Oxfordshire. At Taunton, however, his victims included Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott, who have played a combined total of 170 Tests for England. His family have a strong presence in the sport, with cousins Zac and Josh also representing Devon, but who was at the County Ground to watch his moment of glory? "Dad was on holiday and mum was working, so I just had my girlfriend, her parents and a couple of my mates (watching)," he said. "I think dad will be a bit disappointed - he's gone to Greece, somewhere like that, for a week away."	Whether it comes down to skill level, body shape, or pure accident, anyone who has played a sport will have some memory of how they came to be given a particular role.
They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are "of particular interest" and could help show who was behind the crash. But they say they have not proved their "causal connection" with the crash. MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board. There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner. About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest. Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia. Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame. How a missile could have brought down MH17 MH17: What we know A tale of two sisters and flight MH17 Air disaster that touched a nation The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been "secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine". "The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts," the statement said. Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system. "We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17," he added. "If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough." The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash. The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile. The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system. The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question. The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added. The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia. They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October. The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage. Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as "premature" and "counterproductive". The Boeing 777 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was brought down on 17 July last year in Donetsk region.	Fragments of a suspected Russian missile system have been found at the Flight MH17 crash site in Ukraine, investigators in the Netherlands say.
Gosport Borough Council says it brought in the £100 fines to combat dog mess and poorly controlled dogs. Previously walkers were allowed to walk up-to six charges, but this has been curbed with the new Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO). One professional dog walker said it will affect business. Nick Lower, who runs Gosport Dog Walking, said: "There are a few professional dog walkers who are going to be affected, and members of the public as well." Sue McNaughton, who will now have to walk her five huskies in two packs said: "I understand where [the council] are coming from, but they're penalising the many because of the few. "I wouldn't walk five dogs if I didn't think I could control them." Councillor Graham Burgess said: "In a densely-populated borough like Gosport, we do believe new rules are needed." Some residents are happy about the change, including Jenny Brown who said: "I'm pleased this has come into focus. I've had so many problems when encountering larger groups of dogs." Similar fines are in place in other areas including Oxford. In 2011 the council brought in fines for people walking more than four dogs after complaints of packs being out of control. Councillor John Tanner said: "With more than four dogs, you are not taking your dog out for a walk but a pack of potentially dangerous animals for a riot around the park."	Fines for people who walk more than four dogs at a time have come into force in a Hampshire town.
Mr Houchen beat Labour's Sue Jeffrey by a little over 2,000 votes after second preference votes were counted. Liberal Democrat Chris Foote Wood was third and UKIP's John Tennant finished last. Mr Houchen will have a budget of Â£15m a year. In another result, Labour retained control of Durham County Council despite losing 20 seats. The party won 94 seats in the 2013 election and that has now fallen to 74. Independent candidates have the second highest number of seats (28) followed by Liberal Democrats (14) and Conservatives (10). Council leader Simon Henig said he was "very pleased" to have retained a majority in a "challenging" election. As Tees Valley mayor, Mr Houchen will head the Tees Valley Combined Authority, made up of Darlington, Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough and Stockton councils. After the declaration at Thornaby Pavilion, Mr Houchen said: "What we have seen in recent years is fantastic trends towards the Conservatives across the Tees Valley and today is, I believe, a tipping point. "We have seen a political earthquake that's happening right here for the Conservatives across the North East. "It's the first time anybody would expect a Conservative mayor for the Tees Valley and it is the start of five genuine target seats for the Conservatives in the upcoming general election, and I genuinely believe this is a starting point for turning the Tees Valley blue." This is a sensational vote for the Conservatives. Beating Labour in the first round, we perhaps thought Labour might claw it back with second preference votes. They were counted then but actually Conservatives pulled further ahead and Ben Houchen beat Sue Jeffrey the Labour candidate in a runoff to become the Tees Valley mayor. He has now got to deliver on certain promises, one of which is to take control of Durham Tees Valley Airport and try to revive its fortunes. He talked about turning the Tees Valley blue in the general election in just over a month's time and that will be the Conservative focus now.	Conservative Ben Houchen has become the inaugural Tees Valley mayor after winning a tightly-fought contest.
Ashley Sibery, 39, persuaded Sital Sibery to take the class A drug minutes after she confronted him about his drug habit in their home. It happened on 2 April 2012 at their London Street property. Sibery pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. The court heard that when Mrs Sibery decided to confront her husband because of his erratic behaviour, the GP admitted he had been using the narcotic for two months. She told him if he did not quit his addiction, she would end his marriage to him. But despite the ultimatum, Sibery managed to persuade his wife into taking what was supposed to be his final fix. The court heard how Sibery wanted his wife to experience the feeling he got when he took the heroin. However, Mrs Sibery collapsed and started having difficulties breathing. The court also heard that Sibery, who was on bail for the offence, was now in the care of a consultant psychiatrist who was helping him to tackle his problems, and that he and his wife were still together. Sheriff Jarvie told Sibery that she would pass sentence on him at a hearing next month.	A drug-addicted doctor watched his wife lose consciousness and struggle for breath moments after injecting her with heroin in Edinburgh, a court has heard.
The pipe in Chester Green, Derby, burst at about 04:30 GMT on Sunday, sending water gushing along Mansfield Road. Ivy House School and Carlyle Infant School in Littleover were closed, while people in Chaddesden, Littleover and Mackworth reported brown water coming from taps. Severn Trent Water said it could take up to five days to fix the problems. Mansfield Road has been shut to traffic and bus services have been re-routed. Sarah O'Kane from Severn Trent apologised for the inconvenience and said reasons for the pipe failure would not be known until the road had been dug up. Shops and businesses on Mansfield Road are still open.	Two schools have been closed after a burst water pipe flooded the area with mud and silt.
Media playback is not supported on this device Koeman has advised midfielder James McCarthy not to join the Ireland squad after previously saying he had been "massively overloaded" by the Republic. Republic manager Martin O'Neill said this week that Koeman was "bleating" about the matter. Keane added: "Maybe Everton need to look at their own training schedule." McCarthy, 25, has been ruled out of the Republic's World Cup qualifier against Austria on Saturday because of a hamstring injury. He has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the Republic's qualifier wins over Georgia and Moldova last month. That angered Everton boss Koeman, who has only seen McCarthy play 33 minutes of competitive action for the Premier League club since then. However, Keane says he "could not care less" about Koeman's concerns - and also criticised previous Toffees manager Roberto Martinez. "Everton traditionally have always had brilliant Irish players doing well for the football club, so they shouldn't be so quick to stop Irish players coming to play for Ireland," said the former Manchester United midfielder. "We have had a problem previously with Martinez - I think he was slightly over the top. "Every time, we felt, the Everton players were turning up - and this is not a criticism of the players, this is more from Everton and their staff - they were always carrying knocks. "I always felt the Everton players were going to turn up on crutches or crawling in the hotel door, and now it looks like we are probably going to have that issue again with Koeman. I hope not. "Maybe Everton as a club need to - and it's a brilliant football club - maybe their players need to toughen up a little bit." Media playback is not supported on this device	Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane says Everton players must "toughen up" in an ongoing row with Goodison boss Ronald Koeman.

The Brownlee brothers did not compete, with their focus on this year's World Series competition and the Rio Olympic test event. Benson completed the event in one hour 48 minutes 31 seconds. He was ahead of Portugal's Joao Silva (+11 seconds) and Rostyslav Pevtsov (+33secs) of Azerbaijan. After a strong swim, British team-mates Bishop (16th) and Philip Graves (46th) played a crucial role in helping Benson to the lead during the cycling phase. During the 10km run he broke free from the chasing pack and although the Leeds-based triathlete was briefly caught by Aleksandr Latin of Estonia he soon re-established his lead. "I couldn't have done it without Tom and Phil," said Benson. "It was a real team effort. It's a shame we couldn't all get medals - but getting the gold is brilliant." London 2012 gold medallist Alistair Brownlee and world title-winning brother Jonny are expected to secure further Rio Olympic places for Team GB through performances at the qualification event in Brazil in August. Benson will now hope to be included in World Series races and the Rio test event in order to enhance his prospects of a place in the squad for the Rio Olympics. Triathlon, which consisted of a 1.5km swim, 40km cycle and 10km run in the European Games, is one of three sports included in Baku 2015 which have direct qualification possibilities for next year's Olympics in Brazil.	Gordon Benson claimed Great Britain's first European Games gold medal with victory in the men's triathlon in Baku, Azerbaijan.
Saints had the better of a scrappy first-half, after Jonny Lomax crossed on the back of penalty goals apiece for both sides. Leeds pulled clear when Adam Cuthbertson added to Ryan Hall's score. Danny Richardson's try kept Saints hopes alive but Leeds held on and are now three points clear of third-placed Hull FC in the Super League table. The defeat leaves Saints a point behind Wakefield, who are fourth with four Super 8s games to play. Leeds cannot catch Castleford Tigers at the top, but are in the box seat for the second home semi-final come the top four play-offs. Headingley's impending redevelopment meant this game was to be the last for the 86-year-old roofed terrace, and it added an emotional tinge to a match that held huge significance to the race for Old Trafford. Unfortunately the pre-match festivities failed to transfer to the field, as neither side found their rhythm in a game high on drama but lacking in quality. Saints' best moment of the first half produced the game's first try when Lomax latched on to Zeb Taia's pass after James Roby put the back-rower into space. The hosts were equally disjointed but gave the crowd some cheer when a smart move to the left was finished off by Ryan Hall on his 300th club appearance. Cuthbertson bashed his way across on the back of Leeds pressure but it was never comfortable until the hooter, particularly when the lively Richardson came off the bench to step his way across the stripe with five minutes to go. Leeds Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott: "I thought we were extremely good, I've never not been proud of out players although I don't say it too much. I'm proud to be their coach tonight. "I don't know where we go the second half from, Saints were great, beating us off the deck in the first half and we never got to grips with their play-the-balls. "We rolled up our sleeves and did some hard work, we should have executed better. It was a great game of rugby league." St Helens head coach Justin Holbrook: "I couldn't be prouder of my team. Unfortunately that's two weeks in a row we've been beaten by two points. "I don't think we played poorly. We didn't have much ball in the second half, we were camped in our own half, but we got within two points away from home against a very tough side. "We just couldn't get going for one reason or another in the second half but full credit to Leeds, they played very well." Leeds Rhinos: Walker; Briscoe, Watkins, Sutcliffe, Hall; Moon, McGuire; Cuthbertson, Parcell, Singleton, Ward, Jones-Buchanan, Ablett Replacements: Burrow, Delaney, Keinhorst, Mullally St Helens: Lomax; Makinson, Morgan, Percival, Grace; Fages, Smith; Amor, Roby, Thompson, Taia, Wilkin, Knowles. Replacements: Walmsley, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Peyroux, Richardson	Leeds Rhinos saw off the soon-to-be demolished iconic South Stand with an error-strewn win over St Helens.
The homes are planned to be for social or mid-market rent and it is hoped they will all be completed by 2021. Glasgow City Council's executive committee also approved £20m to improve existing housing. Of this, £14m was announced last month as part of scheme to upgrade homes and make them available for social renting. The £34m four-year improvement and repair scheme is also being funded with £20m from the Scottish government. The funding to build homes is to be channelled through housing associations over the next four years. Eight sites in the area have been identified for development. As part of the strategy, Govanhill Housing Association has also committed £3.7m to new housing and repairs for the duration of the four year period. Overall this means there are plans to invest more than £44m in housing in Govanhill over the next four years. Councillor George Redmond: "This is an impressive document and points to the way ahead in Govanhill." "Significant sums are being invested in Govanhill and it is great news that part of that money will go towards new housing. "The council has been working exceptionally hard to turn things around in Govanhill and we are starting to see real progress being made." He said that while the council was keen to work with all property owners in Govanhill, he warned the council would use power of compulsory purchase against those who refused to get on board with the plans.	About 350 homes are to be built in the Govanhill area of Glasgow under a £6.4m council initiative to help "turn the area around".
The dinosaurs were able to make the journey when a spell of warming allowed passage over frozen land bridges between the continents. Two fossil discoveries in Australia shed new light on this theory. Both specimens are sauropods - a group of large, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads. Further classified as titanosaurs, they are among the largest dinosaurs ever to walk the Earth. Lead researcher Dr Stephen Poropot, of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum, said the specimens add to our knowledge of the area 95 to 98 million years ago. "We get a much better idea of the overall fauna," he said. "And as a result we can start piecing together how climate affected these dinosaurs, how the positions of the continent affected those dinosaurs and how they evolved through time as well." One of the dinosaurs was found near the town of Winton in Central West Queensland. It has been named Savannasaurus elliottorum after members of the Elliott family, who found the fossil in a pile of bones while rounding up sheep at their property. The skeleton has been pieced together from 17 pallets of bones encased in rock - a process that took 10 years. The researchers also uncovered head bones from another sauropod species Diamantinasaurus matildae. "This new Diamantinasaurus specimen has helped to fill several gaps in our knowledge of this dinosaur's skeletal anatomy," said Dr Poropat. "The braincase in particular has allowed us to refine Diamantinasaurus' position on the sauropod family tree." The two specimens have helped to show that titanosaurs were living worldwide by 100 million years ago. This became possible because of the arrangement of the continents and changes in the global climate. Prof Paul Upchurch, of University College, London, said Australia and South America were connected to Antarctica throughout much of the Cretaceous. When Savannasaurus was alive, 95 million years ago, global average temperatures were warmer than they are now, but it was quite cool at the poles. "We suspect that the ancestor of Savannasaurus was from South America, but that it could not and did not enter Australia until approximately 105 million years ago," he said. "At this time global average temperatures increased allowing sauropods to traverse landmasses at polar latitudes." The research is published in N Scientific Reports. Follow Helen on Twitter @hbriggs.	Some of the giants of the dinosaur family may have originated in South America and crossed over Antarctica to Australia about 100 million years ago.
Luiz, 27, joined the Blues from Benfica for £21.3m in January 2011. "The move is now subject to David Luiz agreeing personal terms with PSG and passing a medical," a statement on Chelsea's official website read. The Brazilian has three years left on the five-year contract he signed at Stamford Bridge in September 2012. He said on Twitter: "Thanks CFC for this time of great partnership. I'm thankful for all! It's a new challenge and together we'll go even further. Allez Paris!" Luiz has been the subject of interest from Barcelona in the last two summers, but French champions PSG - despite recently failing Uefa's financial fair play (FFP) rules - will break the transfer record for a defender to secure his services. Luiz is not part of manager Jose Mourinho's first-choice central defensive pairing and his exit would provide funds to strengthen in other areas, especially as Chelsea themselves only narrowly complied with FFP rules. Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is among those linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. Because of FFP, Chelsea cannot afford to spend heavily on incoming players unless they recoup similar amounts from outgoings - which they could, and did, in the earlier years of owner Roman Abramovich's reign. The new financial restrictions, coupled with Mourinho's plans from a footballing perspective, are now at the forefront of the club's thinking and also explain the £37.1m sale of midfielder Juan Mata to Manchester United in January. All 12 of Luiz's goals for the Blues came in his first two-and-a-half seasons and although he played 34 games during the 2013-14 campaign, Mourinho prefers John Terry and Gary Cahill at centre-half and Luiz is not seen as a long-term option in midfield. Chelsea have high hopes for 21-year-old Czech Tomas Kalas and 19-year-old Englishman Nathaniel Chalobah as defensive options. The Blues also spent £12m on St Etienne centre-back Kurt Zouma in January.	Chelsea have agreed a deal with Paris St-Germain, worth in the region of £40m, for the sale of defender David Luiz to the French champions.
The defendants allegedly used "unofficial" company credit cards for luxury purchases, unconnected with their duties as board members. Prosecutors say about €12m (£10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel. Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense. The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011. How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012. The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank. Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. "You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way. Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia. If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m. Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption. Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared. Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases. French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him. In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of "aggravated pimping" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes. Mr Strauss-Kahn's successor at the IMF, Christine Lagarde, is to go on trial in France in December over a state award of €285m in damages to tycoon Bernard Tapie when she was finance minister. She is accused of "negligence", but denies any misconduct.	Former IMF chief Rodrigo Rato and 64 other bankers have gone on trial in Madrid over an alleged credit card racket at Spain's troubled Bankia bank.
Dunelm House was built in the 1960s and although fans believe it to be a prime example of the architecture, it has not been given listed status. The university said the concrete structure needed repairs costing Â£14.7m and wants to demolish it. A petition calling for it to be refurbished and maintained has attracted hundreds of signatures. The building splits opinion in the city, with some residents referring to it as a "concrete carbuncle". However, architect James Perry, from the Something Concrete and Modern project, which is documenting post-war buildings, described it as "brilliant" and "incredibly polite for a modernist building". He said: "It is expensive to demolish and dispose of a building. "I would say as an architect we need to be looking to to reuse, recycle, extend or adapt our buildings rather than disposing of them because we don't like the way they look." Durham University said that if demolition went ahead then the replacement building would be of high quality and a world class design for such a sensitive location.	Campaigners have called for Durham University's "brutalist" student union building to be saved from demolition.
Bower has made 52 appearances for Warriors in all competitions since joining from Leicester Tigers in 2014. Details of the length of the 26-year-old's new contract at Sixways have not been disclosed. "He always gives everything he's got and I've been thoroughly impressed with his attitude and his performance," director of rugby Gary Gold said.	Worcester Warriors loose-head prop Ryan Bower has signed a new contract with the Premiership club.
As no single party or bloc commands a majority of the 325 seats in parliament, the contenders have had to forge new partnerships and deals in their efforts to share out the positions of power. This is the main Shia parliamentary bloc. It was formed after the March 2010 elections as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance (INA). The National Alliance decided in October to support Mr Maliki's bid for a second term as premier, but the decision was reportedly not unanimous. STATE OF LAW COALITION: This grouping - which merged with the Iraqi National Alliance to form the National Alliance - is led by outgoing Prime Minister Maliki, who has been seeking a second term in power. The bloc purportedly cut across religious and tribal lines. It included Mr Maliki's Shia Islamist Dawa [Call] Party as well as some Sunni tribal leaders, Shia Kurds, Christians and independents. Mr Maliki said the alliance wanted an Iraq built on nationalist principles. However, many of the minority Sunnis apparently aren't confident that he truly believes they should be given a large share of power. Mr Maliki hoped to capitalise on successes of his first term in office. However, his record on security was undermined by a series of high-profile attacks on government targets in Baghdad before the March elections. IRAQI NATIONAL ALLIANCE (INA): This mainly Shia alliance - which merged with the State of Law Coalition - includes followers of the powerful cleric and one-time militia leader Moqtada al-Sadr. It brings together the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council (IISC), the Basra-based Fadhilah party, a few Sunni leaders, former prime minister Ibrahim Jaafari, and Ahmad Chalabi - the former exile who played a key role before the 2003 US-led invasion. Jaafari was prime minister in the Iraqi Transitional Government between 2005 and 2006 and his reputation was tainted by the fact that militias took over the security services while he was in charge, and by the sectarian war that ensued. A senior leader of the IISC is outgoing Vice-President Adel Abdul-Mahdi. The Kurdish coalition is dominated by the two parties administering Iraq's northern, semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The Kurdistan Democratic Party led by the region's president, Masood Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Iraq's outgoing national president, Jalal Talabani, are both secular in nature and enjoy close ties with the West. The two parties faced a major challenge in Kurdistan's parliamentary vote this year from the Reform (Change) bloc, which won about a quarter of the seats. The Kurds have played king-maker in Iraq since the 2003 invasion and will likely retain enough clout to be part of a ruling alliance with another faction. This alliance won the election by a slim two-seat margin over outgoing Prime Minister Maliki's State of Law, but neither came anywhere near the majority needed to govern. It is led by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis who view him as a strongman capable of countering Shia power Iran. The alliance includes outgoing Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni Arab, and senior Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq. They ran on a nationalist platform. While all of the major coalitions have adopted a rhetoric of ''national unity'', al-Iraqiyya, and Saleh al-Mutlaq in particular, have a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of their rivals. This group brings together a range of significant political figures, including Interior Minister Jawad Bolani and a leader of the Sunni anti-al-Qaeda militia in al-Anbar province, Ahmad Abu-Risha. Unity of Iraq has adopted a similar rhetoric to Mr Maliki's State of Law list, probably prompting suggestions that key figures in the list, such as Abu-Risha, appeared to have been seriously considering joining Mr Maliki. Like al-Iraqiyya, the Unity of Iraq list was seriously affected by the ban on candidates with alleged Baathist links. The Iraqi Accord Front, an alliance of parties led by Sunni politicians, participated in the December 2005 elections but has since been weakened by splits and defections. It includes Speaker of the last parliament, Ayad al-Samarrai. It consists of some tribal leaders and the Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP), which has increased its political visibility over recent years, enhancing its claim to represent Iraqi Sunnis at a national level. Tribal leaders were courted by major parties as it was thought they would play an important role in the election. Some of Iraq's Sunni tribal leaders sprang to prominence when US forces began backing local sheikhs against al-Qaeda in 2006. While the tribal figures are looking to branch out into mainstream politics, they have not formed a united front and have mainly joined forces with existing blocs. Smaller minorities, including Turkmen, Christians, Yazidis, Sabean Mandaeans, Shabak and others, were thought likely to ally with bigger electoral lists in areas where they were not dominant.

Paul Kohler, 55, needed facial reconstruction surgery after the attack in Kings Road, Wimbledon, on 11 August. Mariusz Tomaszewski, 32, and Pawel Honc, 24, received 19 years each after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. Oskar Pawlowicz, 30, and Dawid Tychon, 29, who admitted aggravated burglary, were sentenced to 13 years each. Judge Susan Tapping told Kingston Crown Court they had targeted Mr Kohler's south London home either because they were looking for items to steal or they chose the wrong address to collect a debt. All of the defendants had been under the influence of drugs and alcohol on the day of the attack, the judge said. Honc, of no fixed address, Tomaszewski, of Crusoe Road, Mitcham, south London, Pawlowicz, of Pitcairn Road, Mitcham, and Tychon, of no fixed address, are all Polish nationals. The court heard that, apart from Honc, all the other defendants had long criminal records in their home country, with 32 convictions between them. Pawlowicz had also been convicted in the UK for offences including sexual assault and affray. The court heard on the evening of the attack Mr Kohler answered the door while his wife Samantha MacArthur, daughter Eloise and her boyfriend Geraint were upstairs. Mr Kohler, head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, was held down on the floor during the five-minute attack as one of the men sat on him and repeatedly punched him in the face while another kicked him in the head, the court heard. The lecturer suffered a fractured eye socket, a fractured left jawbone, a broken nose and bruising that left him "utterly unrecognisable", the court heard. He continues to have double-vision in his left eye. Two of the men ran upstairs and confronted Ms MacArthur. The couple's daughter and her boyfriend were able to call the police after they hid in a bedroom. After the hearing Mr Kohler said he felt "vindicated". "Today was the first day I saw them in the dock and I wasn't convinced they looked very remorseful," he said. "It was far more traumatic than I expected. I felt fear again seeing them, which I didn't expect to feel. In time I hope I will forgive them." He said he felt "fortunate" that with the physical injury he "can see myself getting better but I think it's been hard for my wife and my daughter, Eloise, who've had no such reminder". He said: "My wife still gets flashbacks and my daughter was in tears in court... but we're all strong characters and we're getting through." Investigating officer Det Insp Dan O'Sullivan said the level of violence used was "utterly unnecessary" and the incident had a lasting effect on Mr Kohler and his family. In his victim statement Mr Kohler also revealed the burglary had taken place a few months after he had suffered a heart attack.	Four burglars who took part in a violent raid which left a lecturer "unrecognisable" have been jailed.
The 31-year-old, from Sheffield, has received the honour for her services to athletics. Ennis-Hill, who won gold at London 2012 Olympics and silver four years later in Rio, announced her retirement from the sport in October. At the same ceremony, designer and ex-Spice Girl Victoria Beckham was made an OBE for services to fashion. More on this story and others in South Yorkshire Ennis-Hill, who received her honour from the Duke of Cambridge, will receive another World Championships gold medal after Tatyana Chernova was stripped of her 2011 world title for doping. The 2012 Olympic champion, who was accompanied by her grandparents, mother Alison Powell and husband Andy Hill at the ceremony, said: "Just to hear the national anthem in this kind of moment again is really special. "I've so many amazing memories of standing on the podium and hearing it and to be here receiving a damehood, which I never imagined I would ever receive, is an incredible honour." She added: "I've had more than I could ever imagine out of my career so I can't stand here receiving a damehood and wish for any more."	Former heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill has formally been made a dame during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.
It will be used to stage competitive cycle sports as well as recreational events, coaching and training. The Welsh Government has agreed to sign over some land near the entrance to Pembrey Country Park, meaning work can start shortly. Welsh Cycling welcomed the announcement. Chief executive Anne Adams-King said: "The development of cycling facilities in Wales is a priority for Welsh Cycling as they provide opportunities for all to cycle encouraging physical activity and progression through sport to elite performance." It is expected to make more than £25,000 a year from entrance fees and caravan and camping stays.	Work will begin on a £500,000 purpose-built cycling circuit in Carmarthenshire after a funding boost from the council.
The meeting will be attended by police officers, lawyers and Scotland's Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC. The focus will be on how leaving the EU could affect law enforcement and criminal justice in Scotland. It will also look at the possible implications for civil and family law, and commercial issues. The meeting, which will also include experts from the Scottish Universities Legal Network on Europe and the Standing Council on Europe, is due to take place in Edinburgh on 24 November. Mr Matheson said: "The UK Brexit vote raises many uncertainties for Scotland's unique justice system. "That is why I am bringing together leaders and experts to help us understand these issues - and any steps we can take now to mitigate the risks. "The cessation of EU membership and single market access would have significant and wide-ranging ramifications from a justice and legal perspective. "The issues range from tackling cross-border crime through to an individual with an EU ex-partner securing child maintenance payment, from Europol co-ordination with other countries to protecting Scots consumers' rights when buying from abroad online." It follows a court ruling that parliament must vote before the UK can start the process of leaving the EU. The ruling means the UK government cannot trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning formal exit negotiations with the EU - on its own. The justice secretary added: "The summit discussions will help inform us of risks like these - and others - as the Scottish government continues to press for full involvement in all negotiations between the UK government and the EU. "Despite the uncertainties caused by the threat of Brexit, we will continue our efforts to safeguard Scotland's communities and the integrity of our justice system, while protecting the personal and commercial interests of our families, consumers and businesses."	Justice Secretary Michael Matheson is to host a summit of experts to consider how the UK's Brexit vote could affect Scotland's justice system.
The police allege 28-year-old Nazrul, also called Nazu, was the man who raped the 74-year-old nun. The man, allegedly a Bangladeshi citizen, was arrested at a railway station in Kolkata (Calcutta). The incident caused outrage in India and led to street protests in many cities across the country. This marks the sixth arrest in the crime. Police have identified eight suspects in the attack, of which two still remain untraced. "All the five accused arrested earlier have named Nazrul as the person who raped the nun," a police officer told the BBC. Dilip Kumar Adak, deputy inspector general of the state's Criminal Investigation Department, told the AFP news agency that police acted on a tip off that Nazu, who had fled to Bangladesh after being identified from CCTV footage of the attack, was due to return to Kolkata by train. In May, the police said they had arrested Milon Sarkar and described him as the leader of the gang which attacked the convent. They said it was not clear what role the man had played in the case. During the attack in Ranaghat town on 14 March, money was stolen from the convent school and the building ransacked, before the nun was raped in the convent itself.	Police investigating the rape of an elderly nun in the Indian state of West Bengal say they have arrested a key suspect in the crime.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Plymouth-based 16-year-old clocked one minute 04.30 seconds in Barcelona, 0.15 secs faster than the previous best time set by Jessica Hardy in 2009. Earlier, Meilutyte had recorded 1:04.52 in qualifying, the second-fastest time in history and a new European record. In the 200m individual medley final, Sophie Allen was seventh and fellow Briton Siobhan-Marie O'Connor eighth. London 2012 Olympic champion Meilutyte will seek to win Lithuania's first ever World Championships gold medal in Tuesday's final. Media playback is not supported on this device "I'll be have a relaxing day tomorrow and will save all my energy for the final," she said. "My biggest aim is accomplished now and I'll give it my best shot in the final. Obviously, a gold medal would be a cherry on top of the ice cream." Her coach Jon Rudd said: "It feels a bit surreal, but now I remember the feeling of the Olympic gold medal because it's kind of the same. "The plan was to go for the world record tonight because we don't want to have to worry about times tomorrow - just the medal. "[Russian rival] Yuliya Efimova will push her so she'll her need to be on her toes tomorrow, but I think there's more to come." Briton O'Connor only reached the 200m individual medley final after Australian Emily Seebohm pulled out in order to concentrate on her preferred 100m backstroke event, but the 17-year-old found herself in second place at the halfway stage. However, she faded in the second half to finish eighth in a race which was won by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu. Olympic champion Ye Shiwen surprisingly only managed to come fourth. "I just need to learn how to swim it better," said O'Connor. "I keep doing that - going out too fast - and I definitely think I got a bit excited with it being a final." Compatriot Allen, 21, added: "I'm disappointed I wasn't able to make a personal best like I did in the semi-final." "It's amazing, it's so much fun and so incredible to see the youth that this sport has and that it will continue to have. It's so awesome being a part of it and being a part of this whole experience as it's happening." US Olympic champion Missy Franklin, 18, on teenage successes "If I'd have done that time again [2:10.23], I'd have been in fourth place but hopefully as it's my first major international final I'll be better in the future." Scottish Commonwealth champion Robbie Renwick qualified with the fourth quickest time of 1:46.95 heading into the final of the 200m freestyle event on Tuesday and hopes to win Britain's first medal of the championships. "I have a good lane for tomorrow night and it'll be anyone's race so I've got to get myself in a good position and really try to go for a medal," said the 25-year-old, who will face US star Ryan Lochte in the final. Chris Walker-Hebborn, 23, and Lauren Quigley, 20, both missed out on places in their respective 100m backstroke finals, but each return to compete over 200m later in the week. In the evening's other finals, Australia's Christian Sprenger claimed 100m breaststroke gold with South Africa's Cameron Van Der Burgh second and Felipe Lima of Brazil third. Victory went to Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden in the 100m butterfly ahead of Australia's Alicia Coutts and US Olympic champion Dana Vollmer. Brazilian Cesar Cielo won the 50m butterfly final. There was frustration for Britain's Ben Proud, who did not reach the final, but would have claimed bronze with the British record of 23.10 he set at last month's trials.	Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte broke the 100m breaststroke world record in the World Championship semi-finals.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had identified 33 local areas where pubs would not face sufficient competition after the deal. Heineken, which already owns 1,100 pubs, must submit plans to the CMA by 20 June or face an in-depth inquiry. However, the brewing giant said it would address the CMA's concerns. "This decision by the CMA acknowledges that there are only a small number of local areas where competition may be diminished due to our acquisition of the pubs," said David Forde, managing director for Heineken UK. "We are confident we can offer the CMA suitable undertakings to satisfy their concerns." The preliminary CMA investigation concluded that the deal would not damage the chances of Heineken's competitors selling their own products, as the pubs being bought only make up 4% of the market. It also felt that it was unlikely Heineken would reduce the choice of beer and cider available in the Punch pubs, as this could lead it to lose business.	Heineken has been told to address fears that its purchase of around 1,900 pubs from Punch Taverns could affect competition in some areas.
The IMF's steering committee, made up of 25 of the world's largest economies, said the global outlook was fraught because of weak trade and a series of risks including a UK exit from the EU. It urged countries to boost public spending and avoid deflation. The IMF last week made its second cut to global growth forecasts this year. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, described the talks between finance ministers and central bankers in Washington DC as "collective therapy" to deal with the gloomy prospects. But she said calmer financial markets since February had reduced the nerves at the IMF spring meeting. "There was not exactly the same level of anxiety but I think there was an equal level of concern, and a collective endeavour to identify the solution and the responses to the global economic situation," she said. The IMF now predicts global growth of 3.2% this year and 3.5% in 2017, having previously forecast 3.4% and 3.6% respectively. "Downside risks to the global economic outlook have increased since October, raising the possibility of a more generalised slowdown and a sudden pull-back of capital flows," the IMF steering committee said. It said countries' tax policies and public spending should be "as growth-friendly as possible". But it also pledged to "refrain from all forms of protectionism and competitive devaluations", amid concerns that some countries are keeping their currencies weak to boost exports.	Key countries in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have pledged to pursue "growth-friendly" policies to kickstart the slowing world economy.
Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world. But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned. So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences: Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything. I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script. All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see. Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here. There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: "I think I am not the right person for that role" even when you know they can pull it off. Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda. One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda. I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything. I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists. There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the "work" or manuscript. Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return. Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources. In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf. Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom. There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films. Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see. They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden. Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: "Are those really African stories?". The image and perception of African film is still very narrow. I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: "Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?" Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the "strange for Africa" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIV/Aids etc. But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about. Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make. However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some "fabricated reality" that is sellable. This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale. In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance. In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant. Tune in to the BBC World Service at 1900 GMT on Friday 1 March to listen to the BBC Africa Debate - Are artists free to tell their stories? - broadcast from Ouagadougou. Or take part in Twitter - using #bbcafricadebate -  Facebook or Google+ Africa Debate The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario. There's a big chunk of "development" aid and "human rights" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations. A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good. Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story. Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough. Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft. And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art. Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art. So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories. One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise. That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent. Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted. It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue. But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country? Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu. With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult. Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment. Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble. At first you may be labelled as "an enemy of Islam" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life. However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam. Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance. In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad. No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of "Negritude". With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings. Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining. That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work. In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.	Fespaco, Africa's premiere film festival, is taking place in Burkina Faso this week, amid debate about artistic freedom on the continent.
The 79-year-old West Ham chairman was sent a tweet by a prankster, asking to spread awareness of a "missing" Hammers fan. Gold obliged, only for the fan to turn out to be West Ham winger Michail Antonio. Antonio, 25, cost the Hammers £7m when he arrived from Nottingham Forest on transfer deadline day - but he has made just one appearance for Slaven Bilic's team, coming on as a substitute in the 2-1 win at Manchester City on 19 September. Gold has since deleted the tweet, but the prankster has pinned a screen grab to the top of his Twitter timeline. The lesson - think before you retweet.	David Gold thought he was doing a good deed, but instead was found guilty of not recognising one of his own players.
The 20-year-old, who can also play as a winger, has come through the academy at the Premier League club and played for the under-23 side in the EFL Trophy.

Howe, nicknamed "Mr Hockey", spent most of his career with the Detroit Red Wings, winning the Stanley Cup four times. He was in the top 10 of scorers for 21 consecutive years and was named MVP six times, before finally retiring in 1980. Howe was also named an NHL All Star 23 times and was inducted into the hockey Hall of Fame in 1972. Gordie Howe died just before 08:00 on Friday at his son's home in Ohio, according to Sportsnet and CBS News. CNN reported his son Marty as confirming the news. Gordie Howe had suffered a stroke in 2014. He made his debut in 1946, played 26 NHL and six World Hockey Association seasons and held many of the scoring records until the rise of fellow Canadian-born legend Wayne Gretzky. Howe retired in 1971 but made a comeback with the Hartford Whalers in 1979-80 before finally quitting at 52.	The legendary Canadian ice hockey player, Gordie Howe, has died at the age of 88, US media say.
There was a fancy dress theme of "pirates and princesses" for the 44th Boxing Day swim from North Beach. Sea temperatures were 11 degrees - slightly warmer than the conditions for spectators. The event, organised by the Tenby Sea Swimming Association (TSSA),  is expected to raise thousands of pounds for charity. It prides itself on always going ahead, whatever the weather. Before the main event was a raft race around Goscar Rock, held in memory of Dai Rees, of Saundersfoot, who regularly took part. The challenge was won by his brothers, Adam and Richard, who came home at the head of the nine-craft fleet. Tenby's mayor Sue Lane said: "It's been a thoroughly enjoyable morning and a pleasure to see so many people turning up and in such wonderful costumes."	Hundreds of barmy bathers have been taking part in Tenby's annual festive dip.
Media playback is not supported on this device The Toffees will pay about £5m compensation for the 53-year-old Dutchman, who leaves Saints after two years in charge. Everton have been without a manager since they sacked Roberto Martinez just before the end of the 2015-16 season. It is expected Koeman's appointment will be confirmed by Friday. Listen: Saints fans feeling let down by Koeman BBC Radio 5 live's Football Daily podcast Koeman, who has been headhunted by new Everton owner Farhad Moshiri, will sign a deal reported to be worth about £6m a year. The former Netherlands international, who is on holiday, will take brother Erwin and fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg with him to Goodison Park. Saints have finished seventh and sixth under Koeman - their best Premier League campaigns. Martinez promised Champions League qualification when appointed but Everton finished 11th in 2015-16, his third year at the club. In April, Saints chairman Ralph Krueger said discussions with Koeman over a new deal were progressing "in a very good direction", but added the club was "not in any real hurry". And last month the former Ajax, PSV Eindhoven and Barcelona defender said he expected to stay with the Saints for the final year of his contract. Koeman made more than 763 appearances as a player, scoring 253 goals, and won the 1988 European Championship with the Netherlands. He won the European Cup - now the Champions League - with PSV Eindhoven in 1988 and Barcelona in 1992, scoring the winner for the latter against Sampdoria at Wembley. He also won four domestic league titles apiece in the Netherlands and Spain. Koeman has since managed Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord and Southampton. He has won the Dutch league with both Ajax and PSV. Reaction Former Southampton and England forward Matt le Tissier said he was "disappointed" and "quite surprised" at Koeman's decision to leave, particularly with Saints playing in the Europa League next season. "He may feel he has got a better chance of winning trophies at Everton. I'd be of a slightly different opinion," Le Tissier told BBC Sport. "I understand they've got a new owner and want to splash a bit of cash, but it might not be as easy a job as he thinks. "Most clubs in the Premier League are pretty wealthy now and can compete in the transfer market. We just have to move on and look to the next man to take us forward again. "The players' loyalty lies with the football club and hopefully they will kick us on again next season."	Everton have agreed a deal with Premier League rivals Southampton that paves the way for Ronald Koeman to become their new manager.
The Briton produced a stunning lap to be 0.360 seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg - and seemed as if he may have been able to go faster. But the track was empty for the final five minutes and senior figures said the format should be rethought. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said F1 should "apologise to the fans". "It didn't really work for me," Horner added. "We have not really put on a show. "To have Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen in fast cars not taking part with five minutes to go is wrong." Rosberg was behind both Ferraris after the first runs in the final session, but he grabbed second on his final run ahead of Vettel and Raikkonen, who will start third and fourth respectively. The first race of the new season gets under way on Sunday at 05:00 GMT, with coverage on radio 5 live from 04:00 and online from 03:30. Rosberg said straight after the session: "It's good to try something but it hasn't worked - so we should go back." Ferrari's Vettel, who qualified third but was able to change out of his overalls in time for the post-qualifying news conference because he did not run in the second part of the final session, said: "I don't see why everyone is surprised it didn't work. "It is a bit busier at the beginning of the session but for no reason. People want to see us pushing to the limit at the end of the session. It is the wrong way to go and that's what we said." The new format did work on one level, however. It made the first and second parts of the session more fraught - and one top team was caught out as Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat ended up 18th on the grid. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia. Hamilton said: "I really have to take my hat off to this team - what they have done to raise the bar once more. It inspires and motivates me. "I enjoyed driving the car in qualifying, got the set-up just right. They were some sexy laps, beautiful rhythm, it felt so good. I felt like James Brown at the end of the lap." Vettel added: "We expected them to be stronger in qualifying, which they were. Very happy with the lap in the end so we saved a set for the race. We still have high hopes for tomorrow and it is a long year." Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz were fifth and seventh, split by Williams driver Felipe Massa. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and the Force Indias of Sergio Perez and Nico Hulkenberg completed the top 10. McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button took 12th and 13th, a huge improvement on their dismal 2015, and Briton Jolyon Palmer 14th for Renault on his grand prix debut, ahead of team-mate and former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen.

The bank had no firewall and used second-hand routers that cost $10 to connect to global financial networks. Better security and hardware would have hampered the attackers, Reuters said, quoting an official investigator. The hackers aimed to steal $1bn but made mistakes that led to the theft being spotted and stopped. A firewall would have made attempts to hack the bank more "difficult", Mohammad Shah Alam, a forensic investigator who works on the Bangladesh team investigating the theft, told Reuters. The second-hand hardware also meant that basic security steps to segregate network traffic were not taken, he said. The cheap routers have hindered the investigation, said Mr Alam, because they collected very little network data that could be used to pinpoint the hackers and shed light on their tactics. The hack took place in early February and involved hackers getting access to the core network of Bangladesh's central bank. They used this privileged access to transfer cash from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to other banks. A spelling mistake in one of the transfer orders alerted bank staff and meant the hackers only managed to steal $81m. This has been traced to accounts in the Philippines and to casinos in the same country. Most of the cash has yet to be recovered. Bank security experts said the bank should have spent more time and money protecting the network for its central bank. "You are talking about an organisation that has access to billions of dollars and they are not taking even the most basic security precautions," Jeff Wichman, a consultant with cyber firm Optiv, told Reuters.	Hackers managed to steal $80m (£56m) from Bangladesh's central bank because it skimped on network hardware and security software, reports Reuters.
Three first-half goals in the space of 10 minutes sentenced the O's to a fourth successive defeat as Crawley tasted victory for the first time in seven matches. Orient edged the opening exchanges but lost defender Tom Parkes through injury before Steven Alzate was denied on the edge of the area by keeper Glenn Morris. Crawley had failed to score in their previous three home games but leading marksman James Collins swooped to give them the lead with his 20th goal of the season midway through the half. The former Shrewsbury striker struck by heading in a free-kick from Josh Payne and, although keeper Sam Sargeant got a hand to the ball, it flew into the corner of the net. Crawley took a firm grip of the game by scoring twice in the space of four minutes before the interval. Defender Joe McNerney rose unchallenged to head home a Payne free-kick from 12 yards on 29 minutes and then, from an Andre Blackman set-piece, Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn forced the ball home. Crawley, who had won only two of their previous 13 games, threatened again when a header from skipper Jimmy Smith was saved by Sargeant shortly after the break. Boldewijn, after earlier firing wide from 25 yards, should have increased the lead when putting the ball wastefully wide from a pass by Collins. Match support supplied by the Press Association.

Finney, who earned 76 caps for his country, is considered one of the greatest players England ever produced. "The likes of Bill Shankly and Tommy Docherty idolised him," said former England defender Jimmy Armfield. Docherty, who played with Finney, said: "He was the best player I've ever seen, alongside Lionel Messi." "I watch a lot of Barcelona and when I watch Messi, I close my eyes and can see Tom. I'm serious when I say that Messi is the Tom Finney of today. "Just like Finney, Messi is always getting fouled, but doesn't complain and just gets up and gets on with the game." Finney played in three World Cups between 1950 and 1958, and is joint sixth on England's all-time scoring list with 30 goals, alongside Nat Lofthouse and Alan Shearer. "I was lucky enough to have met him when I was on loan at Preston and he was not just an England great but a true gentleman," said former England captain David Beckham. Away from the international spotlight, Finney's humble nature and reputation as one-club man endeared him to supporters everywhere. Preston born, he spent his entire 14-year career with his home-town club and wore their famous white strip over 400 times. "The two words always went together - Preston and Finney," added BBC Radio 5 live pundit Armfield. "I remember taking the FA team out to the Far East. We were out in Hong Kong and somebody asked me where I lived. I said Blackpool and they asked how do you get to Blackpool? I said, you get a train and change at Preston. As soon as I said Preston, he said 'ah, Tom Finney'. "When he finished playing, he did some reporting for a Sunday newspaper and he used to cover matches. I was playing for England at Cardiff against Wales and I got injured. "I remember [former England manager] Walter Winterbottom asking me, 'how are you going to get home?' I was hobbling and, just at that moment, Tom knocked on the door of the dressing room, came in and asked me if I'd like him to drop me off. "It hit me then. He didn't have to do that but he'd been a player and I'd played against him. No more than that." "Preston has lost its favourite son, a man who gave Prestonians pride in the place they come from. It was as though a little of the esteem and respect in which Finney was held rubbed off on all of them. "My dad always insisted that he knew him. Everyone of his generation did and so I took his words lightly. One day I was walking through the centre of town with my old man when I noticed Finney walking towards us. He looked up as our paths crossed and, with what I am sure to this day was a hint of recognition, looked my dad square in the face and wished him good morning. "Sir Tom, you will be missed." Read Paul Fletcher's tribute Finney scored 187 league goals for North End and was comfortable occupying any position across the forward line. Although team silverware eluded him as he finished as a league runner-up in 1953 and 1958, as well as a losing FA Cup finalist in 1954, he was twice named Football Writers' Player of the Year. "If Tom was injured and couldn't play, Preston would delay naming the team until after 2pm on a Saturday because the gates would halve if he wasn't on the teamsheet," added Docherty, who himself played over 300 times for the club. "If Gareth Bale is worth £100m, then Sir Tom would be worth far in excess of that in today's market. In fact, there is not enough money in football to buy him." To mark his passing, Preston's players wore black armbands and shirts with the name 'Finney' on the back - as well as their respective squad numbers - for their home draw with Leyton Orient on Saturday. "In my time as Preston manager, he used to come in on a Friday morning and he would sit there and spend the whole morning signing autographs and books," said Craig Brown, who managed the club between 2002 and 2004. "I know he cared for his late wife Elsie when she was ill and he diligently wouldn't bring in help - he wanted to do it all himself. This was a man of the utmost calibre and dignity." Howard Kendall, who would later manage Everton, joined Preston as a schoolboy shortly after Finney's retirement in 1960 and recalls guidance offered to him by the club legend. "He was so important to the Preston team that he played despite carrying injuries," said Kendall, who in 1964 became the youngest player to play in a Wembley FA Cup final at the age of 17. "One very important piece of advice he gave me was to never to do the same. He said 'it is not the number of games you play in a season that counts, it is the number of seasons you play'. "Bill Shankly once said that when it came to comparing Sir Tom with Sir Stanley Matthews, he would choose Sir Tom. When 'Shanks' said that, you had to listen." Finney was knighted in 1998 and, according to Armfield, continued to love the game. Sir Bobby Charlton, England's record goalscorer, describes Finney's contribution to English football as "immeasurable", but many former players reflect on his demeanour off the pitch as a defining characteristic. Former England midfielder Rodney Marsh, who played for Fulham, QPR and Manchester City during the 1960s and 70s, said Finney represented a different era. "He came from a time of gentleman footballers where they were always properly dressed, wore a jacket and tie and acted accordingly," he said. "They would go to the games with the fans, and we'll never see the like of that again. "I've always had the highest possible respect and esteem for Tom Finney. It was like being in the company of greatness."	Tributes have been paid to former Preston North End and England winger Tom Finney, following his death at the age of 91.
17 May 2017 Last updated at 06:49 BST Around 9,000 people were killed, and more than 8 million affected by the earthquake - roughly a quarter of the country's population It also caused massive damage to roads and buildings, with schools closed and people left homeless. But as time passes things are slowly starting to return to normal, and aid organisations like World Vision are helping people get their lives back on track. Watch Hayley's report.	Two years ago, huge earthquakes hit the South Asian country of Nepal.
Guide dog Joey, who mainly flies between London Luton and Paphos in Cyprus, has notched up 35 flights with owner Jan Gibson and her husband Roger. Mrs Gibson, from Swindon, said: "The crew and passengers often fuss over Joey and take photos as it's not often you get to see a dog on a plane." Guide and assistance dogs are the only animals allowed on EasyJet flights. Mrs Gibson, who has had the dog for five years, said: "Joey enjoys flying and will usually sleep at my feet through most of the flight, although he does go for a walk halfway through." EasyJet group director Peter Duffy said: "With 35 flights under his collar, he must be one of the most travelled dogs in the country and we are really  pleased Joey, Jan and Roger have chosen to fly with us again and again."	A golden labrador has been named EasyJet's most frequent flying dog by the budget airline.
Latest figures show the the nursing and midwifery vacancy rate stands at 4.5% - the highest ever reported. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the current situation with unfilled posts threatened patient care. Health Secretary Shona Robison insisted staff levels within the NHS had risen to "historically high levels" under the SNP. Figures from ISD Scotland show 2,818.9 whole-time equivalent (WTE) posts were unfilled at the end of March, a 27.5% increase from March last year. The number of such posts lying unfilled for three months or more was up 51.3% year on year to 670.6. During the same period, the NHS spent Â£8.4m more on nursing and midwifery bank and agency staff, paying out a total of Â£166.5m. Vacancies for consultants have also risen year on year from 6.5% to 7.4% and there were 415.7 vacancies, of which 203.4 have lain empty for more than three months, up 38.2 from 2016. The total number of staff working within the Scottish NHS, however, has risen 0.7% year on year to 139,430 WTE posts. Norman Provan of the RCN warned: "If there aren't the nurses, patients won't receive the care they need." He added: "These figures reflect the challenge faced by Scotland's NHS. Across both acute and community settings, there are simply too few nurses. "The Scottish government can point to the increase in the number of nursing and midwifery staff, but the reality on the ground is that nurses wanting to do their very best for patients are too often coming up against the reality of vacancies in the workforce. "Nursing morale is low and teams are struggling to recruit and retain the staff they need." Health Secretary Ms Robison said part of the increase in vacancies was due to the creation of new posts in health boards. She said: "Under this government, NHS staff numbers have risen to historically high levels, with more doctors and nursing staff now delivering care for the people of Scotland - including over 2,000 additional qualified nurses and midwives. "We're committed to training and retaining our nursing staff, and earlier this year we confirmed a 4.7% increase in trainee nurses and midwives for 2017/18 - a fifth successive rise. "We have also committed Â£450,000 over three years to reintroduce a national return to practice scheme."	Nursing leaders are warning the NHS in Scotland has "too few nurses" after vacancies rose to record levels.
The mythical ruler's legendary court has been associated with locations throughout Wales, including Carmarthen, St David's, and Cardigan. Now a retired Bangor University professor has revealed what he believes to be the true location of Camelot. And it turns out to be a small Roman fort at Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Prof Peter Field, a renowned expert in Arthurian literature, said:  "It was quite by chance. I was looking at some maps, and suddenly all the ducks lined up. "I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery." Previous best guesses for the location of the round table include Caerleon in Newport, Somerset's Cadbury Castle, and Tintagel in Cornwall. In Roman times, Slack was home to a fort called Camulodunum, which means "the fort of the god Camul". Over the years, well-recognised linguistic processes would have reduced Camulodunum to Camelot. Though almost forgotten and insignificant today, and even though it was abandoned and dilapidated by the relevant time of King Arthur around A.D. 500, Prof Field argues that this site at Slack would still have been considered a strategic stronghold. At that time, Celtic-speaking Britons, who could have been led by King Arthur, held the north and the west coast against the invading Anglo-Saxons. Slack, on the Roman road from Chester to York, would have been the ideal location from which to defend the east coast. Prof Field added: "If there was a real King Arthur, he will have lived around AD500, although the first mention of him in Camelot is in a French poem from the Champagne region of France from 1180. "There is no mention of Camelot in the period between those dates, known as the Dark Ages, when the country was at war, and very little was recorded. "In this gap, people passed on information, much got lost in transmission, and people may have made up facts or just messed up known information." Prof Field, who taught at Bangor from 1964 to 2004, has been researching the location of Camelot for the past 18 months. He spoke about his findings during the official launch of Bangor University's Stephen Colclough centre for the history and culture of the book.	The quest to find King Arthur's Camelot has puzzled and intrigued scholars and fans for over a thousand years.
Labour's new leader said he wanted the weekly sessions to be less "theatrical" and Mr Cameron agreed there should be more focus on "substantial issues". Mr Corbyn asked about housing, tax credits and mental health service cuts. The BBC's Norman Smith said it was much calmer than normal but the PM had not been put under any real pressure. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg later on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted he would not campaign for the UK to leave the European Union, while vowing to fight any moves towards a more free-market relationship. Mr Corbyn was cheered by Labour MPs as he got to his feet at his first PMQs, before launching into a lengthy pre-amble in which he thanked supporters for his Labour leadership victory, vowed to make PMQs less "theatrical" and explained his decision to crowd source his questions. He said: "I thought at my first PMQs, I would do it in a slightly different way... So I sent out an email to thousands of people and asked them what questions they would like to put to the prime minister and I received 40,000 replies." The prime minster congratulated Mr Corbyn on his "resounding victory" in the Labour leadership contest and welcomed him to the frontbench. Mr Cameron, who began his own career as opposition leader in 2005 promising to end "Punch and Judy" politics, then said "no one would be more delighted than me" if PMQs could become a "genuine exercise in asking questions and answering questions". Mr Corbyn's first question "from a woman called Marie" was on the "chronic lack of affordable housing" and "the extortionate rents charged by some private sector landlords" - something the new Labour leader has said will be his top priority. Mr Cameron said the government had delivered more affordable homes but recognised "much more needs to be done". Before Mr Corbyn began his second question, on job losses at housing associations, he thanked the prime minister "for his commitment that we are going to do Prime Minister's Questions in a more adult way than it's been done in the past". He then asked about "absolutely shameful" cuts to tax credits voted through by MPs on Tuesday, on behalf of  "Paul," and about cuts to mental health services, prompted by a question from "Gail". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's verdict As promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit, no where to be seen.  It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions. What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs, the new Labour leader's first ever outing at the despatch box. Read Laura's full analysis Mr Cameron struck a consensual tone in his replies, agreeing that more needed to be done to improve mental health services, and paused to scold Labour MPs who were jeering him over his claim that the lowest paid would be Â£20 a week better off next year thanks to an increase in the minimum wage. "I thought this was the new Question Time. I'm not sure the message has fully got home," he told them. The prime minister took a couple of swipes at the new Labour leader when answering questions from backbenchers, as noise levels in the chamber returned to normal levels, although Tory MPs still appeared to be following instructions to avoid triumphalism. In response to a question on Northern Ireland from DUP MP Nigel Dodds, Mr Cameron paid tribute to former Conservative MPs Airey Neave and Ian Gow, who were murdered by Republican terrorists. He did not directly refer to controversy over Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell's previous comments on Northern Ireland, but said: "I have a simple view, which is the terrorism we faced was wrong, it was unjustifiable, the death and the killing was wrong. It was never justified and people who seek to justify it should be ashamed of themselves." He held back from attacking Mr Corbyn over his much-criticised decision not to sing the national anthem at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, saying in response to a question from a Tory MP that the St Paul's Cathedral event had been "a reminder of how proud we should be of our armed forces, then, today and always." Minutes before the session began Labour sources confirmed that their leader, who believes in the abolition of the monarchy, would join in with the anthem at future official engagements. Labour denied that Mr Corbyn's new approach - asking six different questions rather than pushing the prime minister on a single point - gave Mr Cameron an easy ride. "The questions were very direct and they demanded clear answers," a Labour source said. Asked about policy differences that appear to have emerged between Mr Corbyn and his front bench, on welfare cuts and Europe, a Labour source said "lots of listening" would be done and some policies would be reviewed under the new leadership.	Jeremy Corbyn asked David Cameron questions emailed to him from the public as he tried what he called "a different" style for his debut PMQs.
Routine monitoring by Argyll and Bute Council discovered raised levels of algal toxins in Loch Melfort and Seil Sound. The naturally-occurring toxins were above the "legally-permitted levels for harvest". Members of the public have been asked not to gather them. The toxins accumulate in molluscs such as mussels, oysters, cockles and razor clams, and when levels breach statutory limits, harvesting of affected species is prohibited. Elsewhere, raised levels of Escheria coli (E.coli) bacteria have been identified in Oitir Mhor Bay. It follows the discovery of raised levels at Kerrera West, Loch Craignish, Kilfinichen Bay and Castle Stalker. They were discovered by the council's environmental health team as part of their work to maintain the quality of shellfish. Potential raised levels of E.coli were also found at Dunstaffnage, Kerrera East, Loch na Cille and Loch Riddon. A council spokesman said: "Eating shellfish such as cockles, mussels, oysters and razor fish from affected areas can pose a risk to human health. "Notices to warn the public and casual gatherers have been posted along the shore. Commercial shellfish harvesters in these areas have been contacted by the council and steps taken to postpone harvesting until bacterial levels subside. "People are advised to avoid eating shellfish from these areas until further notice as a precaution. When levels subside, the warning notices will be removed."	People have been warned not to eat shellfish in parts of Argyll and Bute after raised levels of toxins were found.
BBC Radio Solent reports Eisner has already informed manager Paul Cook of his interest in creating the role. The former Walt Disney chief executive has made an offer to buy 100% of the League Two champions. Cook is believed to want a firm input over any potential candidate to ensure minimal disruption to his set-up. Portsmouth won the League Two title on goal difference from Plymouth Argyle on the final day of the season. Cook won the title for a second time in his managerial career after leading Chesterfield to promotion in 2014. Eisner's offer of £5.67m for Portsmouth plus an additional investment of £10m in equity will be voted on by club shareholders and members of the Pompey Supporters' Trust (PST), who currently own 48%.	Portsmouth are considering appointing a director of football next season, should Michael Eisner's proposed takeover of the club go through.
The 28-year-old Scotland international has spent the last two seasons with Wasps, having previously had a six-year spell with Glasgow Warriors. "His style fits the way we play perfectly and he will provide excellent competition," said incoming Quins director of rugby John Kingston. "We are looking forward to adding his expertise next season." Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Jackson's deal at The Stoop. Jackson has won 28 caps for Scotland since making his Test debut against New Zealand in 2010, and made one appearance at this year's Six Nations. "I'm extremely excited to be starting a new challenge with Harlequins," he said. "After speaking to John Kingston and Conor O'Shea I could see how great a club it is." Kingston will replace O'Shea in charge of the south-west London club this summer, with O'Shea leaving the club to take charge of Italy.	Harlequins have agreed to sign fly-half Ruaridh Jackson from Premiership rivals Wasps ahead of next season.
The watchdog assessed the authority's services between January 16 and February 9 and found improvements since its last inspection in 2011. Inspectors said parents had told them new services, brought in over the past 18 months, were "making a difference". The council welcomed the report, but said it was "identifying areas where can do better". See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here Inspectors assessed three key areas and ranked two - leadership and services for looked-after children - as "good". The third area - children who need help and protection - was rated as "requires improvement". In 2011, services in the city were ranked "adequate". In 2013 the council closed two children's centres and reopened eight others as "strengthening family hubs" and inspectors said this seemed to be a difference. "Services have been reconfigured in such a way as to bring together... family workers with health visitors, midwives and social workers," the report said. "Parents told inspectors that it is making a difference to them and their families and that, increasingly, they are able to get the right help in the right way." However, the report added the help and protection which children and young people receive requires improvement. "The quality of analysis, assessments and plans... is variable," it said. "Some children are not getting the help and support that they need quickly enough." Val Gibson, the authority's cabinet member for children and young people, said: "Inspectors have scrutinised our services in minute detail, highlighting the many areas where we are performing well, and identifying areas where we can and will do better." "We have developed a robust action plan to raise standards still further."	Children's services in Wolverhampton have been rated "good" following an inspection by Ofsted.
Mr Videgaray was seen as the main organiser of the controversial meeting between Mr Trump and President Enrique Pena Nieto. The visit was widely criticised by Mexicans both in the national press and on social media. A spokesperson for the ministry said Mr Videgaray would not take on another public office. He will be replaced by the current Minister of Social Development, Jose Antonio Meade. Mr Meade previously held the finance portfolio in 2011 and 2012. Mr Trump, the Republican nominee for the US presidency, visited Mexico briefly on 1 September, despite widespread condemnation of some of his earlier comments about Mexican migrants to the United States. He had called Mexican migrants "criminals" and "rapists". Such remarks led President Pena Nieto to compare the American to Italian fascist leader Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. Mr Videgaray has been one of the president's closest advisers, orchestrating a successful election campaign in 2012. However, Mr Trump's visit almost immediately caused public relations problems, when he appeared later that day at a rally in Arizona. There, he told the crowd Mexico would "100%" pay for a planned border wall, though he told reporters he had not discussed the issue with President Pena Nieto. The president later insisted he had told Mr Trump that Mexico would not pay. In 2014, Mr Videgaray came under fire when a newspaper investigation revealed he had bought his home from a construction firm whose parent company had won major public contracts. He denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest. President Pena Nieto said the new minister will "apply adjustments to public spending" but there will not be any rise in taxes.	Mexican Finance Minister Luis Videgaray has resigned following the visit of Donald Trump last week.
Shortly after midday, the FTSE 100 was 37.55 points higher at 6,256.81. M&S shares sank 8% after the retailer warned of a hit to short-term profits as it attempts to revive its clothing business. New chief executive Steve Rowe says he intends to lower clothing prices and reduce the number of sales promotions. But bank shares helped to bolster the wider market, with RBS up 3.6% and HSBC 3.4% higher. Royal Mail shares rose 1% to 526.5p after regulator Ofcom said it would not impose any new price controls on the company. Ofcom said it had decided against new controls because of the declining market for letters and increasing competition for parcel deliveries. Electrical goods and mobile phone retailer Dixons Carphone rose 0.5% as it pushed up its full-year profit forecast after enjoying strong sales. It now expects profits of between Â£445m and Â£450m. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.3% against the dollar to $1.4685, and was also 0.3% higher against the euro at â‚¬1.3174.	(Noon): Banking shares helped to lift the market, but shares in M&S slid after the retailer said its turnaround plan was set to hit profits.
Volkswagen (VW) shares plunged more than 18% on Monday after US regulators found that some of its cars could manipulate official emissions tests. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that software in several diesel cars could deceive regulators. Volkswagen was ordered to recall half a million cars in the US on Friday. In addition to paying for the recall, VW faces fines that could add up to billions of dollars. There may also be criminal charges for VW executives. The White House in Washington also reportedly said it was "quite concerned" about VW's conduct. Volkswagen's chief executive apologised after the scandal emerged. "I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public," Martin Winterkorn said. He has launched an investigation into the software that allowed VW cars to emit less during tests than they would while driving normally. The EPA found the "defeat device" in diesel cars including the Audi A3 and the VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has stopped selling the relevant diesel models in the US, where diesel cars account for about a quarter of sales. The EPA said that the fine for each vehicle that did not comply with federal clean air rules would be up to $37,500 (£24,000). With 482,000 cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations, it means the fines could reach $18bn. That would be a considerable amount, even for the company that recently overtook Toyota to be the world's top-selling vehicle maker in the first six months of the year. Its stock market value is about €66bn ($75bn; £48bn). Analysis: Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent There's one question people keep asking me at the moment. Is this the car industry's version of Libor, the scandal that rocked the financial world? It's way too early to say just yet. But the pressure is now on the car industry to prove that cheating the pollution figures isn't a widespread problem stretching across both sides of the Atlantic. The German government is investigating whether other companies are massaging their emissions data. The American regulator is widening its probe to other carmakers. If they dig up more examples, the implications could be huge. Fines running into billions. A complete loss of credibility. And worst of all, the possibility that people have become ill or even died early because of higher emissions. Americans don't tend to buy diesels. They represent just 3% of their car market. But half of all new cars sold in Europe are a diesel. Diesel cars: Is it time to switch to a cleaner fuel? VW has ordered an external investigation, although it has not revealed who will be conducting it. "We do not and will not tolerate violations of any kind of our internal rules or of the law," Mr Winterkorn said. €14bn Wiped off VWs market cap $18bn Potential fines 482,000 Diesel cars recalled 1 Biggest selling global carmaker The scandal comes five months after former chairman Ferdinand Piech left Volkswagen following disagreements with Mr Winterkorn. "This disaster is beyond all expectations," Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the Centre of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said. The VW board is due to meet on Friday to decide whether to renew the chief executive's contract until 2018, and some analysts speculated Mr Winterkorn may be on his way out. "No question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to [the chief executive] losing his job," said Prof Christian Stadler from Warwick Business School. He compared the scandal to Toyota recalling nine million cars between 2009-11. "To some extent, the cheating by Volkswagen seems more blatant, but the numbers are lower and there are no fatalities involved. "This suggests that in the heat of the moment, the long-term effect on Volkswagen may be overstated. Sure, it will hurt, but maybe not quite as bad as we expect right now." VW had been promoting its diesel cars in the US as being better for the environment. The US law firm Hagens Berman is launching a class-action suit against VW on behalf of people who bought the relevant cars. The models cited by the law firm are the diesel versions in the US of: "While Volkswagen tells consumers that its diesel cars meet California emissions standards, vehicle owners are duped into paying for vehicles that do not meet this standard and unknowingly pay more for quality they never receive," Hagens Berman alleged.	Volkswagen boss Martin Winterkorn will "support" the German transport ministry's investigation into the carmaker's emissions scandal.
The poll indicates satisfaction fell from 70% to 58% last year - the largest annual drop since it started in 1983. The King's Fund think tank sponsored the NHS questions put to more than 1,000 people and said their answers appeared to be a comment on reforms and spending squeezes and not care quality. The government said the survey contradicted its poll among patients. The survey formed part of the wider British Social Attitudes Survey, which covers a whole host of policy areas. When asked what they think of their care, most patients are grateful for their treatment and give the NHS a thumbs up. This is illustrated by the results of the latest annual patients survey, which reveals nine in 10 would rate their care as good, very good or excellent. Understandably, ministers have highlighted that research to suggest that all is rosy in the health service. But that does not mean that the findings of the British Social Attitudes Survey are not important. They are in effect an emotional stock-take of what the public thinks the present and future holds for the health service. The NHS - like the rest of the public sector - is facing a tough challenge. Rising demands and a squeeze on finances means the pressure is on - and this drop in satisfaction suggests the public are worried. The 1,096 respondents to the health questions were asked "how satisfied or dissatisfied"  they were with the way in which the National Health Service was run. The King's Fund released the findings on the NHS as it has taken on responsibility for funding that element of the research after the government pulled out last year. Prof John Appleby, chief economist at the King's Fund, said the poll was important because it had tracked satisfaction over such a long period of time. "It is not surprising this has happened when the NHS is facing a well-publicised spending squeeze. "Nevertheless, it is something of a shock that it has fallen so significantly. "This will be a concern to the government given it appears to be closely linked with the debate on its NHS reforms." The King's Fund said it had reached that conclusion because performance measures, such as waiting times and hospital infection rates, remained low. When the figures are broken down in more detail they show similar patterns. Satisfaction fell among supporters of all three main political parties - although unsurprisingly if dropped most among Labour voters. The falls were similar when England was compared with Scotland and Wales combined. While the NHS reforms apply only to England, the King's Fund suggested there could be some "leakage" into the public consciousness elsewhere. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the survey results "clearly reflect David Cameron's disastrous decision to reorganise the NHS at a time of financial distress. Patients are beginning to see the signs of a service in distress." He said A&E waiting times over winter, reports of patients on trolleys in corridors, redundancies, and "reports of services being restricted" were "leading people to feel worried about the future of the NHS". And Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, added: "These results give us a sharp indication that the public have become worried and confused about what is going on with the NHS." But Health Minister Simon Burns said the findings contradicted the government's own research which showed satisfaction rates remained high. In particular, he highlighted the annual patient survey which showed that 92% of patients said their experience was good, very good or excellent. "The British Social Attitudes Survey targets the general public rather than targeting people that have actually used the NHS, so responses are influenced by other factors. "By its nature it is not as accurate a picture as the data from patients."	Public satisfaction with the NHS has dropped by a record amount, the British Social Attitudes Survey suggests.
In a tweet, Eastleigh candidate Patricia Culligan claimed a Liberal Democrat standing in another seat "deliberately became HIV positive yet free NHS care v costly". She was referring to Paul Childs who is standing in Liverpool Riverside. He revealed he was HIV positive last week. In appearing to question the cost of treating British patients Ms Culligan went further than Nigel Farage, who has controversially said foreigners with HIV should not be treated for free by the NHS. The UKIP leader's comments during last week's TV debate were greeted with heavy criticism from some of the other leaders. He insisted it was right to "put our own people first". Patricia Culligan removed her tweet and apologised after UKIP was contacted by the BBC on Thursday evening. In a statement, the party said: "We wholeheartedly support the NHS being free at the point of access and kept publicly-funded. "We have spoken to Ms Culligan and advised her to retract the comment which seems to conflate two very separate issues." In a follow-up tweet she said she "sincerely" apologised for "any totally unintended offence" , saying she had misread a Mail Online article about Mr Childs. She added: "I have nothing but sympathy for sufferers." It is not clear though if she believes the NHS should ration or reduce treatment of British HIV sufferers. UKIP almost won the Hampshire seat of Eastleigh in a by-election in 2013. Ms Culligan was selected last September to fight it for UKIP. The Liberal Democrats said her comment was "disgusting and deeply offensive". A party spokeswoman said: "The Liberal Democrats will always stand up for the liberal British values of tolerance, generosity and decency."

UKIP's candidate in a key general election seat has been forced to apologise after she appeared to question the cost to the NHS of treating British people who are HIV positive.
They have remained flat due to rising inflation and fuel prices, according to Asda's Income Tracker. It says NI families have £105 a week discretionary income, the lowest of any UK region and well below the UK average of £202 a week. Sterling has weakened since the EU referendum, pushing inflation to 1.6%, the highest level since July 2014. The report says rising oil prices, higher inflation and a weakened pound have slowed spending power growth. Families are £7 a week better off than this time last year, despite rising prices at the pumps. The price of fuel is 10% higher than this time last year, NI households spend £28.90 a week on petrol compared to the UK average of £19.90 a week. Food prices in December were 0.8% higher than in November, but cheaper than this time last year. December also saw an increase in the cost of restaurants and hotels. But electricity and gas prices helped keep household bills down. Low interest rates mean mortgage interest payments were 6% cheaper year on year. An Asda spokesperson said: "As we begin 2017, it is clear to see that prices are at the top of customers' minds, across a range of different categories." Kay Neufeld, an economist with the Centre for Economics and Business research, said: "The question in 2017 will be whether wage growth can keep up with rising inflation. "Early indicators suggest that the over the coming months - an increase in unemployment and lower wage growth are on the cards potentially putting a dent in households' spending power," she added.	Disposable incomes in Northern Ireland are nearly half the UK average, new figures suggest.
The Shanghai Composite was down 1.2% to 4,565.25 with analysts citing a number of reasons for the drop including some brokerages tightening lending requirements on margin financing. Another wave of new share offerings due next week is also expected to remove liquidity from the market. A state-owned investment firm also said it sold shares in the top four banks. Central Huijin Investment confirmed it sold some mainland-listed shares in China's top four banks and other financial institutions, along with Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). News of the sale was cited by traders as one factor behind a plunge in Chinese shares. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.3% to 27,362.82. The mainland benchmark index has surged over 140% in the past 12 months despite a slowing Chinese economy. Shares in Japan nudged higher after government data gave conflicting messages about the economy. Inflation was roughly flat in April with core consumer prices rising 0.3%, while household spending was down 1.3% from a year ago. Economists had been expecting spending to rise. However, the jobless rate fell to 3.3% from 3.4% in March, while industrial output rose 1% - rising for the first time in three months. The Nikkei was up 0.1% to 20,566.57. Traders say the benchmark index is taking a breather after rising for the past 10 days in its longest winning streak since 1988. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was up nearly 1.2% to 5,781.5, boosted by commodity stocks. A weaker US dollar has helped copper and aluminium recover some losses, while iron ore prices held steady. Shares of heavyweight miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were up 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. South Korean shares were higher with the benchmark Kospi up 0.4% to 2,118.77. Investors appeared to ignore data that showed industrial production fell in April for a second month in a row - declining by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% after falling 0.3% in March.	Mainland China shares continued lower, falling as much as 3.5% on Friday after plunging nearly 7% a day earlier.
The 27-year-old judo athlete from Inverness was placed in an induced coma after suffering head injuries in the motorbike taxi accident on 10 May. Since being flown to a hospital in Thailand, doctors have begun the process of waking her from the coma. On Sunday, she opened her left eye and followed a light shown into it. Her family joked in a Facebook post that Ms Inglis opened her eye in shock at hearing her father, Robert, singing by her bedside. In the same message, her family added that her temperature was falling and had almost returned to normal, an indication that she was fighting infections, including pneumonia. Ms Inglis had been in Vietnam for four months teaching English to underprivileged children when the accident happened. It is understood that a long skirt she was wearing, and which she had tied up for the bike journey, became unravelled and caught in the wheel of the motorbike, pulling her off the machine and on to the road.	Commonwealth Games silver medallist Stephanie Inglis has opened an eye for the first time during her recovery from a serious accident in Vietnam.
Aiden Hughes, with an address of Balmoral Road, Bangor, posed as a teenage boy before meeting his victim in a Belfast park. During the meeting, he touched the girl over her clothes. He later admitted the charge against him. Belfast Crown Court heard Hughes had marriage problems and took to the internet to "escape the stress". A prosecution lawyer told the court that Hughes met the girl on a social networking site, while pretending to be a 14-year-old called Matt Smith. They began exchanging emails which soon became sexual. Hughes asked the girl for meetings and later told her he was 20, and not 14 as previously stated, and admitted his name was Aiden. His victim reported that he made her feel "a little bit sorry for him". A defence solicitor for Hughes said he was a young man who did an extremely stupid thing and was deeply ashamed of his actions. The judge ruled Hughes be put on the Sex Offenders' Register for ten years and also made him the subject of a ten-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order, disqualifying him from working with children and restricting his use of the internet. On his release from prison, he will be required to live at an address approved by the authorities. The judge told Hughes the impact on the then 14-year-old could not be ignored or forgotten and that adults deliberately making contact with young children for sexual activity would not be tolerated.	A 30-year-old man, who sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl he met online, has been jailed for 12 months.
Brothers Jason Russell, 28, and Darren, 26, and their friend Daniel Hughes, 36, were trekking in a remote area when the quake struck. Mr Hughes' sister, Joanne, said they arrived at Manchester Airport on Saturday and that they were very tired. They had been rescued on Thursday after an earlier attempt to find them failed. The were taken to a military base in Kathmandu to await their flight home. The whereabouts of 1,000 EU citizens remain unknown and according to a Red Cross missing persons list posted online, 28 people from Britain and Ireland remain unaccounted for. The death toll has risen to over 7,000 and the Nepalese authorities have ruled out finding more survivors.	Three Wrexham backpackers left stranded in Nepal following the earthquake have returned home, according to the sister of one of the men.
Industry magazine What Car? says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected. VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said. That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke. However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market. "I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle," said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford. "That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK." The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a "clean mode" whenever they were tested for emissions. VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result. But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation. VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception. The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year. It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.	Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.
13 April 2016 Last updated at 10:30 BST Helen Fairhead captured the charming footage of the three-year-old gorilla, called Lope, on a visit to Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire. More than one million people have watched the video on Facebook with hundreds leaving comments. The zoo's director of life sciences Dr Charlotte Macdonald said Lope's "dance" is evidence of him playing - an important aspect of young apes' behaviour.	A dancing gorilla video has gone viral with more than one million people viewing the pirouetting primate.
