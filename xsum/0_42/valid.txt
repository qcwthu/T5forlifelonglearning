The week-long event will see 15,000 young people aged under 25 competing in categories including singing, dancing, drawing and cooking. Around 100,000 visitors are expected to attend the annual touring event held at Llancaiach Fawr in Nelson this year. The Urdd was established in 1922 to help young people learn and socialise in the Welsh language. S4C broadcaster Iwan Griffiths, who has competed in the Urdd Eisteddfod many times, said it was important it visited areas like Caerphilly, where there were "pockets of Welsh speakers". Hosting committees must raise Â£200,000 for each event and people in Caerphilly have organised a series of fundraisers over the past year. Sunday's highlights include a morning service led by pupils from Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni and an opening concert led by BBC One Show's Alex Jones. There will also be performances from acts including singer Kizzy Crawford and Huw Euron. Competitions run throughout the week, with those involving choirs and dance groups the last to take place on Saturday 30 May. Event mascot Mistar Urdd will welcome an old friend to the festival this year, when the character Pen Gwyn from Patagonia reappears for the first time since 1979. Pen Gwyn's inclusion at the event will mark the 150th anniversary of Welsh settlers arriving in Patagonia, Argentina. There is live coverage on BBC Radio Cymru and on BBC Wales' Cymru Fyw online service. There is also television coverage during the week on S4C, with English commentary of live events on the channel's red button.	One of Europe's biggest youth festivals - the Urdd Eisteddfod - begins in Caerphilly county on Sunday.
Reform Scotland said its research suggested more than half of delays to trains in Scotland were due to Network Rail faults rather than ScotRail. It said devolving the organisation would allow a "clear line of accountability" when things go wrong. Network Rail is funded by Transport Scotland but is ultimately accountable to Westminster, not Holyrood. A spokesman for Network Rail said: "We work closely with the Scottish and UK governments to continually enhance and improve our railways. Any discussions over further devolution of Network Rail in Scotland would be a matter for those governments". The full devolution of Network Rail - which is responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure - has been a long-standing ambition of the Scottish government. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said last month that the move would help to reverse "the current unacceptable industry performance" in Scotland. It comes amid ongoing concern over delays and cancellations to ScotRail trains since Dutch firm Abellio took over the contract last year, which has led to Mr Yousaf suggesting that the rail franchise could be taken over by the public sector in the future. Mr Yousaf is to attend a conference on Tuesday alongside Abellio and Network Rail officials aimed at exploring the future of Scotland's railways. In its Track to the Future report, Reform Scotland said 54% of trains which were delayed by more than three minutes had been attributed to Network Rail faults. The report was written by Reform Scotland's research director Alison Payne and Tom Harris, the former Labour MP and UK transport minister. Mr Harris said: "The current debate over whether or not to nationalise ScotRail misses the point. 54% of delays are the fault of Network Rail. Nationalising ScotRail won't make the trains run on time and it is self-defeating for any politician to imply otherwise. "Instead, we need fundamental change to the governance of Network Rail. The Scottish government is responsible for the strategic direction and funding of the Scottish rail network, but this responsibility cannot be properly exercised while Network Rail remains answerable to the UK government. "Reform Scotland believes that Network Rail in Scotland should be fully accountable to the Scottish government, and that means it must be devolved." The report, which examines the modernisation of Scottish railways, also found that journey times in Scotland compared unfavourably with those of a similar distance in England. For example, Edinburgh to Aberdeen and London to Birmingham are roughly the same distance, but the former takes well over two hours and the latter less than 90 minutes. Birmingham and Manchester are 25% further apart than Glasgow and Dundee, but the train takes 15 minutes less to arrive. While it welcomed recent investment in the railways, the report said upgrading lines while trying to use them could cause additional problems and added that investments such as the Borders Railway had been "short-sighted". The new line from Edinburgh to Tweedbank is not electrified and is single-track. The report said the Scottish government should future-proof all new rail investment by ensuring that it is double-track and electrified where possible. And it called for the creation of a "bold and ambitious" Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to look into faster rail links for the future, including from the central belt to both the north and the south, and looking at strategic inter- and intra-city rail links within Scotland. The report found that, under current proposals, over the next 30 years people will be able to travel by train from the central belt to London faster than from the central belt to Inverness, despite the former being around 400 miles while the latter is only 160 miles. Mr Harris added: "Ongoing improvements are vital and the Scottish government should be congratulated for investing in this area, but we need to think about the bigger picture and create a bold strategy for the future. "Our rail infrastructure is deficient. We should not tolerate a situation where a resident of Glasgow can get to London faster than she can get to Inverness, because Scotland's cities are too poorly connected."	Calls for the Scottish Parliament to be given full responsibility over Network Rail have been backed by a think tank.
The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Lancaster, known as Thumper, based at RAF Coningsby, took the skies for a test flight on Monday. The Lancaster, one of only two in the world able to fly, missed most of the 2015 display season. Squadron Leader Martin Morris said a schedule for subsequent flights will be announced over the next few weeks. Sqd Ldr Morris, who heads up the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, said: "Spares and parts are difficult to find and some had to be manufactured. "The aluminium for the bulkhead had to be sourced from the same type of aluminium as the original aircraft - so it has not been without challenge - but our engineers have succeeded." Hundreds of people turned out to watch as Thumper took to the skies at about 14:00 BST.	The last airworthy Lancaster bomber in Britain has flown for the first time since being grounded by a fire in May.
The original judgment said long delays in executing prisoners meant the death penalty was "cruel and unusual". The appeal court has now dismissed that ruling as legally flawed, overturning it on procedural grounds. Separate legal arguments about lethal injections mean that executions in California remain suspended. The latest case was brought by Ernest DeWayne Jones, who was sentenced to death 20 years ago for the rape and murder of his girlfriend's mother. His lawyers argued that long delays in the appeals process meant that only a "random few" of those on death row were actually put to death. More than 900 people have been sentenced to death in California since 1978 but only 13 have been executed. A district court ruled in Jones's favour in July 2014, criticising the "dysfunctional post-conviction review process". But on Thursday the court of appeals for the ninth circuit concluded that legal precedent meant the courts should not be considering the merits of the case. No-one has been put to death in California since 2006 and executions will remain on hold pending separate legal arguments about whether lethal injections are constitutional.	A US federal appeal court has rejected a ruling which declared that capital punishment in California was unconstitutional.
According to court documents, Amjid Khan was working at a Morrisons petrol station in Birmingham in 2008 when he punched and kicked Ahmed Mohamud. Mr Mohamud died in 2014 of an illness not related to the incident, and his family continued his legal fight. Morrisons said Mr Khan had been sacked and that it had agreed to pay damages. The court ruled that Morrisons was "vicariously liable" for Mr Khan's actions. The attack happened in Small Heath, Birmingham, in March 2008, as Mr Mohamud was on his way to London for a demonstration against the war in Somalia. At the petrol station he asked staff to print some documents he had stored on a USB memory stick. Court documents say he asked this as a "favour", and Mr Khan responded by being abusive and using a racial slur. Mr Mohamud was not abusive in return, but the documents say Mr Khan followed him to his car, shouted more abuse, punched him twice in the head then leapt on him and subjected him to a "brutal attack involving punches and kicks while Mr Mohamud was curled up on the petrol station forecourt". By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman The Supreme Court has sent employers a wake-up call. It has broadened the law which holds employers vicariously liable for the acts of their employees who commit a crime whilst at work. Previously an employer could argue that an employee was acting for entirely personal reasons - lawyers call it being "on a frolic of their own" if they committed a crime. It was only in cases where the employment itself involved a risk that a crime could be committed that employers had been held liable - so for instance in cases involving nightclub bouncers or wardens at residential care homes. This ruling makes it easier for customers of a business who are assaulted by staff - or affected by staff who commit any unlawful act whilst on duty - to hold the employer business liable. It is also likely to affect cases involving assaults or harassment by co-workers while at work. In his case for compensation, Mr Mohamud claimed he suffered psychological injuries and a head injury which led to epilepsy. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the court had to consider two key points - the nature of the job entrusted to Mr Khan, and whether there was a sufficient connection between the role and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held responsible. "The court found that the nature of the job was to be viewed broadly," our correspondent said. "In this case it was Mr Khan's job to attend to customers and respond to their inquiries. His response to Mr Mohamud's inquiry with abuse was inexcusable, but interacting with customers was within the scope of his job." In a statement, Morrisons said: "When this appalling incident happened we were horrified and dismissed Amjid Khan. "We then offered a settlement option to Mr Mohamud but he and his legal team wanted to progress a case which involved widening the rules on vicarious liability - where a company can be held liable for the actions of an individual member of staff. "While the Supreme Court has not changed the law on vicarious liability we accept that it has now said we should now pay the previously agreed damages." The ruling gave no detail of any criminal proceedings which might have resulted from the incident.	Morrisons supermarket is liable for the actions of a staff member who physically attacked a customer, the Supreme Court has ruled.
Stroud also remains a Conservative minority, while in Cheltenham the Liberal Democrats kept a majority rule. The leader of Cheltenham's Conservatives, Rob Garnham, narrowly lost his seat to the Liberal Democrats, in a result that required a recount. One of the country's youngest councillors was elected in Stroud. In Gloucester, voters were deciding on 15 seats in the city. Deputy council leader Jennie Dallimore held her Podsmead seat for the Conservatives, where she doubled her majority. Stroud continues to be run by a Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat alliance. Conservative Paul James, leader of Gloucester City Council, said it was a "big achievement" to defend the group's eight seats from the 15 being contested. Overall the council is made up of 18 Conservative, nine Labour and nine Liberal Democrat seats. The leader of the Liberal Democrat group in the city, Jeremy Hilton, said the council was balanced but it would require "a lot of close co-operation between the three groups" to do the best for Gloucester. In Stroud, where a third of seats were up for election, the council is now made up of 22 Conservative, 20 Labour, six Green Party and three Liberal Democrat seats. It meant an overall gain of one Conservative seat, three Labour seats and one Green seat and a loss of two Liberal Democrat. Two seats on the council were vacant and one Independent candidate defected to the Conservatives. One of the country's youngest councillors was elected in the Stroud district, when 20-year-old Tory Tim Williams won the seat for Bisley. He said he would continue to work on his parents' farm while carrying out his duties. In Cheltenham, the leader of the Conservatives, Rob Garnham, narrowly lost the Park ward seat to Max Wilkinson of the Liberal Democrats, in a result which needed a recount. Overall the Liberal Democrats gained one seat and now have 24. The Conservatives remain with 12 seats, People Against Bureaucracy remain with four seats, and one Independent seat was lost. Turnout in Cheltenham was 37%.	Gloucester remains a Conservative minority administration after every party held their seats in the local elections.
Payne, unbeaten on 48 when bad light ended play, joined Dent (86) at the crease with his side struggling at 97-7, before helping them to 201-7. Gloucestershire lost three wickets in the morning, when they scored only 33 runs from 24 overs, with 129 dot balls. Paceman Steve Magoffin led the way for Sussex, taking 3-35 from his 19 overs.	Chris Dent and David Payne provided timely resistance for Gloucestershire against a suffocating Sussex bowling performance on the opening day.
Media playback is not supported on this device Gylfi Sigurdsson almost put Iceland in front early on but his angled shot and follow-up were both saved. Nani slotted in for Portugal but Iceland worked a shock equaliser when Birkir Bjarnason volleyed home. Cristiano Ronaldo had a header saved for an unconvincing Portugal, while Iceland went close late on when Alfred Finnbogason had a shot saved. Ronaldo came into the tournament fresh from scoring the winning penalty for Real Madrid in their Champions League final shootout victory over Atletico Madrid as he added another club trophy to a long list. Honours on the international stage have eluded him, however, and unless the forward can replicate his club scoring achievements for his country that is likely to continue. Ronaldo, who won his 127th cap and equalled the Portuguese record set by Luis Figo, showed a glimpse of his quick feet to get in a precise cross for Nani, whose six-yard header was saved. But he could only kick fresh air from 10 yards out as he failed to make contact with a long Pepe pass, then sent a 20-yard half-volley wide and had his late header saved as he endured a frustrating evening in Saint-Etienne. Iceland are the smallest nation ever to reach a European Championship finals, with a population of approximately 330,000, and have no professional clubs. However, they beat the Netherlands twice on the way to qualifying for the tournament in France and added another chapter to their fairytale on their major tournament debut. Goalkeeper Hannes Thor Halldorsson had more touches than any other Iceland player in the first half (30) but his side kept Portugal within reach. Their efforts paid off when Bjarnason caught right-back Vieirinha out of position to score from Johann Gudmundsson's cross to the far post. And, despite Iceland having just 27.7% of possession overall, they gave Portugal a couple of further scares before the final whistle. "Honesty, endeavour - that's what Iceland are all about," said BBC Radio 5 live pundit and former England international Chris Waddle. "They were getting a football lesson in the first half but they never threw in the towel. They've got their rewards, and their fans are going absolutely wild." On the basis of this game, the answer would have to be yes. The move for the first goal did not involve Ronaldo and came courtesy of quick passing down the right before Andre Gomes put in a low cross for Nani to finish. However, with Ronaldo having a quiet night by his standards, no other Portugal player stepped up to make the difference. They also conceded an equaliser that suggests vulnerabilities in defence they will have to resolve if they want to win a major tournament for the first time. Portugal boss Fernando Santos: "We should've scored more goals: that's no secret. There's always difficulties in the first game. I think we'll bounce back to play two great matches." Iceland joint manager Heimir Hallgrimsson: "It's down to teamwork. You can't put one player to stop a guy like Ronaldo. It has to be a team effort, closing the areas. "There were a lot of players responsible for Ronaldo tonight. We did a really good job - well done the lads." Iceland play group leaders Hungary in Marseille at 17:00 BST on Saturday, 18 June, while Portugal play Austria at 20:00 BST on the same day in Paris. Match ends, Portugal 1, Iceland 1.

The United Nations children's agency warns of the long-term cost of political violence, particularly in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In south Sudan, Unicef says almost three-quarters of primary-school-age children are missing out on education. Unicef's Josephine Bourne says this threatens the "stability of families, communities and economies". In conflict zones in 22 countries, about one in five school-age children is missing out on education, says Unicef. There have been warnings that without any chance of school, young people will be condemned to a cycle of poor employment, poverty and risk of exploitation and recruitment into violence. Among the worst-affected countries is Chad, where about half of children are unable to get to school, with girls particularly likely to miss out. Highlighting the global scale of the challenge, Unicef brought an education campaigner to Chad who was herself a refugee from the civil war in Syria. Muzoon Almellehan, 19, visited education projects in Chad trying to support families who had fled from violence by Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria. Among child refugees arriving in Chad from Nigeria, Unicef says 90% have never been in school. "Meeting children in Chad who had fled Boko Haram reminded me of my own experiences in Syria," said Ms Almellehan. "Education gave me the strength to carry on. "I wouldn't be here without it. "Conflict can take away your friends, your family, your livelihood, your home. "It can try to strip you of your dignity, identity, pride and hope. "But it can never take away your knowledge." In Chad, Ms Almellehan met a Nigerian girl who had been abducted by Boko Haram and then "drugged, exploited and abused" for three years before escaping. The Islamist militant group is still holding about 195 of the schoolgirls abducted three years ago from Chibok in north-eastern Nigeria. One of the schoolgirls who escaped, speaking last month, called on the international community not to forget those still in captivity. The Chibok student, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "These girls are human beings, not something that we can forget about." But Unicef has warned its work in supporting education is struggling with inadequate funding. The UN agency says in Chad it has only 40% of the budget needed for this year's education work. Conflict and violence have been significant barriers to the goal of providing a primary school place for all children. There have also warnings about inequality within developing countries - where wealthy families have access to education, but poor, rural families are excluded. The international community set targets for universal primary education by first 2000 and then 2015, which, despite some progress being made, were both missed. The current target, part of the sustainable development goals, aims for this to be fully achieved by 2030. Although Unesco, the UN agency that monitors global access to education, warned last autumn that, on current trends, the target was already unlikely to be achieved.	Warfare and conflict are preventing 25 million young people from getting any access to school, says Unicef.
President Wulff was entitled to what is called a Grosser Zapfenstreich, or Grand Tattoo, in front of the presidential palace. In the dark of night, by the Tiergarten in Berlin, soldiers in full ceremonial uniform carried burning torches. Trumpets sounded. The fife and drum were prominent. But it did not feel like a celebration. Chancellor Angel Merkel did attend but the four former presidents still alive were not there. The event was overshadowed by debate over whether it should happen at all because of the allegations of corruption which have forced the current president from office. There was also a row over the music. President Wulff had requested four pieces instead of the usual three. The newspaper Bild said that he had wanted Ebony And Ivory written by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. This tune, it said, was deemed by the military band as not suitable for trumpets! What was played was Somewhere Over The Rainbow, the great hymn to a better life beyond today's troubles from The Wizard Of Oz. It was an instrumental version, but it was hard to see if anyone was humming the words: "Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me." Not for some time, though. President Wulff leaves office to deal with investigations into his closeness to business people when he was a prominent politician and finally president of one of the German states, Lower Saxony. His difficulties started when it was revealed that he had been lent money on favourable terms by a businessman's wife. He then made two big mistakes: he denied a connection to the businessman when asked by the state's parliament, and he left an angry message on the voice-mail of Bild, Germany's best-selling newspaper when it started investigating and publishing details of the loan. Hell hath no fury like a newspaper threatened. Bild went into investigative over-drive, publishing a string of articles about President Wulff and holidays paid for by others. Where previously Bild had painted him as a happily married family man (helpful to a recently divorced Catholic), it examined every detail of his connections to business. Where he went and who paid for it, became the leitmotif. It all became a stand-off between president and press. He would assert that he had done nothing wrong and papers would reveal more questionable contacts and arrangements. It became too much when the prosecutors in Hanover, the capital of Lower Saxony, asked the Bundestag to lift the president's immunity from prosecution. Mr Wulff, the country's youngest ever president at 51 when he took the job in 2010, resigned because he said the trust of the people had "been seriously damaged". A man once talked about as a future chancellor of Germany will, instead, engage closely with lawyers and prosecutors. He has one less thing to worry about: ex-presidents are entitled to a pension of 199,000 euros a year. The papers questioned whether he should get it, but it was decided that he should get the money. And a Grosser Zapfenstreich. It is worth having. The origins of the grand ceremony are lost in time but a common view is that it goes back to when a trumpet was sounded to "strike the peg" on a barrel so signalling the end of the military day (Zapfenstreich means "strike the tap or plug or peg"). The ceremony became grander and much embellished by the Prussians. It continued through the divided Germany, with the East Germans incorporating For The Peace Of The World by the Soviet composer Shostakovich. In the united Germany, it is reserved for the departure of presidents, defence ministers, chancellors and the very highest military officers. Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg got one when he resigned after being caught plagiarising his doctorate (by the way, for music, he chose Deep Purple's Smoke On The Water). Apart from offering much food for debate about the musical choices of departing politicians, President Wulff's departure will have some consequences. It leaves Chancellor Merkel with bruises because he was very much her choice two years ago. The opinion polls say she remains popular with ordinary Germans, but her government is dependent in coalition on the Free Democrats - if they go, the government falls. And by all accounts, the FDP stood up to her over a successor to President Wulff. It wanted the civil rights campaigner Joachim Gauck, whom she had rejected for the post in 2010, and it - rather than she - got its way. That has led to speculation that the coalition is breakable. Now the music has died after the Grosser Zapfenstreich, Germany has much to reflect on. And plain Mr Wulff will be a busy man - but not in a way he would have wanted.	The president of Germany marked his early departure from office with the grandest of torchlight parades in the full tradition of the Prussian military - and with a squabble over what tunes should be played.
A new personal savings allowance of £1,000 will be introduced in April next year, removing the first £1,000 of savings income from income tax. From later this year, people will be able to move money in and out of Isas without infringing their tax free contribution limit. And a new "Help to Buy" Isa will be launched to help people save for a deposit. As announced a few days ago, the government will consult on letting people who have bought annuities with their pension pots sell them, in return for a lump sum. Mr Osborne said the new personal savings allowance would come into effect in April 2016. This would, he said, create tax-free banking for almost the entire population. However, higher-rate taxpayers will benefit from a smaller personal savings allowance of only £500. Users of the BBC News app tap here for the Budget Calculator. And anyone earning more than £150,000 a year will not receive the benefit of the new savings allowance at all. This change, along with more flexibility for Isas, will cost taxpayers more than £1bn in 2016-17 and more than half a billion pounds each year thereafter. An important knock-on effect of these changes will be that from next April, banks and building societies will no longer deduct 20% income tax automatically from savings held outside an Isa. The chancellor hailed this as a major piece of tax simplification. "People have already paid tax once on their money when they earn it. They shouldn't have to pay tax a second time when they save it," he said. "With our new personal savings allowance, 17 million people will see the tax on their savings not just cut, but abolished." Richard Lloyd of the consumers' association Which? said: "The tax break and new flexibilities on savings will prove popular with the millions who have got a raw deal on their savings in recent years. "But there are still many savers whose money is languishing in extremely poor paying accounts, so the financial industry must now play fair and help people get a better return." On the new Isa rules for what he called a "fully flexible Isa", Mr Osborne explained that so long as Isa money is taken out and replaced during the same tax year, such a move would not count towards the annual Isa contribution limit, which is due to rise in any case to £15,240 this coming April. "If you take that money out, you lose your tax-free entitlement, and so can't put it back in," he said. "With the fully flexible Isa, people will have complete freedom to take money out, and put it back in later in the year, without losing any of their tax-free entitlement." However, this new flexibility will apply to cash Isas only, and not to stocks and shares Isas. Mr Osborne said the change would be scheduled for this autumn after consultation. Iain McCluskey of accountants PwC said: "The very significant Isa allowance increase over this Parliament has meant that many savers already pay no income tax on their savings. "The additional flexibility on Isa contributions is a further move to encourage saving through Isas and will be welcome for those who have to dip into Isa savings on those all too frequent rainy days." HM Revenue & Customs confirmed that this new flexibility meant that someone could move out their entire Isa savings, accumulated over many years, and then reinstate them within the current tax year to resume their tax-free status. As a further attempt to help first time buyers save a deposit to buy a home, a "Help to Buy" Isa will be created. Within this, the government will add 25% to whatever is contributed by a saver. The monthly maximum contribution from savers will be just £200, with the government adding just £50 a month at the most. The accounts will run indefinitely once opened.  But if someone accumulates £12,000 over that time, a maximum of £3,000 will be added by the taxpayer. "Savers will have access to their own money and will be able to withdraw funds from their account if they need them for another purpose, but the bonus will only be made available for home purchase," the government said. The payment of the government bonus will only be triggered if the saver buys a home worth less than £450,000 in London, or less than £250,000 anywhere else. Paul Smee of the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: "Such steps are welcome. But as saving for a deposit will never become easy, we still need a clear focus on the supply of new housing that will help deliver a sustainable, affordable housing market over the long term." The cost of the tax subsidy to the Help to Buy Isa is estimated to rise from £230m in 2016-17 to £835m by 2019-20. To help pay for some of these tax concessions, the chancellor announced plans to further restrict pension tax relief. From 2016-17, the lifetime allowance - for pension savings that can be accumulated free of tax - will be cut from £1.25m to £1m. That will save the taxman £300m in 2016-17, rising to nearly £600m in  2019-20. From 2018, that allowance will be indexed to the consumer prices index (CPI) and will therefore start to rise again. Steven Cameron of insurance firm Aegon was disappointed. "A £1m pension pot may seem huge, but with improvements in health and life expectancy, people who retire at 60 may need to use their pension income to cover their costs for 30 years or more," he said. "If you want your pension to continue to your partner and rise with inflation, £1m will buy you less than £30k a year. Many people aspire to more than that." There will be no change to the annual allowance for pension savings, which stays at £40,000. Mr Osborne said changing that would have involved "penalising moderately-paid, long-serving public servants, including police officers, teachers and nurses, and instead rewarding higher-paid graduates". The change that will come into place will only affect the wealthiest pension savers. Government statistics show that among people about to retire, only 4% have pension savings worth more than £1m. It also justified its move by pointing out that in 2013-14, income tax relief for pensioners was worth a total of about £34bn, and of that about two-thirds went to people in the higher-rate or additional-rate tax bands.	Four big planned changes to encourage saving were outlined by the chancellor.
LF15, nicknamed "Lassie", touched down on Thursday afternoon to join her mate LM12, who arrived on 17 March. The charity said Lassie began rearranging her nest before the birds made their first attempts at mating. The pair, who can be watched on the reserve's live webcam, fledged three chicks in both 2015 and 2016. Charlotte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust, said: "We knew it was LF15 as soon as she arrived. "She has unmistakable features including a prominent dark brown "Y" on the top of her head and quickly set to work rearranging her nest to her satisfaction." Ms Fleming said LM12, who has spent the last week fending off crows and creating a deep cup on the nest to hold this season's eggs, joined his mate within an hour. She said: "While it was a frosty reception with lots of shouting and mantling at first, it only took a matter of minutes for them to begin to mate."	A female osprey has reunited with her mate at the Scottish Wildlife Trust's Loch of the Lowes reserve in Perthshire.
Burton, 62, worked briefly as Albion coach under Roy Hodgson before returning to the club in May 2014, to work alongside the club's sporting and technical director Richard Garlick. Day, 60, recruited in July 2014, was with Albion less than a year. "It was felt changes were required," said Albion chairman Jeremy Peace. Since appointing Garlick in January 2013 as 'sporting and technical director' to replace the FA-bound Dan Ashworth, Albion have had four head coaches - Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel, Alan Irvine and Tony Pulis. "We are looking ahead positively to a new beginning under Tony Pulis after two gruelling seasons," Peace told the Albion club website. "All our focus now is on preparing the squad for a stronger performance. "I am on record as saying we would be engaged in an on-going review at all levels. In Tony, we have a very experienced and hands-on operator." Former West Ham keeper Day was head of scouting and recruitment at Championship side Brighton prior to join Albion, while Burton left his post as Arsenal's head of youth coaching to return to the Midlands.	West Bromwich Albion technical director Terry Burton and head of recruitment Mervyn Day have left The Hawthorns as part of an expected summer reshuffle.
The quick rush defence of the Lions has been a feature of the tour. Farrell believes they were unfairly caught offside against the Highlanders last Tuesday, and expects the officials to review the tour matches before the series opener in Auckland on Saturday. "I've been looking for the offside, and I'm still looking for it now," he said. "It's up to us to show a good picture, but it's hard when everyone is going together. "We have good referees going forward. I am sure they will review the games like we will. "But I think it's pretty obvious we want to bring some line-speed to the game." The Lions play the Chiefs in Hamilton on Tuesday before starting the three-Test series against the All Blacks this weekend. They have played five matches on the tour so far, beating the Maori All Blacks 32-10 last Saturday, four days after a 23-22 defeat by the Highlanders. Flanker James Haskell says intensity in defence is a hallmark of sides coached by coach Warren Gatland and Farrell. "It's almost using defence as an attacking weapon in itself," said Haskell, who starts for the Lions against the Chiefs on Tuesday. "The guys the other night [against the Maori All Blacks] took the defence on tour to a new level, but you have to go to another level again to deal with the All Blacks." Media playback is not supported on this device Meanwhile, Haskell says the six new additions controversially added to the squad over the weekend have been warmly welcomed into the fold as players can stay out of the "politics of situations like that". "What's most important is you have team-mates coming on board who buy into what the Lions are about and deliver a performance," Haskell said. "Being a sportsman you can crack on with the job because life is way too short to be worrying about other things. "They are good boys, get on with it. That's all that matters." And Farrell thinks the Lions are ready to meet the challenge of New Zealand, who have won the last two World Cups. "The All Blacks are the best team in the world," Farrell added. "They're an unbelievable side. But our squad is full of winners. It's full of guys who are used to winning and know how to win. "They're in a new side that's been developing over the last four weeks. And I think we're going to be a hell of a side. "We play this game on Tuesday, hopefully we'll get the result we're after and show improvement again. "Then we'll go down to Auckland, there's a sea of red there. Everything builds up. The strength of the collective group is going to be phenomenal. Let's see what we can bring when we bring a togetherness."	British and Irish Lions assistant coach Andy Farrell is wary of his side being harshly penalised in defence in the Test series against New Zealand.
The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) confirms that bills and emissions have been forced down since 2008 by EU energy efficiency rules. Appliances like fridges, freezers and boilers are now designed to use less energy for the same work. Ministers say they will make new energy efficiency policy in the Autumn. But the government's critics point out that its Clean Growth plan for an efficient low-carbon society is already many months behind schedule. The CCC says the UK must shift much more swiftly towards electric cars to reduce carbon and tackle local air pollution. It also says a strategy is urgently needed to insulate millions of homes and create new forms of heating that don't foul the air or crank up climate change. The report's finding on home energy bills will surprise people amidst allegations of energy company profiteering and fears that many households find energy prices too high. It confirms that although the cost per unit of electricity and gas has indeed risen, household bills have fallen thanks to EU and UK efficiency standards which forced engineers to design appliances that use less energy. It says since 2008, when the Climate Change Act was introduced, electricity demand is down 17% (despite all our gadgets) and gas demand is 23% lower, thanks to better insulation and UK rules on improved boilers. The CCC chair Lord Deben told BBC News: "Really good EU regulations have made all our appliances much more efficient. It's meant we've been able to cut bills by about Â£20 a month for the average consumer. "It's been a remarkable success story. But the crucial thing is we've got to keep on doing it." It is not yet clear how the UK will be affected by future EU efficiency rules, although it will be impossible for UK manufacturers to sell inefficient goods into the EU market. Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy at Exeter University, told BBC News: "I don't think most people have any idea about the positive role EU standards play in our appliances in our houses - and have done for the last 25 years, or so. "They have brought down bills considerably, they have brought down carbon emissions and they have stimulated innovation. It would be quite mad to get rid of them when we leave the EU." Meanwhile, the CCC says the government's carbon cutting policies are already off track to meet its obligation under the Climate Change Act to cut emissions of 57% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. The CCC wants: more low-carbon electricity through the 2020s; faster uptake of electric vehicles; a strategy for deploying the carbon capture and storage technology (still very expensive); and a strategy for the uptake of low-carbon heat, perhaps by switching from natural gas to hydrogen for home heating. The new climate change minister Claire Perry told Parliament that she wanted to see if the government's embryonic Clean Growth plan could be made more ambitious. She promised to bring forward policies in the Autumn. But green groups question the government's sincerity. They say that in a meeting of EU energy ministers, France, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Italy, Luxembourg and Republic of Ireland supported improvements in energy saving of 1.5% per year. But the UK, backed by Malta, Poland and others, wanted flexibilities and lower, non-binding targets. Imke LÃ¼bbeke from the green group WWF said: "It should have been a no-brainer to support strong energy efficiency measures given the economic, climate and social benefits of doing so, and the ambition required by the Paris Agreement. "Despite this, member states have rushed to appease the lowest common denominator to reach a quick but bad deal, rather than putting in more time to try and get a better deal." A government spokesman told BBC News: "The government is a world leader in tackling climate change and committed to meeting the UK's targets set under the Climate Change Act 2008. "We have cut emissions by more than a third while growing the economy by over two thirds, and continue to support our burgeoning low-carbon sector." One difficult challenge for the government's Clean Growth plan will be to persuade home owners to insulate their properties better, following the failure of the Green Deal finance scheme. Carbon and energy price targets can't be achieved unless insulation is improved, but the public is loathe to suffer the disruption and cost of works which will take years to pay back, and ministers baulk at throwing grants at householders to improve the value of their properties. One campaigner, Simon Roberts from the Centre for Sustainable Energy, offers a glimmer of a solution. He suggests an incremental approach in which the government and local councils work to develop skills in a home insulation industry by helping people who have spare cash to invest in measures that improve their comfort as they age. He told BBC News: "We've got ourselves paralysed trying to get the whole housing stock up to standard rather than thinking about how we get the next million done. "There are people willing to invest in retro-fitting their houses and builders ready to do it. If we can find ways to orchestrate that at a local level you could start to change the whole dynamic of how our houses get retro-fitted and create a new social norm." The climate sceptic group Global Warming Policy Forum (GWPF) urges the government to consider the social effects of allowing energy costs to rise in the assumption that they will be offset by energy savings. Its spokesman John Constable told BBC News: "All consumers will be seeing the price increases that result from climate policies, but not all consumers will benefit from the energy efficiency measures since these typically require the purchase of new appliances. That means the consumers who benefit tend to be better off." Energy isn't the only issue tackled in the CCC report. It also focuses on adaptation to changes already underway in the climate. It warns that key infrastructure in the UK is still vulnerable to the sort of extreme weather events expected as the world warms. The CCC admits that some action has been taken to address the risks from warming, like funding for flood defences. But it says much more needs to be done to make Britain's infrastructure resilient to extreme events. The government spokesman said: ""We've implemented the majority of recommendations from the first National Adaptation Programme report and are pleased the CCC recognises the progress that has been made, but we agree there is a need to do more." Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Simon Bullock said: "This is the starkest warning yet from the climate committee that the UK government must up its game. "Climate change threatens the security of everyone at home and abroad and the continual delay from ministers on producing a fit-for-purpose strategy is simply unacceptable. " Follow Roger on Twitter.	Household energy bills and carbon emissions will rise unless ministers devise new policies to save power, a report says.
The students at the prestigious Istanbul High School had accused their principal of being too obedient to Turkish officials and not speaking up for their rights. As more and more students joined the protest, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that Turkey did not need a repeat of the Gezi protests that shook the country in 2013. "We see that some forces who have not learnt from the past are trying to provoke the universities, the high schools," he said. The students' demands were similar, as were their complaints. "They are restricting our activities," complained one graduate of Istanbul High School. "They say that the country is going through troubling times so we cannot hold concerts at school. But then the government ran a festival on the anniversary of the conquest of Istanbul. So why restrict our activities? Is there a double standard?" More than 370 Turkish schools have since signed an overtly political declaration by the Turkey High School Students Union TLB, refusing to allow what they see as the spread of fundamentalism in high schools. "They do not allow girls' volleyball teams at the schools because girls are supposed to wear shorts," read the statement. TLB leader Bora Celik complained that there was a movement against secular and mixed education. "They do not permit literature or poetry societies. There are prayer rooms in schools where there are no laboratories. These protests are the result of such oppression," he said. The leader of the main opposition party has backed the students and there are fears that education has become a political football in Turkey's increasingly polarised society. "I would hate to see the tension rise," says Batuhan Aydagul, director of the Education Reform Initiative, an independent think tank. And the school protests do not stop there. In an upper middle-class district in Istanbul, parents of students studying in the Ismail Tarman Secondary School have been staging demonstrations for more than a fortnight. They object to plans to convert their school into an "Imam-Hatip" - a religious school where girls and boys are segregated and taught Sunni Islamic religion and religious practices outside the national curriculum. "I came running to the school as soon as I heard of these plans," says Bengu Bozkurt. "If I wanted my son to have a religious education, then I would have sent him to an Imam-Hatip school already. But I believe in secular education." The Imam-Hatip row has engulfed other schools too since 2012, when the government introduced a contentious 12-year compulsory education system, known in Turkey as 4+4+4. With four-year phases each for primary, secondary and high school levels, this new system had paved the way for religious schools. They virtually severed our carotid artery. Can a person live when his artery is cut? No he cannot" After Turkey's so-called post-modern coup in 1997, such religious schools were largely closed down. At the opening of an Imam-Hatip school in September last year, President Erdogan compared the closures to the severing of an artery. But, he emphasised, "we were patient". A graduate of an Imam-Hatip school himself, the president has long spoken of his plans to raise a "pious generation" and to change the national curriculum. And since his Islamist-rooted AK Party came to power in 2002, there has been a dramatic reversal of fortunes for Imam-Hatip schools, whose pupil numbers have increased by 90% to more than 1.2 million. For Ecevit Oksuz, head of Turkey's Imam-Hatip Graduates Association, says it is simply a question of meeting a high demand for places. "I would never agree to someone being forced to send their sons or daughters to an Imam-Hatip. But as long as there are demands, there also need to be sacrifices," he says. But there are others who see an unstated aim to make Turkish education more Islamic and conservative. "Imam-Hatip schools can of course be established. But there is pressure on all schools to convert. Students and parents are saying enough is enough!" says Kamuran Karaca, leader of Egitim-Sen, one of Turkey's biggest teachers' unions. He fears that tensions surrounding education could become worse. "If people say that's enough, and no-one listens to them, then everyone will try to establish their own model of education and society. I hope it won't come to that."	When a group of high school students in Istanbul turned their backs on their head teacher as he addressed their graduation ceremony, it was the start of a wave of protests that has spread to hundreds of schools across Turkey.
