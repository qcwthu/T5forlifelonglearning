There are 250 commercial growers in County Armagh, supplying the cider, bakery and fresh markets. And right now, they are in the middle of a six-week window to get them in. They are mostly of the Bramley variety, with some eating apples mixed in. Edmund Allen farms 70 acres of orchard on Grange Lodge farm outside Loughgall. He aims to produce 1,000 tonnes a year, with about half of it going to make fillings for the bakery trade. Most of the rest, he sells to cider makers and to shops and supermarkets. But what is it about apples and Armagh? Edmund provided his own explanation. "Apples have been grown here for, we think, around 3,000 years," he said. "It is the climate, we're near Lough Neagh which acts as a heat sink and keeps the temperature that little bit higher. "So it's that, the fact that the soil type is good and the experience that we've built up over generations growing apples." But it can be a precarious business. A sharp frost in early May, killed the blossom and nearly put paid to a year's work. "I looked out the window and I didn't want to go out near the orchard, I knew what had happened," Edmund added. "All the blooms I picked off had gone brown, they were dead. "But we are really truly amazed at the apples that have set, we couldn't find any live blooms and yet nature has healed itself and we have sufficient apples to meet the market requirements." Some orchards are only returning a 50% harvest due to that frost, but others are up to 90%. Edmund says prices for his apples have been fairly "stable". It costs him £40 a bin to produce the fruit. If he can sell them for between £60-80 he is doing well. But he says he would need £100-110 a bin to reinvest in the business. His annual running costs are around £80,000 and he tries to replant 10% every five years. In the old days, there used to be 100 trees to the acre. Now they are using smaller varieties to get more in and there could be 400 trees in the same space. And in a another attempt to push up productivity, Edmund is looking to the Netherlands for help. Native bumblebees caught here are shipped there for breeding, then brought back. They are being trialled because they are better suited to the climate and are a bit harder working than the hundreds of thousands of honey bees that Edmund relies on to pollinate his trees.	£20m a year, that is what the harvest is worth to the apple growers of the Orchard County.
Referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn gave Equatorial Guinea a controversial penalty in stoppage time as they beat Tunisia 2-1 in the quarter-finals. Tunisia staff confronted the official after the match and their federation has been fined $50,000 (£33,000). "The referees committee noted the poor performance of the referee," the Confederation of African Football said. Caf added that the referee's failings included an "unacceptable failure to maintain calm and ensure proper control of the players during the match". Caf also wants an apology from Tunisia for accusations of bias. And Tunisia have been ordered to pay for damages to a door and a refrigerator in the team's dressing room at Bata Stadium. Mauritian referee Seechurn awarded the penalty in stoppage time after Ali Maaloul was harshly ruled to have fouled Ivan Bolado when Tunisia were leading 1-0 and, after equalising from the spot through Javier Balboa, hosts Equatorial Guinea went on to win in extra-time. Seechurn has also been removed from Caf's list of elite referees. According to Caf, it was sent two letters by the Tunisian FA following the match, with the second asking for an investigation and suggesting that Caf and its officials "were questionable and biased against Tunisia in general". Unless Tunisia's football federation can provide "irrefutable evidence to substantiate the accusations" they need to send a letter of apology by midnight on 5 February or face expulsion from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Tunisia football chief Wadie Jary resigned from Caf in protest after the match and he was also "condemned" for his behaviour after going on to the pitch to confront Seechurn, as well as criticising the referee and African football's governing body. Equatorial Guinea were fined $5,000 (£3,300) for poor security at the stadium.	An Africa Cup of Nations referee has been banned for six months for "poor performance".
In a post on the social media site, he said his personal challenge this year would be to build a "simple AI" similar to the butler Jarvis from the film Iron Man. Mr Zuckerberg plans to share his progress over the course of the year. Last month, he made headlines for plans to give away 99% of his Facebook stake. He had to defend his philanthropic venture - launched to celebrate the birth of his daughter- after critics argued that it could provide a way for the founder to avoid paying tax on the sale of his shares. On Monday, Mr Zuckerberg said he would start to build the AI with technology that is already out there and teach it to understand his voice to control everything in his home from music and lights to temperature. "This should be a fun intellectual challenge to code this for myself," Mr Zuckerberg said. "I'll teach it to let friends in by looking at their faces when they ring the doorbell," he said. "I'll teach it to let me know if anything is going on in Max's (his daughter's) room that I need to check on when I'm not with her." It is now a long time ago, but I've been trying to remember my two periods of paternity leave. I dimly recall clumsily changing nappies, making endless cups of tea for visitors, and a mixture of immense joy and total weariness. What I'm sure I did not do is come up with a plan for a personal robot assistant. Read Rory's full analysis here. For Facebook, he added that the system would help him visualise data in virtual reality and help him build better services, as well as lead his company. His announcement comes as Facebook is in the midst of AI initiatives such as building an assistant through its Messenger app for users. The tech billionaire said a part of the motivation behind this year's challenge was the reward of building things yourself. His previous personal challenges have included learning Mandarin, reading two books a month and meeting a new person every day, he said.

Is this the end of the legal struggle and what are the ramifications of the judgement? EBT stands for Employee Benefit Trust and, in this case, it refers to a scheme that was widely used by large companies in a bid to avoid tax liabilities. Companies would set up trusts and make cash payments from these trusts in the form of tax-free loans to employees or beneficiaries - thus avoiding the need to pay tax. In many cases the loans were never repaid. Legislation has since been passed outlawing the use of the scheme for tax avoidance purposes. Payments from an EBT are not allowed to be made on a contractual basis but HMRC insist the loans made by the club between 2001 and 2010 were actually employee earnings that should be subject to the normal National Insurance and PAYE contributions. They point to emails and letters between Rangers directors and players' agents and to the fact that none of loans have ever been paid back. Players, managers and even directors received EBTs at Rangers. Stars such as Barry Ferguson and Lorenzo Amoruso benefited from the scheme as did managers Alex McLeish, Dick Advocaat and Graeme Souness. Former owner Sir David Murray was also in receipts of an EBT. Over 80 members of Rangers staff received payments this way. The loans paid to each member of staff differed but a total of over £47m was paid out from the trusts in the years the scheme was in operation. There will undoubtedly be calls for the football authorities to act following this judgement. A Scottish Premier League investigation headed by Lord Nimmo Smith found Rangers guilty of not registering players properly and the company was fined in 2013. Nimmo Smith's judgement was made at a time when the EBT scheme was deemed acceptable by a tax tribunal and he resisted calls for the club to be stripped of honours won during the years the scheme was in operation, saying "Rangers FC did not gain any unfair competitive advantage from the contraventions of the SPL Rules..." It's unlikely the football authorities will have much appetite to sanction another investigation but that won't stop some calling for just that. A spokesman said the Scottish Premier Football League will "take time to examine the ‎judgement in detail and to consider any implications..." Celtic are the only other Scottish club to have used the EBT scheme. They paid the Brazilian midfielder Juninho from a trust in 2005 but have since settled with HMRC. A number of clubs in England also operated the scheme and some have already settled with HMRC. The case was first heard by a First Tier Tax Tribunal in 2012. The tribunal found in Rangers' favour but HMRC appealed. In 2014 that appeal was thrown out by an Upper Tier Tribunal. HMRC then appealed to the court of session in Edinburgh and three judges found in the Revenue's favour. Since the dispute started Rangers were forced into administration and liquidation. In a bid to avoid a tax bill, the club's liquidators BDO decided to fight that ruling and took their appeal to the Supreme Court. The outcome is expected to have no material or financial impact on Rangers as the club is now owned by a different company. The company is liable for the tax but given the company is in liquidation then the buck stops with the liquidators - in this case BDO. This doesn't mean that individuals who were in receipt of an EBT escape payment. Legislation is expected in the next few months that will require tax to be paid on all loans received through the EBT process from 1999 onwards. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and their decision brings the matter to a close. Rangers oldco liquidators have admitted as much in a statement. "Given the significance of the matter and the support and direction received from creditors and the liquidation committee, we believe taking the case to the Supreme Court has been the correct course of action," said BDO. "We will now engage with HMRC on adjudicating its claim. Further advice and guidance will be provided to creditors in due course."	The Supreme Court has ruled in favour of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in its fight with Rangers over the club's use of Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs).

A Freedom of Information request revealed there were 634 reports in the 2015-16 financial year, compared with 316 the year before. Police said the rise could have been caused by changes over which incidents schools can deal with internally. An education expert called the figures "worrying" and said police needed to identify the reason for the increases. John Howson, who is also a former teacher, said: "I'm extremely worried about these figures - the doubling of the violence against a person, whatever source it is or however minor." Thames Valley Police said more incidents were now included in their figures after the Home Office clarified a policy about what must be investigated. It added: "Recorded violent crime went up in the Thames Valley overall last year by 30% so we would anticipate an increase in violence in schools as well. "All schools in Thames Valley have contact with police through either dedicated schools officers or neighbourhood policing teams. "Their approach is one of preventing young people from entering the criminal justice system rather than criminalising them." In January a survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers showed that, nationally, 43% of teachers four out of 10 teachers had to deal with physical violence in the past year.	The number of violent incidents in schools reported to Thames Valley Police more than doubled last year.
Mr Liu's family had been informed of the situation, medical staff in the north-eastern city of Shenyang said. The dissident was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer in May. He was imprisoned in 2009 on charges of inciting subversion against the state after he helped to write a petition calling for political reform in China. "Liu Xiaobo's liver function has worsened, his bilirubin levels are gradually rising," the hospital said in a statement. Bilirubin is produced by the liver, and high levels of it can indicate liver failure. A photograph showing the dissident looking frail was shared among friends and fellow activists on Thursday. He is standing beside his wife, Liu Xia. In an open letter to the authorities, his friends have asked to be allowed to visit him on a "humanitarian basis". "We feel this is deeply tragic and realise that Liu Xiaobo has few days left and fear he is near death," it says. "At this moment, we urgently need to go to visit him to bring to Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia their friends' care and well wishes." On Wednesday, China invited medical experts from the US and Germany to help treat Mr Liu. Authorities said the decision was made at the request of his family. The decision came ahead of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany. Diplomatic sources in Beijing say China has been nervous the issue might overshadow President Xi Jinping's appearance at the summit, Reuters reports. Mr Liu, who was a key leader in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, won the Nobel peace prize in 2010. His wife Liu Xia has been under house arrest since then - but she has never been charged. Mr Liu has three years left to serve of his sentence for "inciting subversion" after drafting Charter 08 - which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China. Amnesty International has said he should never have been jailed.	The Chinese hospital treating imprisoned Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo for advanced liver cancer says his condition has worsened.
Rangers confirmed that Jardine had lost an 18-month battle against cancer on Thursday evening. He was part of their European Cup Winners' Cup-winning team of 1972 and played 38 times for his country. He was respected not only by Rangers fans but also the wider football community Ibrox manager Ally McCoist said everyone at Rangers was devastated at the loss of "a legend" and "a great man". And the club said their thoughts were with his wife Shona, children Steven and Nicola, his grandchildren and friends. Hearts also extended their condolences to his family, with the Tynecastle club adding they were deeply saddened at the death of a club legend. Media playback is not supported on this device Edinburgh-born Jardine began his career with Rangers in 1965 and went on to make over 600 appearances for the Ibrox side. As well as playing in the club's European triumph in 1972, the full-back won three top-flight titles, five Scottish Cups and five Scottish League Cups with Rangers. A move to Hearts followed in 1982 and, along with former Rangers team-mate Alex MacDonald, he was joint-manager at Tynecastle between 1986 and 1988. Under their command, the Edinburgh club lost out on the Scottish title on the final day of the 1985-86 season, Celtic taking advantage of Hearts' defeat at Dundee to pip them to the crown. Jardine's on-field contribution that term was such, though, that he was named Scotland's player of the year for the second time at the age of 37. The honour came 11 years after he first won the award. After his playing career ended, he returned to work for Rangers in various roles. In November 2012, it was confirmed Jardine was being treated for cancer. "He was respected not only by Rangers fans but also the wider football community and he is a huge loss to the game," McCoist said on Rangers' website. "I had the privilege of watching Sandy playing for Rangers when I was a young boy, I had enjoyed the pleasure of working with him closely since I returned to the club in 2007 and he was a truly remarkable human being. "His achievements both on and off the pitch are second to none and I was honoured to regard him as a friend. "He gave everything for this great club and worked tirelessly in a number of roles because he wanted to ensure the traditions, history and standards at Rangers were maintained. "He recently told me he was proud to be a Ranger and wanted to be remembered forever as a Ranger. Well Sandy, you will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time and we will miss you terribly." During his time at Ibrox, Jardine was a team-mate of Sir Alex Ferguson. The former Manchester United manager and his wife, Cathy, added their own tribute. "From Cathy and I, this is some of the worst news we have heard," he said. "Sandy was a noble and courageous man. "The respect he is held in at Rangers is immense. He was one of the greatest players ever to wear the jersey. To Shona and family, we express our sympathy and sadness." Jardine's international career spanned nine years and included appearances at the 1974 and 1978 World Cup tournaments. He captained his country on nine occasions. Campbell Ogilvie, the Scottish FA President, added his condolences. "I am extremely saddened by the news of Sandy's passing," he said. "I have known him for more than 40 years and found him to be as warm and courteous off the field as he was reliable and elegant on it. "As well as being a talisman for both Rangers and Heart of Midlothian during an illustrious and enduring playing career, he was also a terrific servant to the Scotland national team." Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell also paid tribute to Jardine. "This is absolutely devastating news," he said. "He was a very fine man and it was a privilege to know him. Sandy was widely respected across the game and he will be sadly missed by us all."	Former Rangers, Hearts and Scotland defender Sandy Jardine has died at the age of 65.
"It's a question of reason," he said on French TV. His decision prompted immediate thanks from Mr Macron, who is neck-and-neck for the first round of the election with far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Mr Valls was himself defeated in the race for the Socialist candidacy. But instead of backing the man who won, Benoît Hamon, the former prime minister announced on Wednesday that backing Mr Macron was the responsible position to take, because of the risk of giving the presidency to the right or far right. "I don't think you take risks for the Republic. So I will vote for Emmanuel Macron," he said. "France's best interests go beyond the rules of a primary." Mr Valls met Socialist MPs on Tuesday night to explain his position, and he has rejected accusations of betraying his own party. Mr Hamon has already accused party heavyweights of stabbing him in the back and said on Wednesday that he was the victim of a weekly soap opera aimed at undermining him. While not the first senior party figure to back Emmanuel Macron, Mr Valls is seen as the biggest name so far. Defence Minister Yves Le Drian and a handful of junior ministers have already given the centrist their support. For months, the spectre of implosion has hovered over the Socialist party, with commentators talking of a fault-line threatening to split the party in two. And for months senior party members have teetered and fallen to Emmanuel Macron, the man some believe betrayed the party by quitting the government and running for president. Now the centrist candidate has claimed one of the biggest scalps of all. A man once seen as Mr Macron's sworn political enemy. But the support of Manuel Valls, a prime minister to France's most unpopular post-war president, may be a mixed blessing for Emmanuel Macron. While he himself served in President Hollande's government, he has worked hard to present himself as an anti-establishment outsider; a fresh face in French politics. Mr Macron served as economy minister in Mr Valls's Socialist government but left to fight for the presidency with his own movement En Marche! (On the move). Opinions polls suggest he will qualify for the second round run-off against Ms Le Pen in May. Benoît Hamon, seen as a left-wing rebel within the party, has failed to attract mainstream support across the French left and his campaign has been eclipsed by radical left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who could beat him into fifth place in the first-round vote on 23 April. Centre-right candidate François Fillon, initially tipped to win the race, has fallen behind the two front-runners because of "fake job" allegations surrounding his British-born wife, Penelope. Both have been placed under formal investigation over the claims that she did little work for the hundreds of thousands of euros she received in public funds as parliamentary assistant.	France's ex-Prime Minister Manuel Valls has thrown his weight behind the centrist candidate for the presidency, Emmanuel Macron, and not his own Socialist party's candidate.
On Friday John Toshack takes his current side, Moroccan club Wydad Casablanca, to Egypt to face Zamalek in the first leg of their African Champions League semi-final. Toshack was a legendary player for Cardiff City, Liverpool and Wales and, as a manager, won a Spanish league title with Real Madrid and led Swansea City from the bottom division to the summit of English football. Now his Moroccan adventure is proving a successful sojourn in what the 67-year-old admits is the autumn of his sporting life. After managing teams in the footballing outposts of Macedonia and Azerbaijan, Toshack is enjoying a new lease of life in Casablanca. "I've been very fortunate in my career, but this one is something extra really," he tells BBC Wales Sport. "If someone said you would be managing going on 68 I would never have thought so. "It came out of the blue, it's another country and another continent and things are going really well." After taking charge in June 2014, he led Wydad to the Moroccan title in his first campaign and followed that up with the runners-up spot last season to secure African Champions League football. Toshack admits the foray into African football has come as a surprise even for a man of his formidable experience. It has not just been footballing matters either. The Cardiff-born former striker has been left amazed by the vast distances he and his team have had to cover across the continent as they have progressed through the tournament. And Toshack admits if his side were to lift the trophy next month, it would rank right up there with everything he has achieved in his career. But although Friday's game is just the first leg of the semi-final - with the pair meeting again back in Morocco on September 24 - the former Wales boss has also hinted that lack of progress could see him bring the curtain down on his African adventure and perhaps his life in football all together. "It's been very different and interesting," says Toshack. "We've travelled to Egypt, the Ivory Coast, to Madagascar, to Zambia, in a competition which to win we have to play 16 matches. When we went to Zambia we were away for eight days. "The (Morocco) Federation is good, we don't have to play for a week after a game, but it does cause problems. "We are in September and not played a league game yet - we are already three games behind everyone else. "To be honest, if we can win this, for various reasons it would have to go down as one of the most successful periods of my career. There have just been so many things we have had to adapt to. "If things go wrong here, like they could easily do, I'm not sure I would have the patience again to turn things around. "To be honest, we'll see how we do in these semi-finals and then that would be a good time to sit down and take stock." Apart from his six years as manager of Wales, Toshack's two years with Wydad is his longest spell in a job since 2000. Reflecting on his career which has seen Toshack hold 17 managerial roles with 13 different teams, it is the spell with Wales which has been subject to reappraisal. In light of Wales' success at Euro 2016 and their progress under Chris Coleman and the late Gary Speed, Toshack himself is now being credited with helping to start the revival. It was he who blooded many of the players who now make up the core of Coleman's side. He handed debuts to Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Joe Ledley and made Gareth Bale the youngest Wales international after selecting him aged 16 for a friendly against Trinidad & Tobago back in 2006. "It's six years ago since I finished and to see so many of those players playing as mature professionals, it gives me a lot of satisfaction to be honest," Toshack adds. "Looking at the Moldova game, what strikes me is the ease with which Wales win games now. "I recall the difficulty we had just to get a result against these kinds of teams all those years ago. You can just see now how the players have matured.  Now you are winning a game 4-0 against Moldova, whereas before, whoever we played, that would have been difficult. " Toshack insists Bale will go on to beat Ian Rush's goal-scoring record of 28 for his country and believes that, at one of his former clubs, Real Madrid, Bale has matured into more than just another player. Bale's two strikes in the win over Moldova took his tally to 24 in 62 internationals. "You would imagine he would break the record during this World Cup campaign, but if it does not happen now, it will sooner or later," said Toshack. "Gareth's probably at the best age now to push on. "I know they are delighted with him at Madrid, the way he plays, the ways he acts off the pitch and the things he says. "On top of everything else he's turning out to be a terrific ambassador for his country too. "It's not just Gareth, but a lot of the players with Wales. How many of them are up to 60 or 65 caps already? And they are only 26 or 27 years of age. "There will be a lot of them breaking the record for Wales' caps."	The ancient Egyptian port of Alexandria has seen many historic events, and it might be about to witness the final throes of one of Wales' most illustrious sporting careers.
Johnstone opened the scoring with a close-range tap-in on eight minutes. The 21-year-old slotted Bobby Barr's cross into the bottom corner for his 14th goal of the season to make it 2-0, before Paul McMullan added a third. Dale Hilson and Gary Oliver hit back for the visitors but Morton held on for the win.	Denny Johnstone netted a first-half brace as Morton returned to winning ways with victory over Queen of the South.
DJ Derek, whose real name is Derek Morris, also appeared at the Big Chill and numerous gigs across the UK. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed Mr Morris was reported missing on Thursday and a search for him is under way. Mr Morris's niece, Jennifer Amy, said his disappearance is "completely out of character". She said: "I've left numerous messages for him and he hasn't got back - if he goes away he always lets me know. "His friends have been in touch to say he hasn't been in contact. "We're all extremely worried." And Bristol's elected mayor, George Ferguson, said on Twitter: "DJ Derek is a legend - I'll do all I can to spread word across #Bristol." Geoff Barrow, from the band Portishead, has also tweeted his support while Bestival founder and DJ Rob da Bank hoped one of his "favourite ever" DJs would be found. DJ Derek's disappearance is trending on the social networking site. Mr Morris launched his DJ Derek career in his mid-30s after working in the accounts department of confectionery firm Cadbury's. In 2006, he told the BBC's Inside Out that he left the firm after years of "domestic hell" before starting work as a DJ in a Bristol pub. Over more than 40 years he established himself as a fixture on the city's clubbing scene. As well as playing at Glastonbury, he has also released his own compilation album and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video. In 2012 he won the Lord Mayor's medal for his "outstanding" contribution to the music scene in the city. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 after he was given the award, he said he finished most sets with the Bob Marley classic One Love. He said: "It's a perfect signing-off record for a reggae set - let's get together and feel all right. So next time, people, let's get together and feel all right." He played his final set before retiring at a London show in 2013.	A 73-year-old DJ who played sets at Glastonbury has gone missing, his family has said.
The 5,500-year-old Neolithic axe was found during archaeological surveys ahead of a multi-billion euro tunnel project. The axe seems to have been jammed into what was once the seabed, perhaps as part of a ritual offering. The lack of oxygen in the clay ground helped preserve the wooden handle. The find was made in Rodbyhavn on the Danish island of Lolland, which is to be connected to the German island of Fehmarn via the tunnel link. "Finding a hafted [handle-bearing] axe as well preserved as this one is quite amazing," said Soren Anker Sorensen, an archaeologist at the Museum Lolland-Falster in Denmark. Archaeologists have found other similarly well preserved organic material in the area during their excavations. These include upright wooden stakes, a paddle, bows and other axe shafts. Axes were vital tools for Stone Age people, who used them for working wood. However, they also played an important role during the introduction of farming to Europe, when the majority of the land was covered by dense forests. The archaeologists suggest that the Neolithic communities of south Lolland may have been using the coast as an offering area. Earlier this month, archaeologists working on the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel scheme announced that they had uncovered 5,000-year-old footprints along the edge of an ancient fish trap excavated at Rodbyhavn.	Archaeologists in Denmark have uncovered an incredibly rare find: a stone age axe held within its wooden handle.
The 18-year-old centre-back came through the youth system at Stoke City and impressed during a trial with the Latics. The contract also includes the option of an extra year that Oldham can take up after this season. "He is really athletic, only 18 and definitely one for the future," boss David Dunn told the club website. "He has a lot of very good attributes and we spoke to Mark Bowen at Stoke City about him so we have decided he is a good young signing for us."

She died in Milan after a long illness, Italy's Ansa news agency reports. Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of publishers Conde Naste International, described her as "one of the greatest editors who ever made a magazine". Celebrities including Madonna, Kanye West and Victoria Beckham paid tribute to her. In a post on Instagram, Madonna posted a photo of her with the caption: "RIP Franca Sozzani! A trail blazer and a True Rebel! You are loved and adored by so many! We will miss you." US fashion model Kendall Jenner tweeted: "Rest peacefully, Franca Sozzani." Sozzani took charge of Vogue Italia in 1988 and became a key figure on the global fashion scene. In 2008, she produced an "all black" issue, featuring black models only. It became an international hit. Once asked how to define style, she said: "I think people should buy more mirrors than clothes, to see themselves before going out... but I think that clothes need to correspond to one's own personality. That is style." Sozzani was also a champion of humanitarian causes. She served as goodwill ambassador to fashion for the UN, supporting workers in the fashion world in Africa and Asia and helping to raise money to fight hunger. In a tribute on the Vogue website, US Vogue editor Anna Wintour described Sozzani as "warm, clever, funny". "She made everything she worked on appear effortless, regardless of whether it was an event for several hundred; a whirlwind trip to Africa to support the continent's emerging designers; or the creation of yet another newsworthy, provocative, and utterly spellbinding issue of Italian Vogue," she said. Sozzani attended the Fashion Awards in London earlier this month where designer Tom Ford presented her with the Swarovski award for positive change.	Franca Sozzani, editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia for 28 years and a champion of Italian fashion, has died at the age of 66.
Ray Nottage and Claire Bath supported the idea of merging Dorset's nine councils into two unitary authorities. But two weeks ago the majority of council members voted against the idea. David Flagg was elected leader of the council following the no-confidence vote at a private meeting of the Conservative group on Monday evening. Mr Nottage said: "I had already made it clear I would not be standing as leader at the next AGM and there was a difference of opinion in terms of what I think should happen in a local government reorganisation. "I lost by one vote. I'm extraordinarily disappointed that they've been unable to understand the consequences of the vote against the reorganisation because it's so patently obvious that the service levels are going to collapse with the tsunami of costs which are coming on and the current financial situation of the county. "I think there is a considerable lack of understanding of the seriousness of the position we are in here in Dorset." The proposed reorganisation would see Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch combine into a single authority, with the rest of the county forming a second unitary council. The two unitary plan was rejected by councillors at Christchurch, Purbeck and East Dorset but leaders of the remaining six councils that voted in favour of the proposal have written to the government to express their support of the idea. East Dorset leader Spencer Flower has written to the government urging it not to force through the merger.	Christchurch Borough Council's leader and deputy have been ousted by their colleagues after a vote of no confidence.
