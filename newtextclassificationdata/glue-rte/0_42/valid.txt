When Reston was previously found in monkeys, few animal handlers were infected but only one had very mild symptoms," the DOH's official website announced.

premise: Israeli scientists predict the world's coral reefs could begin to collapse in as little as 30 years from now. Studies show the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic as they soak up manmade emissions of carbon dioxide. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem researchers say this will make it difficult for many coral organisms to produce skeletal and other hard parts. The team's work on corals in the Red Sea suggests a tipping point will be reached in between 30 and 70 years.  Then the forces of erosion eating away at corals will outstrip the organisms' ability to make the reefs. [SEP] hypothesis: The acidification of oceans affects tourism.	contradiction

premise: The Catering JLC formulates pay and conditions proposals of workers in the industry which, if approved by the Labour Court, legally binds employers to pay certain wage rates and provide conditions of employment. However,the QSFA now contends that the JLC has no right to make such a legally binding provision, as Section 15 of the Constitution states that the sole and exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas, and no other authority has power to make laws for the State. It also argued that the existence of the minimum wage and 25 other pieces of legislation protecting employees' rights means that there is no need for JLCs. The chairman of the QSFA, John Grace, warned that the situation would lead to job losses and closures. [SEP] hypothesis: John Grace works for QSFA.	entailment
