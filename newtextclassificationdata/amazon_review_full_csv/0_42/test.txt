Very disappointed--shoddy construction and way overpriced Mine worked acceptably well in the gym and was a good solution to having the shuffle attached somewhere, plus the phones, etc. Unfortunately it was out-of-proportion expensive and hasn't come down in price and VERY flimsy -- so that eventually it just broke--even under light use. I would replace it except for the ripoffski price and the probability the new one would break again.	terrible
OK, but only half of a book What did I think of the book??? I say WHY BOTHER?!?! Like many others who have commented here over the last 18 months, I feel I was "hoodwinked" by Mr. Lee. It appears he wrote half of a book and managed to peddle it to the unsuspecting public. I've learned to never buy one of Lee's books without checking the last page to see whether or not it is "to be continued". In this case Mr. Lee is already 2 years late on his promise. Yawn...I'm tired of waiting.	terrible
Disappointing My boyfriend loves Ms Pac Man, so when I saw this I figured it would be the perfect birthday gift. Buying it was a HUGE MISTAKE because the joystick doesn't work - Ms Pac Man would go straight when you tried to get her to turn (or turn if you wanted her to go straight). At first I thought maybe it was a problem with the unit I purchased, so I exchanged it for another one...same problem. The game was not playable, because you couldn't get away from the ghosts.The problems aren't confined to Ms. Pac Man alone, either. We experienced joystick issues on the other games on this unit.I finally returned the second unit I purchased.I wish I had read the reviews before buying it.Unless you're a glutton for punishment, don't buy this...	terrible

This Suite is barely ok! I just purchased SystemSuite 5 after using SS4 for the last couple years. Besides the new color, I have seen nothing that was improved. All the Utility tests are the same as SS4. The firewall is beyond slow on loading up and appears less in quality than ZoneAlarms free firewall. The anti-virus appears the same as SS4 and still misses virus's. Had a few basic problems, but Tech support assisted via email. Web page support appears useless with a max. of 20 answers for SS5. I was going to see how Norton SystemWorks 2004 rates to see if this 1 goes.	terrible

Thought it would be good , it wasn't. I thought this would be a good movie, I was very wrong.The acting is terrible, not only Vin Diesel's but all the actors are not doing a very good job, even Samuel L. Jackson's level is being dragged down by the rest.In this kind of movies the story doesn't have to be that good if the stunts are great, but they can not even do that right: All the smoke and explosives can't hide the ramps they use.Even the ending isn't exciting !That this was such a big blockbuster is a really surprise to me and it's probably the worst ever!Do not watch this if u like Vin Diesel, you won't after this !	terrible
Not a good mystery This book is too hard to follow. The plot is more into personal relationships than crime and would be better served in the romance novel section of a bookstore. It is one of the worst mysteries I have ever read. The crime part doesn't begin to happen until halfway through the bookThis book is not worth the noney.	terrible
Eye candy and weak on history I didn't read the entire book, simply browsed it for about 20 min while my daughter shopped for books in the kids section of the bookstore. However, it doesn't take much more than 20 min to get through it. The book is nothing but a timeline of miscellaneous events and grouped by presidency. Each event is covered by no more than a couple of sentences. You might learn some trivia going through it but not much else. It is also not a very objective view of US history - not a single "factoid" given for the 8 years of the Clinton presidency was positive, only negatives.	terrible
Jack of all trades, master of none I love the optical zoom, fit, finish and feel of this camera. However, when it comes to pictures, I was unable to get even one clear picture. My 6-year old Olympus D490Z 2MP camera takes much better pictures than this one.	terrible

Poor product and equally POOR customer support Purchase this heater . Had for 4 months and it worked fine. One day the swithch would not turn on. tried everything the sticker suggested. Finally called the customer service for Lasko. They Claim they have a three year waranty. Well they did not have a waranty registration by either email or card. They wanted the original sales receipt. Well of couse I did not have this. So nothing the worthless company could do. NO offer of a replaceemnt part or heater. I also check the Lasko web site. They have many product recalls for faulty heaters causing fires. So I guess I am lucky my heater quit and did not burn down my home.	terrible
CD was a good buy My daughter is doing this novel in school and so I bought it to help her.I am in Jamaica.The acting was great but the story did not follow the book at all in terms of chapter sequence and timelines.Did not expect a perfect match but this was to way off.It was good for her though as it brought the story alive and will hopefully incite her interest in the book.I do not regret buying it.	terrible
shot in the dark/ zero quality control/Junk!!! I wanted a new pair (24" and 48")levels for work. My Craftsman finally got knocked out of true by the damn young "kids" at work who think nothing of using them for pry bars.(lol) It(the craftsman) gave me 18+years of good service under my care. The 24" Stanley Fat Max Extreme arrived and the center vial was 60-70% smudged with epoxy making it impossible to read from one side. Quality control is non-exixtant on these cheap imports. The 48" Stanley FatMax Extreme I bought along with this had a 3/16" tapered metal burr left from the stamping/machineing process where the center vial is epoxied in. it prevented the vial cover from fitting in the body of the level. the burr had a good coat of paint over it otherwise it would have sliced me open. Removing it would have left a hole in the body of the level. Junk!!!!!!!! Mite I suggest a German made product. I wonder if any good tools are made in America anymore. They used to be well made but who knows now????	terrible

This product is garbage I have owned this clock for about 4 months, and the first 3 were just fine. After that, it stopped working properly with my ipod. Nothing I did fixed the fact that I could no longer wake to my ipod.

I would highly suggest purchasing a different product if you plan on using your ipod in this clock with frequency.	terrible

Dont waste your money! Breaks or stops working in a month or so I went through a few of these within a month of owning it.

You have to ship the unit at your expense every time as well and at 20+ pounds its expensive to ship and my closest place was a 2 hour drive.it doesnt make quality espresso at all its more like coffee even with premium beans that are ground just before brewing.Their customer service is useless as well they dont know anything about their units or making espresso.spend a couple hundred more and purchase a higher quality one that will last.	terrible
Just a teeny bopper fad Their first album was ok and showed some potential. But then they decided to kiss up to MTV and become rock's version of N'SYNC. On this album, you can tell that Fred Durst and buddies are very limited musically, all you hear is crap mixed with very weak rock. The reason why these guys are popular is because they write safe, conforming, uncreative songs that appeal to MTV's mindless teenybopper audience. The only good thing about this band is that they won't be around when the crap-rock fad dies in a few years.If you like c-rap then, you might like this album, but if you like real rock or metal, then stay away from this.	terrible
No words can describe ...how awful this remake is...I'm not even against remakes, really. This one is just so bad, I can't believe it made the album. Mallrats probably love it...how sad. Everyone else has covered the details. Please, buy or find a copy of Who's Next.	terrible

How disappointing! I absolutely love the movie Shag. The main ingredient that makes me love it is the music. I popped the video in the VCR and sat down at my computer.... When I scrolled down the page to see what songs were on the CD, I thought I had the wrong movie soundtrack. I was looking for "Alley Oop," "Stagger Lee," and "Mama Said." They aren't there!

I gave up I started this book, put it down, then started it again. Finally, I put it down and won't be picking it up again. It failed to grab my attention from the get-go. It seems like it took forever for anything to happen. And, it was incredibly boring. I am disappointed with the plethora of paranormals around lately. I am afraid that authors have to write this genre of book and either aren't wild about doing it, or they jump in too quickly and don't fully develop their story.Sherrilyn Kenyon has such a fully developed Dark Hunter, etc. world that her books really pull you in. Karen Marie Moning and her fairy stories are built upon of layer after layer of well researched and written material. This book just didn't get my attention, so I decided to move on in hopes of coming across something worth reading.	terrible
Unpleasant to say the least Despite being warned, I gave this book my time. And what a waste of time it was. This book was the worst book I have ever read. The writing style was jumpy and choppy. The choppiness of the writing made it difficult to follow. The ending just creeped me out. No wonder the movie bombed - even with Meg Ryan. And why would an actress like Meg Ryan want to be involved in such a dark, yuck, story? Warning! This is very sick stuff and not at all sexy or erotic. I hope to never again read about a murderer who likes to cut the nipples off his victims to save as "souvenirs" and all sorts of other unpleasant crap. This book was CRAP.	terrible
bizarre theories from bizarre academics Just take Prof. Heschel, the daughter of a distinguished rabbi and scholar. She finds Gibson's movie anti-feminist. That's a hoot, considering that traditional Judaism was anti-feminist.Some good ideas here, a lot of nonsense by axe-grinding academics. What is clear is that Gibson is 150% a Catholic medieval type. No one here has a good explanation why this appealed to Protestant fundies and bigots who don't give a hoot about the Stations of the Cross or the Virgin Mary.	terrible
SCREWPULL PRODUCT MAY BREAK A BOTTLE AT THE NECK My Screwpull caused a wine bottle to break at the neck.

Terrible This is the worst movie I have seen in long time. The effects are fake and the plot didn't make sense.

It worked great for about a month and I loved it then all it ever did was say HD Error and fry the thirty dollars worth of rechargable batteries i bought straight from Archos! Oh how I hate them and this product! I'm fourteen, i don't have a job it took me six months to save up for this, and now I'm just out of about 400$ The customer service is non existant! If I email them they tell me to call them, if I call them I get a menu loop. It's unfair. I'm just [out of luck] over, but lucky for you this happened to me first, so it DOESN'T have to happen to you.

Customer service sucks at Vitamix I just bought the latest model the 5000 and the machine is good but the price is quoted wrong. According to the Manager of Vitamix they add tax at all times so the price you see is not the price they charge at vitamix. If you go through ANY vender they always add extra claiming tax. So if you authorize the price they will attach tax in addition to it. Check your statement when / if you still choose to order. You will have to call your credit card company.	terrible

Not sharp. Straight blade chops, not slice I was so excited ot use this product as I make pickles a few times a year. This review is only for chopping cucumbers, so I don't know how well it works for other purposes. For cucumbers, it just plain sucks. The straight blade is not only too dull to cleanly cut cukes into chips (it tears the skin on the backside of the chip), it take a considerable amount of effort to just push it through the blade. It's also a bad design. The blade should be angled across the machine so it slices as well as chops.Returning it today to Crate and Barrel.	terrible

Not entirely safe The tubing that forms the base of the bouncer fits into plastic oval mounts and are secured by metal pins. The pins, made out of cheap stamped metal, are folded to create a spring. The problem is that these pins break very easily along the crease where they are folded, and once they break, the base can collapse. One day while my two month old son was in the bouncer, one of the tubes slipped out of the mount (two pins were broken) and the bouncer lurched forward. Luckily I was close by and held on to the seat, preventing my son from falling out. The manual said to call Kids II, the maker of the chair, for customer service. I called, left a message and received no reply. I called Boppy's customer service several times and each time left a message and, again, no reply. I emailed customer service at Boppy and once again received no response.	terrible

More conservative drivel!!!! While the author makes some valid points about sexual health and the importance of taking STIs seriously, deep down this is just repackaged Dobson.It is published by the "leading conservative publisher on policy issues" and should be read more as a tract on conservative sexual values than a medical guide. She, like all conservatives, bemoans the 60s yet again and is convinced that waiting and secondary virginty are the answers to all that ails teenagers.There are much better books, without the conservative slant, to be had on this important and complex issue.	terrible
Just plain cheap. I got this as a gift and didnt like it right away. It felt cheap, doesnt seem to have enough pressure to make espresso. Instead it appears to make just a 1/4 cup of coffee. Usually in espresso because its under pressure, you get a almost dark, baby poop brown liquid or foamy substance that comes out with the espresso. With this one it just comes out like normal coffee. The controls for steam are lame. It has an adjustment knob but the steam only goes on when its cranked all the way to high. Thats it, no medium or low steam. Because only the high steam seems to work you end up with a cup of just foam real quick. Im going back to my cheapo mr coffee espresso maker. It makes it just fine and is less than half the price of this one.	terrible
A real skin crawler I have read a number of Marion Chesney Regencies and I enjoyed them greatly. This particular work made my skin crawl.

Disappointing The title of this book is enticing, promising a viewpoint that embraces the dark side of human nature, rather than suppressing, ignoring, or bypassing it.But that's not quite what Ford does, here.Many of the exercises are silly and vacuous (especially the one where you have your "sacred" self talk to your "shadow self" -- oh, come on!). She talks about people "owning" their personality traits, yet doesn't show what this really means, or how this "ownership" produces any changes.She cites examples of techniques and anecdotes, from her own life and from people she has encountered, but all of these stories are greatly oversimplified, and seem rather insincere.Finally, she quotes a lot of other New Age writers, especially Deepak Chopra (for whose foundation she works -- fancy that!). In fact, much of her book is really a regurgitation of things that have been written elsewhere.Anyone looking for a truly "new" view of human nature, as I was, should look elsewhere. You won't find it, here.	terrible

Sheet protector leaked through - does NOT protect Item arrived promptly.

So my child was clean and comfortable.Changing the bed later I discovered WHY it was clean and comfortable on top - it leaked through completely and the bedding underneath was soaked through.I do not recommend this product if you are trying to prevent moisture from reaching the bedding or the mattress.

Boring This book is Jane Green's worse. There is nothing going on and I could care less about any of the characters. The book, I guess, is about Ellie not liking her "controling" mother-in-law. Well, I see nothing wrong with the mother-in-law. What grandmother does not want to see and hold their grandchild? Ellie gets way to emotional about the stupidest things. This character really gets on my nerves. I am stuggling to finish it but I hope the ending is her husband dumps her and she is all alone wishing she had the "controling" mother-in-law back.

Edited unless you buy the DVD version I had the same experience with opening the CD and THEN noticing it was edited, no labels in sight. A friend of mine bought the CD/DVD combo version and says the unedited CD is in that. Ummm... no. I'm not buying it twice.	terrible
If you like stories riddled with spelling and grammatical errors... [...]If that sounded sexy, amazing, or riveting to you, then you'll love this book. [...]This would be better if it were a story written for junior high. Alas, it is not. I gave it a 1-star rating because he deserves that much at least - he has the guts to publish it and let other people read it.I just had to warn people about this book.	terrible
UNSATISFIED, need to return or exchange product a.s.a.p. I received a 3 prong unit but my Dell laptop requires a 2 prong plug. I've emailed both the manufacturer and Amazon on procedure to return or exchange the item. Neither Amazon or the manufacturer have responded to my request to return or exchange for 2 prong item. Pleae respond.	terrible

hate it I hated this product ... it was terrible tasting and left me gassy all day long. Only took it for a couple days but that was enough!!!	terrible
Bamboozled by hype I was very disappointed in this film: the acting is distractingly amateurish, and there is no plausibility to the behaviors of the characters (viz., film crew). I did not feel invested in the characters or story. The musical score is a higgledy-piggledy mess and does not make the contribution that a well-fitting score should. I am also sorely disappointed in myself for succumbing to the marketing hype for this film. Never again.	terrible
No Bill No Coo As a child I saw Bill and Coo in the theater. It was one of my favorite movies. I was looking forward to sharing the film with my grandchildren but the DVD quality was so bad it wasn't worth seeing; it was too dark the sound was garbled and I felt it was a total rip off.	terrible
Pages missing and out of order The book sucked. Pages were missing or out of order. I returned one and the replacement was the same way. I just gave up after that.	terrible

Rubbish I didn't want to give it one star. This movie is a total stinker. I loved the original. It's just a shame to ruin the memory of it with this garbage. Next time, just don't bother....	terrible
Another ill-conceived, dated "comeback" DEVO CD - no no no! Again, I've tried to listen/love this highly mediocre "comeback" CD from the mighty DEVO, but the bottom line is that, like their earlier "comeback" effort on Enigma, this seriously BLOWS BIG TIME. Even for longtime DEVO fans/collectors, you'll be hard pressed to find ONE good track on this horrid CD - just lots of annoying, grating, hyperactive, tinny sounding late 80s/early 90s synth-pop masquerading as pop-art. Toss this in the trash and go back and listen to DUTY NOW, ARE WE NOT MEN, etc. The thing is, DEVO STILL ROCK LIVE, why can't they deliver in the studio? It's as if they have RUN OUT OF IDEAS...or at least passion.	terrible
Was slavery even an issue? Not a bad film if the fact that slavery doesn't seem to have any effect on any person involved.	terrible
This stuff is awful My sister (with yellow-blond hair) loved this product, so I tried it expecting the same. I have ashy blonde-brown hair. It bleached my hair into this awful shade of orange-red. Terrible! There should be a warning on it! I'll be complaining to clairol.	terrible
I have the perfect replacment I used this book for my materials characterization undergrad course. Like most text's I used, I found it lacking examples and was outdated. I searched for a better text and came across "Introduction to Diffraction in Materials Science and Engineering" by Aaron Krawitz. This text does justice to the topic and I would advise any MSE department to adapt it instead of Cullity.	terrible

90's RUSH I Think every RUSH albumn is worth owning.The song "Roll the Bones" is very good even with the little rap section."Dreamline" is my favorite song on the CD and it is one of the best songs By RUSH that I have heard.Every RUsh CD has something on it that I like and that is ALOT more than I can say about alot of Rock Bands.I think "Moving Pictures" is hard to top. "Counterparts" and "test for echo" are my favorite RUSH cd's from the 90's era.At First I diddnt like most of the songs on this CD,But after a few more spins I like most of the record.It is one of those CD's that has to grow on you a bit.Neil Peart shows off his talent alot on this CD.I think this CD has some of Pearts best drum work.	good
moderately satisfied didn't really mind that there was no cover (i think that was in the details that I didn't read) but it took a week longer than it should have to get here. I needed it for a project so I ended up having to buy another copy at best buy. Only reason I'm not more miffed is that I needed another copy anyway.	good
Life of Jesus the Revolutionary This is a well made film that is not only accurate to the Biblical account, but entertaining and inspiring.	good
Nice but expensive. My 6 year old likes it but one of the first things he said, when it was finished, is that he thought it would be bigger. We have built other Lego items that had as many pieces but cost less than half the price. For the price, I would recommend buying a premade castle and formed characters - it would be bigger, stronger and more realistic	good
The men who rocked the world. This album was a success in many ways, but one of them is that I think it was like hearing your favorite band for the very first time again, and at this point, "Nirvana" was alot of people's favorite band. It also showed people that the band could do more than just rock, and highlighted the musical and songwriting skills of the group. This disc is also about 1/3 covers, while still including all the "Nirvana" songs that should have been. Every track here is good, but my faves would have to be Bowie's "The Man Who Sold The World", the Meat Puppets "Lake Of Fire", and their own "Something In The Way". While their other live disc "From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishka" may be a better representation of the band, this one is more essential.	good
Woah. This here is a great blade. It's like a Draciel and a Dragoon combined. It can withstand a strike from a full speed Dragoon Fighter at times! When I don't use Dragoon, I use this one. Buy it. It is truely worth the money.	good
Excellent Sound!! This is a great stereo for your ipod. The sound is great and I couldn't be happier with the purchase. (ok its pricey but well worth it) My only complaint is I have a 2nd Generation iPod Nano (aluminum) and the nano insert does not fit. Yes, I can use the other ipod inserts, but it causes it to be flimsy in the other ipod holder-you have to be cautious. (If you were to hit the ipod by accident there is a possibility of it breaking the connector right off the sound dock) I will be calling Bose to see if they have a replacement part or if all 2nd gen nano's are like this. (Judging by some of the past reviews this has been an ongoing problem and I would hope it has been addressed) Overall great product. I gave it 4 stars cause of the hassle of having to call and request a new insert or be stuck with what I have)	good
simple, clean, affordable needed a affordable, simple wallmap for roadtrip planning. This met my needs.	good
not bad, easy system This book starts out simple and builds on itself as you progress. It covers a broad range of med terms, with about 30 pages in each chapter and a good end of chapter review with different types of quizzes. The CD is also by chapter and has games to test you and also an area you can listen to the vocab words for pronunciation. My "plastic comb" version (not the spiral bound for more $) is falling apart after 2 semseters of use though.	good
RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES I was in the midst of reading this Al Quaeda thriller when the bombs went off in London. Although this tale of an Al Quada assassin dispatched from the Middle East to silence a captured terrorist before he can spill the beans to the CIA takes place a couple of years ago, it is just as relevant today. Sadly, it is obviously going to be equally relevant tomorrow. The book raises interesting philosophical issues about interrogation techniques, both from moral and efficacy points of view. Actually, the nationality and political point of view of the hired assasin seem ambigous. This may be on purpose, but I haven't finished the book so I don't know if this information is ultimately revealed.	good
my baby never had a rash I used these since my son was born. He never had a rash or whatsoever. Never used anything else so I cannot compare, but I think these are pretty good wipes. And I get good price with subscribe and safe.	good
A great eye opener I found this book to be have great guidelines and usefulinformation in taking steps to protect the assets.	good
From the perspective of a social worker This book uses a very clear paradiagm to analyse the different kinds of messages we give our kids. It teaches a person to be aware of the effect of what we are saying. It also can enlighten a person to the way in which they speak to themselves and to foster positive self talk. I would highly recommend this book.	good
As a Man Thinketh Excellent information. This was shared for the first time with the world many years ago, yet it's principles and messages still hold true today! A must read for someone wanting to increase their state in life!	good
those androids the uncuts of the DBZ series shows blood and spit and this one shows blood and spit. great sequences are when Trunks and Adult Gohan fight Android 17 and 18 and we get to see how Trunks turns super saiyan and how it goes into the series. exciting and exhilarating	good
A very entertaining and inspiring life story I don't raise horses but have always loved these animals. This book was a gift from a friend who knew I had read "The Horse Whisperer" and she thought this book might interest me. As I read this book, I became to admire this man for his courage and tenacity; he did it his way and it worked! If you raise horses, this is a great book - a gentle way to "break" your horses is discussed.	good
Very good, But where's the rest of the book. I am rabid fan of this "wheel of Time" books.It seems the books are sliding down the "meat to fluff" sclale. The last two (in my humble oppinion) could have made one of the previous books and still not stood on it's own. I still eagerly await #9. P.S. WHERE'S MATT!!!	good
Great watch I am old enough to have come to the point of accepting that all good things come to an end. This series is one that ended too soon. I was contemplating getting the comic series just to see what was next. Great quality DVD. Non-typical storyline.	good
Joseph "Robb" Roberts The whole idea of a serial or movie for that matter is to get you watching from start to ending. This Serial does that, mostly on the sholders of its star Jack Holt. Could the plot be better? yes. Could the lines be written better? maybe. But WOW! does this serial take off with action in the Saturday movie sreial mode. At one time, Jack Holt was one of the highest paid actors of the silent screen era, and why he was shows through here. When he is on screen, you watch. Also a true fact, The writer of a famous movie detective liked Jack Holt's acting so much he patterned his detective after Jack Holt. The writer's detective was none other than Dick Tracy. Yes this serial is worth getting, also it was the only serial that Jack Holt made.	good
book my son really likes the time warp trio books, we have many of them & all are great fun to read!	good
Average scanner. This scanner seemed a bit bulky when I got it, the CanoScan N1240U Flatbed Scanner only weighs 3 pounds as compared to 9 for this one. It was easy to set up, just installed the software and it was compatible with my Windows XP Professional computer. One of the problems is that everytime you start up the computer, it wants the scanner to be on and the program that opens is annoying if you don't need to use the scanner. There isn't a way to turn this option off so that's a big downfall. Also the program could use some improvements in its interface and ease of use. The scans are great quality but the software could use much improvement and should be plug&play.	good
excellent movie The handy cam shots were a little annoying but, all in all , it was a very good movie. It felt very realistic.	good
Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft A good starting point for anyone interested in the initiatory stages of covens, but difficult to complete some of the lessons if you're a Solitary. Good, sound background knowledge in the basics of the Craft, but no in-depth study of any particular tradition - good if the student has not decided on their own Path. Wouldn't say it's 'complete', but pretty close!	good
After 90 years.... George Buttrick's book was on the table and in the library of many if not most homes of the faithful in 1920's America. Kindle readers will be frustrated in that its not available on their favorite e-reader. If for no other reason than its print seems to be the size that a sixteen year old would find acceptable. The rest of us, journey down to the local drugstore and buy reading glasses two strengths stronger than normal. This book is an excellent book for discussion groups to study as they attempt to unravel the mysteries of the teachings of Jesus. In the end, your spiritual journey will be better enhanced. But aren't all those modern font enlargements wonderful?Richard Hodgetts Madison, GA.	good
They are transfixed! We have about 6 of the "there goes a..." titles, but both my boys are just mesmerized by this one. They watch it twice every night! My 21 month old baby is always asking for a "mon-ter tuck" and he is just as transfixed as his 3.5 year old brother.Yeah, the plot is hokey, but the plot seems to keep them more interested in this video.If you have a little kid, this is a great way to keep him (or her) happy and give you a little time to yourself.	good
Movies are lots of fun and music After watching the Goldigger movies with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler and great set & numbers done by Bugsby Berkley and enjoying Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald movies that are bursting with Musical numbers and romantic songs i was pleasantly surprised by the work of Alice Faye presented in these movies. Her singing is different than other and that difference makes them fun to watch. Extras are great and you can feel and see how hard the movies were on Alice.So much music, so much talent.	good
Great :) I was a little sad to find there were no illustrations in this book. When I was READING it, it never occurred to me, but when I downloaded "Through the Looking Glass" and found there were pics in it, it was a bit annoying.However, that being said, this is just gorgeous children's literature. I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I should have read this book as a little girl, when the magic would have been so much more real. I love the almost stream-of-consciousness feel to the words, and of course the extremely imaginative scenes. I think every child should have a copy of this book and the next Alice adventure!	good
I'm Now a Martin Amis Fan After a very long spell of reading all non-fiction, I picked up my friend's copy of "Night Train" and couldn't put it down until the end. Amis manages to get inside the head of his amazingly interesting, real and vulnerable main character, Detective Mike Hoolihan. The only problems I had were Amis' sometimes off-the-mark American lingo, Hoolihan being a bit too intellectual for an ordinary cop, and the end was a bit underwhelming. Amis creates exciting, slim prose. Very good and entertaining read. I am now an official fan of Martin Amis.	good
Pretty good I Like it alot. Sound quality is A+. Reception is great. Very light weight. Picks up my voice almost at a whisper in a quiet room. It has three different size ear pieces to fit perfect. On off function button doesn't push in much and doesn't click when you push it.It is hard to tell if you've pushed hard enough so I usually end up pushing harder than I probably should. Overall It's great	good
Almost Perfect This is a cool product. I would have given it 5 stars but it shuts off after an hour and sometimes I don't drink my coffee that fast. It doesn't use a paper filter so it needs to be rinsed out. I'm sure most people have excellent plumbing but I live in an older home and this worries me. I love the timer and the not having to grind the whole beans in another gadget. All in all this is a good product.	good
One of the funniest stories told Jill is a wonderfully, alive crazy woman who has a bizarre family and work place to put up with. But she overcomes all obstacles placed in her path, including her own neuroses, to succeed professionally and personally. All of this in a great comedic novel. Laugh till you cry with this one.	good
Nice We have this hanging in my daughters crib and she likes it but doesn't love it. Not a fan of the whale sound but she seems to like the waves and rain. Obviously every child is different, would give it 5 stars for cuteness and sound quality!	good
Great Mix Well done. Great mix of archival footage with contemporary filming. Only wish it were longer, and had shown pictures after the blast, and finished the stories of survivors.	good
Laser Pointer -Flashlight The laser pointer flashlights arrived quickly and were exactly what I was hoping for. Good quality. I was concerned the flashlight wouldn't be bright enough, but am very happy with it.	good
A slaughter Having played the demo:+++Good things+ Original Weapons (a stake gun, how sweet :))+ A dark and squalid atmosphere (nice marriage between the detailed textures,the fog and the music)+ A lot of monsters, like the old-fashioned doom-like.---Bad things- I would like our avatar to go faster (used to Unreal Tournament) for a fps like this (not a prob with my config, it was not lagging, I play with a p4 2.4ghz, ati radeon9800, 1gig Ram)- Not that original (very quake1,2-like), seem to lack some story (but that could get more interesting in the full game I guess)- It's a killing-rush, nothing smart really as in a Half-LifeTherefore I give it a 4 stars.-1 because it's not that original, and 4 as it is seems very well developped.	good
This is NOT a Hi8, it is 8mm XR! I own this one, and finally after ~10 years of moderate use it seems to be dying (suddenly no recording or playback). This camera is a good one for the purpose (easy to use, a pretty good quality of recording), but it is not a Hi8 format, but a lower Video8XR [...]. It is essentially the same format as the original Video8, but "with 10% improvement in luminance detail while retaining full backward compatibility with older, non-XR equipment. XR recordings were fully playable on the older equipment, though without the benefits of XR". By the way, the format is clearly shows in one of the shots.So you get a pretty good Video8 camera, but not a Hi8 one!	good
Good portrayal of the Afghanistan I knew I like narrative non-fiction. It takes me to places I haven't been and if the story is written well I feel like I'm there-sounds, smells and all. I read this before deploying to Afghanistan to get a feel for the land and the complex tribal makeup of the country and found it very useful. Lamb's description is spot on and she does a good job enticing the reader along on her journey where most women (and men for that matter) don't have the courage to go. I especially appreciated her insight into the early days of the Taliban and Hamid Karzai's involvement with them. Though the book wanders off subject a few times and is very much about the author more than her subjects, it's still a good read for anyone wanting to understand such a backward culture.	good
A fresh, original voice Comparisons to Dave Matthews Band abound and are also unjustified. FFF makes a strong case for originality with this multi-faceted release. Soaring vocals and power chords accompany sections of acoustic quiet and introspection. The single 'Superman' is OK, but many of the others shine brighter, noteably the first two tracks, 'Jainy', 'Out of Love', and 'The Last Great American', the latter being a beautiful acoustic number. One of the better discs I've heard in the last year or two. I'm looking forward to more from them. Recommended.	good
Great Buy! This product was easy for me to install and it makes giving the dog a bath easy. The water stays in the tub now and I can reach underneath the dog with no problems.	good

AWESOME This game is awesome. The only drawback is that you need 2+ GBA's and 2+ GBA link cables to play multiplayer and because of this I haven't gotten to yet. Good thing the single player is AWESOME otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone, but it is so I reccomend it to everyone.	good
Good For Vibram Five Fingers These socks work good with Vibram Five Fingers. They are a little snug. Good product to help keep feet warmer in cold whether.	good
great book I would recommend this to anyone expecting their first child! It was a great read, not just for 1st time moms for anyone expecting.	good
Very good I am on a roll in terms of buying books by new authors. This was another example of a well-told story,with sharp characterizations and a well-balanced plot. I would recommend this book to others.	good
Quality tool This seems to be a top quality tool. The fit and finish are very good. I plan on buying the smaller sizes and making a complete set of these.	good
Using Disney's Movie vs/with the Book Being a great classic it does come with some lines that may be a bit too accurate for some kids' taste. Like "They had sharp pins...to stick in the bull" "long spears to stick in the bull" "a sword...to stick the bull last of all." One alternative (or to go with the book) is the Disney short film. It almost follows the book word for word except for the lines mentioned above. it's very good and funny. You can find the film on the Disney DVD titled THE RELUCTANT DRAGON. This DVD also has the story of Goliath II and Johnny Appleseed.	good
Str8 Game.... I think its a decent game great graphics...i would suggest it 2 any n.g. fan....R.$.G.	good
Glad to relive the old sounds This album rocks! I want you to understand that this comment is coming from someone who owns Starflyer59's Gold record on 3 formats (tape,CD,and vinyl). If you like any of the old stuff that was disgustingly compared to The Smashing Pumpkins, then you'll probably dig this release. For the folks who thought that Silver and Gold albums were "noise", here's some advice: Relax, toss aside your misgivings about anything that isn't Coldplay or Radiohead, drop your head... that's right, look down... c'mon just do it, look at your shoes, now sway... no no, sway side to side, there ya go, now you're shoegazing. And that's what it's all about. Oops, sorry about that. What? No, I didn't mean to knock you over while you were swaying. :-P	good
An early, grittier Spenser As one who had read most of the series already, finding this one was a real treasure. So this is the first time any of us met Spenser! This is an early, pre-Susan Spenser who exhibits less conscience when dealing with the ladies but who is still an incorrigible wise-acre and a smart, independent, fearless PI. I missed Hawk, Pearl and even Susan, but still enjoyed this book for the window it gave us into Spenser's early development. BTW, his first name is Jim. (I'd always wondered about the first name thing. I mean, I knew he had to have one!)	good
Great organizer I originally had a crate that I threw all the items in that I need to carry in the back of my SUV. After it fell apart, this was the item I decided to try. Due to the description, I didn't realize it was a completely soft case with no permanently standing sides, but I decided to go with it anyways. I am actually very happy with the design as it is very nice to stuff it as full as I need and not have the limitations of rigid sides and I love being able to zip it shut and have it look that much neater. The zipper also allows me to put other items in when needed that I don't want people to see from looking in the windows. The outside pockets are great for keeping frequently used items handy and the nylon material will not attract any fur from my dogs who ride in back with the organizer. All in all, a very good purchase and leap of faith.	good
British royals - image and dress through the centuries This book takes you through five centuries of royal dress from 1580 to the 1980s and concentrates on the differences between how dress used in portraits etc and the reality of what rulers actually wore. To do this, throughout the book are illustrations, mostly black and white, that are then commented on in detail. These comments are full of interesting titbits of information on the dress of the various periods/ rulers discussed.There's a lot in this book, but it's not a "pretty" book. It has a small colour section in the centre of pictures, but it's the black and white illustrations and their commentary which is where you'll get the real value out of this book. With the 1860s you start to get photographs and the story finishes with Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson in their early royal careers in 1988. For anybody who is interested in royal dress this book is filled with interesting, obscure facts on British royalty and fashion and recommended.	good
Do you want to become a doctor? Konner does a good job balancing the intricate details of his third year in medical school with the broader meaning of medicine from his well-learned sociological and anthropological perspective in "Becoming a Doctor". He lets you in on the medical "culture" that arises from the intensive year of training--the language used by doctors and students (see the Glossary of House Officer Slang), the sleepless nights in the hospitals, the life and death decisions/actions that take place. I highly recommend this book to someone who is looking into a career in medicine. It provides insight into the different areas of medicine, including Emergency, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Neurology, Surgery. But more importantly it probably provides a realistic peek into western medicine so that prospective students do not necessarily enter medical school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!	good
Great for baking pumpkin recipes When I first got this product, I put it in my coffee attempting to make my own version of a pumpkin spice latte but I didn't like it. Then a few months later I decided to experiment with some pumpkin protein muffins and other pumpkin recipes and I went through the bottle fast!! It adds the perfect flavor to pumpkin muffins, cookies, pancakes, and ice cream. Definitely will be repurchasing.	good

works great if you think ahead we are using this on vaction and so far it fine...we charge the ipod before going to dinner and transfer the photos while relaxing before bed. Then recharge the ipod overnight..if works well for 256 memory stick we shoot 4 a day ibout and tranfer them at night. 4 strs only because it does not work well with my camera only my wifes...i use 4 and 6 gig cards in a d200 and it simply will not do it without stopping to recharge and then when you do it wants to start over...so I would say great for the average user but not for those using very large file formats.	good
A word about the song at the end.... Love the series! Went a little slow for a couple, maybe three episodes this season, and I'm not without a few other complaints that have already been mentioned by others...but overall it's been fabulous. Luckily the show varies from the graphic novel to a pretty solid degree, so we've had some surprises along the way, and this is a good thing.On this particular episode, the song that begins to play over the closing credits really caught my ear. The band is Clutch, whom I had heard of, but was not familiar with at all. The track is called "The Regulator" from an album called 'Blast Tyrant'. Just picked this up today and......Wow! Outstanding stuff, especially for those who enjoy ballsy, powerful and well played hard rock with just a smidge of blues tossed in. Would highly recommend, as this Montgomery County, Maryland outfit should really be better known. Check 'em out, and here's to TWD Season Three starting up again in the fall!	good
Read this on my honeymoon... and I thought it was great. A diversion from the grisly world of Alex Cross but a great story none-the-less. It wasn't as dark as some of his other works but it still had an edge that keeps the pages turning. I thought all of the character's were well done and as a newly wed male I found the Black Widow angle to be particularly frightening. Especially considering the intelligence and ruthlessness of this woman and the power a beautiful woman can wield over all of the men around her. Anyways, I couldn't put it down and I would definitely recommend it...	good
Yardley's English Lavendar Just by chance I happened to use this liquid soap in a restaurant's rest room and fell in love with it all over again. I had to have it! It smells wonderful! I like the fact that it is antibacterial as well as moisturizing (although my hands feel kind of dry after using this soap). But I use it anyway because I just love the scent. Great job Yardley!The items arrived quickly and in perfect condition. No problems there. I definitely will be ordering more.	good
Satisfactory purchase I wanted a small, fireproof chest in which to store some keepsakes and the Sentry chest "filled the bill". Entire purchase experience was very good.	good
So Bad It's Good I am a bit biased to be writing this review because I love these old "B" movies. I really enjoyed this movie. I have always been a big fan of William Campbell. He usually plays bad guys and he plays them very well. A very enjoyable movie.	good
fun for children I bought this to play with 4 children all under 10. It's a lot of fun if you have the patience.	good
Surprisingly Well Made Being that this product was a mere $.33 when I bought it, I wasn't expecting much. The reviews said mostly positive things about it, but there are times when I speculate the validity of others ill advised opinions. That being said, this product broke my expectations.The retract feature works much better than I ever thought it would. I have had retractable ethernet cables before that were very cheaply made, resulting in a broken cable and increased latency. This product, on the other hand, is very simply made but with quality components. The retract feature works seemingly flawless.In addition, I had no problems charging or using data transfer. It connected and transferred flawlessly.The only thing that bothered me was the high shipping cost. I purchased 3 to have on hand at work/home/laptop bag and paid ~$1 for the product, but a wopping $9 for shipping. Nearly 10x the cost of the product for shipping? That just seems unreasonable.	good
Very soft! The color is true to the picture and the fabric is really soft. I just can't say how hot it is, since I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the coldest it gets here is 20C.	good
Low price, good product The machine was well priced for what you get. It's easy to setup and has a resonable memory capacity. The message play back sound quality could be better but for the price you can't complain.	good
Fun Reading The Dead Circus is fun reading. Gene Burk, a 40ish ex-LA cop in the mid-eighties, mourning the death of his fiance in a plane crash, decides to solve the one unsolved "crime" from his life as a cop that still haunts him--the apparent suicide of Bobby Fuller. Kaye' story is sort of all over the map--jumping from character to character, discussing three events in one short paragraph--but somehow it's not overly confusing. Burk's quest brings him into the warped and bizarre world of Charles Manson. The Dead Circus is an unpredictible story that starts off almost as a standard crime novel and then goes into something unto itself. Enjoy.	good
Two excellent ghazals "Yun Guzar Raha Hai" is beautifully written by Nida Fazli and Jagjit has sung it as only he can. It is a new favorite of mine. The second Ghazal that stands out is "Rukh se Parda". This is a studio version of a ghazal that Jagit has sung live - I prefer the live version, but this one has an extra sher. The rest of the ghazals are average.	good
Great machine! I love this treadmill! It's a bit heavy to move around easily - but the extra weight is worth it as my husband (who is over 250lbs) can also run on it. There was a part missing (a piece of casing) but their customer service was extremely helpful, altho it did take about 3 weeks to arrive... but I understand, it was at Christmas!	good
Good CD, with a few super cuts. I heard only of Mark Murphy slightly; but this CD made me a big fan. Afew cuts are super-"Miss You Mr. Mercer","The Best Thing for You" and "The Bad and the Beautiful."He might be a better jazz singer than Torme. A super buy!	good
Worth Buying It's a good tape.I highly recommend this tape for an "intermediate." I have done several of Billy Blank's tapes, including his advanceTae-Bo. I thought the pace of the Cardio was very good.	good
Second to its predecessor. This is a worthy sequel to the classic horror game Resident Evil. With improved gameplay mechanics,an improved graphics engine,a plethora of locales to explore(as oposed to RE1's single location), and most of all the A&B scenario that depicts the games events from both characters perspectives. Put all this together and that makes RE2 technically superior to it's predecessor.This game has it all but it is more action oriented than the first RE which also makes it less scary. Sorry RE2 you'll always be second to your big brother.Anyone wanna pick it up and prove me wrong?It'll be worth every penny!	good
compliance review Suspenseful and amazing how men get away with this. I felt like I was in the middle of the situation. Made me feel tense and mad.	good
Schubert interpreted by Janowitz Schubert had a talent for transmitting complex emotions through his music and had he lived longer would, I believe, have at least equaled if not surpassed the likes of Beethoven. Dame Janowitz used her vocal talents to interpret and transmit those emotions Herr Schubert set to paper in these lovely recordings made while she was still in her prime.	good
HARVEST MOON 64 ROCKS I think that HArvest Moon64 is the best game out there! It is my favorite game, and I really want to play it again! but I have lost it so I am saving up to get my own from here, but my dad says he is not buying from the internet, cuz, they usually rip you off, I just think HE WANTS EVERYTHING HIS WAY! BUT I WILL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET HARVEST MOON BACK< NOTHING< NOTHIN NOTHING!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOTTA THING, HAHAHAHAGAG	good
my third one I am on my third Swivel Sweeper over the last 9 years. I tried to go without one for a while, but missed the ease of it. Totally hated using a broom and dustpan.	good
Good overview of daily life in late-15th-century England The "Yorkist" period of English history is often overlooked---it's overshadowed, in many peoples' minds, by the more spectacular eras of Henry V before it, and the Tudors afterward. However, a lot of what the Tudors did was to build on the foundations laid at this time, and much of what came to fruition under the Tudors was started under their predecessors.	good
What is the matter with all of you reviewers!? Hilary Duff's cd "Metamorphosis" has some great songs if this is the type of music you like. Very...Britney Spears (pre-nasty), Christina Aguilera (sweet girl phase), Mandy Moore etc. If that isn't the type of music that you like, then you shouldn't be reviewing this CD and offering advice on it because your opinion is useless to those people interested enough to consider buying it. If you are looking for the sweet, school girl pop music stuff, this cd is great! I have several younger sisters who absolutely love it! And unlike some of the Britney Spears and Christina cds, it doesn't have anything in it that parents might find offensive. Hilary Duff is beautiful, young, and fun. Young girls will love her! There are a couple of really good songs on this CD like "Why Not", "So Yesterday", and "Come Clean". If you like this style, this CD is fun! :)Hope this helps!	good
Christopher Moore's Fluke I enjoy reading Moore's books, they are entertaining and it is very easy to get hooked on them! Buy One today!	good
Logitech 961608-0403 Quickcam Messenger Great quality for the price. I use this to talk to my sister who lives out of town, she has an IMac. Is probably not as clear as hers but she says that it comes over very clear. Was very easy to set up and has been a lot of fun! I love it!	good
great and interesting magazine This is very different then your average magazine. It has random facts that can be enjoyable to anyone interested in learning.My only complaint is the price and the limited amount of issues per subscription.Worth trying out!	good
the little knife that could... This knife made me realize that a sharp knife makes cooking more enjoyable. Apparently my knives weren't sharp enough! I love this knife. It is inexpensive, and so far, performs beautifully.	good
not as good as the movie If you saw the movie first you maybe dissappointed in the book. The main character Tessa never appears in the first person. However it is a great story.	good
Very Satisfied I am satisfied with this product - it was what I expected to receive and it was shipped promptly. What more can I say? They seem to be good quality cables and their ends are the right shapes for what I want to do, which is plug them in to stuff.	good
Short and Sweet This game is quite fun and quick/easy to play. It has about 25 mini games with items that you can unlock. It is easy to pick up yet has enough difficulty that getting the high scores on every level takes some time.	good
I am feeling much love for my new keyboard! A bit of a pain to snap it in, and it's the same size as my Visor, but having a keyboard for my PDA has transformed it from something gathering dust in a corner to something I actually take to meetings!!	good

Very good Les Luthiers es un grupo musical muy interesante, divertido , crítico y cuestionador. Exige mucho conocimiento cultural para entender a cabalidad sus letras y eso limita su público a personas que lo tengan o que se interesen en obtenerlo. Si quierenpensar y divertirse, lo recomiendo.	good
Sell-outs? Kinda, but not really...... Not that I'm the kind of person that is bent on virtually destroying every "sell-out" band out there, it's just that I can't decide if I want to call CO&CA; sell-outs. Seriously, if you listen to what Claudio is singing half the time it's about death and/or other things you may not expect of this kind of sound...... but then again I'm not one to judge. It's different than what you'd normally catch me listining to but that dosen't make them bad. Actually, they truthfully have some awsome guitar solos not normally found in pop-punkish bands. Check it out if yer into this kinda music. Doubt you'd ever see it on Mtv (not that I'd know seeing how Mtv has gone to being nothing but that rap garbage). WARNING may take some getting used to.PS: I would rather jump face first into sharpened razor blades than watch one second of that Mtv garbage.	good
thumbs up & out i've been listening to 'Hitchhiker' like crazy...what a great, great album!... the artwork is fantastic too... i'm especially liking 'Carey Ann'... i'm drawn to the voices-they have this longing emotive quality thatreels me in...highly recommended!	good
these are the bomb Received my new boots just in time for my annual winter hunting trip in the Great Divide.. Australia...the weather has been very cold and wet with a light dusting of snow.The ground is like slush... muddy and wet...but my feet remained warm and dry right through it all...Our winters may not get as cold as it does up there in the northern hemisphere but hey cold feet are cold feet no matter where you maybe hiking or hunting.I must say how impressed i am with these boots, the soles provide positive grip over any terrain, the thickness gives ample support and comfort while providing a great cushion to the feet as you tromp along on rocky or muddy tracks. The insulation(400g) keeps your feet toasty warm whether you are walking or standing still..and the water proofing is with out fault... I highly recommend these boots ...for work ( I'm an interstate truckie), hunting, trekking or any thing else..Amazon delivered my boots on time and with no fuss...once again	good
great toy My dog loves this bird house. I also stuff her other small toys in there, she loves trying to get them out!	good
Cha Cha Cha I love DWTS and have been wanting to learn ballroom dancing for years. I was pysch to see that they came out with a work DVD. All in all it's pretty good, but I wish there were more instructional breakdown of the steps. You're thrown right into the routines. Sometimes the dancers throw out dance terms they assume we know the meaning. It's a fun addition to your workout routine.	good
Good-looking, Works well This is an attractive grinder. Salt shaker on top is handy, as is one-handed action! My only complaint is that there's not a much difference between the coarse & fine grinds.	good
good while it lasted, cats It worked well until my cats found it. My cats chewed through the wires and kept on unplugging it. If you have cats that chew through wires, get batteries.	good
Removable Dog Bowls Easy to clean and works good for food. Not so good with water. The dish is too shallow for my large pooch so he just makes a big wet mess. I use a big stainless steel bowl for his water now. I like the fact that the bowls are removable so I can take one over to the sink when I'm mixing his food.	good
Review Time I read Ransom, by Lois Duncan. The setting took place high in the mountains in a cabin. The main characters are Bruce, Dexter, Glenn, Jesse and Marianne. The book starts out as all five students are riding home from school on the bus, and the bus driver takes a wrong turn, he says that he's going to pick up a friend. A man in dark clothing gets on the bus, he has a gun and forces them to come with him to the cabin which he lives in high in the mountains. There they are held ransom, until each of their parents can pay the money that is asked of them. I liked the book, a lot because it was very suspenseful and had a lot of action in it. I recommend for people that like suspense.	good
Caveat Emptor Warning to buyers of Ruttmann's "Berlin:" many copies are lacking the original soundtrack entirely, and this version does not have the one by Edmund Meisel (who also composed the music for Eisenstein's Potemkin). The VHS by Kino Video also has Brock's score, not Meisel's (of which only a piano arrangement seems to have survived). The European TV program ARTE broadcast in 2007 a re-orchestration by Berndt Thewes of the Meisel score: we need to have this on DVD, please.	good
Doesnt work with Ford Sync I loaded this with 900 songs and it keeps knocking out the computer in my car. Nothing wrong with the drive it just doesnt work with the Ford Sync. I reformatted it to fat32 and that didnt help either. I use it for other data transfer and it works fine. I have an 2 older Kingston 4mb flash drives that both work fine in the car. I have 2 of these and neither one of them will work in the car and they both cause the SYNC to stop functioning.	good
tractors Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. the tractors i have missed you glad to find it	good
A great comp ! This is a great compilation frot eh casual Counting Crows fan like myself ! The addition of the great "Einstein On A Beach" makes it almost essential.And it has a great "mix" feel to it like the Sheryl Crow compilation which also is NOT in chronological order ! A good deal all around..	good
Okay Workout I haven't completed the 30 days yet due to various issues. The dvd is a good workout though. She swears ("@ss") in the workout which bothers me. If you have young children you might not want them around so they don't hear it. I'm hoping to start the dvd again when I can find time.	bad

Advueu PD710 woes From the time I opened the box (ecost.com $135) it seemed to be OK...But when I hooked up the the AC adapter one end to the unit I had to wiggle it to make it work. Definetely no quality control, since I'm an Electronic Tech I soldered the socket on the unit. Of course I voided warranty since I did not want the hassles of sending it back.Works fine now. I would not recommend it, go for the brand name.	bad
Won't be using this novel anymore. I was hoping Maroo of the Winter Caves would be a tie in for my sixth grade class's study of humans in the Ice Age. It started well enough, but by the end of the book my students and I agreed that there was not enough character development or attention to detail to make the novel a worthwhile book for Literature Study. One of my students suggested I have future sixth graders read the novel in order to see what a undeveloped book is like.	bad
Disappointing We tried this sauce because we love the raspberry sauce served on so many desserts in restaurants these days. We had used another brand before but could no longer find it, so we searched the Internet and found this one. Unfortunately, it was more of an excessively sweet jam/jelly than a smooth sauce. One taste and no one would eat it. I tried using it in smoothies and it made the whole thing too sweet, even though I didn't add any other sweetener.If anyone knows a good raspberry sauce, please let me know!	bad
STUPID! I have the whole series on video and I must say this is my least favorite Puppet Master movie.This is not worth seeing.If you loved Puppet Master 4 then you should check this out otherwise stay away from this movie.This movie is the same as Puppet Master 4.Toulon's Puppets battle the killer Totems.	bad

Self Serving Mafia Wife I did not find this book as enjoyable as I had hoped. I think the author was very slanted and presented her side of the story in a self serving way. Really a disappointment.	bad
Regurgitation, when not stating the obvious I have a library of "self help" books that I have read through the years, and this is one that you can pass on. The author simply makes very obvious statements, inter dispersed with regurgitation of what is contained in virtually any self improvement text. A very forgettable book.	bad
Not bad...initially. My player worked well for the first 2 months. Unfortunately, I also had a lot of difficulty with my computer recognizing my player due to driver problems. Dealing with Rio/Sonic Blue customer service is a joke. I had to pay...just to speak to a technician and, at the end of the session, NOTHING was resolved. I would seriously consider another player.	bad
-----------------> FLAG... Not a Gerber! This item doesn't say Gerber anywhere on the packaging.Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the real thing, A Gerber multi purpose tool.	bad
It didn't make sense I agree with some of the other reviewers who didn't like this book. In fact, I didn't finish it and I only had about 75 pages left.Too many things just didn't make sense. Why did Mack leave home? Why did his mother have the stroke? Did it have something to do with his leaving?Abby didn't seem to have any consequences for her very bad choices. And how were they so stupid as to think that a 10 year old would have a gallery art show???? And Sara and Reuben just didn't seem to have any spark.I wanted to like this book - after all, I paid good money for it but I just didn't. Save your money - if you want to read it, get it at the library and if you like it, write a review. The authors deserve to have every opinion (especially favorable) heard.	bad
Very weak Rodgers and Hammerstein This is probably the weakest of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals and watching or listening to it is a test of your endurance. Its best song, "I enjoy being a girl", sounds suspiciously like a rewrite of several other R and H songs. R and H were taking it easy when they cranked this one out and it shows. Tedious and very dated. Do not expect a revival of this show.	bad
Not what I expected I bought 5 pair of these because they looked like the longer knee length I wanted but turned out to be only mid thigh on a young man who's 5'9". Even though they're made of jersey knit, they're rougher than others I'd bought of the same material. For those 2 reasons, my son won't wear them. It's not worth the expense of returning them so they sit unused in a box in his closet. I'll probably just donate them to charity.	bad
Not meant to be full Cheaply attached handle. They broke off in the first week. The net covering the top is senseless. I had to cut it.	bad
It is not NEW as advertised , but refurbished I found out after providing the serial number to customer support that this IS NOT a new Palm as advertised, and therefore it is not covered by the warranty. Palm will charge me $25 for technical support per call because it is a refurbished model. I could have saved over $70 if I had wanted to get a refurbished one! I am VERY disappointed that Amazon misrepresented this product.	bad
more hollywood muck indiana jones has been made. it came out 20 years ago, and was a hit. two sequels of excellent quality followed. why is it that hollywood cant let things go? how many times must there be an attempt to place indiana jones in a different locale, different era, with a different cast? and this, by far, is one of the longest leaps hollywood has made in the "stick-to-the-crap-that-has-worked-before" plan. nicholas cage. he could have had a great career. everything was looking so good, then his complete obsession with elvis somehow took over. mr cage you are NOT elvis presley. stop with the collared shirts. youre also balding, so when they throw a toupee on you in every film, everyone kinda chuckles. the storyline to this film is ludicrous at best, and barely researched. yes there are some neat-o things, but i got a bigger thrill from reading angels and demons from dan brown. its a silly movie. entertaining, but silly.	bad
Lacks Staying Power This probably deserves 2 and-a-half, maybe three stars. Maybe. The whole thing sounds to me like "Well, we've(I've)got these songs, they're rehearsed, we have a label, let's record them". That's about it, no real emotional attachment to or involvement with the material. I'm a long time Weasel fan too, but these songs just don't stay with me. Television City Dream is more memorable, and that's saying something. This one sounds a little fatter though, but that's cold comfort. I can't honestly say I wouldn't have put this record out though, there are no Ghandis or Albert Schweitzers in the music industry, Fugazi included, and everybody takes a dive now and again.	bad
so close...yet so far away. This movie is filmed rather well with a good story line. The problem is that it fails when it comes to a making well connected scenes. It leaves so much unsaid that it fails to make it clear as to what is going on. The conversation between Arn and the opposing king is so comical I had to laugh. It wasn't meant to be funny. I think they tried to make a great movie and just couldn't do it. It was a valiant try. It also has many subtitles as the English is only spoken some of the time. It was not what I hoped it would be.	bad
Cindy Sheehan's Favorite CD I'm not a hardcore Ministry fan, but I have enjoyed a few of their CD's from the past. Sometimes I need to hear something with heavy industrial edge to it, and Ministry does it.I got this CD and I like the music to it. The lyrics however, ruin the album for me. I respect people's political opinions whether I agree with them or not. But this is kind of absurd. Even if I hated Bush, I would still find this type of propaganda annoying, especially in a band that I like to listen to. I'm not a Bush hater, but I'm not a Bush lover either, thats for sure.If you can get past the propaganda lyrics, then its not too bad. The music itself is heavy as hell. I suggest previewing tracks before buying. I would rate the music part of it at 5, but its not enjoyable due to the lyrics. I assume if you dont agree to this review you are a hardcore liberal with no open mind.	bad
Died after 5months This adapter/extension cord worked for five months. It did not hold a charge more than about 15 minutes the entire time. Therefore, I always had to keep the computer plugged ito the outlet. The other day, it died out of the blue. First I thought the power in my house went off. I checked the outlet. It was fine. I plugged the computer into another outlet. It worked for a minutes (green light on), then stopped. I felt the adapter and it was burning hot. My computer is 7 years old (Powerbook G4) and otherwise in good shape. Too bad Apple has stopped selling the real deal adapters. I have to spring for another 3rd party now - and I don't expect it to last too long.	bad
Very weak Bond parody... "Casino Royale" is the most confused Bond film ever created. It is a comedy based on the first Bond book with a stellar cast, but an awful script and an excruciating runtime. It's hard for me to watch this film without falling asleep. So much of it fails to generate anything that could possibly be entertaining. There are occasional funny parts and a couple of entertaining moments, but the movie feels like an over-budgeted flop. David Niven makes a lousy 007 who is mostly bumbling and completely unbelievable. Ian Fleming is turning in his grave... but he does flips with "A View to a Kill," which is worse than this one.	bad
fatally flawed Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use. Very nice compact size.However, as others have pointed out, the battery is the fatal flaw in this camera and we will be looking for a non-Elph replacement for fear we will run into the same problem again. There is NO battery meter until it needs to be recharged or replaced. We were warned about this so I thought, no problem, I'd get two batteries and be ready to switch them when charging was needed. But what we found out is that the batteries themselves quickly retain less and less charge so that now, they last only a few minutes each before another charge is needed. I had previously thought that this problem of retaining less charge over time was only for the much older battery designs and am dismayed to find myself looking for another camera so soon.	bad
Plastic not Hardwood, weak magnet Magnet not strong enough. knives fall off. Also came in black plastic vs. the natural hardwood as advertised. I sent it back.	bad
Secrets of the lost cavern This game its a diferent kind of piece of entertainment than i thought, i was expecting something less complicated, more as the way of prehistoric cultures. More fun, with a bit more action and larger scenes. Perhaps is just that is not my kinda of games.	bad
Good movie, cruddy stream The movie is good, the download stream stunk. We're I to do it again, I'd think twice before attempting the stream from Amazon.	bad
Obsessed Short story I couldn't finish this book as anxious as I was to read it. To me the author was obsessed with the crows to the point it seemed as though it was all she could think about (they all had first names and/or family names) and it slowly began to grate on my nerves.	bad
It wasnt Earthsea I mean honestly the movie was...ill use the word ok. But other then that this had nothing to do with the actual Earthsea book. Which is why I give this movie such a low score. The book Earthsea is really great...and calling this movie Earthsea just brings it down. At least have the decency to call the movie something else.	bad
Great Science, Not Great History Unfortunately, Wile repeats the same silly lies - the made-up history that Galileo was horribly mistreated by a mean, Catholic Church. (In fact, it was the Church which defended Galileo against the protestants, who were horrified at his theories. And no, Galileo never proved his ideas about the earth's rotation. He enjoyed the Church's money and protection, even after being rebuked for stating his theories should be accepted as fact until proven false.) Hope Wile's books can be corrected, so they can be enjoyed for excellence in scientific and historical analysis.	bad
Unreadable The text tries to do a good job at citing sources, but it unreadable. There is very little content in the text. There are words; not meaning.	bad
Disappointed User Everything in the game as far as graphics and feel are awesome, however; the online play is far from as described on the box. There are several issues that have made online racing with a full field and flag rules virtuously impossible. The patch that came out was useless and created more issues with online play. EA has lots of work to do to make this a viable option for online play. I have been very disappointed with EA's response or lack of to the complaints. To my knowledge EA has not done anything to correct the many complaints that my Online Racing League has sent.	bad
short boring card game its a bad game with an original concept. use cards and points to battle foes. the cards come to life similar to baten kaitos, and phantasy star online 3	bad
Forgot to ask me about property taxes, doesn't do amendments I switched over to TaxCut from TurboTax because I hated TurboTax so much (buggy, spyware from TY2002, etc.). It looks like I like TaxCut even less. Either it forgot to ask me about property taxes, or I skipped it, but I forgot to enter them, and after filing electronically, I see no way to generate an amendment. I remember that TurboTax at least knows how to generate an amendment (though it cannot be filed electronically). Another thing I didn't like about TaxCut is that it imported some fields incorrectly. It created duplicates of some of my itemized deductions, and it incorrectly imported my children has non-dependents, even though they were clearly marked as dependents on last year's form.Looks like I have to switch back. TurboTax is not perfect, but it looks like it does better than TaxCut. TurboTax claims that they can import TaxCut data. We'll see.	bad
An Entertaing Book About two years ago I started doing research about moving to Costa Rica. I began by reading every tourist guidebook on the subject. Next I read three books about living in Costa Rica and made two preliminary trips to Costa Rica. I've been residing in the country for over a year and really was helped by all of the guidebooks I read about living here including "Living Overseas". However after much trial and error I have reached the conclusion that one person can't live on a budget of $1,000 monthly and have any kind of a decent lifestyle. It is impossible for a couple to live on said amount as the author claims on the back cover of this book. With their rent they would have to survive on $100 per week. I'm a single retired person and have to spend at least $1500 monthly to get by.	bad
Rename it to "RedSox, Yankees and Giants" I've always trusted Ken Burns to make a good, fair documentary. Now I have to wonder if I was mislead on those other documentaries as well. I wasn't around for most of those times. I took his word for it. If his work was as slanted and narrow-focused as this work, then I probably was mislead. I remember the last 20 years of baseball and he blew it. Excruciating detail of every Boston-Yankees game and complete omission of other important baseball events. How do you talk about baseball in the last 10 years and not even mention Albert Pujols--ridiculous. But then again--that pretty much covers this piece of work.	bad
Poor Quality Canister I have owned 2 of these now, and managed to break the canister on both of them in less than 1 year. Bissell will not sell you a new canister, and these are too expensive to buy one as a parts vac. At least wally has a good exchange policy, because you will need it.On the bright side, it does clean well, and the hose is a handy feature. But the quality of the canister makes this product a $200 paper weight in the end because once your can breaks. Your done.	bad
Huge Printhead Problems My S750 worked well for 2 years. All of the sudden, however, the print quality dramatically decreased and an error message indicated that the printhead needed to be replaced. So, I reluctantly bought a new printhead ($50), installed it, and... now the printer does not print at all. All trouble-shooting does not help. Canon's tech support responded quickly, but the suggestions do not solve the problem. Canon's final advice: take it in to be serviced. However, in the meantime, I have lost interest in wasting more time and money and decided to purchase a new printer. Clearly, it won't be another Canon. I cannot recommend this product.	bad
1/2 KISS I have seen these guys in the 70's and during the 90's for the "farewell" tour. The key issue with this DVD and the band line up is its only 1/2 the original band.Why is Eric Carr wearing Peter's make up and the other guy wearing Ace's spaceman costume?Eric was in Kiss before as the "Fox". Why change?Tom Thayer was a tour manager and in a Kiss tribute band.This is only 1/2 of the classic Kiss line up even if it appears otherwise.The DVD has a good mix of classic Kiss tunes and Paul and Gene are the heart of this band.But without Peter and Ace you won't find "New York Groove", "Shock Me" or "Beth" on the set list.Most importantly the band's best stuff was made as Paul, Gene, Ace and Peter and that's not the band anymore even if an attempt is made to portray that. Let it be known that Ace Frehley is a great lead guitarist and that is clearly missing here.	bad
Not the entire solos! Just based on what the "look inside" feature displays, these solos appear to be incomplete versions. The Andersen Scherzino that's the first solo in the book is actually only the much simpler middle part of that piece. The more technical parts of the solo at the beginning and the end are not there! This is fine -- if you know ahead of time what you're getting. I'd have been VERY annoyed to have bought this book (hoping for a piano accompaniment to the entire Scherzino), only to discover that the solo is incomplete!	bad
Eye candy only. Not a bad picture; however it's not a great one either. Nothing but eye candy and some decent action sequences. Unfortuately, the plot has some blaring holes and the action is shot way to close to see what's going on. Naseeruddin Shah is great as Nemo, Peta Wilson is hot as Mina Harker and Jason Flemyng is touching as Dr. Jekyll. This movie is for visual lovers only.	bad
Disappointed This is the first book of Barbara Freethy that I have read. I was disappointed with the use of profanity in the book. It did not enhance the story in the least but cheapened the characters. the second thing was the immorality. A love story can be beautiful and uplifting without the use of these two items. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.	bad
McCartney's Worst Effort Other than the strong tracks on the album (SOME PEOPLE NEVER KNOW, TOMORROW, DEAR FRIEND, all a bit overlong) this album has hardly anything to offer. It was recorded over just a few days with a fresh band and it feels that way. Songs like LOVE IS STRANGE and WILD LIFE are half finished and tunes like MUMBO, BIP BOP and I AM YOUR SINGER are just worthless junk.The bonus tracks are nice. Give Ireland Back To The Irish is McCartney's best attempt at having a backbone in his solo career. Mary Had A Little Lamb is a garbage response to the BBC banning "Irish". It have no musical value. Little Woman Love is a nice underrated track from that era. Mama's Little Girl is a lovely little acoustic track that remained unreleased until 1989 or 1990 on the Put It There CD single. It very well may be the best track on the disc.	bad
a movie that lived up to its title 1 star for nic cage-i guess he owed someone a favor.1 star for the beautifull ms jolie-had free time on her hands.i should give the cult 1 star for a pretty good song.the movie itself got what it deserved,1 minute lifespan.	bad
no chemistry Sofia (Amanda Peet) and husband Tom (Zach Braff) expect their first child. How can they raise the child when Tom loses his job? Tom then takes up Sofia's father's offer to work with him. There, he meets wheelchaired Chip Sanders (Jason Bateman) who gradually makes Tom's life hell, both personally and professionally. Tom has to prove that Chip is out to destroy him.Some parts were funny, but this is not the comedy of the year.There was absolutely no chemistry between Zach Braff and Amanda Peet.Jason Bateman was possibly the only good actor and even then! - although all of the actors overacted, especially Sofia's parents (Charles Grodin & Mia Farrow).This should have been a straight-to-video flick. I almost fell asleep on it, as the jokes were old and so not that funny, and very predictable.The ending is obviously a happy one, but at least Tom gets to avenge everything that happened to him.Watch at your own risk. Rent it if you absolutely have nothing else to choose from.	bad
Disappointed with this HP product The on-off button doesn't consistently work. Sync doesn't go smooth half the time. Battery has issue with charging; it doesn't fully charged, and battery replacement is hard to find. Will not buy any HP PDA again.	bad
These strings broke to easily Sounded nice, but quite a few snapped on me. Don't last as long as some other brands I have used.	bad
Overblown but hardly definitive See, the thing about demos & outtakes is they are rough drafts or works in progress which make nice filler or bonus material. That said, buy the 3 individual CDs. They've been nicely remastered & reasonably priced. The 1st album even has the mono version of the album included(preferred by the band members) along with the stereo format. If this had contained all 3 albums in their entirety plus the extended version of "Bluebird", this could've been a 5 star comp. Then, a third or 4th disc could've been tacked on to please the diehards.	bad
Disappointing the first half of the book is still ok......... But after the somewhere in the middle where they finally got married it start to get real boring. No offense to London's fans. But this is my first and last London's book Though i admit the part where she finally save julian's sister is heroic but ..........i have to say not v well developed. The story juz keeps go on and on........ abt "i love him/her but i cant let him/her know else she will make me weak"	bad
What Happened to these "Rising Rebels"? If you loved 7L & Esoteric's old stuff, do not pick up this album. It sounds completely different than "Dangerous Connections" or DC2. The beats are much heavier and not catchy what so ever. It's not music you can knod your head to, its music you want to sit in a dark room and cut yourself to. It's very "pop" sounding and and Esoteric doesn't bring any fire in his lyrics. What happened to piano beat tracks like "Rise of the Rebel" and "Battlefield". I don't no what this CD is, but it's not the 7L & Esoteric I know and love. This isn't "A New Dope" it's "A New Nope".	bad
typical nu-metal......crap this is like the default average hard rock CD. there is NOTHING special or different about this band. every song has the same guitar pattern that everyone uses which gets just irritating after awhile cos that alone shows where the music scene is going. and at first, you may think the vocals are good, but they really aren't. in fact, "told you so" has a bit of the [big] man rapping in it. the lyrics [are no good]. it's just about self-pity. like we've never heard that before. (korn, adema, staind) i keep wondering how bands like this get signed but then again this is the same label that signed creed so maybe it isn't all that surprising.	bad
Library Clerk I found this book quite outdated since libraries are now automated. This book refers a lot to card catalog which are no longer used. Everything is done on online catalogs. I work in a school library and a lot of the subjects didn't have anything to do with my job. You really had to read the questions carefully to understand, at times, what they wanted you to do.	bad
SHINIA, GIVE US WHAT MADE YOU A STAR there is no doubt that shinia is one beautiful woman, even as messy and poorly dressed as she is. us music lovers made her a sucess with the woman in me album. why, she gave us what we want and on that album she did just that, her reward is the only woman to sell over 12 million albums. her latest album is the pits, the songs so far are lousy. she has fallen into the same trap that other female artists have, we don't want their life history songs. we want any man of mine, you win my love, and other pop tunes like the other songs on that album. now if she was as smart as she is gorgeous, she would have picked up on this and her latest album could have exceeded the woman in me album. AND, DOES ANYONE REALIZE THE UNKNOWN POTENTIAL SHE COULD PRODUCE IN A MINI SKIRT AND HIGH HEELS. MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE WOULD SIMPLY GO CRAZY. SHE WOULD OUT SELL EVERY ARTIST IN THE BUSINESS. DOYLE CONNOR	bad
Was it done in the basement or the attic? Steven himself says that it took him just a couple of hours to produce each song, so no surprises there but it would have been helpful if his comment was part of the product description. That way it would have set the expectations.	bad
Not his best work I was dissappointed with this album; it is very housey, and very repetitive - after a while the songs all sound a like. His previous albums are far superior. Bummer, another one bites the dust...	bad
Not what I expected It took me about 30 minutes to read through this book and glean whatever original material the author had to offer. The most useful bit of "practical" advice I found was to use post-it notes stuck inside of a manila folder for organizing web page topics. Somehow I expected more from a book with "Information Architecture" in the title. This is a light-weight book, possibly for someone who has had little or no exposure to the web. It is more about corporate project management than website structure. The architecture of the book itself is disorganized and confusing; it rambles for seven chapters on various disparate topics before launching into the purported subject of the book, and even then it amounts pretty much to restating fairly obvious, common-sense techniques.	bad
Not Helpful A worthless book for the most part. It's written to administrators, not the average user, so there is no help on actually using the software.And if it's written to administrators, all it covers is the obvious that can easily be found in the documentation or discerned by the average IT pro.So I'm not sure who this book is for.	bad
Sorry, Mandy, ur not there yet... I listned to Mandy Moore's CD So Real. It was a smart thing to do, too because I figured that before I bought it, I should listen first. The only reason I was going to buy it was b/c I liked Candy. Well, none of her other songs have the umph that Candy has and they are too "raw" - I feel like not enough time was put into them to make them good. Her voice is alright... it isn't exactly the BEST. Her videos are annoying and her attitude is fake... I know that has nothing to do with the CD, but it gives some background on the artist. Unless her next CD proves me wrong, I don't think she has the ability to be a major celebrity... Sorry Mandy!	bad

Bring Back Girl You Know It's True! Bring back "Girl You Know It's True" because it was a top album and just because the two people on the cover didn't sing doesn't mean the ORIGINAL album shouldn't still be available. Nobody likes these remixes. The only reason people are buying this is because they are trying to find some way to buy Milli Vanilli Music. They want the original. BRING "Girl You Know It's True" Back! Please!	bad
Far too hard to hold on full zoom Clear enough image but at half to full zoom the field of view is tiny and the binoculars can not be held steady enough to settle the image down enough to actually see it. I have bought similar binoculars in the past and I should have known better. The Galileo binoculars are not at fault -- small image binoculars with large zooms simply can't be held still enough to use.	bad
frustrating!!! My son is 8 and this toy is bringing him to tears. He wants so bad to transform it and neither I nor his father can figure out the tiny graphics on the instructions. They should change the age rating on this toy or make better instructions. We have him partially transformed now and am putting a call into his engineer uncle to see if he can figure it out. My son is a whiz at lego instructions and other complex instructional toys so this is a big bummer for us and we are dissapointed!Buyer Beware!!	bad
Don't bother While the information contained within the pages of this book are pretty interesting, it's not something you'd look for, in terms of finding out further information on this holiday, and it's history.Seemingly random quotes are thrown in, and the book simply does not hold your attention.The cover gives the impression that it may be suitable to read with your child. The font size, and the size of the book are the only things that would deem it so.Save your money, and buy something else.	bad
Huh..? What...?? A discombobulated cowboy comedy in which an aging (over-the-hillish) Jimmy Stewart locks horns and then falls in love with an eccentric, headstrong English woman, who is determined to introduce Hereford cattle into Texas. The livestock angle dominates the plot (yawn -- who cares?) and the most likeable character turns out to be her prize bull, Vindicator. I thought this was kind of a snoozer, with a somewhat brittle feel overall. Kind of a dud.	bad
Party on...or study on, depending... So, according to this guide every school must be either...a) A "party school" where the students are inebriated a greater percentage of the time than they spend in class. It turns out that the tuition and board at these schools are merely cover charges for the four years of parties and jam-band concerts. Chances are you'll miss the majority of your classes due to hangovers, so don't even bother with the academics.orb) A "nerd school" where the social life is defined by the number of people in your study group. Forget parties and fun at these schools kids, it's off to the library...Did we mention the lackluster "male to female ratio"...funny, considering they mention that for an all-male school...Use this in conjuction with another guide such as Barrons or Fiske, and take everything with a grain of salt.	bad
Did not help... Ordered and it was delivered all the way to middle east surprisingly fast. I had hoped it would help me sleep while I'm deployed and it has not. I ordered melatonin from the same company because that was recommended to me by someone here... so we'll we how that goes when it gets here!	bad
There are much better options out there I agree with a previous reviewer that these bars are waxy and awkward in taste - there is definitely only a hint of peanut butter and the rest of the mouthfeel is filler. I bought two cases on sale and keep them in a drawer at work for when I'm trying to fight off the urge to hit the vending machine, but I can't give these away, and only eat them myself because I've already paid for them and they're better for me than a Snickers.	bad
a real review I bought this book for help on a 12 hour flight, what a mistake. Totally improbable, filled with fluff, a waste of my time, and yours too. See my listing, you can buy it for $10	bad
Disappointed The recording is professional. However, the ensemble had consistent problems with being together and individual voices often stood out. This is a very average performance, and I was hoping for more.	bad
Hummmmmmmmm I plugged this into my laptop and recorded a sound file. There was a noticeable hum at the low end in the recording. Sent it back.	bad
Expensive, and sound quality doesn't warrant the purchase I've had this product a while, and when my existing headsets wear out I'll be buying the aluminum version. There is no discernible quality improvements, and for triple the price it isn't worth it for the titanium housing. With daily use threaded in my Scottevest it's starting to have sound quality issues from frayed wires after about 16-20 months of use. Save your money	bad
Disappointed! How surprised I was when I started listening and realized that the music on this CD is identical to the James Taylor Hallmark CD from 2004!!!!! There is one song that isn't on the Hallmark CD... but other than that - reruns! I just can't believe that JT is in need of money so much that he would release the same music, in different order, and with a different cover photo. SAD.	bad
Charley Prides Tribute To Jim Reeves We have listen to this cd on my Sony cd player and car cd player with no problem.I think that Charley did a wonderful job,to me he even sounds like Jim Reeves,but this cd will not play on my pc at all and I can't make a backup.What if something goes wrong with this cd,I'm just out of luck with a $15.00 cd that won't work. They should have it where you can at least make one or two backups just in case.	bad
Misleading and disappointing! Even though the description said this pack was a large, and intended to fit my 13x9x2 Pyrex, it is really much smaller than the one I needed to replace. Very disappointing!	bad
Not engrossing, not entertaining, not enlightening I did not enjoy this book. Try The Color Purple instead.	bad
SBC Executive Series Phone I am a remote associate for a firm and so I need a high quality phone. This phone is okay, but the speaker volume does not get high, you get a lot of interference in the speaker. The headset volume is not very good either and makes it difficult to hear. The caller ID also record out of town calls but when you hit redial they error out because you have to push one first. Kind of annoying, invest dollars in a better product.	bad
More misses than hits... Although Incesticide contains Sliver, Dive, and Molly's Lips (by the Vaselines) which are all excellent. The rest of the CD however is not very good at all. Some of the songs are too boring or repetitive. Fans of In Utero might like this one, but if you like the great melodies and excellent lyrics of Nevermind and Unplugged you should skip this one.	bad
A regrettable read War...or at least the kind that's mustached and carries a swaggerstick. A hard read for those who do not buy Keegan views on war. There's too much of his own coloured personal opinion in his thesis to be quite convincing. It isn't hard to see why he ascribe to the view he does (ie "Fog in Channel; Continent cut off") but it makes for poor history for those who really wish for a clearer understanding of war.	bad
Remedial writing and plotting This is garden variety urban fantasy genre - you know, the loner outcast protagonist realizes magic is real, makes magical friends, finds out she fits in after all, blah blah. It's all been done much better by others, particularly Charles de Lint and Neil Gaiman. I had bought this book on the initial gushing reviews and was sorry to learn later most of them were the "friends of the author/ free copy if you review" variety. Well, I paid full price and have never met the author. I wasn't able to get past the average writing, nominal characterization, and I won't even get into the glaring typos and continuity errors. Look elsewhere.	bad
Boring Mr. Borge has some great acts, but in between the acts there was alot of time taken up with him looking out at the audience and making funny faces. I would rather it had been shorter with more acts.	bad

Oxford Cushions are okay, not great I returned my cushions. The natural color was too stark. The single welt was not nearly as nice as a box welt. The cushion thickness was a little too flimsy. If you are on a tight budget, these are fine, but if you want something that looks really sharp, I would pass on these.	bad
Not what I was hoping for This soundtrack did not live up to my expectations at all. There are a few good Rob Z toons on it, especially Brick House 2003, but, that is about it. There are no long, moody-spookie tracks on it, the isolated clips are trite, and I could have lived without the Slim Whitman and Buck Owens.If you are hoping for another Rob Zombie album, this is not it. At best, look at it as a CD-Single, a few good tracks and a lot of spare baggage from the movie. Sorry Rob...	bad
DVD is a Disgrace to the Original Film WARNING: This DVD is in 1.33 aspect ration, so you won't see the same film as the one in the theater.If you have a widescreen tv or 16:9 projection screen you'll have black bars on the left & right sides of your screen that will make this DVD look like a "TV Movie".Visually this was a stunning film, shot by one of the greatest cinematographers - Jordan Cronenwenth who also filmed BLADERUNNER, STOP MAKING SENSE, etc. It is such a disservice to him and the film to NOT release this as an anamorphic widescreen DVD so the homeviewer can enjoy the great visuals.WARNER Bros., we'll rather pay a little more, and get quality!4 stars for the film, 1 star for the DVD.	bad
handy but not sturdy I really wanted a messenger stlye bag so that it would not fall off my shoulder when carrying the baby, this fits that description, however, in just 2 months the lining came apart. i wanted something daddy friendly, but this bag is not big enough even for the essentials (diapers, change of clothes, bottles, and formula dispenser). it is a nice looking bag but i do not recomend it.	bad
Not good for crushing ice for smoothies We have owned this blender for about 6 years and while we love its sturdy feel and clean design, the rubber coupler that allows the blade/blender to function started to deteriorate over time. I looked to find a replacement part and appliance.net has some recommendations and some "horror" stories as well. It seems like a flaw in the engineering. Bummer.	bad
More Money From Gladiator Fans I have some issues with this release:1. There was enough space left on the 1st CD to include the additional movie tracks.2. We don't need no stinkin' dialog!3. We don't need no stinkin' remixes!4. I have no emotional attachment to scores that were not used in the film.There should have been a single CD with all the major musical themes and they should've been in chronological order.Just my 2 cents.	bad
Nothing Special It is true: this band has managed to put forth a new sound, and that sound appears consistently in the CD. This new sound, however, is nothing worth getting excited about. I listen eclectically to many things, including emo, but I am not impressed. I've pinpointed what I don't like about the music. The guitar seems too thick and repetetive, with muddy and ill-defined chords. The vocal parts are strange and not very melodic, seeming not to fit the guitar parts (but then again, what could, given their ambiguous nature?). The emotion is refreshing, but there's just not enough musically to maintain my interest.	bad
A New Earth For some it may help, but for me I didn't agree with what was written. But hey try it. You may like it!	bad
Barely Regaining Traction My first disappointment is that it is yet another episode spent/wasted searching for the lost girl. As a consolation, a major character expresses his exasperation with this futile and monotonous pursuit.Now for the foolishness:An unconscious character wakes in a stream-bed to find a zombie munching on his... steel-toed boot. A barn full of zombies that hitherto and inexplicably went undiscovered is revealed at the end. This is done in typical Lost (a detestable show that I quit watching after 2 seasons) and Breaking Bad (a series that turned things back around midseason) style where the episode's major revelation is left for the very last scene.All this portends to a Lost style program. A foolish program that I despised.[..]Set the hook, keep giving them mysteries, and, most importantly delay, or better yet, deny a pay off.	bad
died after about 2 years The power supply that is... i have an 8 port one that still works, but I am worried about that now since it uses the same power supply.I checked and it's 5v at 1.2aSo I remembered that I had a usb cd drive that took additional power from usb. So I plugged that cord into my htc's phone charger and plugged it into the switch.Back in action.It also worked via the pc's usb slot, which is surprising since I believe usb only gives 100ma if it does not give a data signal or something from a computer. Don't quote me on that.I am worried about my 8 port one now since I don't have anything for that unless I spliced the cable open and soldered a usb conenctor at the end.	bad
Not upto Scratch I am a 'foreigner' who has spent a lot of time in Perth and Western Australia. Initially I had a copy of rough guide Australia, but thought it was not detailed enough on Western Australia (purely because of quantity not quality).This book is simply not upto scratch. My final straw using this book was going to a restaurant in Northam, recommended by this book, which had been shut for several years! If Rough Guide does not cover something, it is because there is no need for it to be covered!My advice would be to purchase Rough Guide Australia. It covers everything in the depth it needs to be covered.	bad
Good diet.......cookbook ehhh........ I lost weight on the Fat Flush diet, it worked well for me. I wanted to get a few more different recipes so I purchased this book. I agree with one reviewer who thought it was written in a hurry to get it out, and I also have to question how a nutritionist with a diet plan can write a book without any information as to nutritional values for the recipes. Calories, protein, sodium, carbs, etc. none of that is listed for the recipes in this book. Granted it is not a diet about counting calories but some of us still want to know. Also, information about wooden spoons and utensils? Really?? The writer assumes ignorance on the readers part. Anyone who cooks knows about these things. Just how many pages were needed for this book to publish it? Give me recipes, not filler.	bad
a below average book according to me,this is quite a ridiculous book.in this book,nancy is not allowed to enter the mapleton country club.so what does she do?she sneaks inside the club at 11 p.m. at night and also takes puppet,slave ned with her.talk about illegal!even if she wants to sneak inside in the night,why should poor ned do the same?otherwise it is quite an OKAY book,but not too worthwhile.	bad

Read This Before Buying Although the Tai Funk Dance moves are fun to learn, this video is not what it promised. Camera angles make it difficult to learn the dance moves for one thing. Next, once you do manage to learn the routine, they only do the whole routine three times before the video concludes. Most exericse videos, such as Tai Bo, teach the moves individually and then have a 20-30 minute routine encompassing all you've learned. I didn't even work up a sweat doing this workout. Therefore, if your only interested in learning some new dance moves, then purchas this video. If you are actually wanting to exercise, purchase Tai Bo.	bad
Beware Buying Sayers Books -- Duplication Abounds Beware buying collections of Dorothy Sayers essays. She didn't write all that many, and most books are simply repackagings of the same essays under a different name -- like this book and "Letters To A Diminished Church," which is not any "letters" at all but simply a few more essays than are contained here. If you have Letters there's no need to buy this book, which the publisher dishonestly wants you to think is chiefly concerned with Christian dogma. It is not. Some of the content is, other content is not.	bad
didn't the Velvet Underground already make this record? Aping, aping and more aping. I give them two stars for at least doing their job passably well. But come on kids, this is nothing new or different. It's a bit slicker than all the stuff it's based on, but is that really a good thing?	bad
It's just OK I don't dislike this machine but the cons are it makes weak coffee if you don't use alot more grinds. I've noticed it helps to use a 'strong' coffee type and it also helps if you make at least 8 cups at a time. Four cups comes out weak. If you make 10 cups you need to use the special filters as the large amount of grinds spill out. If you make less than 6 cups you can use a standard filter. I turn on the warm plate button minutes before I start the brewing otherwise the coffee isn't as hot as I like. Also the stainless water tank looks similar to a tin can, not like your stainless steel appliances.I do like the speed in brewing. It does make a fast pot of coffee and it tastes reasonably good. We've used it daily for months and have had no leaks from the machine.Don't think I would buy it again. It's based on an interesting concept (always heating) but I'll probably go back to a regular coffee maker that allows you to pull the carafe during the brew cycle if you're in a hurry.	middle

Rainbow Six Rogue Spear First person sneaker, A clone of Thief The dark project. Sneak behind the bad guys and shoot them with a silencer, One flash bang weapon is just like the flash bomb in thief. The graphics and sound are good. The bad guys are very sharp shooters and just one shot is enough to get you down and you cant save the game in the middle of the mission. Single player gameplay is very difficult as you need atleast 4 persons to finish a mission.	middle
A good book but leaves you wanting at the end. This book starts out great. You learn a lot about the characters and the places they go. You learn about the horrors they see and experience and how they overcome them. It is a true love story set in war-ridden India in 1857. This would have been an excellent book but it's about 300 pages too long. After awhile I got bored with it and just wanted it to end. This was a great story but it was too drawn out.	middle
A Talent, but Second Tier Fans of North African music and movies conjure up 'Rick's Place' in 'Casablanca' and hope for North African-International music that might fit that era. Maurice El Medioni may have come from there but he does not deliver what contemporary North African music lovers might hope for or what 'Colonialists' might wish to remember. This CD also features 'The Klezmatics'--a modernized reference to klezmer music traditions typified, for me, by Giora Fiedman. They and their tradition don't get much of an outing here. I wanted to see these two 'grooves' come together! For my taste, Maurice El Medioni delivers piano music that features changes in rhythms, percussive effects and wonderful tonalities but he does not captivate. Many of his compositions draw too much from the same well and feature the same sonic effects. For me, this outing of his is a bit like a third-world lounge act.	middle
Pay the extra money and buy the Britax I purchased the Britax Marathon for my car, and the Evenflow Triumph for my husbands car. I really didn't want to spend a lot of money for the second car seat since we take my car most of the time. The straps on the Evenflow are very hard to use, and adjust, compared to the Britax. You have to turn a knob on both sides to adjust them, where the britax, you just pull one strap. I had to wash the covers on both, and the Britax came out looking new, the Evenflow was all balled up, and I can't get it to lay flat now. I just broke down and purchased another Britax for our 2nd car. I wish I would have done it to begin with. It is a lot of money, but until they make another brand that is of the same quality, I recommend the Britax.	middle

How to Edit on a PC This is a good cam for the price, great picture, OK not good or great sound. I went with the HVR-A1U for better sound control.For those needing a PC based solution to edit, Sony Vegas Movie Studio (Amazon sells it) which is the consumer version of Sony Vegas pro editor is a good choice. Version 6 was good with HDV and Version 7 is better. HD is a lot of data and a newer well configured PC is best for crunching all that data. If your computer meets the minimum hardware for Vegas Movie Studio but is still slow you can improve performance with a utility from VASST called Gearshift. I used Vegas Movie Studio 6 and upgraded to the full pro version Vegas 7.	middle
Motor hums, light bulb diffuser rattles It's an inexpensive range hood, and you get what you pay for. It's not awful, but not great either.For use with a ducted exhaust, scored panels must be removed but the "perforations" are very strong, I had to use a Dremel and a cutting wheel to cut them free. Tinsnips might also work, but don't plan on removing these with bare hands.No matter what speed is selected, even the slowest, the motor has a loud hum.On higher fan speeds, the plastic diffuser that covers up the light bulbs rattles like crazy. If you put your hand on the diffuser the rattle goes away, so you can either wedge something in there to hold it tight or just throw away the diffuser.Unless I'm missing something, the metal mesh protecting the fan from grease splatters etc seems to require a butter knife to remove.Other than these issues, it works well. Moves plenty of air, the sheet metal is sturdy, and the rest of the build quality seems adequate.	middle
if you love skinny puppy, you'll hate this A little background: This cd ended up on my computer. I listened to it, was disgusted, gave it a few more tries since i was bored, and deleted everything but dead of winter.A good skinny puppy cover is like a cold fusion reactor, or a good doors cover. As of yet, none have been made. While it is interesting to hear download download itself, it is not very memorable to hear a progeny of spinoff bands attempt to improve upon their sole source of inspiration. What is produced is a lot of mumbling and structureless atonal mush, lacking the visceral emotion and entrancing rhythm that we have come to adore.For an industrial cd, that merits no stars. For this cd compared to any other cd, including linkin park, three stars.	middle
Paige's book review "Pleasing the Ghost" is a funny story but I don't like it.I think the words and repitition of "pleases" that are pointless.I like Bo [the dog]though. The way he jumped up and barked when ghosts came through the window. It's cute! My least favorite charactor was Colin because he thinks he is so cool.He is the most conceited charactor in the whole book.I liked the part when Uncle Arvie asked for the 1st. "please" it was very exciting because you have not read the book and don't know what will happen next. The 2nd. and 3rd. "pleases" start to get boring.I think it is most similar to "The Sixth Sense"because both kids see ghosts.Sharon Creech has an unique style of writing but it is not my favorite.It is so short and she crams it then stops short like:"I wonder why aunt Julia has that huge box..." It's so annoying!I would recommend it to gr.3 up.On a scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 3!	middle
Earnest but not what I expected. I am a riding instructor and am continually looking for more ideas to keep my teaching fresh and interesting. This book is more about teaching techniques than lesson plan ideas. I think that there is definitely a place for a book of this kind, just not what I expected. If you are looking for a book that would be like a college textbook to learn to be a teacher and specifically a riding teacher this would be helpful.	middle
Great product rotten price! I love this protein powder! I am required to drink at least one protein supplement a day because of my medical issues. This tastes alot like lowfat chocolate milk and isn't gritty at all. BUT this price is outragoues! I ordered from another vender a container this very week of the same flavor and size for $29.99! Check around before you buy! WLS sites are great for high protein low carb mixes and powders as well as ready to drink protein. In my opinion Champion is the best but I can't give this product here a 5 star when I know it is over priced compared to other venders.	middle
Good, but the plastic snap broke Not sure how it happened but one side of the "female" end of the plastic snap, which is made of relatively thin plastic, broke after a time. This kind of renders the whole pack unwearable.	middle
Hmmm I put a big write up on this cd on here and I guess amazon didn't like www.noiserecords.com in my text. Check it out...it has all of the songs.....you be the judge	middle
A tepid remake, but with some surprising scares! I'm not a huge fan of remakes. I didn't like when they remadeLet the Right One In (English Subtitled). I didn't like when they remadeManhunter. I didn't like when they remadeBeing Human. No, not a big fan of remakes.This one makes the common remake mistakes of explaining too much, showing too much with their new whiz-bang CGI, and delivering flat characters ...... yet despite all that, there are some genuine scares to be had in this movie. It starts out very slowly, looks like it's going to be a non-starter, and then before you realize it, there are some scenes that just scare the ever-loving piss out of you!I can't really bring myself to recommend this remake with any enthusiasm. It just didn't need to be made, or if it did, it could have been made better. That said, it could also have been made much, much worse. I suppose it's worth a watch if you can't find anything better on tonight.	middle
Important but unfortunate script If not for the point of the movie (killing innocent people is bad; let's all feel guilty about who allowed it to happen), the writing would openly be criticized. Someone suggested this is a "Schindler's List" of Rwanda. I disagree; Schindler's List was an excellent drama in every way; from music to writing to photography to acting. Hotel Rwanda falls short with canned writing and on-cue tear-jerking mediocre music.Hotel Rwanda almost succeeds in maintaining a degree of sobriety, and a mood of factuality in the dramatic events--and this is its strength and its originality.However, the script goes too fast to convey the plot's atrocious events, leaving the aftertaste of awkward melodrama. And to give another example. the happy ending is too fast and artificial. I could be much more critical; could go on.I especially felt bad for the actors, who have much greater talents than the limited script allowed.	middle
Okay, and has some good ideas I liked some of the ideas that the authors presented, but overall I found the way that they broke up the book to be confusing. The names were not listed alphabetically, and in several cases I would read one section, and have some of the same names from earlier listed in another section. I will definitely be searching for another book to help me find a better variety of names with more organization.	middle
good shoe for the price this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.	middle
OK, but there's been better The premise is old and has been done better before - "Watchmen" comes immediately to mind. Compared to the thoughtfulness and attention to detail in that milestone work, the "Powers" universe feels very hastily thrown together. Cheap tricks, like a barely explained "light" that nullifies super powers, provide easy plot devices and eventually weakens the already predictable conclusion to the book's title question. The main characters are vaguely interesting, but are fairly one dimensional - We've all seen the hard-edged detective with a secret and his unwanted, but scrappy (female) sidekick as well as the stereotypical Mark David Chapman type "crazed fan" killer they hunt. On the plus side, the art is great and the book itself is printed on high quality paper with loads of extras - including the full script of the first issue.	middle
???? 'n' bass I bought this cd expecting to find something unusual in it. But it is the same old story containing the same elements, except some high moments like "dark gift", "shirt waste" and "goldbug". But the album really misses the "drum" part of its genre.	middle
Amusing but slight. If you're familiar with Steven Millhauser, Lightman's writing style doesn't have any surprises in it. Although Lightman's book is enjoyable, it lacks the resonance and depth that Millhauser's work has. The thoughts on time meander and leisurely move along in prose-poem fashion. However, the thoughts merely skim the surface and Lightman doesn't seem interested in delving more deeply into his material. The overall effect is amusing, but slight, much like this review.	middle
The American Dream The Great Gatsby is the classic novel known as the American Dream. I thought that in some ways it represented what everyone in the United States wants. I thought that in the beginning it was really really boring but in the secone half of the book it became a little bit more interesting. I think that overall it was an okay book but I don't think that I would ever read it again.	middle
Meh Meh. Most of this collection is background music in a light acid-jazz style. Standout tracks are "You Might Say" and "Fast Forward."	middle
I Told You So-Chino xl Chino has never disappointed when it comes to lyrics. This album is no different. The listener must constantly be aware, or they take the risk of missing the next punchline. A few of the tracks were suspect (but that's what remixes are for). Chino says what's on his mind and is a surprisingly good storyteller. His boasting and bragging don't come off...like other artists. He has proven himself true to hip hop from numerous appearances on The Wake Up Show which also served the purpose of keeping his name fresh in the minds of true heads. One word of advice is to not let so much time lapse between releases next time or he may become insignificant. Overall, this is a solid effort.	middle
a little slow but interesting When you read that this novel takes place in one day, don't expect anything like a season of the TV show 24. Just the opposite, here. Very little happens over the first 2/3 of the book. Mostly it's flashbacks. It's wordy, almost overwritten at times, but there are great images, too. The last 100 pages, things pick up, and I felt good about the book at the end. Half the time, I liked this, half the time, I got a bit restless.	middle

Necessity that should of been in the system. Basically, if you want to get your saves from your old ps2 and ps1 memory cards, you have to buy one of these. It really should of been included in the ps3, but sony decided not to put it there(probably for more money).The thing is easy to use though. You plug in your memory cards and upload them. No problems with it.	middle
Cheap but nice looking. The humidor has a nice dark wood looking finish and lined with felt, so it will not scratch your furniture. The humidifier and hygrometer is held on, by a Velcro strip so it does look a little cheap, but look at the price.Overall, I say that you get the best little humidor that $20 can buy. The few months I have had it I have enjoyed it. Every time the lid is opened, the wonderful aroma of the cedar and hand rolled cigar smell pleases the senses of the body.The company that shipped my order arrived in about 2-3 days. As well, charged less then actual shipping costs.	middle
Boring narrator Even though I really dislike the new narrator, my 3 year old loves these stories and the new characters. I disagree with other reviewers who think the new narrator gives different voices to all the characters. To me they all sound the same...boring and monotonous. This DVD wasnt for me, but for my son and as long as he's happy...I'm happy.	middle
Mediocre The product did no preform as well as I had hoped. Several years ago I had a complete hysterectomy (ovaries as well) so this just din't alleviate the dryness associated with this severe dryness associated with a total hysterectomy.	middle
Fun home soft serve machine This is a fun machine to have for a kid's party or for a small dinner party. It makes 10 half-cup servings, with delivery somewhat slow but adequate. I think I'll get more use out of this than my ice cream maker.	middle
Honestly Speaking on Smooth's Reality I love Smooth. No I really mean, I love Smooth. But I wanted to remember those brilliant blasts from the past. This Album doesn't quite do it for me. The title album "Smooth" is without a doubt the Bomb. I could play it from start to finish with a yawn. So "Reality" will have to take a back seat.	middle
Paint fades to pink in a few months Bought this for my 6 year old soccer player and he really likes it but the paint faded to a pastel pink color after 3-4 months of being outside. We spray painted it so he doesnt mind it now.	middle
Great start...terrible finish The movie does have nice visuals and the crash of the space ship is done very well. In fact, the visuals on the planet surface almost make you feel warm. Unfortunately, all of the tension and action builds to an absolutely absurd and anticlimactic finish. Too bad even to be categorized as predictable. I will probably purchase it just so that I can have access to the nice bits but it is lightyears away from much better horror/scifi such as Event Horizon or Alien.	middle
a reverse propaganda film? With blue eyes and near blond hair Greta Scacchi just doesn't seem very Cuban?The film seems to be trying to get Cubans in Miami to not resist Castro?The film has a flimsy triangle of the boat owner who rescued the wife and thejournalist who was a political prisoner. Having just seen a filmabout "disappeared" in Latin America this film is a real contrast.Both sides seem bent on getting rid of all opposition byany and all means. A large number of Cubans are in a Ghettoin Miami and will probably remain there. It is in the interestof the US government that they don't make any waves.So I take this film with the non-Cuban ( Italian) lead asbeing a propaganda film. The US government is waiting for Castro to die.	middle
Great knives, block broken The knives themselves are sharp and great- however I received them yesterday and the block was split down the back.	middle
decent, but same as online I've just finished my applications for law school and have to say, this book was very little help. You can find plenty of examples of good essays online. One reason I didn't find it helpful was, there is no consistent theme between all the essays. There is no "one thing" that makes an essay a Harvard Accepted one... and a non-accepted one. I think I expected to see similarities or consistencies between the styles or subjects or formatting and there just isn't. So, I think your time is better spent working on your own unique essay and having it double and triple checked for grammar and spelling.	middle
Entertaining It was entertaining but I wouldn't re watch it or buy the blue ray. It was worth the rental though.	middle
Broke after 18 months I have two of these units. The first has broken after 18 months. I have sent it back to a Yamaha repair center and the cost to repair is as much (or more) than a factory new unit. It was not used heavily for the time that I have had it... But I AM going to buy another one.... I am a brand loyal type all of my stuff is Yamaha brand.... Looking at some Thiel speakers though..	middle
Ben-Gurion's Spy This is a good summary of the 20th century terrorism and scandals involoving Arab/Israeli conflict. The author writes in a narrative form, making these factual occurances seem almost fiction. It is interesting to read and written in a manner which evokes suspense and unveils history.I would primarily reccomend this to someone with an interest in this topic already.	middle
A few quirks I've had this hotpot for at least 5 years. The chrome and black is attractive and it heats water very quickly. However, I have 2 problems with it:1) When you try to pour, instead of coming out in a manageable stream, the water pours in the middle and dribbles on each side, creating a mess. I think it is caused by the interaction of the lid and the spout. I get around it by popping open the lid slightly before I pour, and that does the trick.2) The auto-off feature stopped working reliably about a year ago. It will boil dry if I don't keep an eye on it. It still works sometimes, but when it does it will be at a full boil for a good 30 seconds before it shuts off.	middle

Pretty decent read Sex is pretty explicit, but I liked the plot, it was interesting and well written. I hated the name of the heroine and the fact that people even her lover called her Miss Gussie. It irked me. But other than that it was okay.	middle
Not As Good As The Outcast/Heroine Was A Shrew I didn't enjoy this story nearly as much as the The Outcast. It lacked the poignancy of the author's first novel in the series. It also had a much weaker plot. One of my problems with the book is the non-existent journey to love for the main characters. Dodge simply loves Starla for no apparent reason. I could never buy it since Starla was a total shrew to Dodge for much of the book. I had a lot of problems with Dodge also. He was so boring compared to Starla's brother. Overall, the book was an enjoyable read, but not a keeper.	middle
Too Much Edited Out! Loved the Book,have & read many times- which is very good. The PC Game got into the general frame of the story, but,,, some key elements of the book were cut out for the sake of time saving? - a Good game is at least six dedicated hours - interesting & fun, but not enough of it for a clever game play. In the book, at least one person is dispatched every several pages, in the game it's the exact opposite- none at all... non-existant strategy scenario-lite entertainment.	middle
AIR SUPPLY DVD COLLECTION When purchasing this dvd i had not heard many Air supply hits, but the dvd is hit and miss... some songs fine and some a bit too old fashioned ...actually i come from England and thought Air supply was American.... just shows how wrong i can be, but i do have a good general knowledge on different types of music...but if you know Air supply well then i think buying this dvd would be well worth the money...ps my girlfriend sang along to a few songs, so it cannot be too bad	middle
WESTERN Not bad for a western mystery, not exactly my favorite but okay. The classic western writers are still hard to beat.	middle
Strong First Chapter but Started Skipping Pages One thing in common with the Lovely Bones is the fact that Sebold has an extremely effective and powerful style of grabbing the reader in the first chapter. Even though I knew what each book was about, I found both Lucky and Lovely Bones riviting in their first chapters. However, unlike Lovely Bones, I found myself skimming pages in Lucky to get to the essence of the story. I gave it 3 stars and was contemplating 4 because I was not only compelled to finish it, but found that it stayed with me enough to discuss it with friends. (one friend also agreed with the skimming technique to try to finish). The book is important because Lovely Bones would probably not have been written but for Sebold getting out this story, which is in itself a very powerful story of survival. Something to talk about. . .	middle
Full of gems, but dense reading This book's greatest strength is that it is filled with gems of truths about human existence. What shows Xingjian's writing abilities best is how he makes an observation about how people behave and turn it into a universal human truth.However, finding those truths is not always easy. Some are stated, many are not. The point is that this book is incredibly dense, and very literary. Being a literary author myself, I appreciate that, but not all readers do. I recently taught this book to a class of college students and though they all read it, none understood what the book was trying to tell them -- and most of the class is pretty astute.I recommend this book to people who enjoy dense reading, books filled with meaning and human truths. If you're looking for a book to read in the sedan chair at the poolside, this is not likely your book.	middle
Bought this razor as a gift I bought this item as a gift and it arrived yesterday. First, it was not as pictured. The natural wood handle is silver in color and styled with imitation wood grain. This was not a selling point for me but buyers should be aware of this. I ran the razor along some cardboard and it seems sharp enough to shave with, though I can't confirm this with an actual test. Three stars because it arrived on time and looks suitable but was not as pictured.	middle
Muscle Needed If you are not very strong, I would opt for a different edger. I cannot use the product. I am going to try a step edger. My fried has had some success with this edger, but it seems that the amount of strength it takes to actually edge will soon break the tool.	middle
The ghost was the best part of this book The book seemed to change focus partway through. It started out focusing on the heroine running away, and how Robert distrusted all English. Suddenly, that's dropped for a boring discription of how Mereli is in charge of the Douglas household (with pages and pages discribing her cleaning). We don't see why Robert stops disliking her. Personally, I though she had more chemistry with the ghost, Huge, and even Philip than Robert. Much of the dialogue was flat, sounding more like something written than said.	middle
Good Read If you like the "Cat Who..." series, then you will enjoy this book. I found that since it is the next to the last book in the series, it is not the best example of this mystery series, but still a nice read. Some of the story line and writing style seems inconsistent with earlier titles. I thought there were too many unanswered questions at the end. But if you gotta have the book to complete your collection (like me!), then read it. And then go back and read some of the books in the middle of the series to remind yourself why you like them so much....	middle
A classic on DVD...Finally While I am extremely happy to finally be able to watch ALF whenever I want. I want to point out that these are not the original uncut episodes. These episodes have been taken from the syndicated versions and not the ones that were aired on NBC during the 1986-1987 season. This was very disappointing since some of the funniest parts of each episode were edited out. Still in all, it is great to have ALF on DVD. I only hope when they issue Season 2 that they use the original un-edited episodes.	middle

Glorified romance novel This book wasn't nearly as funny as I had anticipated based on all the hype, though I enjoyed it once I got 12-13 "days" into it. Basically, this is just a re-packaged romance novel.	middle
Arrived Broken and mounting bolts not threaded Ordered one stool. Middle slat was broken. The rest were ok. Mounting bolts were not threaded and looked like the bottom of the barrel bolts (the last ones in the lot) and I had to use my 3 of own nuts and bolts to mount. Other than that, everything is just fine.	middle
Awesome little flash! I used the Nikon SB-400 flash to shoot pictures for a wedding and both the day pictures and the night pictures were great. The two double AA batteries lasted a long time. I used the diffuser which spreads the light evenly, but not harshly.I would rate this higher, but I thought the price was too high. If the price of the flash had been 90 bucks or so, I would have bought two flashes!	middle
Interesting, but also not awesome I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan and so was really looking forward to this movie. There are some really interesting things that he's done and touched on in this movie. A familiarity with the Alien films, particularly "Alien" and "Aliens" is really necessary to catch all the ways in which you can see Scott is playing with subject matter for which there is already a lot of canon, but a fair bit of it he doesn't agree with, maybe. There are some great gems in the subtexts created by backgrounds of the characters, the android's choice of on whom to model himself, etc.On the other hand, a lot of the movie is messy as heck. There is tons of exposition and just a lot of general ponderousness. This is not a great film.	middle
Slightly surpasses mediocre, I guess. The plot is utterly formulaic, and "The Rock" has all the acting ability of a cinder block, but this movie isn't totally boring.	middle
Good Transmitter- bad mount So i got this for a 20 hour car ride to florida. The transmitter works great no problems with the signal. But the connector does not work with my ipod case protection - so i have to take that off every time i want to use this item. also the connection to the power plug falls out from bumps and shakes from driving long distances. overall it was worth the money, but i would recommend a top transmitting unit - from the head phone jack instead of this unit.	middle
Outlaw history Interesting book. If one is really into the stories behind the outlaws of the American West this book covers a lot. I was bored at times. The author did his homework though, kuddos to that.	middle
Good Cool Fun, But not a classic I bought this game when it dropped in price. I had to have one more item with the SLC Olympic Logo on it, I was a volunteer during these games. The game has a good representation of some of the sports played, graphics where decent but not memorable. I think it would be a great sports title for someone who has never played one, young or old. For the hardcore fan, I would maybe pick this up only if you have pride for TEAM USA!!! But for the rest of us it had the thrill to keep me jumping off that K-120 hill for a couple of days.	middle
Hearing Gets in the Way of Romance This book contains a wonderful little romance if one could just get past the long, drawn out hearing centered around a university professor. Gilbert, the college professor, is keeping a very important secret from Rachel James, one of his favorite former students. It was more than obvious how much Gilbert and his students cared for one another, but the reader was beat over the head with that point far too often.Rachel, along with his other former students, come to the aid of their much beloved mentor who holds a well guarded secret. During this time, she happens to fall for the reporter covering the story. Another problem with the story is: most readers probably will have figured out that secret without having even gotten far into the novel.If only the author had focused on this story rather than that of hearing, this could have been one nice little romance novel.	middle
Good camera, not perfect PROS: 1. Unbeatable Price, 2. Very good sharpness (not excellent), 3.Intuitive and easy-to use. 4.good performance un AUTO, better in other functions. 5.Good video quality, adequate in poor lighting. 6. adequate digital zoom (if you have a very steady hand). 7. performs well in low light (using manual). 8.Very flexible for the "family/vacation shooter".CONS: 1. Mediocre software, 2.Poor macro/close-up fuction (closest focusing = 9cm. aprox.), 3.Diopter diffcult to manipulate, 4.Strange and very light violet cast/hue on certain pix (still don't know why). 5. Need two batteries so as to not lose info on camera. 6.Some focusing difficulties. 7. No spot-metering in manual mode(doesn't say this in the manual).Bottom line: for a camera its price and its class, it's very hard to beat. Built for the very advanced "familiy/vacation shooter", not quite flexible enough for the avid amateur. Has some quirks I can live with.	middle
Curious collection of bizarre monstrosities Here's the compendium of some of the most bizarre creatures ever found in D&D - this set includes the minions of Chaos that come "from beyond"... not only are they fun for pure Dungeons & Dragons, but we've successfully run a D&D/Cthulhu campaign using these beasties as the main source of terror. Too much fun, and hard to find!	middle

Incomplete Index, errors, some material not fully explained During the last halve chapters of the book the author started to scurry through topics too quickly. I understand that he was trying to write a book that was not too advanced but I was irritated at new syntax and processes introduced in examples but not fully explained. This was my first Perl book. I admit I did like the book alot in the beginning. But when I began to practice code and needed to look up a keyword or special character I found there was no appendix for characters and keywords and scarcely an index at all. I had to thumb through the book each and every time I wanted to find "where I had read about" something.	middle

Zune can't be used as a portable harddrive. The Zune can not be used as a portable harddrive like the Apple iPod can. If Microsoft were to fix this via a firmware update then I would give the item four stars.However, lacking that feature is a real negative when you consider nearly all other players have it.Otherwise; I do enjoy the zune interface on the zune itself; it's fast and very clean and well organized. The zune software for the PC could use some work to make it more user friendly; but it is better than iTunes.	middle
Good basic overview of Linux Administration I have not yet taken the exam and am planning on reading a couple of other study guides and the exam cram first. I have only been using linux for about 4 or 5 months and use it as my primary desktop operating system. This study guide is easy to understand and appears to cover all of the objectives of the exam except for the hardware objectives. The book does not, however, go into a lot of detail. Linux+ is supposed to be an entry level exam (with LPI and SAIR being mid-level) so this may be sufficient. If the test goes very far into detail (such as asking what ps -aux does rather than what ps does), there might be a problem. I would stronly suggest that test-takers read this book and then follow it with a more in-depth book.	middle

The Pedal boat comes out early Spring(April) and get put away late Fall(October). And by late Fall the cover is ripped.

Good, but not great I'd not read Mina before. She has created a wonderful character in "Paddy," who, in spite of her repressive upbringing and poor self-image, is smart, ambitious and determined. The story does have good suspense, but not until late in the story. The story of the real Paddy was interesting but I think the book would have been tighter and better without it. The book is good, but could have been much better.	middle
An Easy Read The Secret Life of Bees" is an entertaining book and an easy read. I enjoyed it very much, but it's not a great book. The author demonstrated that a family does not have to be a traditional composition. Many people's families can be made up of friends. Men don't nessecarilty have to be in a family. I ama single middle-aged woman , so the power of the 'daughters of Mary' hit home. But I am sure married women as well could relate to it. This novel doesn't have the universal appeal that say another southern novel"To Kill A Mocking Bird " has but then that novel is a classic. After reading "The Secret Life of Bees" I want to form deeper bonds with my friends, live in a pink house , and develop with my friends some traditions. Read this book over a weekend. It's a chick book.	middle
Good information/ but with bad tast Ok first of all, if you going to have the host do a nude segment on a nude beech, then at least have a woman minus all the whale blubber down below. "Of all the girls they could have picked"Of course Justine did a great service on the film directing the audience attention exploring what Germany has to offer such as trains rides, street tours, and the beer festival. She even whooped a guy with a loaf of bread when being pinched on the arse.I might add a bit more latter. Right now I can't think of anything interesting to say regarding an ungreatfull socialist country "yeah I know we too are going down the same route" that was built up by American money; and kept from starving though American Airpower. I hope some of those deeds wasn't lost in the German text book.	middle
A good game, but did not meet my expectations.... This game is great, but it did not meet my expectations...Pros:-Theres 24 characters...that's alot to master...-There's a new Allstar mode, which is kool...-You can collect trophies - collecting them all will take a while...but it's cool to see all the trophies on your "table"-Event mode, in which you have to accomplish something with a special rule...Cons:-Adventure mode is BORING!-Every character, new and old now has Forward B attacks. This causes you to accidently do this attack occasionally when trying to use your B attack and Up B.-Everyone's voice sounds corny (especially Peach)-Some old characters just suck now... (Such as Kirby and Ness)Something in this game is missing...it's not enjoyable as it was when the first SSB came out...	middle
Don't be too mistaken One must remember Ford's other novels, "The International Jew", and that like Woodrow Wilson, he too was an avid white supremicist. I do think the world could have easily done with him. And for those who romanticize his business ethic, remember that he had also employed a private militant security detail that violently suppressed strikes and unions. Maybe Henry Ford isn't at all the great one he writes himself out to be?	middle
Could be better David McCullough is famous for his gripping and readable histories, and undoubtedly, he has a unique talent of making history more accessible for the general reader. I have read McCullough's biography of Ted Roosevelt, and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, "1776" failed to have the same effect on me.In "1776", McCullough covers the major battles the American forces fought against the British. Despite the title, McCullough only covers a few important battles: the fall of New York City, the siege of Boston, and the battles of Princeton and Trenton. He leaves out or barely mentions important events such as, the Declaration of Independence. The description of the battles is not very clear, and it was very hard for me to picture the battles."1776" is widely praised chiefly because it is a very readable and accessible account of the year 1776; however, it is far from being a deep and thorough account.	middle
Not very happy with the quality I just received this and I tend to agree with most that it has got a very flimsy backing to hold the quarters and also I'm not sure whether this is intended to be split into two parts but when I opened, it actually tore midway and I now literally have two albums one for the P and the other for D quarters ...is that how it was meant to be? or did I get a bad egg?	middle

Crawford ladder stabilizer Good stability, but the bumpers on the ends are slick plastic. Wanted to get "mitts" like you can for the end of the ladder, so it won't slip or mar the painted surface. Crawford says they make these, but its hard to find them.	middle
Dio finally starting to show his age I was really wondering how long he could possibly keep putting out records and wailing with his amazing voice. Well, this disc is finally the answer that no one can pull off metal infinitely. Even the master, who has rocked longer than anyone else I can think of (besides Mick Jagger), is really straining on this disc. Thanks for the great career, Ronnie. You've given us more wonderful music than most. Now, it's probably time to shift gears a bit and maybe do a twilight bow. Maybe something quiet, acoustic, in a John Prine vein. Really shock 'em one last time. The heavy rock dragon has finally landed, though.	middle
not great but better than a lot of other new stuff cassidy is not close to as bad as other new horrible rappers like j-kwon or murphy lee. this cd's not amazing, but the production's pretty good and cassidy's not bad. two AMAZING songs are "the problem" and "get no better". download those if u don't get the whole cd	middle
Highly technical This is a very comprehensive text. However, make no bones about it; the prose reflects a highly technical style of writing. If you have limited knowledge about differential equations, logic, and statistics, you will struggle to stay engrossed past the first few chapters. Hard reading is an understatment. I was hoping that this would be the book that could boil down what real options are and give me a straightforward approach to their applications. Reading this I feel like I am back in an astrophysics class at MIT.	middle
Wesley Snipes was a BAD choice for Sanaa's co-star... I'm not a huge Snipe's fan anyway, but I actually found myself turning away during their love scenes. Wesley just doesn't have the appeal that makes it believable that Zora would fall for him in the first place.Other than that, I thought the movie was okay. I really felt for Zora, I think Sanaa did a good job portraying the emotions and frustrations of that character. But again, it was hard to believe that she would fall for Wesley to begin with!	middle
come on , be intellectually honest , you know you like it i figure a star per dollar ratio at the LOTS is a good reinvestment on this baby . perhaps as the man of the hour writes , it doesn't have all the goods . rent a porn . this film was a labor of lust as the editorial-a-new-one review suggests . i like it . i divested myself of it and now i've reaquired the modest nugget . i'm in it like the tar baby .	middle

Kieja, It can't end here..... I couldn't put it down (even at work).This book went by so fast, I hated for it to end. I even went back a couple of times just to read some scenes a second time. There are so many loose ends, there has to be a sequel.	wonderful
excellent This movie is great. It takes the old time line and twists it one more time. Its like Deception but with time. Pay attention so you don't miss the count.	wonderful

I really do enjoy my quesadilla maker Since I found it marked down at 10 percent at a local drugstore. I have been having a blast making these quesadillas with this. I have made them before in the past using various other gadgets but found this to be the ideal way to make them. Before I'd get them on my grill griddle the fillings would fall out. same with my george foreman grill. This happens to be the easiest way and most fun way to make those. So far I have made plain cheese ones and Pizza quesadillas. I just love this and I know most will too.	wonderful

Unfortunately, not sure they still manufacture it as I can't get a hold of more.This is a case of the best product losing to cheaper alternatives that are worth only a fraction of what this product is worth.It goes a long way, making it EXTREMELY economical. I hope this company is able to continue manufacturing it.	wonderful

Ariadne's Thread a Workbook of Goddess Magic What a wonderful book for those who want to learn more about the craft, whether solitary or part of a coven, or getting ready to teach. It takes you through the year with lessons, projects, rituals and many other things that keep you on the path. It follows the Dianic tradition, which does not include men in ritual, but provides a solid base for practicing love of the Goddess. I highly recommend it to both Dianic and other practicioners.	wonderful
My Brother Sam Is Dead To my surprise my daughter loved this story! I thought it was going to be a fight to get her to read this book. It is full of 'colorful' language which middle school children enjoy, in addition to being uniquely told from a preteen boy's perspective. Excellent story! Though I should warn parents the ending can be disturbing to children. Realistic ending...might want to discuss feelings with your child upon completion.	wonderful
Unique. I first heard this album in 1978. I went out, bought the vinyl LP, and, over the course of the next three years, wore it to a frazzle. Thankfully, I had taped it right after I got it. When it came out on CD, I snapped it up immediately.This is the CD I take with me to audition speakers. San Lorenzo and Phase Dance have kept me from making a few mistakes as far as speakers go.I've listened to many of Pat's other albums...While most are quite good, nothing-repeat, nothing-will top this album as far as it being Pat Metheny's best effort. This CD will always be on my D.I.D. list.	wonderful
Great Resource This book offers a reality check for our culture on why we are here and our purpose for living. I have used the book for a sermon series to challenge us as Christians, not to buy into the religion offered by our world today. It helps us examine or faith and gives answers on how to respond to persons caught up in life under the sun.	wonderful
just what I wanted , on time. Great product at a decent price. The product works well. I recommend it. Philips Norelco makes good shaving products: this one is no exception.	wonderful
The Picture Bible This Bible is easy to read! Your children can follow along with the text and the pictures, making this educational, as well as spiritually beneficial!	wonderful
Extraordinary and splendid I have seen so many, many movies but this one I think has to be my all time favorite. The whole setting of the liberal arts college, the 50s conservative setup in which the college dwells so firmly in, and the magical aura of a bygone era captivates you right form the start of the film. Top that with some beautiful photography, a nice gripping story and some convincing performances and you've got a great film.This is a movie that will lift you up and make you smile. Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) Encourages students to reject conformity in any form and pursue careers rather than settle down as housewives. Colleagues advise the new professor that the trick to surviving Wellesley is to go unnoticed, as too much independence frightens administrators, who she is told have claws under their gloves.With this movie, I think many people will discover that not only students learn from teachers, but everyone learns from others.	wonderful
One of the best One of Hitchcock's best movies. A very good story and plot, with a good amount of entertaining suspence. I can watch it over and over without getting bored. Strongly recommended.	wonderful

REBIRTH OF A LEGENDARY SERIES Whoever was responsible for selecting the sides for inclusion in Vocalion's original Swing Series deserves a medal, because the quality is such that the label is held in high esteem. And who better to reissue them on CD than the reincarnation of Vocalion, under Mike Dutton. Not only has he done that, but with great attention to detail the cover duplicates the Vocalion 78 sleeve, and the CD face is emblazoned with a blow-up of the original 78 label. All of which merely sets the scene for what's on the CD, which features some of the best bands of the mid-30s (although the last track harks back to the late 20s). Benny Carter is featured on one-third of the tracks, all recorded during his stay in London, when his orchestra comprised some of the best British musicians of the time. This is a superb reissue which is enhanced by the late, great Malcolm Laycock's liner note.	wonderful
Good book - other reviews are accurate I cheated here and for the first time, I read other reviews first.Why reinvent the wheel....what other people said is true! ;-)This is a good book.

Extraordinarily Great 1st, 5 stars out of 5 stars isn't an adequate rating for this dvd release. This dvd set deserves at least 7 out of 5 stars for a rating.This dvd set continues where Season 1 of Gargoyles left off and expands the universe even further.It has commentary on all 4 parts of City of Stone, which vastly explain the backstory to Macbeth and Demona as well Demona a very sympathetic character.This release carries the 1st episodes of the World Tour which vastly expanded the Gargoyles universe very richly.Buy this set if you want to see the rest of the Gargoyles episodes released on dvds.	wonderful

Billboard 70's #1's This cd is great and I enjoy all the songs on the play list. I've listened to it many times and it brings back to the 70's.	wonderful
Original recordings... The used copies of this best-of are all dirt cheap. So without any other reviews of this item I was nervous that I was looking at a collection of re-recordings that Gene Vincent had cut, or that something else was wrong here. But no, these are the real deal! The CD-ROM is pretty lame. Don't buy this is you have all the music but think the CD-ROM will have something to offer you. It won't. The only thing that could make this best-of any better would be the addition of Catman. But, hey, I already have that song, so who cares? Right? 5 out of 5, man.	wonderful

A great, fast read Like one of the previous reviewers, I read this book in a short time (about three days, around my college schedule). It's a entertaining, colorful book with honest takes on the WWE, current and former wrestlers, and the everyday lifestyle of a sports entertainer on the road. Amy tells her story with candor, especially having to do with all the ups and downs of working in the WWE. She's no "company man" that acts an apologist for the company she works for. Yet her book is filled with positive stories, she has led an interesting life and is thankful for the experiences she's had. This is the most refreshing aspect of the book, compared to the Dynamite Kid's book, which was very bitter and negative. A highly recommended book, as far as wrestling books go, I rate it only behind Mick Foley's first book, and far ahead of every other one I've read.	wonderful
Works! It was easy to install and had no problems using it. Look for installation video on YouTube. Package arrived a little bent but keyboard was ok.	wonderful
Great product and service This workbook arrived on time in great condition. Everyone could find this useful, even those with a healthy level of self-esteem. It is well written and easily understood even for teenagers. I highly recommend this product.	wonderful
Old Time Poetry in Motion David Schnaufer, a national dulcimer champion brought the dulcimer to the Nashville scene. Dulcimer means "sweet sound" and it's never sounded sweeter than when played by David Schnaufer. Combine that with Bruce Baldassari and you've got a winning combination. Bruce can play the mandolin like no other. I had the opportunity to hear these two together in concert, and I've never heard such a wonderful sound as the dulcimer and mandolin played together by these two masters. This may be heavenly music at it's best. It sure would have the angels singing, clapping, and stomping their feet.	wonderful
Blew up my boat! I bought this pump for my Sevylor HF350 inflatable boat. It blew it up in about 20 minutes of actual run time. The directions read to take a 20 minute break after 10 minutes of continuous use.I was surprised by how it keeps on pumping even with a lot of back pressure and resistance from the inflatable.Afterwards, I blew up a Coleman Colossus raft in about 5 minutes, and an air mattress in about 2 min!!So far, I think it's a great value.	wonderful
awesome!! very small, slim and handy! good quality too I have a medium size bag and a very small one for when I go out, my purse is pretty heavy and big and does not fit my little bag. I wanted a credit card holder so I could easily transfer my important cards from one bag to another, and not have my cards loose in my smaller bag. This card holder is of good quality, remains very thin despite all the cards and bills I'm fitting in (ID, student ID,credit card, transport cards, bills). Each side has 2 slots, and there is a space in the middle for a few bills I honestly don't think it can be thinner. Extremely happy with the purchase, in particular for that price! The shipping was prompt and the item was delivered in a few days only. I highly recommend it!!!	wonderful
motion made easy this book is for anyone who feels overwhelmed by motion and its numerous applications. the easy to follow tuturials are what i needed to finally figure out this program.	wonderful
Easy to pack I have been traveling a lot to visit Grandchildren, etc. The Kindle is much easier to pack that a stack of books. It is great not having to worry about bookmarks falling out and finding my place again. The downloads are quick and easy. Bookmarking spots to return to are easy, too. I have a variety of books so I can read whatever I feel like. My kids are envious.	wonderful
Great I took the reviews of others and I agree - these are a beautiful color. Great price and fast service	wonderful

Laughing out Loud!! I wanted a DVD that I could send in a care package to a U. S. soldier who is deployed, and this really filled the bill. My very first impression was that it was beginning slowly, but a minute or two after that, there was actual laughing out loud.If you would like a great comedy "getaway from life," this is definitely one to try. This young man is really talented, and I would highly recommend this DVD.	wonderful
Easy, stable, and fast Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection.	wonderful
What a fun game! Syberia II for X Box is such an excellent game. Women especially will love the touching storyline, adventure and breathtaking graphics. As a follow-up to Syberia for X Box, this was a lovely conclusion to the somewhat disappointing ending of the first. I have never really played video games, but I really liked the setup of this game. The controls are easy to learn, and if you played the first game, they are pretty much the same. I am just so impressed with both Syberia games. I wish they made more games like this (games that women enjoy to play).	wonderful
Passion for Passion This is an amazing album! When I first went to my univ. my roomate and I used to blast it every morning! When I was shuffling from home to school... I lost my copy, and just re-purchased it. Songs like Breathe, and Grace Flows Down bring absolute peace and contentment on my most turbulent and upsetting days. The songs The Noise We Make and America get you pumped up for God and inspired. The song We Fall Down, that's sang in Setswana, is absolutely magical and powerful. Salvation is always a song I come back to when I need to feel God's presence. This album is a must have in every Christian's library. It inspires, and makes you feel not alone with the crowd cheering in the background. A must buy!	wonderful
An outstanding book on a crucial period of Scottish history Anyone who is a Scot or has a Scottish background will be fascinated by this book. Meticulously researched, it describes the harrowing lives of the many Scots folks who emigrated to the US and Canada during the 18th and 19th centuries.We were shocked to learn that some Scottish emigrants had become slave owners, while others with few belongings and no means were left stranded on remote points of the Canadian coastline in the middle of winter.	wonderful
One of the very best If you love loose and juicy watercolor painting, you'll love this book.It is filled with goodies, wonderful paintings and demos on how they were done. I have many books on the subject and this one ranks as one of my favorites. Landscapes and portraits all done with great flairand a very high level of drawing skill. There is some similarity in style and approach to my other favorite watercolor artist, Charles Reid.Mel Stabin is the real deal,very inspiring work of the highest order. Buy this book, you'll love it.	wonderful
British humour at its best! Being a fan of 'Allo 'Allo, I was thrilled to find out that series 5 was finally being released. Believe me, it was worth the wait. Lots of smutty jokes and double meaning puns ...of course Rene talks his way out of tricky situations every time. Officer Crabtree still keeps me in stitches with his attempts at French, and Herr Flick and Helga add a little spice. I recommend this series of 'Allo 'Allo and hope that series 6 will not be too far away.Frances in Australia	wonderful
Best At-Home Walk DVD I got this exercise dvd for my birthday. My husband and I both love it, and it has become my most used gift. We do the 1-mile walk together several mornings each week. His legs and back used to hurt when we walked outside on the sidewalks but not when we follow these exercises on the carpet at home. Sometimes, I do the 2-mile walk alone because it is too advanced for him at this time. We are both in our mid-sixties and have some back problems (healed herniated disks). I also have osteoporosis and mild scoliosis. There is only one exercise on this dvd I would caution others with similar back problems about doing. At the end of each walk, Ms. Sansone does a lunge and tells you to stretch your back forward, and then to stretch a bit more until your back is straight. I tried it a couple of times and got back pain several hours later. Now, I do it without the extra stretch. In other words, I do not completely flatten out my back, and I've had no more pain.	wonderful
Hauntingly Beautiful Music Every once in a while a recording comes along that you are sure will stay with you for the rest of your life. This is one such recording. Georgeous melodies, incredible rhythm section, standout soloists like Hancock and Shorter, and above it all the voice of Milton Nascimento. I cannot recommemnd anything more highly than this - it should be required listening for anyone who enjoys and appreciates good music. There are tracks here which grab you AND DO NOT LET GO. An absolute classic in every sense of the word.	wonderful
Not what I expected This game is just like the regular sonic, but you have levelsfor each player(Sonic Tails Amy and Knuckles).It is over all a good game, but it is not my favorite.It also has Tiny Chao Garden.

****many stars above the best! One of my top 5 favorites of all time. This is a classic, in tune with Dr. Zhivago...timeless, such a romantic movie! I adore it and watch it and Monsoon Wedding often.

Yes, there are Other films worth watching for those of us who want more than the latest silly action flick...	wonderful
The best $60.00 I ever spent I have this exact same model. I purchased it about 11 yrs ago from a CVS Drug store for $60.00. I used it daily when I went out walking. I have never had any problem with it, until recently. I think it just finely gave up the ghost. It was the best $60.00 I ever spent.	wonderful
Perfect I recently got this knife; I had been wanting a Global Chef's knife since I was given a Global utility knife as a gift. I was very impressed with it, to say the least.This knife is very sharp and Stays sharp. Unlike the famous European colleagues that look very classic, but go dull in a short time and require round the clock steeling and sharpening, the Global can do the same amount of work with much less upkeep.I would recommend this knife to anyone working in a kitchen, commercial or home use.It is extremely light, and perfectly balanced. I use it at work, and it has never let me down. I do recommend the handheld sharpener for touch-ups, it returns the blade to a close factory edge.It should be noted that the handle should be kept dry when you are working, because it will slip because of the nature of the design. That is it's only flaw.	wonderful
Excellent inspirational and motivating book Sonia Choquette has written a very inspiring book that offers intriguing excercises. I normally hate to write in a book ( ingrained manners!) but this book motivated me to meditate, reflect and write, then write some more! The concept that my hearts desire was within my grasp always seemed like such a fantasy but Sonia has made it a goal within my reach. I will most certainly be recomending this book to my friends,	wonderful

Works like a charm! What can I say? It's made by Timex, so it's super accurate and easy to use. The heart strap fits comfortably around your chest, and secures easily. The watch size isn't to large or to small, it fits and looks just right. The numbers on the screen are large and easy to read. You can set the watch to beep if your heart rate setting falls to low or high out of your specs, or you can set it to silent mode. It's been working great for me!Timex T5G971 Unisex Sports Personal Heart Rate Monitor Watch	wonderful
a well-crafted addition to Ender's universe Ender's Shadow is a well-crafted companion plot that complements the original Ender saga, both by filling in details of the first installment and spinning off several new threads of its own. Although there are fewer plot surprises than in Ender's Game the additional intrigue and Bean's savage-but-fascinating origin compensate well.Bean's story is fundamentally darker than Ender's. His origins are completely unknown until the investigations of a Catholic Nun and a Battleschool Commander reveal one disturbing layer after another. It also adds a visceral counterpoint to the final battle with the Buggers and blazes a trail for Shadow of the Hegemon. One note of caution: While Ender's Shadow is worth the read in its own right I would still recommend that readers new to Ender's universe read Ender's Game first.	wonderful
Southern Comfort My Brother Michael is as delicious as a large glass of sweet tea on a hot Florida day!

Really Good Album! Soundgarden made a really good album here. A Follow Up to Badmofinger ( their contribution to the 1992's grunge phenomenon). This is a really good album. Production is good. the songs are good , Criss Cornell is one of the most gifted singer around. The lyrics are good and the blocket and the whole cd is nice. Not a single filler and a fabolous album. I recomend this to anyone who are tired of all the [bad] that is in the music today and for any music fans. thank you	wonderful
top 10 cd for 03 There was once a band called 'THAT DOG'.. who's first album was a strange child.. It was beautiful, yet difficult to love.. Some years later 'THAT DOG' released their third (and final) album 'RETREAT FROM THE SUN'. It was (not to put to finer point on it...) PERFECT. Then they split up (I blame their wicked stepmother 'GEFFEN RECORDS'). Anyhoo, I happened acrossSUPERCHIC(K) when I was browsing someones top ten girl band albums on AMAZON and gave them a listen. They embody the spirit of THAT DOG and blend it with the experimentation of ANI DiFRANCO and the disco charm of DEE-LITE.. In short, this band are a breath of fresh air to jaded ears, and this is an essential album for anyone with eclectic tastes.	wonderful
Looking for quality sound? Sounds terrific! I purchased it based on the reviews. I must say it exceeded my expectations. I've owned my share of portable radios and the RF-SW50 has by far the best quality sound. You will want to replace the headset with one that is more comfortable, but the radio is worth it.	wonderful

Let's Hear It For Healthy Play Food! I was so excited to see these at our Play Group - after finding nothing but milkshakes and cheeseburgers and ice cream cone clones at the store, finally some healthy play food! All the kids at Play Group love this set, and I know my daughter will be very excited to get it as a gift. It's very well made, sturdy and rich-looking, as others have said. No cardboard to rip, plastic to dent or flimsy metal to break and scratch little fingers.Cutting the "carrots" and "cucumber" has made my daughter want to eat more vegetables at dinner, and she's also learning how to hold and use a knife safely! Great set, great quality and great price.	wonderful
Held her attention After bringing my daughter home and she was no longer on the bili blanket. She would not lie on her back for very long without fussing. Then I put her on this playmat one day and guess what? She laid on it for the longest time staring at the toys above her. She is just about 4 months now and loves this toy. I don't understand it but it is great for her.	wonderful
Excellent If you are a fan of Barenaked Ladies, this DVD is for you!! It will feature 17 BNL videos along with 7 clips from a recent live show. It will also feature a hilarious commentary by the band and a "One Week" karoake singalong feature. I can't wait!!	wonderful
Huge Crate! I recently purchased the 42x28x30 crate for my 4 month old German Shepherd. He was quickly growing out of his smaller crate as he is already over forty pounds. I was unsure before ordering whether this would be a sufficiently sized crate for my dog when he is mature. I will tell you we joking call this his condo because it is huge. I am 5'3" and 110 lbs. and me and my dog could fit in this crate (we actually did lol!). Plus the free divider makes it great as a training crate. If you are considering a crate for a large breed dog like a German Shepherd, this is a great crate for your dog. It is also very sturdy and easy to set up. I am so happy that I saved money and got a great crate!	wonderful

An excellant, must have cd for any Mariah Carey fan! With 13 #1 singles under her wing, it was only fitting that Mariah released them all on one disc. They compilation is awesome, how can one go wrong when putting 13 chart toppers together? The four new songs, Sweetheart, When You Believe, Whenevere You Call, and I Still Believe are just as good. I Still Believe is the best of the 4 new ones. Mariah sings so much better alone then with other artists. Her voice is as powerful as ever and she puts her all into I Still Believe. Mariah is one of the best singers of her time and a cd like this allows you to listen to all the favorites on one disc. But don't call this a greatest hits, because it is not that at all...ask Mariah herself!! These are just the number ones according to the general public and Billboard, her greatest hits...now that is a cd to wait for !!!	wonderful
When it's time to "be a better friend to yourself," read this book I friend recommended this to me. Now, through understanding the issues associated with drinking this book will help me improve the rest of my life. Buy it, read it and recommend it to others you care about.	wonderful
i love it, i love it. It is indeed a cruel mix of Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Dino Crisis and a lil bit of soap opera altogether in one thrilling show.I have noticed a lot, the fact that they used multiracial people to be in this show, allows a lot of other races to be interested in watching it, and thats such creative genius!I love Naveen Andrews!!! Since I saw him in Mira Nair's Kama Sutra I always have loved him, but now everybody else can see his acting prowess as well as his chiseled abs! Maggie Grace is also very beautiful. Emilie de Ravin, who plays Claire, is not only beautiful, she can actually act!I used to think this show was just plain weird. Now I am hooked on the season 1 box seat and I am too embarassed to admit I only have been watching it 2 days ago!!! Dont take my word for it, though!Yoon Jin Kim, who plays Sun, gives great performance as well.	wonderful
How can you not like Mark Twain quotes? Great book, lots of fun. Most fun is the actual truth that is spoken throughout. Some of the quotes make you think, others just make you laugh. Personally, this little book helps brighten an otherwise junky day......Being a Twain fan I cannot help but toot the horn for this book. It's worthy.	wonderful
Nice They work really well. I should have bought two of them. They are great for watching movies and not disturb others.	wonderful

Jazz it up Songs you recognise and songs you don't, you will love them all. Lounge around listening to the more laid back tracks or jazz yourself up with the funkier numbers. Whatever your mood there is something to listen to on this album especially the singing voice of CT Apple.	wonderful

Underrated Hard to tell you how good this album is. Its raw, emotional and unconventional. Nevermind is nearly perfect and maybe their best album, but In Utero is probably the record Cobain wanted to make.	wonderful

Arilyn at its best again After already reading Daughter of the Drow, Evermeet,Elfsong and Elfshadow, I hungrily took up this book to read further on in the intriguing story of elves on Faerun. And I enjoyed it every bit. Discovering more truths about the elven culture and history and a new tribe of elves--the wild forest elves- all of this and more you can find in this book,	wonderful

Absolutely "brilliant" target. I used this target while laying out the foundation for a barn I am building in the high country of New Mexico. The target was brilliantly visible even in the fierce light of the noon-day sun.	wonderful
An irresistible historical fiction I'm an avid armchair space- and time-traveler, and this book whizzed me away and made me want to stay there until I was done. The sights, smells, sounds, and textures of pristine, rural Appalachia are powerfully evoked in this brilliant first novel, which also happens to have a creative and compelling plot.I heartily disagree with the reader who found the speech of the characters contrived; don't/didn't people in different places and times speak differently than we do? I found the dialogue to mirror the psychological portraits that were painted of the characters - women who, for example, said "hush now" and nurtured men who, by modern definitions, tried to rape them. I very much enjoyed this book's exploration of morality, religion, spirituality, societal roles and expectations of women, midwives' roles in and attitudes towards women's health and birth in that time and place. This is a wonderful book on so many levels.	wonderful
great book a must for young kids. A classic story which all youngsters should have in their library. Good art to go w/ the story	wonderful
Prepare to subordinate all else to the reading of this book. The weekend was a pleasant disaster. I made only one mistake. I took "The Price of Honor" with me and my wife on an out-of-towner, and for once in my life, she came in second. I simply could not put it down. Col. Hackworth is the heir apparent to Tom Clancy, the mantle fitting so much better because of Hack's credibility as a warrior. Only a man who has walked on the thin edge of life and death, known the love of soldiers, and who has ultimately received from his experiences "beauty for ashes" could write such a tale. Captain Sandy Caine leads the ghost of his warrior father from the ignominy of official disgrace to the honor of moral victory, on the way paying a price that allowed not only the martial spirit of the Caine generations to rest, but his human spirit to be healed by the love of a woman. Once started, you won't be able to put it down.	wonderful
Inexpensive, easy to use--love it!!! I wanted a simple, inexpensive digital alarm clock and this one is perfect. It is easy to set up, easy to use, big numbers are easy to read. Travels great. I actually keep it on my desk when not traveling to track another time zone for work. I'm totally satisfied.	wonderful
IF YOU HATE EITHER/OR QUESTIONS Many of the clients I work with are Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to pick just one.) They hate having to choose because picking one thing means giving up a whole bunch of others. For this reason, they hate taking the standard Myers'Briggs test where the choice is either this or that. Tieger's book avoids that problem by skipping the either/or questions and letting readers place themselves somewhere on a continuum in each area. This makes so much more sense and makes such a difference!	wonderful
grim masterpiece of characters The different chapters penned by the strong characters of the novel works to bring their personalities to life in this rich story about a rural family burying one of their own, and getting on with their lives.... one of my favorite books!	wonderful
Getting the feeling just righ Be dumped by your woman through seven years, get drunk, and stay drunk - for about three weeks, wake up and play 'Drive-in Movie'. It gets the feeling just right. Makes me wanna go way up in the mountains, bring my cd-player and just listen, just feel. Eaglesmith's voice is rough as rocks, and fragile as men's hearts. The 'backing' by W.P.Bennett (Juno this year) and R.Schipper is great as always, and D.Pendrith's bassplay and P. Vonalthen's drumming is solid work. Still, and again, it's the feeling of the record that gets to you. The feeling only an Fred Eaglesmith album can bring to life. His ability to write great songs and produce great albums (co-produced by Scott Merritt) is about to be widely known. His lyrics is down to earth, white-thrash kinda beautiful statements on trains and cars and relationships and, well; life. To bad its only 35 min. It's simply a great album. Go buy.	wonderful
great sweat pants I have purchased multiple pairs of these sweat pants. They have a much better construction than most other comparable products. Are very comfortable. As a warning, if you have some one special living with you, I would suggest purchasing at least 2 pairs. My fiancee is constantly stealing mine. Sadly I have noticed 2 problems with these sweat pants, first: when buying, purchase one size larger than you think you need as they will shrink some when they are first washed. This can cause problems if the pair you bought "just" fits. The first pair i got rode up my legs more than I like after the first wash. But if you get one size larger when buying it will counteract this small flaw. Second: the Drawstring ties do not like to hold there knot and come undone all the time. Add an extra knot and this also is easily fixed.All in all, the best sweat pants i have ever gotten, and I will undoubtedly be getting more in the future.	wonderful
an amazing coffee maker for making one cup at a time, this little guy can't be beat. impressively simple design, easy to clean, makes a terrific cup of coffee. One tip: since you're making only one cup, I'd recommend you pre-heat your mug before preparing your coffee, to prevent the coffee from cooling down too much.	wonderful
