Lack of originality, yeah... It sounds the same from the beginning to the end... Furious, noisy, without a break. In my opinion a true black metal album must have instrumentals and more of an ambient sound. It must sound mysterious, dark and gloomy. This one fails at this point. The music is boring, and besides, there's a bit of techno in it, specially in the first song. It could perfectly fit in a rave party.... Good black metal bands are Gehenna, Arcturus and early Dimmu. Cradle is also great, despite it's not actually black metal...	middle
This book needs to stop being reprinted The basic information and concepts are good but...This book is seemingly out of date. It keeps referring to Netscape 1 for goodness sakes! The example pictures make it clear how outdated this book is. In such a fast changing environment, looking at these examples was a big turn off!But I suppose the information is not completely outdated. There's not much to CGI, so I guess it doesn't really change. Still there are better books out there	middle
Alright. Although this boardbook had many pages to it, the pictures were not varied enough to be very interesting. Basically, this little boy carries a book around with him for the entire day. Each page show him doing something different with the book against a gradient colored background. And, there is a cat that comes and goes through the story. Not much more to say.	middle
TELECOM Engineer...To complex!! NOT practical. My teacher at Georgia Tech said.."this is like the bible of digital communication"..and certainly it is like the bible, confusing and too complex. Theory wise, OK it serves well, but as a reference for practice..get Lee and Messerchmitt!!	middle
Good but no where near 5 stars I read this book while at the beach for week. It was a perfect backdrop for a book about incest,poronography,necrophilia,snuff films, murder and hollywood!!! Why was it perfect, well because if I was anywhere else other than the beach I probably would've been depressed to no end. The Shock value of the book ends about halfway after the reader realizes that no character in this book is immune to the seedy undergound life of Hollywood and that really you should expect anything to happen. There's no bright light at the end or anywhere in this story. The main character is driven by desire to be famous, not the death of his girlfriend. He's also one of the sickest people you would ever read about.After awhile you start questioning the dark actions of every character and start to feel like the author is forcing the material to be dark instead of letting the characters and plot grow on their own.This book is worth 3 but not 5 stars.	middle
This album is solid, and MxPx is awesome! Hey all, this CD, by one of my fave bands, MxPx, is pretty good. Even though there are about half-and-half good and bad songs, the good ones are so good they weigh out the bad. If you like MxPx, you should get this album, it's solid, with awesome songs, and some weak ones. Best 4 tracks:1,2,16,27. This is good, but Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo is better.	middle
Useful It is very cute, the only negative point is that is not a true timex watch, but it is very useful.	middle
Movie Is Great, DVD - Questionable. I love this movie. The comedy may be getting a little dated these days, but 'tis still great. I had been trying to get a copy on videotape for years, but now that it is available on DVD I was super pleased!The actual DVD however is kind of a let down. It's great to see the trailer. And the menus are nice. But I suppose I was looking for a little bit more in regards to a wider screen, but it's just set to normal full screen. Still a great classic for the collection if you like these kinds of flicks.	middle
Just another Bourne movie I expected some kind of twist or something interesting to grab the attention. Unfortunately, it was pretty much the same old movie.	middle
A Fun Mystery This would probably be a good book for someone about 10 to 12 years old. I liked it when I was young. The heroine, Katie, is desperate to earn some money to buy Christmas presents for her family and friends, so she takes a baby-sitting job with a family living on her street. During the course of the evening, she discovers that some of her employer's jewelry is missing. It isn't certain exactly when it disappeared since several strange things happened that evening. The owner of the jewelry doesn't blame her for the theft, but an obnoxious girl who lives nearby starts spreading rumors that Katie is guilty. To save her reputation, Katie sets out to find the missing jewelry and the person who took it.	middle
Interesting Introduction After seeing Squeeze in concert this past summer I realized I knew almost nothing about the inception of this band or the lives of its founders Glenn Tilbrook & Chris Difford.

VERY STRANGE AND ANNOYING LITTLE BIT WELL THIS IS A STRANGE AND ANNOYING MOVIE THE MUSIC IS ALWAYS NEARLY THE SAME IT LOOK LIKE A FIRST MOVIE FROM THE DIRECTORWELL I ENJOY IT OK BUT THE MOVIE LAST 70 MINUTES AND IT WAS A BIT LONG TO WATCHI THINK THE FILMAKER DON'T LIKE BABYS SO MUCH AND HAVE A PROBLEME WITH THE PREGNANT LADY AND BIRTHSO WHAT CAN I TELL YOU MORE I LIKED IT BUT?????	middle
INTERESTING EVOLUTION OF VAMPIRE SOCIETY--SAME OLD CORPORATE SOCIETY Vampires live in a world where they are the majority and humans are the minority. Humans are captives and are, basically, farmed and "milked" for their blood. But the blood supply is threatened because of human population decline. Ethan Hawke is a vampire scientist researching a "cure" for this blood supply shortage--artificial blood. But an inexpensive, easily accessible supply of blood threatens corporate interests. Sound familiar?I can only give this movie 3 stars. I liked watching it, but I wouldn't watch it again. It was just OK.	middle
Excellent movie; Horrible DVD transfer I first saw this movie in the early 80's and again several times over the years. This version definitely does not resemble what I saw back then. As other reviewers have noted, the picture is almost milky white making it very difficult to view most of the time. Also, the audio is so muffled that I had to turn my TV volume way up just to try to make out the dialogue. Some of the time, I completely missed what was being said. If it weren't for the disappointing transfer, I would not hesitate to give this movie 5 stars. Great performances were given by all, but I feel Bette Davis provided her fans with a memorable performance as only she can do.	middle
Crown? Others warned about the "screw in crown", but I ordeered on the positive information. My watch looks good and the weight is fine. After I recieved the watch I had to set the time and discovered the crown would not screw back "in" to operate in the normal manner. Maybe it will work after I leave it for a day or two. The crown is a pain as others have said.	middle
Very captivating Was not sure if I would like this because of it being only one person doing the whole show. I was very surprised because Dean Jones did an excellent job in telling John's story and the story of Christ. He did several voices and made you laugh and cry. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves live stage performances and is interested in finding out more about Christ. This performance really makes you wonder: if you are one of Christ's followers, could you endure the hardships that the apostles went through and still not deny Christ?!	wonderful
this album rocks this album is really good. daveys voice is so amazing his lyrics are chilling. i think everyone should go buy this album. their music is really inspiring. one of the best bands ive ever heard..up there with BAD RELIGION..	wonderful
Wonderful This is a great stethoscope and blood pressure cuff. Seemes to be very good quality. I have duchenne muscular dystrophy is hard for my nurse to hear for my blood pressure because of weakening heart and this stethoscope picks up everything. The book pressure cuff is accurate as it was exactly or within a point of my automatic blood pressure cuff. I got this one as a backup.It is in my favorite color of orange although I don't know why they show a blue one. Throws you off after a little bit you see it says orange. I guess they have many other colors, but be careful don't just go by the picture.	wonderful
Awesome!!!! This is the best Bible I have ever had. It makes it so much easier to understand the NIV version when translated into modern language! Highly recommend it.	wonderful
I'm impressed I don't have perfect teeth. I've got pockets around the back molars but I just couldn't maneuver the floss into thse areas effectively. I tried the plastic wedges and they help the outside pockets not the inside ones but I was still just barely breaking even with six month check-ups.I have switched to the Reach flosser with snap-on heads and this thing is really great. I can easily reach all the pockets even behind the back molars. My most recent dentist visit was the first positive experience I have had at the dentist in some time. I'm never going to have perfect teeth but perhaps now I can expect to keep the ones I have for a very long time.	wonderful

Consumed by the Crush I knew, I KNEW, when I first heard Trevor Hurst's voice, that I had to hear more from this guy. His voice had such a clarity about it that I really listened to what he was saying. He sings his emotions with words, and just the right amount of VOICE CONTROL! The music is just, well, it intoxicates me. Don't take this CD away!	wonderful
just what i wanted Perfect book for a 9 yr old. Faced with the beginning of changes I decided to buy for my daughter. She really loves it and it doesn't focus too much on the menstrual cycle and instead focuses on total body care. Very age appropriate!	wonderful
I Love this Video!! I love this video, I use it with hit the spot abs. It gives you one low impact video of fun things like cha/chas. then when I got a little more in shape I started alternating between the first and second part. a 20 min fat blaster. 3min intense areobics and 1 min weights toning. the minibursts kept me going. Plus she smiles and encourages you all the way through...cheesy, yes, but for people like me, I'd rather think they are having fun, than watching some of those videos that try to look intense. This is a great video. worth the money.	wonderful
A beautiful book but not his complete work It's a beautiful book but I would have liked to see all of his work and not just a small part of it. The book could have showed more of his earlier work, like "The Family Tree" and a few other that were very successful paintins and sold out as print. I had to buy the book "Song of Creation" to see 15 of the paintings that were missing in that book.For the fan of Carl Brenders, this book is a must although it is not complete. I hope he will eventualy publish a book with full reference to his work and in larger size. I don't mind if it would cost 100$ or more.	wonderful

The Real Deal! Ursula Rucker is what she proclaims ...SUPA. If you never heard her on the Roots albums as a guest poet then surely you are at a loss. This is her first album and it can be put in one category--Soulful! She tackles everything as far as subject from growing up in Philly to how people get caught-up in the digital world. The tracks are fantastic...Jazz, Funk, Hip Hop, Soul, and even drum and bass. Her delivery and style are one of a kind, the kind that once you hear it, your hooked! On top of that, she is very deep and her stuff usually has multiple meanings. Go Get The Album!	wonderful
A Great Read About Mountain Gorillas and Life in Uganda This is a great book. Written in a clear, easy-to-read style the author does a great job of weaving together descriptions of the mountain gorillas in Bwindi National Park with descriptions of the Uganda people and their culture, the politics and history of the country and other aspects of his experiences there. If you are looking for a book with detailed, scientifically-oriented analysis of the mountain gorillas, this is not the book for you, nor is this the book for you if you are looking for great color photographs of the animals and the country (he only has black and white photos of so-so quality). But, if what you are looking for is a book that allows you to learn about a variety of aspects of life in Uganda, its people and the gorillas this is a great choice. It would be the perfect book to read prior to a trip to the region to see the park and its gorilla population.	wonderful

Excellent Performance Bear in mind I purchased the Philips specifically for HD reception. I had a RCA 25dB antenna before I purchased the Philips 50dB. What an amazing difference. With the RCA, every time a car passed by my picture froze or was lost, and I was only able to get two HD stations that were iffy. Once I flipped the power switch of my new Philips on, I flipped. I now get five HD channels with solid results. I also suggest going to the antenna website Philips suggests in their literature. Plug in your zip code and it shows you a map of where the transmission towers are located in relation to your home. It takes the guesswork out of positioning your antenna. Two friends of mine ran out and bought the Philips after seeing the results I had. They were with me when I set it up. They both achieved the same great results as I did.	wonderful
Something missing The case is great, but as someone else mentioned there is no strap. That is big draw back when carrying the camera.	good

A Classic !! Well, I just read that MGM is issuing a special editon of this DVD. I hope they improve the sound as the sound of the first DVD is lame. Its 1999 sequel (The Rage Carrie 2) has a super Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. Anyway this DVD's picture quality is good. Bright and sharp. You won't notice this is a 1976 movie. You should know the story by now. About a nerdy high school student played by Sissy Spacek who has telekinetic power. And things turn deadly as the other students make fun on her during prom night. John Travolta, Nancy allen and Amy Irving Co star. Brian De Palma reunited Travolta and Allen 3 years later in Blow out that is coming soon on DVD as well.	good

Book Review Our book club just read and reviewed this book. What an interesting story. We all loved Rosie and were genuinely amazed at who killed one of the main characters. It was presented one way at the onset of the book and then a surprise unraveling at the end. This book made for a very good book review at our last meeting. Passing it along to friends.	good
Old Belilevers The Times of London has a story on the Old Believers of Buryatia in the February 21, 2001 edition. If you have read this book, you will find the story interesting. I thought this was a great book, and gave me better understanding of the underlying causes of the dislike of America in the Eastern European countries today. In Lingua Franca magazine of March 2001 is the story of how Bulgarian Jews were saved in WWII.	good
Its OK Difficult to tell if the batteries are running down on the flashlight is malfunctioning. Turns out that batteries that came in the pack were nearly dead upon arrival.

Good for carrying camera for long times This strap helps a lot when you'll be carrying a heavy camera for longer periods of time. It definitely is a better choice than the stock strap that came with my camera.I don't do much tripod shooting, but I can see that it would not be a great choice for those who do--the part of the strap that remains attached to the camera when you take off the neck strap is long enough to be a bother on a tripod.I am hoping the strap will get more comfortable with use because the padded area that falls along my neck is quite stiff and doesn't conform to my neck as well as I'd hoped. I do think it'll break in over time, though obviously I can't be certain of that yet.	good

Niiiiiice Light weight and cool to wear. Seals out the light better than most, and its good if having something right up against your eyelids bothers you - you can even blink unobstructedly if ya want. Still, my eye sockets are very hard to seal and its not as good as my tempurpedic which molds better to my steep socket/nose curves. Tempurpedic however is very bulky, which not only makes travel less convenient but also makes it less comfortable when pressure from pillow. I use this one for travel and tempurpedic at home.	good
shades of twilight being a twilight fan, and an ardent lover of vampires,werewolves,and anything that goes bump in the night. i appreciate a good movie in that genre. this is a light version of Twilight, and certainly not Carpenters vampires. i enjoyed it, it did catch and keep my interest. i find the little twists that will lead up and onward fun.the cemetary and diary is good and different. although the fog is a little hokey. who knows it may get better as it goes along. i like the fact that it is nt filled with screaming and yelling.i will tune in again.	good
Great product I have had my rocket pod since Aug 2003, granted its only 120GB and at that time you were paying over one dollar per GB. The fact that I ran this almost 24/7 or at least 15/7, since 2003 without any issues. I have never lost data and the file transfer speed is still the same.Only issue now is that its filled with dust over the years and have no way of getting it open to clean it out so the fan isn't so loud.	good
a great party book the short test in the book kept us in hysterics. this a great way to get a large group arguing. All in all, the book is illuminating and fun. We almost all loved it.	good
breathe easy I purchased one and liked it so much, I got another. I use them in bedroom and home office during my allergy season in the spring. Had an old Honeywell round HEPA media type filter, which was loud and blew the dust off the floor. I noticed a big improvement in air quality. Maybe the old one needed a new filter or maybe the new one has a better filter technology. The tower configuration circulates room air smoothly without blowing everything off the floor. The squirrel cage fans in this new one are quiet and vibration free. Direction oscillation is good for cooling at night.	good

BUY HARPO SPEAKS INSTEAD!!! I loved the book Harpo Speaks so very much -- I've bought it for birthday presents for 2 different people so far. It's one of my top 10 favorite books. The first 80 - 100 pages are a little slow but after that? It takes off at a gallop and reads like fantastic fiction -- drama and comedy and heart -- and all of it actually happened! Well, out of love for this book, I wanted anything else by Harpo Marx and Rowland Barber and bought this book without much thought. Or research. And found, much to my chagrin, just like a previous reviewer noted, it's just THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS OF HARPO SPEAKS!!! NOTHING NEW!!! I reiterate: BUY HARPO SPEAKS INSTEAD!!!	terrible
A perversion of the meaning of Passover This is one of the most twisted concepts I have ever seen relating to Jewish Holidays. Passover is a celebration of the miraculous escape from bondage by the Jewish people. By combining that meaning with the authors views of social problems is to blaspheme the word of G-d. This book does not deserve to be called an Hagaddah.	terrible
Terribly designed What were they thinking? Did they never actually TRY these utensils out after making them? The handles are so heavy that they constantly tip out of the pans if you tap them at all.	terrible
Illogical The book is not convincing.No one disputes that some Catholics have engaged in anti-Semitic activities, just as no one disputes that there are Catholics who have lied, stolen, cheated, procured abortions, and committeed armed robbery. How could it be otherwise in such a huge religion?The question is: did these people commit such crimes because of their church's doctrine or in spite of it? Carroll seems incapable of dealing with the issue. To insinuate that somehow this violence was the product of church teaching, he has to do incredible violence to the evidence. He simply ignores many clear papal condemnations of anti-Semitism: the encyclicals of Pius XI, the radio addresses and well-publicized diplomatic protests of Pius XII against anti-Semitic laws, the many statements by medieval and Renaissance categorically condemning the anti-Semitic violence committed by bogus Christians of the period.This is country-club anti-Catholicism disguised as history.	terrible

This book is a pack of lies!! This book is a pack of lies would have given it 0 stars if could. Harry Potter teaches children to stand up to your friends and to respect the other person no metter where she or he came from , what religion they have ,or what they read.Actually I can only quote a good friend of mine "False faith and witch fear work are things, which harm us more then any occult. The fubndamentalist church builds its power on lies! What became of the rock, on which Jesus wanted to establish its church? A rotten bit stone? If the faith will be kept upright by lies only, then it is more worth nothing.The burning of books makes this statement een more evident.We can not live in the 2nd century anymore we as human being have to progress.	terrible
Shallow sequel Homely Estefan is a weak vocalist with no talent to speak of. She can't dance, she can't sing well, and she's nothing to look at. She and J-Lo are the worst examples of modern "superstars". They both get by on the flimsiest of talent. In J-Lo's case, it's her artifically pumped up rear end. Anyway, here we have a bunch of vacuous non-songs, even worse than the first volume. At least that had one decent tune, "Words Get in the Way". This doesn't even have that many good songs. And what's this retread of "Conga" doing here? Yuck! It was bad enough in the original version. My true rating: ZERO STARS.	terrible
SO FRIGGIN' BAD. This movie was terrible and I really couldn't wait for it to end. I'm glad I did watch until the end though, for the final scenes of the movie were the most powerful and tragic. The rest of the film was just a terrible buildup with dialogue that could easily inspire auditory bleeding to a less desensitized person than myself. Terrible. Almost as bad as Edmund.	terrible

Wrong Choice This had quite a disappointing plot. Although in the start it seemed like it could get somewhere, upon reaching the end of the novel, there was really no personal character development WHATSOEVER on Hatsumi OR Ryoki's part. This story just displays how Ryoki USES Hatsumi. Personally, if I were the author, I would have made Hatsumi end up with Shinogu, who is a much better ideal. It seems completely unlikely that Hatsumi would choose an immature brat like Ryoki. Also, Hatsumi herself is not a good example setter for teens who read this novel. She has no self confidence at all and allows herself to be bossed around by anyone and everyone. All in all, this novel COULD HAVE gone somewhere but in the end it was a complete waste of time.	bad
Disappointing The opening few minutes seem promising, but the video quickly declines into either uninteresting and overlong shots from train windows or story lines drawn out longer than interest justifies. What we are left with is basically a home movie, although of professional quality, centred on a limited group of characters in the countryside. It would have been far more interesting if the producers had widened the scope to take in more people and places in the regions covered.	bad
For Some Women... I finally realized that this book appeals to a small segment of women who have had great difficulty in achieving meaningful relationships with men. Of the few women I know who like this book, not a one of them has ever had an intimate and good relationship with a man (or, actually, with a woman). Anita Liberty must be the same kind of woman, which I find sad. Hell, if it makes some people happy, then I give it two stars.	bad
Comes with starter toner cartridges. Something you should also consider when buying this is that it comes with the starter toner cartridges which have half the toner of the ones you normally buy. These toner cartridges go for around $130.00+ a piece (they have 4 seperate cartridges in each printer, black, cyan, magenta, blue, for a total of around 400.00+ more if you need all 4) so in a short period of time you will be spending hundreds of dollars more on this printer.Brother should have the full toner cartridges in this unit when you purchase it.	bad

Castle does not foam. This castle does not foam and the picture on the box is very misleading. If you continually pump the button, a small amount of foam will appear just above the bubble reservoir, but that's all, folks. Also, the pieces are all removable (read: you're going to lose them). My 3-yr-old played with this toy in the bath for an hour, so it does have some appeal, but the fact that it doesn't foam has me very aggravated. It's also ugly.	bad
Works but keep the water pressure down I love the compact case for my RV. If you are not VERY attention and allow higher pressure to be used, this hose starts splitting along the seam, starting with pin holes and eventually lots of seam failure holes. I am buying another one, because it is approved for drinking water, but if I found one that fixed the seam problems, I would jump ship.	bad
poor design Cushion is very firm. It supports my 215 lbs very well. However the edges around the cut out are very rigid and firm. Makes my buttocks very sore where it contacts the edges.

could be better As far as size goes they are pretty close just a touch small but overall a good fit.HOWEVER they will not last if you do any kind of real work with them after just 2 days using them they began to come apart at the seam.

whispernet-silentnet Could not register Kindle from my home, despite being in the good area on the amazon coverage map. Upon calling help line, they explain that ATT is the service they use.

One of the all-time riddims..... .....but these are not the all-time great versions, with the exception of "Bam Bam". Some great voicings (Marcia Griffiths, Sizzla, Sister Nancy) but the recut version of the riddim is cheap and...none of what makes it so exciting. The megamix is a gimmick and is, frankly, just plain horrible. If you want a kicking update of stalag/stagalag/whatever you call it, check out "Stalag The Next Generation 20, 21, 22". ...	bad
needs some design changes This thing only works when used on a hard surface, and you have to hit the sensors against the ground pretty hard to register the input. Harder than my child could make the sensors hit the ground reliably in fact. In order to make it any fun for her, I had to glue plastic bumpers to the sensors on the bottom so that the sensor gets pushed further into the board with less force required, meaning that even a gentle tap on the sensor registers the hit, and I had to put it on a hard board on the carpet. Using it on our hardwoods actually DAMAGED the floors. So what you've got here is a toy that's supposed to teach kids to balance, but requires that they SLAM the sensors down, and requires that they learn on a hard surface like concrete, unless you do what I've done to it. It's a good idea for a toy, but a poor implimentation.	bad
Great price but bad video I did a lot of price comparison and this trampoline was by far the best one with a handle for the best price!!! What I didn't like was that the DVD that comes with it does not use the handle at all. In fact, the woman doesn't even have hers attached! I could have figured out all of the different ways to jump around on my own. What I wanted to learn was different ways to incorporate the balance bar. Oh well, now I just have to order a seperate DVD from someone else.	bad
