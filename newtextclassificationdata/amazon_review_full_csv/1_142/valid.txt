A So-So Book, But Not Bad At All This book would be perfect for a college student on a tight budget who will, generally, eat anything. I give it three stars for the attention to budget, the simplicity of the presentation, and the pictures that show the guy or girl not used to the kitchen what things "look" like. It's really very, very user-friendly. It's also solidly constructed and laminated, so it's kitchen-accident friendly as well.The problem is that many of the recipies look - well - really gross. And I am sorry, but even the most ravenous would probably think twice about anything made with Spaghetti-Os that bears more than a passing resemblance to a botched autopsy.Great for the college student or the single person "on the go" who is not nit-picky about their food. Otherwise, pass.No firm recommendation one way or the other.	middle
Techni Ice---Works The Techni Ice works if coolers kept closed. I had my last over 20 hours that in a 7 day cooler. Only thing I didn't like was the contents inside that freezes in the pack. Leaves a slimy residue on the outside after you activate them.It stays on your hand and it's the consistency of squeezing a slug. Other than that it kept things frozen. I would probably lay down a towel under the packs so it doesn't get on food.	middle

Salty and chewy I saw the film some two decades ago, and I heard Bogart's voice every time Queeg opened his mouth. But this book is less like the film and more like the summarization of war (and my job in flight control at the airport)--long periods of leisurely description punctuated by brief explosions of action. Characters developed, their depths were plumbed, and then they transferred or got killed or were sent home.There's a long gentle arc to the story, for the most part, and the book is about Willie Keith's trajectory. I sometimes found myself tempted to flip ahead to see if anything started happening, but this was a well written book and if nothing else I know a lot more about the USN in WWII.	middle
Average rating, becuase... Lammle generalizes a great deal in this text. Yes, he covers the fundamentals, but fails to give more detail information concerning LAN design, LAN Switching, and WAN protocol compatibility.A text for beginners, but I would not rely on it alone for the examination...It is the details that will make you or break you on the exam...	middle
Pilot driving lights 509 These would be great lights if it were not for the small intense beam. Driving lights normally cast a spread beam of light that substitute the OEM headlights well. These lights have a very small bright beam, a beam associated more with a fog light instead of a driving light. Other than that, the lights look great and are made well. I prefer the plastic construction, since it cannot rust. These lights should be called fog lights instead of driving lights. So when buying, keep in mind what type of beam you desire. If it weren't for the small intense beam, I would have rated these lights as a five.	middle
Mediocre Plot with Little Speculative Fiction Die hard SCI-FI fans are going to be disappointed with this book because it's not about science fiction or fantasy. It's about relationships and a comming of age. This could easily have been set in medieval times, in an orphanage, in present day, or any other time period or place you can think of.The book is a good read, the same way that Harry Potter is a good read. Yes it is entertaining but does not scratch the surface to immerse you in the setting. For those of you who truly enjoy that sort of thing, I would recomend Dragon's Egg.OSC is one of my favorite authors because he does use relationships in his stories, I was just disapointed with this because his jaunt into sci-fi made it so obvious that he really should stay on the fantasy side with his Alvin Maker series.	middle
One works great, the other was worthless Quality control plagues this product. I've purchased two. One required new batteries every week and had to be consigned to the trash (one star!). The other has been running continuously in grueling heat and freezing cold for over a year without a battery change (five stars!).	middle
Good enough, just give it a tweak The design is great for safety and orderliness, but I found I had to remove the lock. The lock was difficult to open when my fingers were slightly wet and then the whole unit would slide around (while holding the blade in the other hand).

Don Williams - Anthology Great tracks! Of all the Don Williams CD's I have, this would be THE one I'd suggest for an all-in-one collection. Williams' mellow, gentlemanly tone is soothing to my country ears. The downside....once again here is a Don Williams CD without one of my favorites..."Yellow Moon". Have all the labels forgotten that fantastic tune? I'd sure like to know of any CD with that hit. I only have it on the old LP with that title track. This is why I've limited my rating.	middle

Daughter's Favorite Video My 18 month old daughter is obsessed with this movie. It is great because it holds her attention the entire time.

Every child should see THIS version!!! Robinson Crusoe is a timeless classic. I find this version to be among the best because of the underlying message that it conveys, "shed the restraints of civilization and return to your roots." It seems a great message for today's youth as our economy crumbles under the weight of commercialism and over indulgence. Steve Drexel (Douglas Fairbanks) sets off to recreate HIS civilization on a deserted island in the image of New York City. He faces several challenges, including an attack by natives from a neighboring island who are acting at the bequest of the rivals of Drexel. The lesson for the children takes a bit of a turn when Drexel escapes the island with a native women (Saturday played by Maria Alba) and returns to NYC with her on his yacht where she performs in the Ziegfeld Follies. An almost complete reversal from the original intention to escape the modern world, Mr. Robinson Crusoe brings the uncivilized back...Ironic...	wonderful
A karmic delight Everyday Karma was an enlightening and enjoyable read. The book was easy to follow and understand. Life is very complicated and full of difficulties for the average person but Everyday Karma simplifies it all. Dr. Carmen Harra explaines the depth and value of a person's actions and reactions. Even the most insignificant action can create karmic instability. She also stresses the importance of karmic resolution and has creates a system to do so. Every chapter of this book leaves the reader enlightened and pondering the importance of life. It makes one want to be a better person. Definately a worth while read and a good book to have around for re-reading during difficult times.	wonderful

Addition Wrap-Ups a big hit at our house!! I bought a set of Addition Wrap-Up Keys for my homeschooled 5 yo daughter thinking that when she started to get into addition she might enjoy these more than workbook pages. As soon as I opened them she couldn't wait to try them. I briefly showed her how they work, and was amazed to see her pick up addition so quickly. Instead of using them to suplement her other math, I feel like we are using her other math to suplement the Wrap-Ups. I think this is a wonderful product. They are small, portable, self contained, and self correcting. They are great for using at home, in the car, the doctors office or to visit grandma. Right away, I bought the subraction set, and am planning to buy the others too, as soon as she is old enough to use them.	wonderful
yes, this is really the BEST cookbook ever When we lived in Philly, Frog, the Commisary, and Eden were definitely on our top 10 list. The recipes in this book bring that back for us every time. These recipes cannot be beat. My friends have been BEGGING for the recipes for years: eggplant capponata, carrot cake, chocolate killer cake-just to name a few. I am so glad to see this in print again so that we don't have to be tempted to photocopy.	wonderful
into the dark vaults we look... it seems i had been swimming in the rivers of shmutz for so long, i'd forgotten what a good horror film was..enter THE UNNAMBLE. They do not make them like this anymore. This film tells the sordid tale of a house that is inhabited by a wraith who doesn't take kindly to trespassers. Of course, local university students decide to spend some time in the home. Their visit is naturally cut short as the wraith seeks to punish the unwanted guests. The acting is above average. There is some real suspense here. And the gore! theres a throat ripping scene here second to none and its timing is perfect. The effects are solid. The plot is good. I have no clue whether the film was true to the lovecraft story it was supposedly based on but who really cares? If you have the chance to own this, buy it!	wonderful
Essential reading for Pinball Collectors, a MUST have! Well, I finally went ahead and took the plunge and got all 3 of the Pinball Compendium book. Sure, they're not exactly cheap, but I found the best price on them anywhere on Amazon. I have to tell you, these books are ESSENTIAL reading and must haves for anyone who collects pinball machines, or just interested in their history, and a pretty complete synopsis of all the major games put out by each of the major manufacturers, from the 30's all the way to just a few years ago. The books are very well laid out, packed with TONS of history of both the games evolution and of the manufacturers, interviews with the designers and artists, and TONS of pictures. Get the books for the pics if nothing else! Do yourself a favor and pick these up, you won't be disappointed! These are pretty much an Encyclopedia for pinball machines and collectors. Well worth the money, Highly recommended!Jeff ScottOrlando, FL	wonderful

U2 is finally back on track... Wow!!!! This is an awesome U2 CD. I still say that The Joshua Tree is the best U2 album ever, but this is a close second or third. Beautiful Day is an awesome song, and so is Walk On and Stuck in a Moment... . This is definitely worth buying. A big improvement over Achtung Baby and Pop, which was a decline in U2's greatness.

One of the BEST ! ! ! I've been selling off books from our library for five or six years now, you know, downsizing. This book is one of the ones that will never be sold. It is the perfect balance of hard science and emperical knowledge from our collective past. Its a serious read, at times some might find it a little dry, but its the science, myth, and history of trees. They have kept us alive on this planet for a very long time. This is written from the perspective of an herbalist.	wonderful
First Album For a band that really had no other electro-punk influences to draw from at the time of it's release, this album proves that they were WAY ahead of their time. Always minimalistic and staggering in its approach, the album's power derives mainly from trance-inducing and repetitive keyboards from Marty Rev and unpredictable, howling vocals from Alan Vega. Not bad sounds coming from what mainly started with a broken down Farfisa organ and cheap-o drum machine. And tracks like "Ghost Rider" and "Frankie Teardrop" have proved to be timeless and greatly influencial even by today's standards. The live tracks taken from different shows of the era only prove how often controversial and violent this kind of music was taking it's only influences from the doomed and claustrophobic climate of the late 1970's in NYC. HIGHLY recommended and a leader of the genre.	wonderful
Yes, you should step back from that ledge, my friend! This recording (which is also available under the title Conscious Relationships) can be hard to find, but is definitely worth the effort. I just wish I had heard it before I used that flamethrower on my late boyfriend... I read constantly, and on almost any topic, one result being a very low opinion of self-help books and even distant relations to the genre. This guy's recorded workshops are in a class by themselves, and his blend of eastern and western disciplines takes the whiney myopia out of psychotherapy and the self-righteousness out of religion. Maybe I'll wait a few more days before putting my head in the oven. He really is that good.PS - I very much like his laugh.	wonderful

Lots of fun, brace yourself for a learning curve This game is not for everyone. If you need to play a game where you know what you are doing after playing it for a few hours, this might not be for you.

Shop around I thought my grandaughter would love this as she goes to ballet and loves barbie dolls, but the price really put me off. However, if you have time then shop around. I looked on e-bay and eventually found this item,new, still in its box(unwanted childs present). My winning bid was under 10. Genevieve arrived in the post today. I unpacked her, bought cheap batteries at Tesco,and tried her out myself. Great fun and no problem with assembly. What a bargain!	good
Important and self-important Bloom's long, rambling discourse on Shakespeare's plays is sometimes insightful, often pompous, and always readable. His self-styled brand of criticism allows him to trumpet huge, occasionally fascinating propositions, without ever REALLY backing them up (except with various paraphrases of "Isn't this obvious?")...his title proposition is not the least of these ill-supported theses. He repeats himself to a ludicrous degree (we are afforded the same observations on Hamlet and Falstaff in just about every chapter in the book), and commits himself to writing entire chapters on plays that he seems willing to discard. Still, we feel throughout as if we are in the presence of a great mind and a piercing eye; Bloom's enthusiasm for these works is infectious. And he delivers courageous blows to a variety of pillars that are in need of some major re-evaluation. We have the sense, by the end, that this will stand as a hallmark of Shakespeare criticism for centuries to come.	good

No problems, 8 cupper Must have fixed flimsy filter foible, it looks to be well reinforced and has given no trouble. Easy to operate, filter and lid slide straight down with no hassle.

Seems like a fair deal to me.	good

This CD will change your perception of pop music. As others have, I first became acquainted with Akino Arai through her work on "Outlaw Star." She recorded both end themes, "Hiru no Tsuki" (Melfina's Theme) and "Tsuki no Ie." This is truly an album in the artistic sense. The theme is an exploration of the offerings on the radio dial, thus the selections are eclectic. However, whatever the musical style, all the cuts are done with the virtuosity, humor, refreshing intelligence, and enchantingly understated style for which Miss Arai is known. The entertainment value of this very enjoyable album has changed my perception of pop music. As performed by Akino Arai, "Koseki Radio" is a rare treat. (BTW, the tenth track is "Riskcaution Corporation.")	good
The only book that will help you on your journey to locs I give my review this title because i haven't seen any other book available that will help anyone thinking of locking their hair the way this one offers to. It took me a year or so to make my decision and this book is one of the reasons that helped carry me along in my journey. It dispells all misconceptions about locks..and theres nothing dreadful about our hair. Gives a brief history with pictures and all. If you're looking for the how-tos or any fashion aspect of locking hair then this book is not for you. Its about knowledge, acceptance and preparing yourself for the changes that will catapult you into your path. On my first visit, my loctician handed me this book and i was proud to say that i had already read it..(didnt say how many times) The only problem i had with the book is that it was too short. It left me wanting more, but then I suppose thats a good thing. My Thanks to Sister Evans!	good
Good But........ We have had this wagon for a year now. It is still wheeling along, but the paint is peeling off and there are a few spots of rust and the wooden stakes on the sides are almost off too. The review says not to use it for rocks and firewood because the rails are small. I would have to add to that list a 28 pound 2 year old that just can't sit still because that has made the wood railings come off also. I guess for one of their lower end wagons it was a good deal while it lasted but I am looking into a larger more comfortable one now. THe wheels on this one are quite small and hard to manuever unless you are on the street. (it is nearly impossible to get up and down off the sidewalk if there is no built in ramp) And don't even bother pulling it through grass. Spend the extra money and get one of the all terrain wheeled wagons.... it will be worth it!!	good
Classic Whistler This is an easy to use, quality-built, whistling tea kettle. I bought this for my mother-in-law, who has difficulty opening other brands' kettles, and tends to leave things on the stove too long. This one is easy: just pull the trigger and it is open for filling or pouring. There is no center opening to complicate matters or provide an opportunity to burn fingers or frustrate arthritic hands. The copper bottom transfers heat quickly so water boils before she forgets it is on. The whistle is a must. On that point, however, this whistle seems to fill up with water, instead of vapor, and spit as much as whistle. Thus, the 4 instead of 5-star rating. Strange, because we own a slightly smaller version which works perfectly.	good
Another hilarious book from Evanovich. Come on! How can you resist the stories of the female bounty hunter from Jersey? This time Stephanie Plum is after old man Eddie DeChooch and you just can't believe his luck and the trouble he has gotten himself into! Mooner and Dougie are back, as is Lula, Connie, Vinny, Grandma Mazur, the two men in Stephanie's life - Ranger and Joe Morelli, and Bob the dog who eats everything and poops in Stephanie's arch enemy Joyce Barnhardt's yard. This series is hilarious from the characters to the situations they find themselves in. Its action, comedy and mystery all wrapped up in a bright cover.Enjoy!	good
swampy Cajun fiddling This was a 1974 recording by the legendary Blues fiddle (Violin) player, but the emphasis on these songs was, as the album title suggests, the Bayou Cajun and Country sound. No city slicker licks on here, just pure down home fiddling and some songs that drift closer to traditional country. Gatemouth's singing may not set your world on fire, but his playing, and that by the other strong cast of musicians on here more than makes up for any vocal deficiencies. This CD edition also gives you 2 earlier recordings from 1972. My favorites are the songs with long instrumental passages such as "Gate's Express" (yes, he makes that fiddle hum like a train's a-comin') and "Cassoulet." 49 minutes of music, although nearly two minutes of that is devoted to "studio verbiage and other appropriate banter." Gotta like that sense of humor, too!	good

When it says FAMILY, it means FAMILY! I had hoped to be able to put my family history - that is to say, my mother, father, grandfathers, grandmothers, maybe even my brothers and their respective familes in this book. But I find they mean FAMILY - as in husband/wife and his/her genealogy, back to Adam/Eve if possible, it seems. This book is not for a beginner who does not have a sharp Exacto blade to take out the pages he/she does not want or need. A book with the graphs built into it, letting you do the labeling and assorting would've been better - at least it wouldn't assume a 1950s family....	terrible
If you Can't Discredit the Message - Attack the Messanger This poleminc is diatribe against the producer of the documentary - with only the option to go after a person like Michael Moore when they don't refute the elements of the movie which is motivating the origin of the book. Will the book change the reaction to the movie or any of Mike Moore's books...No, and will the movie change the outcome of the election. Too early to tell - but the movie will far outlast this flash-in-the-pan reaction book and it will filter to the bottom of the pile. More luck had they tried to make a documentary - unfortunately, no one would go to a documentary on Michael Moore where as we all would go to one on G. W. Bush. You are wasting bullets on a low-value target if you get my drift....	terrible
I used to hate this sorry game! Don't get me wrong...I absolutley LOVED the Sega CD.I thought it was the coolest thing ever at the time.There were also some really good FMV games out there for it too.Which alot of people hated...but I loved.Anyway.Sewer Shark was NOT one of those games that I enjoyed.This game totally sucked.And it was SO f-ing hard too.I couldn't even get passed the first level....or whatever it was.I would always crash EVERY...SINGLE...F-ING...TIME! No matter how hard I tried to avoid it.Ugh! This game was such a headache.Fortunatly,I didin't pay anything for it,because that was the game that came with the Sega CD console.I only wish they would have included a game that was actually PLAYABLE! Would have been bad ass if Sonic CD was the game that was included instead.By the way...The guy who plays in this game,is the same dude who does the voice for Solid Snake.	terrible
Learn To Embrace Silence I bought these ear buds as a replacement for my iPod in an airport where there was no selection, but I still regret buying them. They are extremely uncomfortable, and seem slightly larger than other ear buds. This means that not only do the foam pads slip off every time you take them off, but that they never really seat correctly in your ear, rendering them utterly useless for any kind of physical activity. I tried them on a treadmill, but got so frustrated with putting them back in every few seconds (literally) that I took them off and ran in silence for the next half hour. As soon as I got home from my trip I bought a pair of Sony ear buds, which I highly recommend.The sound quality is not great either, but that will be the least of your worries when you are trying to use these. I would avoid these ear buds at any cost, despite the appealing price.	terrible

Where's Tom Clancy and Who's This Guy I've been a big fan of Tom Clancy ever since Hunt For Red October and I have to say that this is by far his worst book ever. The plot was so predictable I knew the end before I'd gotten halfway thru. The characters are beginning to resemble cardboard cutouts, without anything to make them human. Maybe Tom just needs to take a break, much like he had Jack Ryan do between Sum Of All Fears and Debt Of Honor. A couple of years to recharge his mental batteries and regain his edge.	terrible
Good idea, appalling result Ms. Shaputis apparently assembled puff literature from 50 Chambers of Commerce around the country and repurposed it into a book. What you get is superficial, uncritical . . and wrong.The median house prices are years out of date. It is incorrect, for example, that half of the homes in Indianapolis or Bangor are less than $100,000, or that half the homes in Reno are less than $160,000 - figures contradicted by the National Association of Realtors quarterly reports on home sales.By the way, Bangor - in northern Maine - doesn't get 94 days of 90-degree weather reported in the book; more like 30.	terrible
Xtremely Overrated I heard this album about 2 weeks ago and I was very dissapointed. All of the beats xcept for Just A Lil Bit are WACK. 50's lyrics are horrible, he raps about the same stuff over and over.

Definitely disappointed This toaster worked okay - for less than a year-and-a-half. It just quit working without any kind of warning - no deterioration in its performance - it just stopped working. I know toasters are not known for their longevity, but I thought that spending a little more would guarantee at least a few years' of adequate performance. Unfortunately, this was not the case with this product. I am definitely disappointed in this toaster and will not purchase this model (or this brand) again.	terrible
Don't bother I was looking for a book that compared & constrasted all the different project management methodologies. According to the book's description & the feedback from the other readers, this was a very good book. I was alittle apprehensive about the book because of its age, but since the book dealt with methodologies & not the latest technology, I thought I should be ok. I was terribly mistaken. The book uses a very general tone & lacks all details. To compound the issue, the author writes about methodologies that aren't used & about methodologies that were never used. This book would have been a terrible book even when it was new. I've never been so mislead by other reviews in my life.	terrible
Non Slip? The chord is entirely too long for an active set of head phones. Who needs 4 foot total length. I'm not wearing my MP3 player on my ankle.

Other than the dazzling Tim Burton visuals, the most mesmerizing and alluring thing about "Big Fish's" TV trailer ad is the beautiful acoustic sound of the tune "Your Move" by YES. It moves the trailer along, and makes one really WANT to see what this is all about. And it shows (or so I thought) a refreshing awareness and enlightenment on the part of the film's "decision makers" about outstanding music from what is arguably the world's most accomplished and virtuoso band in existence today, YES. How in God's name, then, could the song not be included in the soundtrack CD?? This is an insult not only to YES, but to the viewers that are "drawn in" by the trailer they saw on TV, only to have the haunting music that attracted them in the first place omitted from the soundtrack! Instead, we get Eddie Vedder --- great.DON'T buy this CD!	bad
flawed premise The book context has some merit, but the basic premise is not substantiated. I don't find any merit to the claims of this book	bad
Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies not fluffy! I should have heeded the other reviews of this product. These socks are not the classic Gold Toe "Fluffies" that have been so hard to find in department stores these days. I have about 6 old pairs of them and they are practically threadbare. I have been needing to replace them, but cannot find "Fluffies" in white, and THESE ARE NOT THE SAME!!! Very disappointed, and I don't understand why Gold Toe does not make the Fluffies in white anymore. I have only seen them in tan in JC Penney, but that would not look right with sneakers. I guess my search must go on.	bad
Problems with the armband The armbands on these watches are not on hinged pins, but attached directly to the housing of the watch. That makes them prone to breakage, and when they break they are almost impossible to replace. I've found quite a few stores that sell Skagen watches but none that sell Skagen armbands. I've been told that I would have to send the watch in, which would take 4-6 weeks and cost more than half the original sale price of the watch. Great design, but I'm not going to buy another Skagen watch!	bad
FOR NON-FANS ONLY! This set has really good episodes but is strictly for non-fans. Why any true fan would buy it escapes me. Released as a tie-in to the 2009 movie, also strictly for non-fans.	bad
A bad movie that could have been good. There are certain rules to making a good movie. Rule number one clearly states do NOT cast Christopher Lambert. Putting the fact the he is a terrible actor aside, he is not Scottish. He does not even try to fake a Scottish accent in this movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is the strong story line. Unfortunately, poor acting and '80's movie syndrome kindof ruin it. It is good for a laugh though. If only it had been directed by a good director with a Scot cast aws the Scot and a Spaniard cast as the Spaniard...It would be nice to see a remake...	bad
Beware AMD X2 owners I bought this program when I bought my new Nikon D50 so I could catalog the NEF files. It worked wonderfully on my 5 year old system but it was a little on the slow side. I decided to buy a new computer. An incredibly fast AMD X2 processor with 2 GB of RAM and a great nVidia 3d graphics card. I loaded PSE4 and it would crash on me. In the Adobe user forums an Adobe representative confirmed that the problem was the AMD X2 processor. Now I'm waiting for a patch or a new version to fix the errors. I REALLY like this program when it works correctly.I would not hesitate to recommend this program to anyone who wants to catalog and edit pictures but does not want to step up to Photoshop CS2. However, I would recommend downloading the demo first and using it extensivly for the month of trial you get.	bad
Funny but not hilarious I enjoyed these seasons, but I didn't think either was as funny as the first season. Others will disagree, so maybe it's just not my thing. My advice is to enjoy the first season and stop there.	bad
unbearable vocals... I'll put this simply, wonderful drumming, great bleeps, awful vocals, i mean really awful, and mixed high. If you can get past the vocals, or remix the music without the vocals, you'll be well pleased.	bad
be very very careful- BAD editing, GREAT ideas! I am a working chef. I used this book a LOT during culinary school to get ideas.Great! Ideas!***LOUSY*** "editing".As several other have warned/mentioned- I honestly wonder if the author TRIED these recipes. example- the 'drunken peach trifle' recipe measurements need to be reworked.(I also remember a nightmare with a pie recipe but can't remember which one...the results were horrific)I have had simillar experiences with other books of hers...I truly love the series (the healthy cookbook is good as well as others in the series) but I can't believe the truly horrendous editing.Be warned- take the ideas and create your own...	bad
A hot and sweaty mess of a plot The plot is hard to follow, the characters are very unlikeable, John Cusack is made up to look really horrible, and Nicole Kidman is stimulating herself in front of his character--a killer who is in prison and with whom she has fallen in love. Or something. Got that? Nope, it's not so good at all. Too bad they wasted these actors along with Zac Efron and Matthew McConaughey.	bad
Confusing plot I have never read any of Wilcox's books before so I can't compare them. While he has an ear for dialogue, I kept getting lost in the plot and the relationship of the characters. I know this was supposed to be a funny book, but the protagonist was too much of a sad sack to invite any identification for the reader and the lines weren't snappy enough to get me laughing. Instead I felt sorry for "Lou" while not really liking her that much. I kept wanting to stop reading the book as it didn't seem to go anywhere in the plot. The ending confused me, as it did another reviewer. So my recommendation is pass on this one and try another of Wilcox, as the author seems to be quite popular.	bad
Boring! Wow, what a letdown! After reading 'Certain Prey', my first Sandford novel, I was hopeful that I would be equally impressed with the other books in the Davenport series. Unfortunately, 'Chosen Prey' was nothing like 'Certain Prey'. Gone was the instant deluge into the world of a ruthless killer. Instead, we get a white bread and mayonnaise, ho-hum serial killer, with whom even Davenport even seems bored to death (no pun intended). Talk about your lackluster antagonists! I hope I didn't waste my money on the other Sandford novels I've purchased.	bad
Not Demille's Best I love Demille's books, but this just wasn't one of his best. Wouldn't recommend to anyone but Viet Nam Vets or children of same.	bad
Good political satire While not as good as Gulivers Travels, this book is an excellent political/religous satirical work. It started out slowly but the strong satire comes through loud and clear.	bad
