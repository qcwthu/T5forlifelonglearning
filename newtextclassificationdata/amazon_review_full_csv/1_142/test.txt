Painful.. I'm a big fan of the series, and I was excited to read this book because I thought Dalamar was an interesting character and hoped that a good portion of the story would have to do with the time he spend in the Tower of High Sorcery with Raistlin (my favorite character). Unfortunately the book ends at the door to the tower. And getting there was truly painful. I usually go through these books in a week while riding the train. This on I had to force myself to read just so I could get on with another book.	terrible
DOESN'T WORK, ISN'T SUPPORTED Linksys can't tell me how to make this product work with a wireless LAN.I purchased the WPC54G Notebook adapter, the Linksys WRT54G Wireless Router and a Linksys WMP54G Wireless PCI Adapter. The cards can link with the router, but not send any data. Furthermore, the wireless link doesn't work unless WEP security is off. You have to broadcast your data in the clear!With an all-Linksys solution, you would think Linksys could make this work. Nope. Linksys tech support can't offer any solutions that you can't read off their website. If the website was helpful, that wouldn't be a problem.Don't even think about purchasing this product!	terrible
Miserably inaccurate I just received one of these. Being a suspicious sort of person, I checked it against my professional digital instant-read thermometer. When the true temperature was 275, the Taylor thermometer read 300. When the true temperature was 115, the Taylor read 130. So the Taylor was neither absolutely accurate not linear.	terrible
Excessively simplistic This book would only be useful to ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS.The applications are excessively simple, and the explanations are long.As a professional ASP programmer I bought this book for the ASP code, hoping to fond some to short-cut my own development, and learn some more along the way. NO WAY. The applications are excessively simple - not even worthwhile as a foundation for adding your own code.Wrox Press' Professional series are still the best in my opinion.	terrible
Sigh.. So I ordered this tank a little while ago - got here fast, no problems there. Got it filled and worked wonders the first week of play.

Read the Reviews!!! I absolutely agree with the previous reviews. Do not buy this item unless you participated in the reenactment and you want a nice picture of yourself to show the kiddies.

Author is a Nazi skinhead The author of this book, Matt Buschbacher, is a neo-Nazi who engaged in white supremacist activities throughout his stint as a Navy Seal (see the Southern Poverty Law Center's website) prior to penning this garbage. While Buschbacher wants us all to take into account peoples' status as Black, Jewish, or homosexual, and he has advocated violence against the aforementioned people through his involvement with hate groups, he wants us to ignore his disgusting past and make him rich by purchasing this dribble. Don't buy this book. Buschbacher is about as good of an author as he is a human being.	terrible

Biggest mistake I ever made This is the worst memory card I've ever had the displeasure of using. It wiped out 3 of my video games so now I can't even play them, when you contact their customer service they will not respond to your letters or calls.

Cheap junk -- beware! I bought this to secure my commuter bike to the rack in the storage room of my apartment building as a casual theft deterrent. It was never banged up, exposed to elements, or even taken outdoors. After roughly 60 or 70 unlockings the key became difficult to turn. A few days later when I inserted the key and turned it with normal pressure, the key broke off in the lock (just completely shattered -- little shards of metal everywhere).This lock is junk and does not stand up to the lightest possible use. Save your money.	terrible
skip this one I have been a fan of Jude Deveraux books from her very first book. Her first twenty or so books are wonderful and I own them all, but lately I have no idea what has happened to her. I have to agree with another reviewer who wrote this is written on a high school level. I would have to agree it is like a Nancy Drew novel. The characters never develop and the story is down right childish. If Ms. Deveraux wants to write mysteries, she should read a McNaught or Garwood novel, they are all wonderful. If you want to read Deveraux try: The Summerhouse, The Duchess or The Princess, some of my favorites.	terrible
Rating of Everything We Had by Al Santoli We are very disappointed with your service! I purchased the book shown because my husband is the Marine on the cover of the book and I wanted to give it as a Christmas present to a relative. You sent me the book with a different (unoriginal) cover. I do not consider the book with a group of soldiers in the jungle an original and is not what I ordered! As for the Everything We Had, it was a NY Times best seller in 1981, many love it!	terrible

Raiders of the Living Dead In the name of GOD don't buy this movie. The cover art was better than the movie. (I use the term movie loosely) The acting was the worst thing I have ever seen. I have spent more money on a good dinner than was spent on the special effects for this (movie). I should have turned it off after the kid turned his Grand Fathers Laser Disk Player in to a death ray. The same effect used to beam people up in the old Star Trek TV series was used to make the laser beams. (scraching the film) After watching this (movie) I could not even bring myself to rewind it. It now sit on the self and I threaten to tie the kids up and make the watch it again if they act up.	terrible
Disappointing book I bought this book looking for decorative concrete ideas.

If you are thinking of this as a gift, Dont I wont tell you how it ends, because I could not stomach the movie for more than 28 minutes.It looked to me like a poorly done high school production of "hey kids, lets make a war movie".When I read that there was no script, that all the lines were improve, it explained a lot.No plot, no direction, no character build, all in all a terrible waste of time and film.Please, Please, do not waste even a Netfilx space on the tripe.	terrible

Two hours you will never get back. A talent of mine few people know about is that I can quite easily sit and look at a picture of Penélope Cruz for hours. I can, nearly as easily, listen to her squeaky voice, or observe her quirky ballerina-like mannerisms. This film really put this task to the test. I gave in towards the end and fast forwarded to see how it ended. Aside from beautiful Penélope Cruz, I found this movie simply unwatchable.Penélope Cruz plays a gifted cook from Bahia who suffers from motion sickness. She leaves her cheating husband and moves to San Francisco where she stars in a T.V. cooking show and makes men all over town insatiably hungry. You'll have to figure the rest out.	terrible
Ewww, why don't they just give Bjorn Again their own CD to? Why? Why bother? Who is Russ Pay and who cares? He did the whole album. Just one guy. I don't think he's ever done anything else. Like, if you had a "Tribute to Elvis" CD, you'd expect it to be various other artists interpreting his music in an original way - not just one Elvis impersonator for the whole thing!It seems pretty obvious that the only reason he did this CD was so he's dopey name would show up in all future JD discographies. Listen to the samples here... this moron ruins all of these great songs by slightly reworking them so they sound like straight modern-rock-radio mediocre clutter. For such an original band it seems like the most inane tribute you could give. It's Joy Division: pub rock style.	terrible
Thin Skin Carafe I Bought my BRAUN Coffeemaker 11 Months ago. The Coffeemaker is a good product but, the glass Carafe is paper thin. this is the second time I am replacing it in a month.

Faulty Pump Head Fitting I have purchased and returned 2 Bell Airstrike 1900 pumps before I found one with a pump head that would fit my tire valves. These are very cheaply made pumps and Bell does not have a quality control department that can ensure that their pumps will perform the basic function of fitting smoothly but tightly over valves. This flaw can be costly to consumers; I have torn 2 tire valves while trying to force the Bell pump heads to fit correctly.	terrible
DON'T BE SUCKED IN BY THE HYPE I had been anticipating this film for months after a friend of mine was in a test screening during the SXSW Film Fest. I waited in line three hours for tickets. Here's the real scoop. The creators of this film are ingenious. The way they organized and promoted this film is something that will be studied for years to come. But the movie itself is an utter disappointment. It is NOT scarier than 'The Exorcist.' It does NOT do for the woods what 'Jaws' did for the water. It's pretty much a theatrical version of MTV's 'The Real World' with a shoddy and slight supernatural spin on it. There were two things that were genuinely frightening about this movie: seeing just how many times the characters could use the word 'f**k,' and the realization that I wasted fifteen bucks and an hour and a half of my life on this movie. It's worth a rental so you can draw your own conclusions, but prepare to be disappointed.	terrible

Should not be in final fantasy series I guess one positive thing I can say about this game is it is nothing like any of the other final fantasy games ever released. Ok the graphics are better so what! In my opinion a good final fantasy game would have a GOOD story line that intrigued you and kept you playing. This game on the other hand takes you on a journey of the sphere hunter yuna(who they degraded from final fantasy X as a high summoner to a shallow teenager) and her cute little friends looking for spheres for her lost boyfriend. Most of the game consists of side quests. You want to know why they are called side quests because they are not the game itself they are things to do on the side! Furthermore you can not even control the camera angle in the game. This games target audience seems to be jr. high teenage girls. I truthfully can not see how any gamer would enjoy this game.	terrible
Horrible B&D PowerPro mixer We needed a new mixer and figured we couldn't go wrong with a Black & Decker. As it turns out, we were very wrong in this thinking. This could possibly be the worst mixer ever! Just as others have said, there is NO low speed, you turn this thing on and it throws pieces every where!!! After using this piece of junk you have to change your shirt because you will have food all over it. I think there are two reasons for this- 1. Too fast and 2. Poorly designed beaters. Also, the beaters are made of a heavy gauge wires that don't cut very well and are weak.If you just bought one of these then take it back!	terrible
So predictable Two society women fighting in a toy store, throwing stuffed animals, banging carts? Please. This is just plain dumb. Then the love interests are so ridiculous and predictable it's enough to make me delete it from my Kindle.

STUFFED.... My cat bit me a few hours before I watched this film.I mention this because half-way through the excruciating90 or so minutes, I had convinced myself that I had adose of tetanus coursing through my body. It was theonly explanation for the sudden appearance of lock-jaw.Truth be told, my mouth was wide open as a result ofabsolute amazement that someone had bothered to makea film that was so puerile, so vulgar, so immature,so vacuous, so unfunny, so tedious, so revolting, sovainglorious in its homage to 'adult' humour, soinsulting, so....arrgh, CRAP!I once was a fan of McFarlane.

Superficial Treatment of a Complex Subject Mr. Benedict attempts to write a book about an entire group og people without interviewing a single member of the group. No competent journalist interested in a fair and accurate treatment of a tribe as controversial as this would consider that an adequate effort. There is a fascinating tale of who these people are, of how they achieved what they have, whether by hook or by crook, of how the money and change in status has affected both them and the region. Unfortunately Mr. Benedict has chosen to take the easy way out and has written a utterly simplistic and superfifical treatment of a far richer and complex story of America today.	terrible
A snapshot of bad 3D action adventure from a bygone era This is a classic example of a direction games avoided. A perfect snapshot of failed ideas in the early 3D eras. It makes the complaints about camera and control in modern 3D action games seem like nitpicking, as Urban Chaos is all but unplayable with its set up.Even basic functions like jumping, or punching are so poorly mishandled, it makes you wonder if the developers were really thinking they had something cool, or simply going through the motions w/ a limited skill set and lack of funding.	terrible
How can a book be less useful than its predecessor?? I've owned the previous version of this book for years. I was hopeful. The TOC you can read online indicated that the book had grown with the industry. This edition includes more space dedicated to user scenarios, collaboration, topic-based authoring, content management, and localization. And yet the book has less to say than the previous edition. Gone are almost all of the concrete examples and practical advice. The "best practices" that are sprinkled throughout the book are rarely more than platitudes or admonishments that you should do something, but the tools to do it are missing. I suspect that the book is really more interested in advocating for Hackos's consulting business than in providing value for your money. Buy the 1994 edition. You'll get more out of it.	terrible

Unrepresentative of classical singing It is laughable that people can consider Russell Watson to have been singing opera when he hasn't even performed an opera on the stage. In fact, he isn't able to perform classical vocal music without amplification, which immediately exposes the fact that Mr Watson isn't neither a tenor nor a competent classical singer.The only thing that he is doing here is to trace the "tunes" of some classical songs. Unfortunately, he can't even do this well - his singing is hoarse and coarse and there's little by way of interpretation. Even if we disregard all the markings in the original score (which Watson is, of course, incapable of realising with his severely limited vocal means), his singing is still extremely unsubtle.In all, a low point in the history of vocal recordings. An album to forget.	terrible

Lets be Honest, this is a terrible Book I am extremely disappointed with this book. I have read Agatha Christie. Here are the ones I read and liked: Appointment with Death, Hercule Poirot's Christmas, Evil under the Sun. The problem with the 4:50 is there are too many characters! I can't keep them straight. There is no plot about the timing of the train which is what I thought it would be. The only reason I finished the book was to make sense of all the time I had wasted so far. No luck there either. Even the Queen of mystery can fail miserably at times. I just wish someone had warned me. Here is your warning. Go elsewhere, maybe to Hercule Poirot novels.	terrible

The Most Painful Experience I don't understand WHO is giving this movie good reviews. It is terrible. I usually like movies where nothing much happens (The Age of Innocence, Lost in Translation) but this is a joke. There is NO script here. It's just made up of VERY SLOW scenes most of which only involve 2 sentences and finish with the words "Alright". Natalie and Robert are supposed to be having a passionate affair, but the two leads look like uncomfortable strangers throught the entire thing.There is little plot and NO emotion from any of the characters. The acting is a joke. The cinemtography etc is bad...but that's not really such a big deal...I'm sure they had budget restraints etc...but seriously...they could have come up with a plot or nice dialogue...or something.This is a like a Pinter-nightmare.	terrible

It should be called "The Boring Witch Project" I actually remember seeing this movie in the theatre when it first came out in 1999. Sitting through this movie was absolutely mind numbing! This was supposed to be one of the scariest horror movies of all time, and what did I get for my money? A bunch of screaming and cuss words. The actors in the movie just run around and screaming in terror the whole time. That's supposed to be scary? And the filming itself is really dark and you can't see anything going on at all! How can a horror film be scary when you can't even understand what's going on in it? Big disappointment here people. Not scary at all. No fun to watch. It's just boring!	terrible
Frustrated and Disappointed I never write reviews, but I simply had to vent my frustration over this highchair. Like other reviewers (wish I had read them before I spent $100) at first I thought my daughter was just small and would grow into this chair. But now that she is 11 months old and in the 75th percentile for height, and still cannot reach if I put the larger tray on, I am deeply disappointed. Also she leans forward on her own, without support from the chair, because the damn thing won't sit straight up. I now know I'm not just imagining this after reading other reviews. Do yourself a favor and read reviews before purchasing. This was a waste of $100.	terrible

look elsewhere First off, the reason I bought the book is because it's required text for a Maya class I'm taking and the instructors decided on this book before it's release - big mistake! This book is loaded with inaccurate, vague or mislabeled information and the DVD isn't much better, in one of the DVD tutorials the instructor stops and backtracks several times because his "script" is off.

Ford's Insanity Exposed This book serves as a great companion to Neil Baldwin's Henry Ford and the Jews. It shows in detail the insanity and hypocrisy of Ford's assertions. Ford, who admitedly did much for the development of the industrial economy, was guilty of exactly the type of control he accused the Jews of attepting to exert. Ford owned banks and newspapers. Via his paper, The Dearborn Independent, he published a series of his diatribes against the "international jew."This work, based on the debunked Protocals of the Elders of Zion and his own opinions or obsevations (mind you he was a bit of a recluse and saw few people), along with his support of Hitler in WW2, clearly show how it is possible to be both a great influence on the economy and a bad actor in the social and political world.Sadly, Ford family members have spent generations trying to distance themselves from these rants while respecting the economic work of their benefactor.	terrible
WARNING REGARDING SHINING STARS FROG I was given a Shining Stars Frog, and thought it would be wonderful to name a star after my son, who is in Heaven. However, when I went to the website "[...]" to choose a star and give it my son's name, all I got was a screen stating that Russ Berrie had filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, and the website was no longer available.

As for myself, I couldn't be more disappointed - I had pictured myself looking up at the stars at night, knowing that one of them had my son's name.	terrible

Shocking Having just purchased this recording, I can't help but wonder HOW did Scott's voice evolve from this sugary, bubble gum style on this CD to the fine voice he currently possesses. The CD on Amazon lists 27 titles but only the first thirteen are on this CD, but then enough IS enough. It is amazingly hard to believe that he went on to record anything ever again but then this is only MY opinion. I have heard better on American Idol but it does not distract from his later works, only mystifies!	terrible
After 6 weeks on one side of my face ... I'm 46 and have pretty good skin. I was very excited about Strivectin and started using it religiously. I could have sworn that it was making my skin look better. It was one of the first cosmetic product I ever bought. After several months I became cynical about the entire industry after seeing marketing claims for various products that were obviously bogus. So I decided to really test Strivectin by only putting in on one side of my face. The skin regenerates every 28 days, but I kept doing it for 6 weeks.No results whatsoever! I asked several friends which side of my face looked better and most of my friends would say there was no difference. A few chose a side, but they were evenly divided between both sides.	terrible

Don't waste your time. I had an older model from La Crosse that worked well for years. When it died, I bought a new one. Got it... and it doesn't work. Display comes on... but no buttons work, does not communicate with temperature transmitter. So they sent another. The buttons work on the second one... you do have to push on them several times to get them to work, but hey... they work...but still no outside temperature.

outrageous price This is perhaps the most expensive book besides collectables. Judging from the size and amount of information, it probably worths $5 - but I had to buy it simply because the professor uses it as textbook.Granted that this is a book for business management professionals or to-be's, but this does not mean the book should be this expensive. You'll know what I mean when you see the book. I think they they are taking advantage of that fact that most people buy this book get reimbursed - my self for one will get reimbursement from my company, but I resent the fact that I have to buy such an expensive book and waste my company's money only because I have to. This is robbery - it's not printing book, it's more like printing money.	terrible
Save your money I am big fan of the BBC 10970's era Pride and Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility so I thought I would enjoy this as well.Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel.Sadly, between the 60 years old Anne who lacked that inner fire, the Little house on the prairie fabrics and the scary mismatched interiors I had difficulty watching this film.It didn't help that Capt Wentworth never bothered to steal a secret glance so we hoped maybe he still cared.There was no follow through, so the letter he writes at the end made no sense.See the Persuasion with Amanda Root.Don't bother with this one.	terrible
Get Free Software This could have been done much better! This is simply a Bible divided into sections by adding numbering to the top of the pages. Some readings even end mid verse. Here is a link to a free software program that will allow you to create your own Bible reading schedule. You can choose which books of the Bible to read or include the entire Bible. You also choose which days of the week that you will read. And, you then choose a start and stop date. From this information, a personal reading plan is generated. It is very flexible, and I have used this, in the past, to create a 90 day read through the Bible plan. With this program, you choose how long you will take to read through the Bible. And the output has a very good verse balance! In other words, it will not cut you off mid verse, and you will be reading roughly the same amount of text each day. The plan can also be printed out.

Don't waste your money I used several different brands and was the least happy with the Medela brand. After just 1-2 washes they were so wrinkled and misshapen that they were unusable as a breast pad. No, I did not use the little bag that came with them or hand wash, etc. I just threw them in with the rest of my little one's laundry. however, I tried 4 different brands and these are the only ones I had trouble with as far was washing and losing shape.	terrible
What a waste of time and money Loved the actors in this film (which was why I rented it) but that was it. It was a total waste of time and rental fee. A embarrassment for the screenwriter and the director. "Come on" Hollywood I know you can do better than this!	terrible
Don't buy it - It's Junk! There is a drive belt inside that attaches to plastic gears. My trimmer made it three months before breaking. The plastic gear melts. Looks like it's made out of the same plastic you would find in toys. Definitely not durable enough for the job. What were they thinking? Oh yeah, profits. But, that's the last dime Black and Decker is getting from me!	terrible
Waste of Money If you're looking for a cordless impact drill to get those frozen, rusted, threadlocked or just plain difficult nuts and bolts--this impact drill is NOT what you want.I don't care how this Milwaukee impact drill is rated, I have found it totally useless for anything needing *Tool Time* power. It was back to breaker bars and pipe extensions.What a total waste of money.	terrible
Fast paced story, but the plot blows! Clive Cussler generally writes a good fast paced adventure story. A fun read. But the plot of Valhalla Rising strains and breaks credibility.Particularly I didn't care for the author writing himself into the story as a hero at a particularly tight plot point in the story. Sort of a saved by the Gods cameo.If you must read Cussler,read Fire and Ice.	terrible
A book that is neither worth the money, nor the time Unfortunately I was requried to buy this book for a class. An absolute waste of money. Nothing is covered in any sort of detail at all, while the pages are dedicated to output from compilers. For an example, the information covering file Input and Output consists of a single paragraph. And it's wrong. C++ Primer Plus is a much better alternative. It's cheaper, bigger, more correct, and is actually a useful book. I want my money back Barbara! (And I suspect that you're the one who wrote the first review and that you also paid someone to write the second.)	terrible

no snow leopard support & no plan to add Bought this a year ago and, while Amazon's description says this supports Mac OSx 10.4 and above, this does not work on Snow Leopard. I've talked to Peterson support, but they could only confirm that it's not Snow Leopard compatible. They also went on to say that there isn't a plan to add support because they have moved their resources towards developing their iPhone tuner. They couldn't actually offer me anything better than a discount on a hardware tuner that was used for demos. This was like throwing money away, with nothing to show. I'd love to hear if this works for Windows users.I gave it one star because the feature set, had it worked, looked very promising.	terrible
Weak Effort This DVD is pretty bad. The sound is not good and the visual really lacks in all aspects. I think watching the video was the same as the dvd. The only plus is that you get the trailer, but that does not help enough. Kubrick is dead, take his work and make it look as it once did and as great as it could be.	terrible
This book is a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, for all the book provides, there are enough problems with it that I have to wonder if it missed out on some much-needed editing. The author's describtive ability is extremly limited. Overall the book was very poor. Try something else and save your time and money.	terrible
Science-fiction for people who don't like science-fiction This is a story about many things: longing for love, a lover had, a lover lost. Politics, business, and a power struggle between father and son. There are science fiction elements sprinkled into the long, winding tale - but a sci-fi tale it's not.Like the main character who is afraid of confrontation (won't go after the girl, won't stand up for himself, won't look into the box), Wilson sparingly teases you with interesting sci-fi concepts, only to beat a hasty retreat back to his comfort zone. This relegates the majority of the book to the minutiae of daily life and exquisitely boring relationships.This is science-fiction for people who don't like science-fiction.	terrible
Defective I received mine today, and the on/off button wouldn't work. The only way to get it to work was to squeeze and twist the base. The only problem is that the beard adjustment has to be twisted, too. You can probably guess what happened. What was supposed to be a level 5 shave suddenly and irreparably became a level 2 "stubble mode" shave. That just sucks. I used Norelco's live chat to complain and hopefully to get a little sympathy and apology. What I got was a rep telling me that I need to read the manual from now on. Thanks. And thanks for the apology that finally came at the very end of the conversation. I hope you didn't sprain anything.Plus, instead of the vacuum system sucking the hair into the storage chamber, it blew it all over my shirt and the sink. That was sweet, too.Anyway, it's probably just a defective unit, but it still ruined my beard. Actually, I ruined it, but its defectiveness should get most of the credit. The end.	terrible

more time spent fixing than playing my son is almost 3 and loves the concept yet i spend more time putting ti back together than he does playing on it. the spiral is mostly secure but as soon as you try to go down hill, the support pieces are barely table and the tracks have so little support that the whole side collapses. he can barely use 3 trains and it's in shambles. if i could take it back i would - by far this is the most i've spent on one of these sets and would take it back in a heartbeat. i bought it when he was 2 hoping our results would be different but nwo they're worse - and i wish i never dug it out of storage to try it again. can't wait until it disappears when he's sleeping one night....	terrible

Fumes, fumes and more fumes My daughter seems to enjoy it but I'm very disappointed by the fumes--which makes me believe that the paint is not eco-friendly and/or has not off-gassed yet.

Going forward, I will no longer use M & D products--everything smells unless it's used for awhile and has off gassed.	terrible
Only for Electa Bikes I bought this for a Giant bike and when the product came in the installation instructions made no sense. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it's ONLY for Electra bikes -- no wonder I couldn't figure out what piece of the bike they were talking about.

Terrible. Greasy and thick but this with the cleanser and serum left my skin and my husband's skin blotchy and irritated.

In the garbage it went.	terrible
Very disappointed, poor quality I bought this unit because of the great features and the Polariod name...well, I have learned my lesson. I watched one movie on it on the way to the airport. Once we got on the plane and I turned it on, the screen lit up, but the disc would not spin. Checked the unit when I got home, the battery was fully charged and the player still wouldn't work plugged into direct power...I will be returning this and buying a new one, and not a Polariod.	terrible
This is a touching book I found this book to be charming, witty, open, intelligent and loving. It is classic Maclaine, complete with her deep interest in all things metaphysical. There is also a warmth that radiates through her writing, you can feel that she truly loves and cares for all her animal companions and especially little Terry.I have always respected and liked Miss Maclaine, but there is a new "grace" about her life right now. She says she has found joy and peace because of her relationship with this smart and funny little dog. Who I am to argue?Some people may shrug it all off as "eccentric fluff" and I have a feeling that would probably tickle her, but I know the "animal lovers" will get it and the spiritual readers will find some interesting wisdom to ponder.This book and its photos share "down to earth" glimpses of a unique woman. You might not agree with her spiritual standpoint, but you can't ignore the love she feels for her home,her life and for Terry.	good

Good album, but what happened? I remember seeing Bush in 1996. During that time No Doubt opened for Bush. Yes that's right kids! Success comes and goes for most bands. Bush nowadays would open for No Doubt. Ironic don't you think? A lot changes in time. This album is good, but what happened. What happened is people started moving past grunge after 1996. After bands like Nirvana people held onto the dream. I myself included. But it is over. Everytime I go to Pearl Jam concerts I see people with Nirvana t-shirts, but sadly I've moved on. What other choice do we have.	good

Other than that the chain is thin and it is very beautiful I love my gift.	good
Can't Wait to See What's Next... Being a fan of the Left Behind book series, I was naturally thrilled to hear that plans were being made to bring the story to film. As I read the books, I could visualize the story, and the characters became all the more real and personal to me. The film has brought these characters completely to life.Watching this film was like reliving the experience of old friends. It was interesting to me, knowing how future events were going to affect these characters, watching them introduced on film for the first time. From the sight of planes exploding midair over Israel, to Buck's first prayer before the meeting with Nicolae, I found the movie to be both touching and thought-provoking. Even if you don't believe in God, or in Christianity, the story alone is truly compelling. It's definitely a movie worth seeing.	good
Good basic CAD program An excellent basic computer drafting program. User inferface that is not too dificult to pick up, and includes a reasonable collection of symbols. Help is fair. I could use more information fairly often. No programming interface that I have found. No auto-dimensioning. Snaps and alignment are always problematic and there is no solution here.A high bang for the buck item.	good
Nice little heater I have had it for a few months now and overall it is pretty nice. You can only set the temperature in 5 degree increments. 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are the options. I have it set at 70 degrees and it keeps my place 71-74 degrees. It doesn't turn all 360 degrees, only a little under 90 degrees. It stays cool to the touch, except for the metal screen. That part gets very hot but the rest of it can be touched even when the unit is on (my dog knocks it over sometimes), although 80% of the unit is cool. It also doesn't shut off automatically if it falls over. It is not loud, I rarely even notice it is running; it is much quieter than my other space heater. Well worth the price in my opinion.	good
In the best tradition of Brazilian regionalist storytelling This was a captivating movie, with beautiful filming that captures the awesome, rugged beauty of the Brazilian sertao. And the story was as captivating and satisfying as it was conventional. What is remarkable about this film, beyond the beauty of the imagery, is the bittersweet ending, that leaves you both relieved that the outcome was not what was expected, but that also was as sad and tragic as a story could be.Although this movie was based on a novel by an Albanian writer, it fits well in an established genre of Brazilian story-telling, the stories of the sertao.The only thing that seemed a bit unnecessary to my imagination was the indication at the beginning that the movie occurred in 1910. Given the transcendence of the story, this was not necessary. This movie could have been set in 1879, 1910, or 1928. It doesn't really matter - it is a mythical, fabulous pre-modern sertao that is the setting, not any particular time and place.	good
Feel Good Music! Voyage to India is very upbeat and is a breath of fresh air. Songs like Slow Down, Simple Things and God is Real help you to remember that life is a journey to be enjoyed. The Truth and Beautiful are great love songs that prove that love can be expressed without being explicit. If you enjoyed India's Acoustic Soul than you will enjoy the Voyage that India takes you on this time. Out of the 15 tracks on the CD, I only bypass the Intro (#1) and one other one.	good

A bygone era Luckily, this 1965 book has the whiff of a bygone era. It is a comparative study of the political elites in major 20th century dictatorships. Concentrating on the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. It analyses the demographic makeup of the elites. Looking at, for instance, the occupations of the fathers of Politburo members, to get a sense of the social background that these members grew up in. Likewise with Nazi leaders.The authors try to find common patterns between these elites. In an attempt to understand how such movements successfully seize power. Plus also, no doubt, how the US might have to deal with them. Remember, too, when this book was written. An spoken undercurrent might have been how the US could prevent such revolutionary movements from taking power in the first place.	good
Malawi Valance My husband and I love this set of bedding, etc. for the nursery. We painted the walls green and purple (green on top, border then purple) and it looks adorable:) The valances are great and really finish the look off. The only thing is that I had to stitch the loops up about 2 inches or so. Otherwise, the valances hung low and you could see the blinds on the top. Once I shortened the valance though, it looks great.	good

Good for small spaces This unit is great for small areas like closets, utility rooms, small bathrooms, etc. As another reviewer mentioned, a larger unit is needed for medium to large sized rooms. I most recently used the unit in a hallway, just outside of the room where the cat's litter box is located, to keep any odor from drifting to the rest of the house, and it worked very well. The filters always seemed to last longer than I expected them to, so I really feel that I get my money's worth.*The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.	good
Remembering Memories of Mom A charming and peculiar biography about a writer, his alcoholic and artistic mother, and the rest of the family that formed around them. Antrim uses a kind of stream-of-consciousness style much like our own memory works: he flits from remembering his mother's dying to buying an expensive queen-size bed, from his uncle's station wagon stuffed with fishing lures and Playboys to the nature of addiction and recovery. Wonderful and moving writing - experimental without being off-putting, heartfelt while still being intelligent.	good
Very Nice Good quality, nice size. I haven't been able to find something similar in the stores in leather so am pleased.	good
Nice Little Throwback. I watched this last night and I didn't expect much more than a typical "chick" horror flick. I was wrong. I won't say this is the second coming of a John Carpenter film, but it was good enough to grab -and keep- my attention. There's good suspense, and while I did figure out the punchline a bit early on, it wasn't enough to make me shut off my television. I don't want to give much away, but it takes place in an all girls school where a powerful secret is being kept. The premise may seem typical, but they did give it a dose of originality.So, from a possible 5, I give it a 4 for those that remember, and enjoy, old skool horror and can have a good time without a metric ton of blood and gore. On a side note, the "remixed" version of Lesley Gore's, "You Don't Own Me" (it seems to include haunting backing vocals), was a true highlight.	good

Awesome DVD Player I've had this player since Dec '04 and it's been great. The player plays all my CDs with AVI, JPG, and MP3 content. Even slightly scratched DVDs work great. I had rented a DVD from Blockbuster that came scratched. I watched half of it on my PS2 and the rest was unreadable. I used other DVD players from computers and the data was still unreadable. I had almost given up but then I popped the DVD into this Philips player and I was able to read most of the data. Although the DVD skipped a bit, I was able to make out the rest of the story. Even my parents' foreign DVDs played fine when other generic players failed. My whole family is pleased with this purchase.My only discontent was over the controller's design. The buttons are all oval/circular and make it difficult to locate by touch alone. The player is slim but long unlike other players. I guess these are rather negligible factors compared to how much I enjoy having this player. I'd recommend this player to anyone so far.	good

Slipping, but still gripping! The mysterious intrigue continues in season 2.Four teenaged friends with diverse interests and talents must work together to solve the identity of the mysterious A, who stalks their lives and sends threatening messages.The plot thickens in this season as more potential suspects come out of the woodwork. The girls try to navigate everyday pressures such as boyfriends, parents, and homework . . . while trying not to fall into A's deadly traps.Some of the plot points start to get a bit tired in this season and some things are a bit too over the top, but overall it still captures your interest.A is finally unmasked at the end of the season, but season three (which has just started playing on television) promises new mysteries!	good
Mooch Moves... Fante is better than Bukowski. I loved Buk while in college, but Fante has taken the torch for me. LA, at least the crappy parts of it, are tangible in Mooch. You feel the heat, smell the smoke, and taste the booze I understood the protagonist's sauce problem with even more reality than I did in Chump Change. Every word is perfect in the text and the story flows as smoothly as a cool bottle of Mad Dog 20/20.Pick it up- you'll be glad you did.	good
Makes me want to read more This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I've read. I've had it laying around the house forever and just never seemed in the mood. Then, today, I ran out of anything else to read and picked it up. I couldn't put it down and read it in about 3 hours. Ms. Clark kept me interested in the plot twists the entire time. I couldn't wait to see what happened. It makes me want to read some of her other books.	good
Great flavor, just can't get used to it. This stuff has a great flavor and is made with real ingredients...but actually using it will likely be a love-it/hate-it. Just dipping into the jar, the spicy raspberry flavor was really nice... but I never could get used to my meat tasting like spicy raspberry. Same deal with crackers...So...great flavor, and if your taste buds aren't as stubborn as mine, it'll probably go over pretty well. Otherwise, it has a great flavor with nowhere to put it.	good
like I needed the cases and have no problem with these. The price seems great for so many. They are not heavy but do the job. I do like these for protection of the disc.Good price good item !	good
Very good overall The picture is very good. Response time is very slow when changing channels, ect... Speakers are so-so and the PIP is too limited. The shipping did not work out well, that is the biggest complaint. The carrier would only give me a window of 1PM to 5PM. I said fine I will be home at four. NO, that won't work, we may show up any time from 1 to 5. How about Saturday? NO, we don't deliver on Saturday. I ended up driving 60 miles each way just to pick up my TV.	good
Great Deal for the Price I've had the item for 3 weeks now, and it works better and has already lasted longer than a similar item that I bought from Best Buy for $25. I had to adjust the treble and bass levels on my car stereo but it sounds great once you make those adjustments. I wasn't expecting much when I received this item considering the price but it's defintely worth it.	good
Likely good I was shocked when I saw the price tag usually new manga is alot more expensive but this isn't a bad price. I heard alot about Cowboy Bebop the anime series, but never got around to watch it. When I went shopping the other day I saw this manga at the store and descided to get it. I liked it! The art and characters where great! I had some good laughs in a couple of the chapters. I think I found myself a new manga series. So go buy it! You will like it!	good
Waited for so long, not 100% satisfied :( I am almost 23 years old, and got hook with Harry when my little brother bought the 1st book, ever since I just got so much into the story that I finished reading the book (and the others) in matter of a day!!.. anyway, each of the books present new and interesting characters, secrets discovered, questions answered & more mystery! and lots of magic of course! yet this new book HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, was slightly disappointing.it's 90% repetitive. Just new stuff about Lord Voldemort but, Snape being -nevermind, almost let it out-.. well, in other words you sort knew already what was going to happen. :( But!! yes!! BUT!!! the book is more serious than any other and Harry actually stands up for himself, which is good. I loved it when he talked back to Snape!!! heheheRead it!	good

Excellent book told in the inimitable Miller style Ann Miller, one of the most underappreciated stars of the Golden age, tells all in this book. Focusing on her childhood and her personal life, she recounts memories with a disarming cheeky style that became her trademark. While more information about her work would have been nice, it's great to have Miller by Miller since no other real biography exists. We hear a lot about boyfriends, her fascination with spirituality, and her work as a goodwill ambassador.Bottom Line: An excellent book by Miller, told in her trademark cheeky style. While short on professional details, it's great for private ones and shouldn't be missed by any Miller fan. (great pics, too!)	good
So Ya Need Even More Velvet Revolver...Eh? First of all, I whole-heartedly agree with everyone who gave this album a 4 or 5 Star Rating. It does Rock. Let's just hope it keeps getting some good Radio Air-play to let EVERYONE Know that Rock & Roll is still Alive! Although, I'm sure the next single will be one of the "ballads". Just wait and see.Now, while you are busy ripping these new tracks to your iPod, or making a copy for the car, don't forget about an extra track that the band did for the Fantastic 4 movie soundtrack in 2005. It's called "Come On, Come On". It's on the Fantastic 4 - The Album. Track No. 1. It's a straight up Rock song, that will fit in with either Contraband or the new Libertad cd. Check it out.	good

Great system I've been using a pressure canner for years now. Used one when I thought the Y2K issue was serious, canned up scads and scads of meat. This is a canner you want for meats. Otherwise, when it comes to vegetables, use the usual water system. I think everyone should use this system as it does everything, meat, everything!!!	good
Very good action movie. For what it is, this is an intriguing action-packed movie with A+ synergy between Sutherland and Douglas. The soundtrack thumps in perfect pace and keeps it hot right up to the end. Great job!	good
First time user review Omron HEM-637 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor with Advanced Positioning SensorIts almost 2 months i have purchased this product. Until now it is working fine and is convenient.	good
Liked It! *This review contains spoilers* I really like this movie, because it shows the difference between a mere crush and true love. What I didn't like is how blind they were to Reese's feelings, I really felt for her, because it reminded me of a little situation that I'd once been in, but instead of the man stealer being my sister, it was best friend of 3 years. I also didn't like that the hero died and I especially didn't like how he died, because it was just really sad and stupid to me. But overall, great performance by Reese Witherspoon, especially since that was her first film.	good
Best Jude Deveraux since A Knight in Shining Armor I got this book in the mail on Wednesday and was up until 2 in the morning finishing it! What a great story concept.... what would YOU do if you had the chance to go back and make a different choice in your life? "The Summerhouse" is just what I look for in a book, good characters and a plot line that is a little out of the ordinary.	good
My dad had been wanting to see this movie again for many years... My daddy had been wanting to see this movie again after seeing it YEARS ago. He actually had it recorded on VHS and it was recorded over many years ago. He was hoping that one day he could just find it again on VHS, but much to his surpprise, I was able to find it for him NEW on DVD! He was quite pleased with the quality and the fact that the price was SOO reasonable and that it got there so quickly. Thank you!! Kudos to the vendor!!!	good
Good Buy. You'll enjoy. There really isn't a way to escape the time commitment required to put any system together. My advice is to take your time and read through several steps ahead so you have a better idea how each section fits together since there were few occasions where I had to redo something because the instructions weren't clear enough. It took me 4 hours spread out over the weekend which made the entire process more digestible. Just remind yourself that you're going to get more out of the product than the initial investment of time building it.	good
A comfortable read I noticed a few spelling errors in the book, but other than that I have nothing bad to say about it. The relationship between Christine and Erik is sooo beautiful I wanted to cry on several pages. A comfortable read that is easy to go through, but not in the least bit boring. ^^	good
Pleasantly Surprised I got this book for free and it was in the top 100 of its category on the day I got it. I was a little bit torn because it had a few 1 star ratings mentioning excessive profanity and bad grammar, as well as poorly drawn characters. Well, I am glad I gave it a chance. There was no profanity, I only found one typo. The plot and characters are well drawn. I enjoyed the book and plan on reading more from this author.	good
A great movie I my self i like the movie.it was good from start to the in .good docmentary for any one to relate when they where young.and the kids are so funny. and the film says being strange can be fun when your young.	good
So much fun If you constantly find yourself needing to blow out some candles from across the room but really don't to stand up walk over there, and blow with your own lungs, then this is the product for you!!!This is an absolute blast! I received one for my birthday (my 20th birthday HA!) and my friends loved it so much that I bought 2 more for them.With practice they can shoot up to around 30-40 ft!My original one, however, broke a few months ago but with a little tape, it was as good as new.	good
Digging the New Davis Sound The album was initially released in a 10-inch format in 1951 - with Dig, It's Only a Paper Moon, Denial, Bluing, Out of the Blue - and then issued in 1956 as a 12-inch "album" with the addition of My Old Flame and Conception.Miles has walked away from "cool jazz" and is exploring new avenues of sound with saxophonists Jackie McLean and Sonny Rollins, pianist Walter Bishop, Jr., drummer Art Blakey and Charles Mingus and Tommy Potter on contrabass.The soundscapes are works in progress - with McLean delivering the goods - and are an interesting chronicle of Miles expanding his artistry when he could have easily remained on familiar terrain.	good
Interesting I like the original (Ani Difranco) version better than Alana's but I am impressed with what Alana did with the song. Alana has a great smokey voice and I like how she made the song more upbeat. If you like Ani's version then definitely check out Alana's, if you like Alana's cover version definitely check out the original (Ani's)! The two songs are quite different but both deserve a good rating for their different reasons.	good
One of the best albums of 1998 Fastball comes from a long line of power pop bands--if you like Badfinger, The Raspberries or XTC you'll appreciate the pleasures of the band's subtle melodies, strong hooks and wry lyrics. While they do stray into preciousness on one or two tracks, the overall effect of this fine sophmore effort is of a band having a great time entertaining themselves (and us) with witty songs.	good
Study of Norma Jean's Life and the Craft of Writing I chose to read this book because I admire the work of Joyce Carol Oates and I wanted to see how she addressed such a challenging task: writing a fictionalized biography.She succeeded wonderfully!The only criticism is it went on for a couple hundred more pages than perhaps were necessary - or perhaps it would be better said that the last couple hundred pages were less interesting to me... so perhaps a different edit would change my perceptions although it makes sense that Norma Jean's descent into despair would not be as entertaining writing.Nonetheless, I read this entire book in less than a week while running my business, teaching and doing my usual non fiction reading which is quite a testimony to the "page turning" nature of Oates' writing.Definitely worthy of a read and a study of the craft.	good

Looks like Oreos This item was a welcome addition to my household. It is one of the best store bought wheat free cookies available. It could never compete with the real OREO, but for wheat-free diets it is the best there is. The cookie part is a little harder but at least it doesn't crumble like most Gluten-free items. The mint adds the perfect touch.	good
Driven But Then Delivered From Distraction Finally a book on how to deal with ADD. Enjoyed the practical and easy explanations which is a good read for those of us who do have ADD. Talk about hitting the nail on the head with descriptions of those of us who have ADD! Yes, and I even started reading the end of the book before I started at the beginning which is a habit we ADDers have as written in the book. The book is written so you can skip around the chapters without missing information. There is even a special chapter if you can't finish the entire book. I recommend reading this book for those who have ADD and those who have ADDers in your lives.	good
Not What Was Expected but... I purchased this book for my husband after hearing about it from a instructor in a CPR class I took...I told my husband about it and he wanted to order the book...it wasn't exactly what he expected it to be and after he thumbed thru it, he laid it down for servral days...well when he picked it up again, he said he couldn't put it down as the stories we very inspiring...we will be ordering it for our grandkids in the future and based on what my husband said about the book I will also be reading it...	good
good humidifier this is a good humidifier. if you have hard water you have to purchase a filter and replace it i think every 3 months. if you dont use a filter you will get white powder all over the place.... but other than that, which is my water's fault...i like it...and it's cute.	good
Smart and original. The title is what first caught my eye--one of those titles that made me say, "Whaaaa?" So I checked it out.It's tough to acutely depict the message Ms. Strauss tries to get across in this work--one must see it with his or her own eyes. One must read the novel and interpret the ideas with one's own mind. Each of the stories that comprise the novel are braided into one another until the final, which makes the work particularly noteworthy.This work is a different read; a novel with smart organization and catalytic prose.I recommend it.	good
It was wonderful It was wonderful, I never thought that it would arrive sooner than I thought and the movie was awesome.	good
Not the most recent version Its a fine book but what I found out after I recieved it is that its keyed to the First Edition not the most recent edition. So its missing a few cases.	good
One of my favorite David Gemmell books My favorite David Gemmell stories are the Rigante series. Having said that, I love Morningstar. In fact, I've read it twice and will most likely come back to it again when I'm in the mood for a great fairytale. I hope the word Fairytale doesn't turn anyone away from this story. Others have described the plot so I won't repeat that other than to say, Jarek Mace is one of my favorite reluctant heroes.	good

Wanted the softest putty I could find. The putty is soft, but a rating of XX-soft I do not think is correct. The putty is sort of stiff and becomes pretty soft after your hands warm it up. I am using this to make magnetic putty so I needed the putty to be super soft.	good
Early Examples of That Sparkling Lubitsch Touch Strange thing about silent films -- to modern audiences, many seem as dated as a Hittite epic, while others are fresh as the day they were lensed. THE OYSTER PRINCESS, on delightful display here, is one of the latter. No wonder Hollywood couldn't wait to get the benefit of Lubitsch's sparkling comedy style -- much of this picture's laugh-out-loud funny. A dumpling of a comedienne, Ossi Oswalda's captivating in both pictures, but she's a particular hoot as the Oyster King's daughter, in a frenzy for a husband. The set and costume design are fascinating, the actors personable, the jokes good -- what's not to love? I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN isn't quite up to that high standard -- a little slower -- but the sexual politics are fascinating, as are the glimpses of actual Berlin locations. Excellent restoration (thanks, Kino, for bringing us this series). Big fun!	good
Creator toys for my creative boy My son does not usually like to play with the things he builds with his Lego sets. He just wants to build them. This is the best way for him to do that. It has directions for 8 different dinosaurs and then picture ideas for several more. What a great idea!	good
@ss kicking workout!! This simply is a real butt kicker...(in a good way). If you're doing it properly within a few minutes you'll be moaning, groaning and really having to psyche yourself through it, no matter your fitness level. I use 5, 8, and 10# weights (she does have someone modifying w/no weights) combine with the ab section of herWorkout: One-On-One Training with Jackiedvd and am absolutely loving it. Would have given it five stars had it included a true, full-on abs workout.I do this dvd twice a week and break it up withJari Love: Get Extremely Ripped! 1000weights only option once a week. Really like both and find they compliment one another wonderfully. Along w healthy diet, lots of water and some intense cardio three times week...keeps me nicely lean and sculpted, but not bulky. Looove it!!:)	good
Month Python's Life of Brian I saw this movie years ago at the theatre when it came out. It was oddball, off the wall and to me and my good friend who was also a fan of Monty Python, hilarious. I don't see it on tv much and it is nice to see the movie now and then. And it was a good price. If you like Monty Python, you'll enjoy this movie.	good

XP Limited user issues, but robust, reliable and well built. I have had issues taking the drive to use on public computers, where administrative access isn't possible and have been unable to use the drive at all.But the drive is robustly built, reliable, and the cap stays secure on the end of the drive. 256 MB now is pretty poor, so now I'd recommend against getting such a small drive, but if the larger versions are anything like this, the stability and robustness should be a factor when comparing usb drives.	good
Very interesting reference I enjoyed this very much. I wish there could have been more photographs, but that would have been a different book. This is almost exclusively line drawings.Very helpful and informative. Warning: trying to duplicate these in decorative metal today is *expensive*. Architectural salvage might be more affordable than starting from scratch.	good
very informative If you're looking for a book that has the recipe for everything, this is it. The only quibble I can think of is that some of the recipes (i.e. for roast chicken) are extremely basic. No interesting spices are listed; salt, pepper, and oil make up the ingredient list. (which I suppose some people would find to be a plus, not a drawback). Overall, this is a good effort, with few oversights, as far as I can note.	good
20/20 Hangs together surprisingly well. A group effort from the late Sixties. Includes the hits "Do It Again" and "I Can Hear Music". Features the wonderfully complex SMILE fragments, "Our Prayer" and "Cabinessence". Dennis is well represented. Worth seeking out.	good
They are the cutest! The Pixar Cars Movie Moments (whoever the character might be) are the cutest toys on earth! I bought one for myself (to put in our TV room) and got them as well for my nephews! They totally love it! They've collected almost all of the characters in the CARS movie and this is definitely a great addition to their collection and playtime! :)	good
Great band Sup my ... homies eastside representin da north dirty south. Anyway great cd the vocalist can scream as well as sing which is hard to find in a vocalist anymore. Oh and buy it from amazon.com cause they are the best...	good
Great unit, Works to unlock doors I installed this for a customer (school) and it worked like a charm. Only ohter thing I needed was a angled wall mount so the camera can see the person better. good value for the price.	good
Excellent accessory I have the radio remote attached to my iPod almost all the time--mostly for the convenience of being able to adjust volume and change tracks from the handy clip-on controller. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that this is actually my second one: After a year and half of heavy use, the first one just stopped working. But I'd grown so attached I had to get another!	good
The Third Story Is The Charm Though I like Jess Michaels, the third story in this anthology, Border Lord, by Julia Templeton, is the charmer. This romance is hot as you-know-what, and witty to boot. I liked it so much I bought it as a single story on Kindle! The first story in the book is slow, and never quite appeals to me. The second story is better, but both are completely overshadowed by Border Lord. This is just my opinion, but I hope it helps.	good
I have to be honest here I am a total fan the serise but this book is just really slow in places and as a result I can totally understand if you can't get into it. I also have a problem because I have never read Jane Eyre before and I realize that half the jokes are going over my head. I plan to read Jane Eyre than go back and read this book than I will be able to appriciate it more.Overall-Give the other three in the serise a shot even if you have a hard time getting into the first.	good

worked fine for a while this was the greatest purchase ever until some random screen started to pop up. in the middle of my movie it would say that the device could not support the ipod. but for some reason once the screen went away i still had a lonnnng battery	good
Best Processor for the Price. I have been using this processor almost daily for about 1 month and I am very pleased. I have used it to make nut butters, mix desserts like fudge, and chop veggies. It is a small cup size, but works well if you are making a meal for a family of 4 or less.	good
Very enjoyable Any book by Heather Graham catches my eye and I thought I would give this one a try and was quickly taken in by the story. It was just a nice read. I loved stories about past loves reuniting and this book just made me smile.	good
Interesting Setting and Time This looks like a promising new series to watch for. For those who like period mysteries, this author is definitely a good one to keep in mind. The setting in late 18 century Philedelphia is different, but a good one just the same. I like the hero - McLeary is a believable and entertaining narrator. I look forward to seeing more from Mr. Graham	good
The great book to read The house on mango street is a great book because it has many things that people deal with today. The book was great it shows you the point of view from a teen age girl. Her style is great because she showed and telled what the characters were feeling at the time. The one chapter where she gets rape. Thats the part that hit me the hardest. A girl getting rape shouldn't happen to any woman, but it happens. She was not proud to tell or show where she lived they're just ashameded. I will tell someone to read this book.	good
Works good when you get it working.... Had 2 people working on the router for over 10hours setting it up. Called techs support several times, and like others have said, you only get told to go to the webpage. Turns out our settings were right all along, but after applying the firmware update it just worked perfectly.... Argg, the tech support should have suggested this in the first place!!!!!!!	good
Liked it alot! This book is a nice mix of historical fact and fiction with a good story line. Characters are detailed. A good read!	good
Excellent but expensive I really liked the book. I think is a pretty good book and it came in a great shape. however, I also consider its kind of expensive.	good
Good Product, Bad Bottle! The product seems to work pretty well. I have applied it to my mailbox, A/C outdoor unit, and several other tools. The only issue I have is the trigger bottle and how it cannot be used to "mist" the contents in any way. It has the same stream, no matter what the setting is. In hindsight I should have bought the aerosol can for best application. I will have to buy a spray bottle with a good difuser attached, so as not to waste any of this precious substance! It does appear to be making a difference to the rust on everything I have applied it to. Hope this info helps someone. Thanks!	good
Power Strip Are you tired of hunting for that electrical outlet when your laptop battery is on its last bar? This Kensington power strip is what you need.Pros- 6 outlets, illuminated power switch, protection indicator (green LED), and best of all there is a 15ft cord which allows extended range at the airports or the coffee shops.Cons- None at this timeThis review is based on a 60 day use.	good
Growes on you Justin Timberlake is a great singer and dancer however i was not so impressed by this at first. "Like i love you" growed on me the more i heard it and i really started to like it. "Cry me a river" is good too. "Senorita" and "Rock your body" were songs i didn't like at first but then adored. It's an interesting debut, with some notable songs, Neptunes made 2,Timbaland 1, 2 are about his quite famous-ex girlfriend( Never again is a ballad by the way) and rappers appear on some aswell, and also Janet Jackson on "Take Me Now" It's a little too much soul here, feels like he wanna look like something ne. I don't mean he should neccesary make an album with teen-pop but some more variation would do well. But it's an allright album in the end, maybe the start of his solo career for real.	good
Fire or foul I think this book deserved 4 stars because........It was a thrilling, grabbing story. I think it should of had less blood.	good
Leaves a mess Initially I was pleased with its pickup power (compared to our Shark), but I now view it as a failed $50 experiment. The major drawbacks are:- As soon as the power is off, it drops all particles. If you've just cleaned up kitty litter, you'll find it all in a pile under the vac head on the floor once you turn it off.- It creates a high-pitched whine, which actually caused my wife and I some ear pain.- REALLY awkward to use on furniture...needs a brush attachment.- No HEPA filter (forgot to check for this before buying it).- Cord is just as short as the Shark's.On the upside, it's lightweight.I'll be donating mine to Goodwill, and am about to buy one of the fullsize vacs.	bad
This was not a good movie. At all. Kevin Smith was the only good thing about this movie. Otherwise it was horrible. One big advertisement for why not to live in Boulder. Horrible movie.	bad
How painstakingly depressing! Initially was so exicted to buy this. first let me say i respect anyone's right to tell their story. But I also say some stories dont need to be put on paper. this book had me begging for it to end! first there were FAR TOO MANY characters floating through this book. I had a very hard time keeping up with who was who!'Then there were far too many errors in the book that should have been caught by the editor! Finally the authors obsession with writing about the horrid perverted acts annoyingly often and very distubing. I completely skipped those portions and there were lots! Overall i didnt enjoy the book at all and found it depressingly annoying and was glad when it was over.	bad
Sounds great, but actions speak louder than words. I have been using a French Press for years and when I saw this I thought it would be nice to be able to keep the coffee warm for longer periods of time. It does do that well, but when pushing down the plunger, it almost always forces grounds past the filter screen as well as air which often, even when used very cautiously, comes bubbling out of the spout (Yes, even when it is not totally filled). So if you don't mind cleaning, and you are not apposed to swallowing some grounds, this is the product for you. I occasionally use it to keep coffee warm that I make in my glass French Press, since this does a very nice job of maintaining the heat.	bad
Needs more help with implementation First of all, the enclosed video with this product is really more of a promo; it helps very little with using the course.Secondly, the written material is put together like a menu. The "appetizers" are some fun and easily implementable activities to help kids gain an overview of geographic concepts.The "desserts" are different ways to output the learned material.However the "main course" in which I expected to learn HOW to teach my kids to "map the world by heart" was nothing but a list of the continents and all the countries and landforms that need to be memorized. I was looking to this course to teach me HOW to teach my kids to "map the world by heart" but all it showed me was the WHAT. It, unfortunately, was a waste of money.	bad
Too much money for good vacuum I have owned this vacuum for about a month before I decided to return it to target. I have found a few flaws with it that I shouldnt have, considering the price I paid for it.It is a great vacum when it works fine, however if you happened to get someting on your way of vacumming and it gets caught in the brush - the brush attachement will stop working - you then have to rescrew it and reassemble the whole attachement.Secondly, the tool attachement is placed so akwardly, and it is not at all convinient to use it. The storage compartment is also very small and you have to empty it frequently. Overall it is a good vacuum - it didn't seem slim as the name suggest - I cannot imagine what size a regular dyson would be - difinetely storage issue. Dont get into the hype of the product - the are many vacuums out there much cheaper for same value. Buy from a place that accepts returns without hassle in case if you run into similar issues as I did.	bad
Prone to slipping I would agree with the other reviewers that it is prone to slipping unless you find a sink that matches its shape perfectly. The arms can technically fit a large variety of sinks, but the longer you extend them the less stable your cutting surface.Also, the bamboo surface will scratch heavily if you use reasonably sharp knives. The cutting surface itself is smaller than the picture would make you think.This might work well in some situations, such as cutting soft vegetables in small amounts, like for a stir-fry. But based on my experience I can't recommend it generally.	bad
A Dissapointment I have been searching for this cd for over 2 years and i finnaly got a copy recently......Having already heard acouple tracks i liked... i thought that the Applejacks would become one of my favorite Merseybeat bands.I was very wrong. There are only a few good songs on this cd(Tell Me When,Like Dreamers Do) and the rest are really bad covers(Aint that just like me, Too much monkey buisness) My sugestion is that you try to find these two 45's because the two good songs i mentioned are FANTASTIC.....but i wouldnt buy this cd	bad
different color When this arrived it was black instead of orange - good news is that I actually prefer the black and would not return it - just not the same color as described.	bad
Asvab for Dummies It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.	bad
You get what you pay for . . . . not much! I read a number of the reviews to the effect that the blade was too flexible and didn't cut well. I thought: it's Fiskars, a highly-regarded brand, how could it be that bad. Well, it is. The extending pole is great. But for anything beyond cutting a green, soft, no more than one inch branch the blade is practically useless. Save your money by spending more on a better product that will handle tougher jobs.	bad
bare bones This dictionary came packaged with an audio Italian language course. Having brought it along on several trips to Italy, I've found it to be inadequate. The range of words defined in this volume is limited, and many common words have been omitted altogether. My advice - pick up a better one, such as the Langenscheidt or Larousse.	bad
Cheap hose I must preface my review that I can not speak to the sealing effectiveness of this product as the compressor seized during the road test. The hose it comes with is crap, plain and simple. Its suposed to be a quick release and seal up but it didnt, instead after i disconnected it the hose sprayed a nasty sticky, oily foam. So even if the compressor had lived im not too sure about if the sealer would have even done the job. Lesson learned, always test the viability of the system before adding expesnsive additives.	bad
My Opinion The book Sound of Waves is a book my classmates and I are reading for our English 1 class. Our opinion on this book, is it's the most unintersting book we have ever read. Nothing very exciting happened and there's no big tragedy happening in the little village where the characters live. Although very descriptive, it's not my #1 choice for a reading book.	bad
overrated really i know a lot of people who are really excited for this show to finally come out on dvd. i myself, just never bound the "brilliance" in it. it had its moments here and there ill admit, but for the most part, i just couldnt find this show funny. was overrated(just like Everybody Loves Raymond) its sad when a show like this, or Friends can last so long, but a brilliant show like The Tick only lasts half a season. oh well, just one mans rant.	bad
Just not a good story Ok, Dan Brown, we know you're smart; stop hitting us over the head with it! Why don't we use some of that energy that was used in all those puzzles and plot twist to make some likable characters. Heck, I'd settle for un-likable characters over these flat stereotypes. There was a very smart idea in this book. But instead of letting it shine dully through a well crafted novel, Brown lets it blind blatantly without any sort of veil. I felt like I was at a lecture at some points in this book. And when it did that, this novel lost any saving grace. I love learning new things when I read fiction, but more than anything I love a good story and the Da Vinci code was severly lacking in that department. Online customer, save yourself the hassle; I'm sure a movie is on the way, save the time and fork up the 7.50.	bad
Good thoughts, great man, but poorly written book Dorrance is a skilled horseman and "whisperer" whose skill at understanding the horses language is certainly a gift. However, the book came across as disjointed and poorly organized, in places very redundant. I was also disappointed by the tendency to attribute results to almost magical abilities: not much "meat" on how to put the training techniques into use.	bad
Effete's too big These flacccid disjecta membra would seem trivial in Reader's Digest, escapist in an in-flight magazine and fluff in any language	bad
Is outdated price whise, not enought details, is not a bad guide for used car research but just don;t see why it worth 10 bucks, price can;t follow try online usually is more accurate, blue book or edmunds, not details of each car either very basic guide not worth the money.	bad
Uninspiring And Over-the-hill "Preachy" Let me tell you that I know my bit about Cassius Clay and what he stood for. This movie has little or no entertainment value.Will Smith probably made a good Ali but to be true I thought he was boring and loud at all the wrong times.There's a fiest of bad actors in this movie and there's nothing really to talk about.I'm a Will Smith fan but this movie only made me a little confused with what I saw.It gets a bit too political somewhere in the middle and the final result of it is an overly preachy film.Watch it if you told yourself you had to do so.Don't buy it.Buy cheap bubble game but avoid buying at all costs or situations.P.S - I can't recall one scene I enjoyed in this film except the last fight scene(climax if you may call it that)	bad
Not useful for me. This book is useful if you want to take magenta pictures with a magenta filter, or blue pictures with a blue filter. On the other hand, the parts of the book dedicated to bringing out 'natural' light in photographs is small. It is mainly about creating fancy effects. A photography book should inspire you as you look through and see the photos. This book is full of shots with heavily over-used filtration. Not for me, but if you like more abstract photos, then you might like it.	bad
Not Very Sweet I normally use the KAL Pure Stevia Extract Powder and I thought that is what I was ordering when I bought this product, but it is nothing like it. I have to use a LOT more of this product to get anything sweet enough. With the Pure Stevia Extract Powder, I only needed a tiny bit.	bad
Slide Guitar? I ended up buying this album on sale and am so glad that I didn't pay full price. I am an Erasure fan from way back. I own all of their albums (look at my other reviews, I defended them during their Loveboat days) singles, etc. I am sorely disappointed in this album. I thought Other People's Songs was better than I expected and the Boy EP was better than I expected but this whole album is largely bad. It lives up to its acoustic apellation but the use of slide guitar and the reworking of the songs makes them largely into new songs with the same lyrics and singer. I think that Andy's voice is shown in a great light here. My disappointment is with the music. I couldn't recommend this to anyone unless you like old school country (not even then since I like Johnny Cash but not this).	bad
Great Game Poor Quality My 6yr old played an older version at a relative's house and was excited to use his allowance to buy one of his own. Sadly, it was a waste. The cards constantly fell out of place, making game play difficult. Also the plastic pieces broke because my children (who are in NO way destructive)continuously replaced the cards. After about 2 rounds they asked to put it in the donation box for the Salvation Army. If any good came of it, it was the discussion I had with them about only giving away nice things, not junk, to charity. The game went in the trash... where it belongs! And they wrote a long letter to the manufacturer. We were mailed coupons to buy more crappy games. Thanks guys!	bad
A Nice Format With OUTDATED Maps. I knew when I bought this map book that it wasn't new and would not be totally up to date. However the maps in the book were out of date before the book was even published!I say skip the book and buy a GPS.	bad

it's ok I don't really get all the Love that Lay Z opps I Mean Jay Z gets??His tone&vibe are so basic it hurts my head.now He teams up with Beyonce on a Old 2Pac track&doesn't add any Life too it.the true "Bonnie&Clyde" of rap Songs was the one Ice Cube&Yo-Yo did back in the early 90's.this is a dime a dozen just like much of what Jay Z does.	bad
Most tracks are garbage This album is in my girlfriend's dad's collection. Most of the songs are teenie 60s Whitey-McWhite romance pulp. (I love you; you know I'll be true etc) A few classics on the album, but I can't believe how many stars people are giving it.	bad
15 months then it broke. This is an okay glider. The wood is fine. The gliding parts are fine. Still silent when we glide. The back did break but I replaced the nuts (with some studier ones from the hardware store) and now it's fine. I weighed about 180 lbs just to give you something to compare.The biggest warning I have is don't let your kids play in it! Since their legs don't extend over the front, their center of gravity is further back in the chair. My son tipped it backwards and he only weighs 24 lbs! They are strong enough to do this already. Good thing I was there to catch him! Make sure you watch them carefully or put the glider near a wall so that it can't fall backwards.	bad
Rambling and Incoherent I've read a lot of Nabokov and finished this one while riding on the Moscow Metro. This is not even close to his best work. It may have been the intention of Nabokov to keep the reader guessing about what was and wasn't real, but in the end it didn't really matter. I don't believe what the copy on the back cover says either. Cinnatus doesn't will his executioners out of existance. His head has been removed and in the end it is his spirit moving to this other existance. Apparently when you write copy for book jackets you are not required to actually read the book you are writing about.	bad
A so so DVD The movie of Aliens on this DVD is really nice. The extra 17 minutes of footage fill in pieces of the plot and make the movie have a better more rounded plot. Almost worth the DVD itself.However, I said almost...There are no good extra's on this DVD. No directors commentary, in fact, there are no commentaries at all on this DVD!What extra's there are on this DVD are pathetic; Some short home footage of the model of the Base and Atmosphere Processor on LV-426, and how the Face Hugger, and Chest Burster mechanics work and a concept of the Alien Queen. There are also some stills from the movie and that's about it. I expected a whole lot more.As a movie, I would rate the 5 out of 5, but as a DVD, only 2 out of 5.Mr. James Cameron can make some really good movies, but his DVD's really stink in comparison to what other directors put on their DVD's.If your a hardcore Aliens fan, get this, other than that, spend your money on the Gladiator DVD since it is a much better DVD.	bad
Yawn. This is one big yawn. It is what I call "boat payment" music: When an artist must need some extra cash and puts out drivel. Save your pennies and wait for his next (and hopefully more inspired)album.	bad

Could have been alot better. I got "Lone Rider" because the book looked interesting and the reviews were pretty good. Well never buy a book based on its cover. I was very dissapointted! "Lone Rider" was bad. It seem from page one that there was something different about a Dallas and it didn't take long to find out. And Tess seemed like a character without a clue. If you are for a great romance writer check out Lori Foster	bad
Watch one then done This movie really is not worth more than one viewing. The humor really is not that funny. Snicker once, or twice here and there, then the movie ends. The story is dumb as hell, and really should not be attempted to be understood. Buy and watch when dirt cheap, or skip it completely.	bad
My rite-up's is law to a mafia movie freak ( DaviD 1930's MOBSTER)...... This movie is based on the year 1935, The Dutchman's last year of life. It doesn't paint the real picture of the Dutchman or his orginazation. ( Dutch Schultz was a ruthless hot head who didn't entertain a thing. Billy Bathgate was supposed to be Dutch's Protege but was merly an errand boy (No gun play at all). There was almost no gun fights in this movie or the showing of daily operations which was still going on in 1935. There was a apperance by Lucky Luciano which was good but nothing shown of the Commission which Dutch was a part of. The best Dutch Schultz I have seen on Film is (HOODLUM). If your like me and want the real 1930's & 40's minus the watered down or mis leading facts, D your homework before you buy or rent. Or read the review and look for David 1930's mobster).	bad
Disappointed I bought this book thinking I was getting a Bible study/commentary on Romans. Very disappointing when I saw the book was mainly a work journal. You may like if this is your objective but if you want a detailed and wonderful commentary read the book on Romans by Chuck Swindle.	bad

Anxiously awaiting "The Return: part 2"..... ....maybe then we will find out what this one was trying to say.As you can see from the previous reviews this is not a bad film, but it would be nice if it actually had a point.	bad
fun but very hard I like this game, but don't play it any more. I got it for new year with my own gameboy. Ok what I like about this game is that you can pick up some thing and throw it. I also like the 3D stuff like chase Dory or chase the turtle that said '' hey dude ''. Also it starts out simple like first level, going to school. Second level, going out to find your classmates and returning them to the sting ray guy. But the best part of this game is I one time just typed in something in the cheat code place, and without knowing, I got too the last level. What I don't like about this game is that it is too hard. This game is for people who want a challenge.	bad
Don't pay extra! If you liked the movie in the theaters, this one is NOT that one, and the parts you're paying extra for are simply nothing good. I was a little disappointed at tghe theater's version too; as funny as everyone seems to think this is, gutter humor WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE just gets tiresome. There is little to no intelligence behind this movie's humor, as opposed to a Will F. movie such as Weatherman which had some insightful comedy that was not ALL based on body parts. But if you liked the movie in the theaters, get the regular DVD version, don't pay extra for this widescreen.	bad
Great document, outrageous price I bought this book, new, for %5.25, when I was in graduate school. Shocked at how expensive it became even just a few years later, I created my own very similar document, and have made it available free for all on the Internet.	bad
Not a good choice The perfect solution spinning remote control organizer looks nice and the spinning is OK if your too lazy to reach over to get a remote control. The big problem I had and I know other wrote about later is the side holders are just too small to accept most remote controls. I had only one out of five it could hold in it side pocket. I don't like to say bad things about a product but this was not designed with reality in mind.	bad
Great Camera, Bad Company Here's the Good News:I have had many cameras in my life, digital and film , and I have found the Z1 to be my favorite. The camera is very user friendly and the pictures are sharp with great color. My previous camera was a Minolta Dimage 7($800) and I found that this camera's photo quality was just as good. The best feature of the camera is the fact that it is sturdy and compact enough to carry with you daily. Owning this camera made taking pictures a daily part of my life.Here's the Bad News:Recently my camera broke and when I tried to contact Fuji to get a replacement or a repair, the service was terrible. Their website is very difficult to navigate and offers very little support.Summary:Great camera as long as it doesn't break. It's easier to pay someone to fix it than actually get Fuji to repair it.	bad
Misadvertised The title is 3 cup. In actuality, it's less than one mug of coffee. Other than that, it's good. It should be advertised as a single serving size, not 3 cups.	bad
Disappointing Granted that Mr. Gallois is a technically accomplished flutist, there is something very much amiss in this rendering of the Mozart concertos. What is missing is beauty in phrasing, or perhaps better put, good taste. Some of the phrasing is downright bizarre. I find the Ransom Wilson recording of these concertos much more enjoyable.	bad
Not for Me I have been doing an Ab Blast DVD from Jeanette Jenkins for about a year now and decided I needed to change it up a little. I bought this DVD as a recommendation from a relative who said the Abs of Steel series was fantastic. I have attempted this on several occasions knowing that it takes time to warm up to something different. I cannot warm up to this. The first few segments in (not the pilates and yoga portions) the line up were moving fast and almost putting a dance routine together without giving you time to learn the form. Just when you start catching on it's time to go on to the next move where you start over trying to learn a form. I am happy to work my body hard, but I need solid clear instructions. I also want to clarify that I have been working out 5 to 7 days a week for 4 years. I'm familiar with a lot of moves and usually catch on quite fast. For now, I'm sticking with Jeanette!	bad
Not enough oomph Bought this pump to use for inflating an air mattress, but ended up having to buy a different pump because this one just couldn't get enough output to inflate the mattress completely. It took forever to fill, and still left the mattress feeling squishy.	bad
Nice bits until the bearing set screw fell off and the bearing went flying across the room! I got this set for a specific project that needed the bearing out at the end of the bit to move against a pattern. Hadn't used it more then 3 minutes and the set screw that holds the bearing in place unscrewed and let the bearing go flying and my router bit no longer could track to the pattern and severely gouged my work piece.Amazingly I found the bearing and the set screw and put all the parts back in the bag and returned it. They should at least come tight from the factory!	bad
Sticky Buttons Purchased this phone for my in-laws to replace an older phone. within a month the buttons started to stick. Would only dial one number when I returned it. Volume seemed to be good and without roar with a hearing aid. Speed dial function a little to complicated for the elderly, plus the lack of a lighted dial makes it difficult for those with low vision to see the buttons.	bad
Warrior's Woman This is really one of the worst books I have read written by Lindsey. It is silly. It's like a bad portrayal of a strong woman still being dominated by the big bad male. I have quit reading Lindsey's works. She used to be interesting. Then she got into too much abuse of women. Rapes, nasty men, etc. I can find something better to read.	bad
Handbook of adoption This book disappointed me. The authors did not make enough reference to recent scientific literature. To complete with the recent meta-analytic reviews like:van Ijzendoorn, M. H., & Juffer, F. (2006). The Emanuel Miller Memorial Lecture 2006: Adoption as intervention. Meta-analytic evidence for massive catch-up and plasticity in physical, socio-emotional, and cognitive development. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 47(12), 1228-1245.An integration of psychoanalytic and empirical data would have been great.-A Psychology Psy.D.-Ph.D. student.	bad
Very disappointed!!! The humidifier started leaking after a few weeks. In another website, a few reviewers also had this problem. The water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty. Very annoying!! The filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use. It is also way too expensive.	bad
Rent for the kids, but DON'T buy it. Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache.	bad
Waste of money - didn't work Arrived quickly, no drivers included, did not work on Vista without drivers. Manufacturer and amazon unwilling/unable to provide working drivers. Amazon support unhelpful.	bad
Hard to hold interest I never really got into this book. May have been me? I found it to be simplistic and slow, never really held my interest. I did finally finish the book, but to be honest, I didn't retain anything of a positive nature.	bad
Bored of the book... I was expecting so much more from the Harvard Lampoon- "Nightlight" and "The Hunger Pains" were both rolling-on-the-floor hysterical. Maybe because this was an earlier effort and the parodies keep improving as they continue? At any rate, this parody was inferior to the other two mentioned.	bad
Not Helpful - Except as a Footstool I purchased this book for the first part of my Biomechanics class. We raced through the first 10 chapters, and each one was very difficult to understand. Fung skips steps in his derivations which, for an undergraduate, made studying more confusing and time consuming.Probably the most frustrating part (at least for an engineering student) of the text is that none of the equations (except the ones from Chapter 1) are applied to anything. Not even for the problems at the end of each chapter. The book is just a long list of mathematical derivations regarding hypothetical blobs, I mean "bodies of mass", in space.In summary, I wish this book had a lot more examples pertaining to applying all the equations written in this book. Perhaps application of these equations will be used in the second part of my Biomechanics class, where we use yet another Fung book. I hope so.	bad
Caution! Please take much of this information with a grain of salt. The author did not have the authority of the Church on this book. Some of the quoted so called "seers" and/or "visionaries" are nothing more than frauds who deceived people in order to make money. I also question the motives of this author by following suit.	bad
Accounting Guide - I fear not !! If it's an ACCOUNTING guide you want, then this book is not for you. If it's a FINANCE guide you want, then buy it. I was hoping it would have more strictly accounting advice like how to read a balance sheet, what a profit and loss statement is, what is a liability, etc. It hardy touches accounting, concentrating more on the finance side of starting up & running a business, eg. business plans, cash flows, types of companies, tax, etc. The book however is easy to read & understand but I feel should get rid of the "accounting" term in the title.	bad
Not to happy Chopin is okay, but his pian music doens't appeal to me that much. I prefer Mozart's piano music. Chopin's wasn't mood suiting because to me most it is flat.	bad

TINY! TINY! The seller should do more to make sure the buyers are aware of the tiny size. They are about 1/4 the size of a standard rubber ducky.	bad
Just didn't get it I can only guess at the writer's motivations for writing this book, which offers a tacky insight into the sad world of strip clubs in a style that blends hippy slang with words and references I never heard of.	bad
One of the most confusing books I've read It's unbelievable how confusing a fluid mechanics book can be. Tritton achieved to present fluid mechanics in a way that only mathematicians (with usually no interest in fluid mechanics) can comprehend. If you need to really understand fluid mechanics and not to continuously deal with divergences and curls, better look for another book.	bad
Worked for just over a year I purchase the Platinum B70 for my wife as an Anniversary gift. The coffee maker made it just over a year before we started getting the, "Not ready" that I have recently found out about. Not only do we get the not ready but the machine will turn on by its self and start spitting water out now. The only option for this machine now is the trash. It was great while it lasted. Guess we got one of the better built ones as it made it a year before crapping out.Update - 1 Feb 11 - we attempted to contact Keurig customer service to find out if the machine could be fixed. After waiting a month for someone from Keurig to contact me, the machine stopped working all together and is now in the garbage. I have since bought my wife a Bosch Tassimo and she very pleased so far.	bad
I should have listened!!! I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint, and that you couldn't smell the fragrance. I should have paid attention to it. But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance. This one is extremely mild but pleasant. It's a pleasant fragrance, I just should have saved my money. I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me....it didn't.	bad
cute, clever, pretty but not correct The BBC tv series is closest to the book.This film is not much more than a colorful cartoon for those who can't read or will not read a book. It is supposed to be for the modern audience. Perhaps it is but it failed to make a profit and critics laughed at it one might say. Even the trailer on Youtube is worthless by my judgement,How can something so pretty be such a mess? Dunno. It's not Becky Sharp and not Vanity Fair in my humble opinion.It has value if you want to see how a great novel can be cleansed by scrubbing away all truth and reality. Hmmmmm, perhaps that is the way to treat modern viewers ----or is it?Still it has merits. Although one of the merits may be how not to make a movie.	bad
No thank you long, boring, and depressing. The Rough Riders was a bit of a stretch. It made Teddy Roosevelt look like a bumbling school boy.	bad
Barely does the job I bought this cam to be a nursery cam. I have it mounted over the crib looking down directly into the crib. As was mentioned previously the picture is not great and you do need a lot of light which means as a night time nursery cam it is worthless. No audio of course. I have a separate nursery monitor for that. It does not work with Vista. I have read where the WVC200 software when loaded on a Vista machine will work with this camera but I haven't tried it yet. I think it is a great idea but all in all the cam is just a hair above worthless.	bad
Lasted all of a year This toaster looks great but after about 10 months, it started toasting inconsistently. Now, all it does is burn our toast, no matter what the setting. Really quite frustrating, but it is another example of "you get what you pay for." I would not recommend this toaster to anyone.	bad
Usefulness I ordered this handbook based on a recommendation from a professor of mine. I have used many handbooks in the past, but have not owned one until I bought this one. Unfortunately I never keep track of the authors on the other handbooks I have used. Therefore when I received this suggestion, I went and bought it. Once I received this book, I realized that this book has no useful integrals that I actually need. I am a physics major and none of the reoccurring integrals we use are listed in this book. I consider this a waste of money, and would buy a different/better handbook if your in the market for one.	bad
Once again, too much country/blues not enough rock and roll This album has one really rocking song at the beginning "Jump In Now" and then it's all down hill from there.The two reggae songs, "Shall Walk" and "Run-In", are cool and interesting but not enough to legitimize this album's steep import price.Hey Izzy, you are supposed to be a rock and roll guitarist, so cut out this hokey country/Rolling Stones thing and do a rock album for once.Izzy Stradlin's first album with the Ju Ju Hounds was very good, underated completely, one of the best rock albums of the 1990s, but it's been all downhill since for Izzy.If you can get this album used and cheap, then go ahead, otherwise save your money.	bad
Disappointing This was the first book by Jodi Picoult I've read. I'm trying to figure out what had led me to believe she was a skilled writer. This book illustrates that she can tell a story, but her prose is often clunky, her dialog hackneyed, and her characterizations thin. I enjoyed the glimpses into Amish life, particularly through Katie and Samuel. Ellie's story, on the other hand, read like a Lifetime movie. I had no sense of an actual inner life, and her outer life was a mass of cliches. Don't get me started on the interminable, abysmally written courtroom scenes.Others have commented on the "surprise" ending. I felt it was an unearned conclusion and truly unconvincing. Methinks Ms. Picoult considers herself deeper and more clever than she actually is.	bad
This gets boring quickly This is the only album I have heard. The one song "Heartwind" was interesting to listen to but - most of their music is simple and repetitious. I kept wanting them to go someplace with the music. I consider them a curiosity.	bad
Not What I Expected This book was not what I expected. After reading other books by this author, I was unhappy about the sex in it. At the 50% mark of the book the sex started. It was very well written, I just did not want to read in detail, about the sexual encounters. I requested a refund and stopped reading the book, which I almost never so. This book and the sexual content was very well written and done in good taste. Just not to my taste.	bad

Good ernonomics but one heavy problem So I like the ergonomics of this mouse overall. Light click-touch, fits well in your hand, the wheel moves smoothly, lots of pluses.But who at Logitech got the brainy idea of designing a mouse with two double AA batteries? After you use this thing for a while it's like lifting a small brick.Bad design idea. It's going back :-(	bad
Good price poor quality very flimsy The note books were a great price however the back and front covery are very flimsy an tear easily, would not recommend for school projects.	bad
It is NOT the roadshow version--it is the edited version Once again MGM/UA proves they have no respect for their potential audience. Despite what is written below, the DVD release of "Hawaii" is NOT the uncut roadshow version, but the edited version. There is no excuse for this atrocity--both the laserdisc and the most recent VHS release were the uncut versions, and there is no noticeable quality difference in the elements, so MGM/UA just doesn't care. I recommend boycotting this release until someone at MGM/UA gets the message. Not that I'm holding my breath.	bad
Too insular Although the writing is quite nice in some places, this novel becomes quite numbing in it's glacial pace. A novel about an ordinarly family has to have a universal appeal, but this book is an endess exercise in self-indulgent navel-gazing. The detail is so minute and insular that you're left gasping for air. And books where the protagonist is so unnaturally self-aware and insightful bothers me. If he was this in tune with his family, then his emotional distance does not make sense.	bad
$49 worth of sound This is not a particularly great sounding set of speakers, but, hey, you don't get great sound for $49 (guess I caught them on sale). The intended use was to supplement the built-in speakers on my TV. One of the satellites developed an annoying rattle after being in use for a short while, so I discontinued using them, but am still using the subwoofer. The subwoofer adds a lot - a LOT - to the movie viewing experience. If you don't want to invest the money, or the space, for a regular surround sound setup, this is a good low-budget method to upgrade.	bad
Poor Quality Works okay when it works. Fell apart quickly. There are better vibrating rings out there.	bad
Need a beacon light? Try this! I would have given this product 5 stars for doing what it's supposed to do at a reasonable price, but I gave it only two because of a frustrating design flaw. Even when it's on the "dim" setting, the clock is so bright it's beyond nightlight, it's more like beacon light, illuminating the whole room! If you look at the picture, you can see why. Most clock radios have numbers illuminated against a dark display. This one is reverse with the numbers dark and the entire rest of the (quite large) display illuminated shedding WAY too much light for a person to reasonably sleep with.We got this mainly as a sound machine for our daughter who also needs a very dark room to fall asleep, so we're either going to have to return this or jerry-rig something to go over the display to make it dimmer.	bad
DISAPPOINTED Was very very disappointed it would not play on my 2 DVD player's only on my Computer and I did not buy it for that. Wish I got my money back for it.	bad
good premise, a great Clive Owen but why the love story? It's hard to pass up a movie when it's about trying to save starving and dying people in other countries and when the person is played with such a strong presence from Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer and Gosford Park), you know its gonna be a good movie but putting a love story between him and a miscast Angelina Jolie (Shark Tale, Hackers and Taking Lives)...it doesn't add up. Also starring Teri Polo (Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers and Domestic Disturbance), Linus Roache (Hart's War, Wings Of The Dove and The Forgotten) and Noah Emmerich (Monument Ave., Miracle and Cellular). Yeah, so, good premise sqandered by love story with miscast Jolie but Owen still holds his own in a strong performance.	bad
Remarkably easy compared to the real test. . . I am the director of a tutoring program in Boston. Kaplan SATs can be so much easier than the real thing that I sometimes to use them to help my eighth graders prepare for high school entrance exams.Instead of this book, buy:1) the College Board book of real, previously administered exams (the so-called Blue Book), then2) the more recent Princeton Review book of 11 Practice Exams.The old College Board book, 10 Real SATs, was also great, although it did not include the writing section and the reading section was different. Still, if you are struggling with the Math section or the long Reading passages, I would buy that book even before the Princeton book. And I would buy all of those books before this one.	bad
what song is it? I just wanted to know what song the mariachi band was playing right before the president requested his song.	bad
Simplistic I wanted to enjoy Urban Shaman, but frankly I found this novel to be rather cliché. There was nothing inspired or original in a part native-American 'shaman' who encounters various supernatural beings in a modern setting. This theme has been done to death from comics to television, and this novel is no exception.What bothered me most about this novel was that it seemed so light. I had a difficult time taking this novel seriously, and deciding whether it was supposed to be funny or serious. Certainly it is not dark fantasy. But neither is it humorous romance. The closest writing style I can come up with is that it is like a `harlequin' novel. A novel that wants to be something strong, but is written to cater to readers who don't want a plot that's too involved or characters which are too deep.I had high hopes for this book, considering the glowing reviews here, but sadly it is just another c-grade novel with some supernatural elements thrown in to titillate the Anita and Buffy crowd.	bad
Thank God I borrowed a copy I'm in a better position then most of the people reviewing this insofar as I didn't have to pay to watch this train wreck.While you would think that the juxtaposition would be interesting any novelty quickly wears off because the acting is so bad. I really wish I could be kinder to this movie because I wanted to like it but my vocabulary fails me when I attempt to describe how bad this. Avoid if you can.	bad
probably not what you want I was looking for a simple CD of classic nursery songs play for and sing with my daughter. This is a classical music CD of a particular songbook from the 19th century - well sung, and perhaps kids might like listening to it, but it's not what I wanted. She could be singing Schubert for all you know - they're definitely not kiddy tunes. If you're looking for simple, classic, sing-a-longs, keep looking (I'm still looking! Why is everything either off the mark, like this CD, or adulterated with "original, fresh" looks at old tunes, how about just a normal CD of normal songs! I can't remember them after 30 years, but I'd like to). Incidentally, while I recognized some of the song titles, these are different versions.	bad
Ugh! No value - too much of the least favorite, cheaper candy and you do not get enough to justify the cost..	bad

WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER BOOK ON HILLARY. Joyce Milton is a fine writer and has written many good books. However, this time she has just written a book for sell and not informing the public. Hillary is tested every day by being in the public arena. The book just rehashes old stories into new revelations that cannot be confirmed. I expect better from Joyce and I shall read her again on another day...Joe Janos	bad
Bad cuing, Not balanced. The voice-over narration could be vastly improved. Several times during the workout, Janis switches sides, but doesn't cue to do so, and since you are not looking at the screen at the time, you don't know what's going on. At other times, she cues "arms back" when "arms up" is what she means, and "bottom leg" when she means "top leg".Moves opening the chest and back and leaning to each side to stretch the obliques are repeated three times during the workout. It seems like an aweful lot of oblique stretching, whereas the lower body (which needs more stretching in most people) is given short shrift.	bad
It was a disapointed book My English teacher and my parents said that The Education of Little Tree is a great book to read. I thought I should read the book because all the other books my English teacher recommended to me were books I really got into. I really didn't understand the point to the book of Little Tree learning his lesson, but maybe I misread the whole point. In the end of the book it had more persistence to it because of the adventure and action--that's why I gave it a two. I think adults like this book better than kids do because they understand the book.	bad

EA Sports missed the mark (this time) EA released Madden '04 too early this year. There was more beta testing needed to fine tune this years game. The defense in '03 was too easy to beat (unless the defender took advantage of the AI to trick the CPU) - the defense in '04 is too hard to overcome. Not globally; the CBs, FS & SS have far too many interceptions in terms of 'reality' or 'sim' football. And, there are too many fumbles and too many false starts (especially if you use the hurry-up offense). The fun factor is there on other aspects of '04, like Franchise mode, and mini camp. Even online play can be fun as long as you keep in mind the games limitations. Maybe next year EA Sports will get it right.	bad
A quick light read I have a long commute to and from work, so I go through books to the tune of 2 to 3 a week. I gravitate to any genre of romance, though I tend to avoid books with glaring covers and big type print. Thus saying, I would like to put in a good word for Kathleen Nance's book Wishes Come True. The story was enjoyable even if I felt the plot was very predictable. I appreciate when writers add a lot of detail to their stories, showing that they have done their research on the book. Though this book is about fantasy, I felt the lack of details, the small touches which make a book a really great read. The characters are "friendly" and I enjoyed watching the interference of the secondary characters as the story unfolded.	middle
Shame on Amazon! I just ordered and received two 407WH can openers for my Boy Scout troop. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when the ones I received were NOT made in the USA but made in China. One of the photos Amazon uses on the product page actually highlights the "Made in USA" logo. I can't speak to their quality yet but our Scouts manage to destroy every opener except the original Swing-A-Ways. They lose those. Will update this posting after the boys use the Made in China models for a while.	middle
fair sound, fair value I have several sets of Koss earbuds. The best earbuds seem to be the ones with tips that fit in the ear. These have an O.K. fit and sound, and I suspect some users may find the fit better or worse than other earbuds. They seem to be at a lower volume than other earbuds I ownwhich leads me to believe that I'm either not getting the best fit, or they have a lower DB rating than others.,Koss KEB24 Portable Isolation Earbud (Black)	middle

OK, but way too much hype. I really liked the idea, even though a bit trite. Norah was a bit of a head case, but she succeeded in the end, kind of. This was fairly far-fetched, but do any of you have a better story line? I think so. I stuck it out to the end, but was disappointed with it. It kind of reads like a "Indy Film", more than a good read. Hollywood should snag this, it plays better as a 9pm movie than it does a book. All the loose ends tightly bundled at the end or you think. A lot of authors have wonderful ideas and I am not sure the "Best Sellers" list is all what it's cracked up to be.	middle
NOt what I expected I wanted a more engaging and elaborate book on Greek Mythology. this books seems to be a little too rushed and the stories a bit too short. however, it does do its job, so i am satisfied with the product.	middle
Trying I bought this book because so many readers said it was great. Well, I tried but just couldn't. It was way too long and the good vs. evil battle is just a bit much. How many devil vs. god books do we have to read. It's such a boring overplayed subject and the characters are so Disney and predictible. It just rambles on and on and I realize that so many USA writers follow this type of format. I have to wonder what sort of education these SK lovers have had. This book made me think I wasted my money. It sure as heck didn't scare me.	middle
Hallmark Hall of Fame Strikes Again? I wonder if this film is a *slightly* maudlin, syrupy, and overly-romanticized version of the strictly biographical history that so many millions of us have come to treasure in our twelve-step societies, AA being the first; notwithstanding, this film puts life, sound, flesh and bone, with appropos faces, to figures many only know from the black and white pages of AA literature. One can't be too critical of such larger-than-life portrayals of our founders and friends...	middle

Poor printing quality detracts from a great book, won't buy I bought this book and ws really disappointed when I leafed through more thoroughly and found MANY of the illustrations were out of focus, and one had a HUGH printer error where the image was blocked on one of the printer's colors.I returned this book and have repeatedly looked at it at the book stores to see if a re-issued copy comes out that corrects these problems. My estimate is that there are 7-8 plates that are defective.	middle

Of course I've only read the author's 5-star blurb below... ...but I like the idea that the novel starts with a "faint visual" coming from beyond Uranus (most of the time). May not want to look too closely before getting down to the action of musing over 33 years of backstory...	middle

They got the price right. But the season was terrible. I loved the first season. But the second was a huge let down. However... it's still better than most other television shows (except for Lost).On the plus side, Unlike the Lost S4 DVD, they actually LOWERED the price on the Heroes S2 DVD since the Season was shortened.	middle
Not Bad The show was pretty funny and he talks about some crazy things. It is not a bad movie but you have to have a certain type of humor to appreciate Dane Cook.	middle
Water doesn't taste great... I ordered this filter to replace a reverse osmosis water filter. The reverse osmosis filter produced delicious water but was very expensive to operate and did not produce as much water as we needed. I bought this particular filter after doing a lot of research on the web as to effectiveness of removing chemicals and particulates from tap water. I am assuming that the studies I read accurately reflect the efficacy of this filter, but the water it produces just doesn't taste great. To produce good tasting water we are running the water from the Culligan thru a Brita. On the positive side, we have no issues with the faucet that we received as some reviewers have. It's not the BEST I've ever seen, so maybe if you had kids that were harder on the faucet, it would break. But so far, it has functioned perfectly well for my husband and me.	middle

What I thought about Maniac Magee! Reviewer-Jessica(A 6TH GRADER) Jerry Spinelli uses his words in the most exciting way. When I read Maniac Magee I felt sad for Maniac. I like how Jerry really gets into the story and you know he will always use great details. A lot of people are against other people that are a different color then thereselvs. I liked how Maniac did not care which color anyone was as long as you he liked someone it did not mattter to him which color they were. You can learn a good lesson from this book.I suggest you don't read this book unless tou like boring dragged out stories.	middle
Wake up Amazon! I have a Kindle 1, and love it. I have had the chance to handle the Kindle 2 and the DX, and there are certainly noteworthy improvements . . . BUT . . . there is STILL no provision for folders -- everything on your Kindle (whether stored on the internal memory or on a memory card) appears as one long multi-page list with no way of separating or categorizing books you have read, reference books, collections by topic or author, whatever. This is really silly, and now that there is serious competition I find it incredible that Amazon has not responded to this need. Trying to move into "professional space" with the DX without this capability is just bizarre!	middle
These are beautiful but are definitely NOT Clark Kent These are high quality, very beautiful glasses. BUT I was specifically looking for bigger, which is what I think of when I think fo Clark Kent, not just the shape. I believe the measurements said they were 2" x 2", which they definitely are not. So, if you are looking for a beautiful pair of glasses, normal size, these are definitely perfect. But, if you are looking for that new, oversize style, forget it.	middle
Darkfall It's a horror story that initially grabs your attention and makes you wonder how it is going to turn out. Events are happening inside the building as well as other places. You add in a special group of people who seem to understand what's going on, but they are operating under some veil of secrecy that threatens the participants' lives. With all of this, you almost feel you got yourself a winner. However, the book's excitement dies around page 260 and the book has a 100 pages to go. I found myself struggling to finish it. I found myself no longer caring about the characters and I pretty much knew where it was going to go. I wouldn't say it's a waste of time, but if money is tight when it come to your book budget, you might want to look into other options.	middle
Goofy fun with Ted and Bruce Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell have great fun here along with Stacy Keach in a tale of an American businessman who ends up with part of another man's brain in his skull.

Selections from Salmi a quattro chori Venice 1612 Not in the same league as Monteverdi or the Gabrielis but interesting and worthy production, sponsored by the town of Viadana in Lombardia, from which (we assume) Lodovico took his family name.Recorded 1993. Timing 74'10, full texts in Latin. No translations, but then none needed for this repertoire, as anyone who buys this will already have several Monteverdi Vespers (and probably also the Cavalli and Rosenmuller Vesper sets on Harmonia Mundi).	middle
Society and Diversity Antony Thomas' Middle Sexes explores diversity within sexuality that makes all people unique. Focusing on transgender issues accross society that film helps to create the feeling that diversity is good and that one of the keys to peaceful coexistence is tolerance for all views.The film's most powerful message is that there is no one real normal definition of human sexuality. All life is neither black nor white, male nor female. Everything and everyone is made up of shades of gray.The film makes its point by intoducing the viewer to other cultures where the idea of transgender roles are more accepted than in our own. We travel to India to learn about the Hindu third sex and to Thailand to get the insights of the Ladyboy community.This is a quite good documentary produced by Sheila Nevins for HBO. While it offers no stunning conclusions its message of diversity and tolerance is well appreciated.	middle
Does its job I recently purchased this item after having my first child. I'm 21 and was very worried about my getting my shape back, after using the product for the last 2 weeks I have seen a noticeable change in my stomach and waist size. the only complaint I have is that under certain shirts you are able to see it. Other than "that it does its job.	middle
Shakespeare at Home It's good to be able to watch these plays in the comfort of my own home. One problem I've noted thus far -- the audio is uneven. Production values vary from scene to scene. Sometimes the volume must be increased significantly to hear the lines, and then the volume changes and the shouting begins.	middle
wabi sabied OK for a beginning understanding but very over done. The concept is lost because it is too well defined. Wabi sabi takes right brain intuitive thinking which cannot really be explained. Through book study one can begin to map out a foundation. The rest is gained through feeling and insight. It is creative spirit. I do not think wabi sabi means rustic. The term does not categorize in such a materialistic manner.	middle
informative I remember the laudatory Reader's Digest articles, the coincidental Kingston Trio song, and mention of Dr. Dooley by my high school English teacher. And, of course, I remember the disaster of Vietnam in the years following Dooley's death. "Who was this guy Tom Dooley?", I wondered. I know he didn't cause Vietnam, but he was emblematic of the drift that got us there. We had "victory disease" hubris from World War II, and Dr. Dooley was part of it. His vigorous self-promotion and the homosexuality revelations were surprising to me. It was the 1950's, of course, and his homosexuality was certainly kept under wraps when he was being hyped all over the place. I don't feel qualified to say this is a well written or poorly written book, but I at least know more about the influential Dr. Tom Dooley and, as follows, more about America.	middle
Good Story Despite the Writing I am not a big McMurtry fan because of his writing. He switches POV all the time and I have yet to read one of his books that couldn't have benefited cut about 20,000 words or more.Even with that Dead Man's Walk is a pretty solid read. It's episodic, like the other Gus and Woodrow novels I've read, full of violence and humor and pathos....these are his trademark and he does it pretty well, right down to the surrealistic ending. This is the book that purports to be the first in the series, even though it was written after Lonesome Dove. That's okay, the book is still fun (for the most part) and if you like the characters from the previous novels you will definitely like them here, too, as they begin their work for the Texas Rangers.Not the best and not the worst I've read from McMurtry, but still memorable...and in a good way. Check it out.	middle
fine but not compelling I wish the games were a little better. Some of the sound effects are a little annoying - of course they are the little ones favorites.	middle
Half a good album The first half of this album is absolutely wonderful, from the blase fatalism of Dominion/Mother Russia to the overblown theatrics of This Corrosion. But the second half is just sorta there -- it sounds like it was thrown in to fill out side-B after This Corrosion. Even worse are the two bonus tracks -- I like the idea of adding extra material to expand a 45 minute tape to a decent CD length, but in practice the extras almost invariably turn out to be material that didn't make the original album for good reason.Still, the first half of the album is good, and if I set my CD player to repeat after the fifth track it's as good as First and Last and Always.	middle
Truck good but... I liked the book, but I just don't think the many ten dollar words added anything to the book, in fact they may have hindered more than helped. I felt the writer tried to pretend he is just another guy only smarter than all of us. I do recommend it though.	middle
Not Bad But Not Great I almost stopped reading this book several times. It has a good story line but it wears you down with his self-destructive nature. I found myself skipping pages to get back to the dialog...not a good sign.	middle
Back to Turn-Coupe. Clay Benedict was only checking on his cousin's friend. He didn't expect to be drugged, tied up and drawn into Janna Kerr's problems. But one look at Janna's eight-year-old daughter told Clay he had to stay and help the ailing girl and her attractive mother. Romance, mystery and education about renal failure. What more could you want?	middle
well researched but thoroughly biased Mr Preston writes a thorough, albeit completely biased account of Franco. I expectd to read a book that measured Franco on balance, especially in view of the irrevocable political antagonisms that characterized Spain in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, Preston seems bent on ruthlessly attacking not only every aspect of the man's public record but also weakly constructing a sort of psychological profile to explain the General's every move. Interestingly, the more I read the book the more I gained a healthy respect for dictator and the role he played in setting the stage for the resurgence of democratic Spain after his death.	middle
Nice Arrangements Some very pleasing tones on this Miles Ahead release. After three or four listens, some moments stand out more than others. New Rhumba seems to stick in my ear the most.The overall sound has a more orchestral tone with more focus than later releases. No song exceeds six minutes in length and the jams do not go off the deep end. That may be good or bad depending upon your tastes. For me the experience just may need a little getting used to. But no doubt about it, Miles sure was a talent.	middle
ecclectic, low budget, wholehearted I'm just responding to the guy who thought he was clever by saying that "they couldn't afford a vocal processor..."Apparently you've never heard of an artist named Donovan, although you parents surely have. The vocal styling on the song "You Are My Son" is a tribute to Donovan's vocal style, and actually as original and courageous as a tribute gets.	middle
Kept expectation low I wasn't expecting much since I've read the reviews before purchasing that said the papers were thin. For my 5 year old just learning to write, it's good enough. However, for any other uses, I won't recommend.	middle
Not what I expected It took a long time to get moving, and even then there seemed to be some resistance to making things happen. I really liked the world he built and the characters, but it could have been done with tighter prose and more intense imagery. Not his best work. I will still look forward to the next volume.	middle
Good movie but bad quality I rented this movie on Amazon Instant Video. I've seen the movie before and was watching it to satisfy a Bollywood craving.The movie itself is about a family with three sons and a daughter. The first two hours are really happy and full of songs and dancing. The last hour is the family drama hour.Giving this three stars because the quality of the video is pretty bad. The image was not clear and the audio sounded a little muffled at times.There were no subtitles for most of the songs.	middle
Rules Change Played this game twice now with my 9 year old daughter and wife. The fundamentals of the financial learning are sound. But the rules make the game incredibly boring. For example if you offered a liability you must buy it rather than having the choice. And you can't always pay cash. Assets are only available to the player that drew the card. Where in real life there are almost always additional bidders. There are a lot of extra parts that don't seem to be needed (i.e. stands for cards). Stands for A few rule changes would fix this game to make it playable. With some testing the game could be great. It has the potential to be up there with Life and Monopoly. But it's not there yet. I'd love to help work on the game if the publisher would contact me. John at historic future dot com.	middle
Swimming in paranoia. A surreal film about one man's descent into shock, paranoia and despair. Burt Lancaster is riveting in his portrayal of a wealthy executive who cannot (or will not) face the facts of his family's disintegration. Lancaster's image as a macho guy is turned upside down in this film, as we see him in a vulnerable, almost pathetic state by the film's end. Clad only in swimtrunks (or less) for the entire film, his character is metaphorically naked, defenseless against an onslaught of jaded ex-lovers, uncaring acquaintances, and hostile enemies. An odd, arty film, outside the main of Lancaster's other work but well worth viewing for his excellent acting and the powerful message of the film.	middle
Libro con muchas preguntas y respuestas Este libro es bueno pero lo que no me gusto es que practicamente todo el libro es con preguntas y respuestas,para mi es importante,pero a la vez me interesa un libro donde yo pueda leer mas acerca del embarazo...sin necesidad de tener tantas preguntas ahhh y otra cosa es que hablan de un tema y despues dice vaya a la pagina .....(el numero) para leer mas al respecto,eso tampoco me gusto,porque te la pasas de una pagina a otra, prefiero libros con informacion en la misma pagina o capitulo.en general te saca de muchas dudas,y cosas importantes que toda futura madre desea saber.	middle
Lots of Creative Ideas, Potentially Overwhelming I enjoyed the fact that the author compiled ideas from hundreds of homeschooling families around the country. That gave a little glimpse into the lives of a diversity of homeschooling families.My main problem with this book, like the other homeschooling compendiums, is that one can quickly get lost and overwhelmed (or is it just me?) I just kept reading thinking "Okay, I will have to decide what out learning styles are and choose ideas based on that." Once I read a book filled with hundreds of ideas like this one, I finish it not sure exactly where to begin.Having said that, I still see that the book could be a very useful resource for homeschoolers looking for more fun activities to complement their curriculum.	middle
Not sure what to say about this Very distinct odor from the pills. Gross after taste that resembles 'black pepper'. Had to go to the bathroom 5 times every hour. I'm not saying it doesn't burn fat or water weight because it probably does. But it's not worth it because of how it made me feel.	middle

Good for Beginners I was disappointed when I bought this tape. I'm an avid exercise nut and I loved Denise's Ultimate Fat Burner. I guess I expected something similiar because of the title. This would be a great workout for someone just getting into workouts as she has some good exercises here, just doesn't do enough of them to do anything for those who are more advanced. I used heavier weights to get a little more from it but this is one video that is only used when I'm not feeling terrific or when I first start working out in the fall(I run in the warmer months and save the videos for winter). Some of the ball exercises are fun and even a little challenging, you just don't do enough repetitions.	middle
Not terrible First, I never saw the original so I am not comparing it to anything. Standing alone, the movie is just o.k. The story is slow and the dialogue is rather strained. I like Jeff Bridges, though, so it wasn't a total bust.Not bad but not recommended.	middle
Surprise! The concept is good, and the questions for us (a couple) are reasonable, but we aren't having any "fun" yet. Deck 1 is supposed to be fun and funny -- it's not. We're a little concerned about the seriousness of deck 2.	middle
Arrived Partially Discharged The title explains it all. Good product, I can only guess, because (1) a lot of it was in the box instead of in the extinguisher and, (2) thankfully, we haven't had a need for what was left.	middle
Predictable Year of Wonders was ok. It was incredibly predictable. I would call it very light historical fiction. Parts of it were good, but I was left wondering more about the real Plague Village servant instead of this trumped up fluffy character, Anna, who just happens to "blossom" into this superwoman heroine. Oh, please. For example, this woman was illiterate and within a few years she's reading and writing English and then understanding Latin in addition to holding two jobs, housework, managing a flock of sheep and raising two babies?!? Maybe they didn't need sleep back then or had more than 24 hours in a day. Oh wait...let's not forget nursing the plague victims. And don't get me started on the ending..... I won't spoil it, but it felt like it was the ending to a completely different novel with completely different characters. In conclusion, this is a good book to bring on vacation - an easy read with little substance.	middle
ya esta bueno! Suficiente. Me he leido todos los libros en la serie de caballo de troya y francamente ya esta bueno, por favor, no mas. El cuento estaba muy bueno en el primer y a lo mejor el segundo libro, pero ya. Se agoto. El estilo cansa, y se nota a leguas que la farsa del diario del mayor es eso, una farsa, y que esto no es mas que una novela, por lo que seguir pretendiendo que es una historia real es ridiculo. Como dicen en los estados unidos, el autor ha tratado de milk this cow hasta el final. Pues creo que ya llego ese final.	middle
A Great and Terrible Beauty (Gemma Doyle #1) by Libba Bray I was first intrigued by the cover of the book and then when I started reading it the plot is what really kept me going. I made it through the book, however, I thought it was lacking in parts and the story kind of drug on, especially in the first part.The characters were not overly interesting and I disliked most of them. Pippa and Ann complained a great deal making them just annoying and hard to deal with; I would not want to be their friends. Gemma was the most genuine out of all of them.Overall it was not a bad story and did do a lot of credit to the strengths and independence of women.	middle
Helpful tips, excruciating read This book attempts to help journalists figure out the thought process that goes into organizing stories. To that end, this is a helpful tool for anyone who has struggled to piece together all the facts of a complicated story as well as coaches who are helping writers organize their thoughts into a coherent, flowing series of sentences. The problem is that it also is a difficult read that is full of complicated flowcharts and takes a long time to get to the point. But if you can get through it, you will come away with a better understanding of just how it is you get from the notetaking stage to the printed page -- even if you've never thought about it before.	middle

Taxi Driver My thoughts on Seeing Taxi Driver,the film itself is complicated to explain,yes there is Intense Violence and you have someone who is not well,on the other hand You sort of have De Niro's Character and the Loneliness come through Raw and Gritty,I would call it a Gritty Street Film Not ART or A "Masterpiece",It certainly was not meant to Be Pleasant. Certainly Cannot Condone such behavior,I was skeptical because I thought maybe it was a Political Statement at the time on Guns and Violence as usual from a Hollywood Liberal Perspective,and it might be in a way in some sort of hidden meaning. It also just so happens De Niro is a Vietnam Vet in the movie or former marine so the Stigma and "Political Jab" may or may not be there for some including myself. I do not view it as a Classic but It is Eerie,And De Niro certainly pulled it off.	middle
Mono! Not to rain on your parade, but the reason it is finally being released and for such a bargain price, is because the film is unaltered from its original form and the soundtrack is therefore in mono. Yentl was released on DVD in Europe (region code 2) two years ago, with the same disappointing mono soundtrack and no extra's. Why Miss Streisand hasn't bothered to finalize her pet project and make sure it was released with a new digitalized 5.1 surround soundtrack is beyond me. We all know the film and score deserve it. Nevertheless it will finally be available in the States for home entertainment! Enjoy!	middle
ok read i enjoyed this book only because the dialogue between the h/h was sexy and some of the best ive read but the rest of the story was totally unrealistic totally give money to sb who had a hand in killing your father ????the sister being so evil unspeakably evil throughout the book and in the end does nothing makes no sense?! also i dont understand why since the guys brother was such a great guy why that whenever he was alone with the girl we were always left to believe he was about to kiss her also the bird and quote lady got on my nerves it had the bases for a great book if it didnt have the unrealistic senarios as if someone doesnt know when he has seen a ghost!but the words spoken by the guy especially in the beginning are some the sexiest ive read so for that reason i liked the fact i read it!	middle
It was all right. I bought this CD at Half Price Book without really looking carefully. I was actually looking for Fantasie (for four hands) D940. For some stupid reason I didn't expect this one to be four hand works. So when I first played it, I said to myself, "oh, what's wrong with this? Is the piano out of tune?" Then I realized that there were four hands involved. The two performers used only one piano, so it really couldn't be the piano's fault if it sounded out of tune. The difference of tones and colors of the two performers is what made it sound like out of tune, I think. Once this understood, I accepted it as it was.The next problem I faced was the selection of the works. I got tired of the poundings of marches after a while. All pieces are pretty much energetic, go go go!, and not very lyrical.Over all they did a fine job, but I will have to wait a while before I'll listen to it again.	middle
Can be noisy when on full blast I purchased this unit for my family room. It does the job but the fan is pretty loud when it's on full and and the mist emits from the lower vent. I can feel the cold moist at my feet and that makes having this on uncomfortable.	middle
"SOMEONE COULD'VE DONE BETTER" Although the D.O.C. was a new sound the delivery was a little suspect!, on funky enough towards the end put it on the needle and drop it one the one boyyyyyyyyyyyyy! sounded like a rasta turned rapper. the beats in my honest opinion is some of the tightest by dre yet, but the lyrics are not at all catchy. I think that we expected something new and this is what was thrown out at the time, im not at all hating on this album i do own a copy but, i still feel it could have been alot better if you think along the lines of gangsta rap this is by no means is this gangsta, gangsta.

Average Movie I finished watching Underworld Awakening and found myself unimpressed.The story for this movie just wasn't that good, and I would consider it the worst of the series so far. Kate Beckinsale carries the movie, but only because she is very beautiful. That by itself helps to improve or cover up the other areas of the movie that are lacking. Some reviews say they finished this movie wanting more. I finished this movie saying is this it?Kate has done a good job playing her part in all the movies, and they are lucky they have someone like her to make up for the poor story that she was given. I wish she would come to my house and bite me, but the movie itself was just mediocre. Good enough to rent one and never look at it again.	middle
Great Service, Not so accurate I ordered these tests and received them a few days later. I was pleased with the time frame. I tried them for a couple days with BFNs and then decided to try a different brand of test strip. These showed a clear negative, but the other ones showed a faint positive. I decided to confirm with a drug store HPT (First Response Early) and it was also faintly positive. I have had 2 days of positive tests with the other 2 brands (6 tests were all BFPs so I know it's true), still no BFP with these. Price and service are great, lack of results are not so great. My guess is that you have to have already missed your period for these to work, even though they say early.	middle

An Easy Snack Sized Read This is the story of Eddie's death and the five people he meets in heaven.It's a bit simple but I found it enjoyable. I liked the story, the characters and the way the story is told. It's not magnificent but it was good and moving and easy to read.More like a nice little snack of a book, rather than a meal.	middle

Item performs as described, good starter My daughter got the idea she wanted a violin, and this was a good starter at the price point. It performs as a starter should, but do not expect excellent quality. The rosin was broken when we got it, but nothing major. The case was a nice addition and she has been happy with this gift every since she got it. If you do not have dreams of a future virtuoso based on this purchase, then drop the cash on this item and see if interest peaks to where you buy a higher dollar model.	middle
It's ok, not what I expected The toy is ok. If you read most reviews you will notice that it was bought mostly for 1 or 2 year old toddlers. I would not recommend this toy for any child older than two. It really was not what I expected. For a baby, this toy is good and I would say it's pretty durable, just make sure you pull the seat way up for them to reach the pedal. It did not seem to catch the attention of my little one very long. I guess I did not read the description when buying this. I assumed the screen with the car was electronic like a video game when driving, however it is just paper with a car that goes from side to side. If you're fine with that then I think you'll enjoy it. As a stated for a baby this is good.The horn has sound to it as well as the pedals.	middle
Worked well but didn't last long This tub worked well for the first 4 months. Our son was 5 weeks early but we only used the hammock for the first bath - it just didn't appear to be sturdy enough. The recline position allowed our son to splash and have fun in the bath but he seemed uncomfortable where his bottom rested against the raised plastic area meant to keep baby in position. Since he was still too young to sit upright but obviously uncomfortable on the recline side we retired this tub and moved to a bath tub cushion which works great.If I could go back in time I don't think I would purchase this tub again, but there was nothing wrong with the product itself.	middle
Not durable but comfy Our dogs love lounging on this bed. They fight over whose turn it is to use it. I just hope it lasts a year. Their claws have poked holes in the fabric some dime sized some quarter sized.	middle

A nice FICTIONAL book Annie's Baby is an overall good read(thus the three stars). But 'Annie's' writing is odd. Like 'Alice' and 'Kim' she repeats things 3 times. But the one thing I LOVE about this book is when 'Annie' finds out she's related to 'Dr. B' and automatically knows who she is. I also enjoyed the tape transcription things where her and Sparks talk. You can tell Sparks tries to portray herself as a do-good pyscholgist who would never try to scare kids out of doing things. Despite the unrealistic factor it's an o.k book.	middle
Get the message If you enjoy dark humor, political satire, and the movie "Election" (Is that redundant); then I highly recommend this gem of a movie. The movie is dated; but the subject matter is just as important, meaningful, and funny today!	middle

The briefbits of grim reality spoil an incredibly wacky and delightfully unbelievable yarn I was all setto give this five stars in spite of the plot's cheerful implausibility and mounting of impossible coincidences. I can appreciate over-the-top screwball humor. However, one of the bad guys turns out to be too close to real life sickos to belong in this book's wackily fantastic universe where all that can go wrong does. I don't really want to scare readers away from this, but I do want to warn of possibly quite disturbing feelings during the last couple of chapters.	middle

Good not great This book is good, and that's all it's! I recommend you look at the many first-hand accounts that are out there. One isYellow Wolf: His Own Storythis is not just a first-hand account but it is also enjoyable read. You could also look atHear Me My Chiefs: Nez Perce Legend and Historyhere you first hand accounts from many different Nez Perces, orIn Pursuit of the Nez Perces: The Nez Perce War of 1877which has the account of Gen. 0.0. Howard, Duncan McDonald and Chief Joseph. In my opinion all of these would be a better choice than this one.	middle
Not very palatable I am not a trained singer. I am certain the exercises presented are valuable ones. There's certainly good information here. Unfortunately the singer's voice is so sugary and fake sounding that I can't choke this down. I absolutely want to hurl into a bucket every time she sings. How can I take advice from someone who thinks this sounds good? I hate to be so negative about anything that's probably full of good information, but I can't help it. I think this is awful. If the jewel case hadn't broken when I opened the package, I'd try to return the item. This is a lot of money to pay for a thing I hate this much.	middle

Better than My Frequency but could be better Ok call me a Tech freak,but Im so used to him throwing down these killer tech/trance/breaks tracks,and the fact that he has changed his style sucks.He's a great dj but why , WHY does he continue to add filler songs that are boring as hell in his mixes.To me this totally takes away the "magic"of the cd,and it's just another track that I program in my cd player to skip.Still recommended if ya like dance.	middle
What a disappointment! I greatly enjoyed the first two books of the series, but this one is a joke.1. Everybody gets more and better powers. And even more and better powers. No, really. What a cheap trick.2. Leena irritated me. The war maids irritated me even more.3. There are at least two plot points that received absolutely no resolution.Mind you, Bahzell's relationship with his God is always fun to see, and some of the nonmagical battles were nice. But this was as tremendous waste of time on my part.	middle
Average but not great While these locks were indeed TSA certified, the quality is very lacking. After two uses of the four locks, only two are functional. My gun cases take two locks per case. After the first trip with the locks, one lock disappeared in transit. I was left with three locks. After a second use of the locks, one lock will no longer lock properly.These are cheap, but required by the TSA. Don't expect them to last.	middle

Expected More Mr. Russ used all the appropriate quotes and dredged-up memories from the participants in this incredible story. It is the story and background between these quotes that is wanting.

Completely satisfied The book came quickly in the mail. Just loved the book, it has lots of wonderful pictures. It's very informative, has good tips for hotels and hostels. It breaks down the islands so it makes it easier to figure out how to get from one island to another within the same group. Being a vegetarian, I also enjoyed how they talk about the food it will make it easier for me to eat out.	wonderful

The Best Disney Movie since the Fox and the Hound The critics rated this movie well and it deserves it. It is a truly entertaining movie that can be watch by anyone and still be thoroughly enjoyed. It also teaches good morals to little kids, if you care about that sort of thing. One thing that supports it, and you'll notice it, is all the little humourous quirks they fit throughout the movie, ie: the character Pleakley has two toungues, the weird language Stitch uses and Lilo's facination with Elvis.It's a 5 star kids movie and it's worth buying if you have any kids at all!	wonderful
One Of The Best Fighting Games Ever If you have ever played a weapons fighting game, you will know that they are usually bad. I usually get bored of them quickly, and will never play them again. But, alas, this didn't happen to me with Soul Calibur 2! I am still playing it after beating weapons master mode (you can unlock over 200 weapons here), and arcade with every character (even the 3 special ones). Now, there are really no flaws, other then the fact that the levels are just to small to have weapons on. You can easily throw somebody off the ledge, and win that quickly. If you want a great fighting game that you can play for hours, with no major flaws, this is the one to get.	wonderful

Epakitin for Dogs and Cats This product is amazing! My very sick elderly dog was hospitalized for kidney failure. He was not eating and lost weight. Along with daily hydrating him daily through his skin, his doctor suggested that I use Epakitin mixed in his food twice a day. He is like a different dog. I mix this in his food and he doesn't realize that it is in there. He's eating again, and he's gaining his weight back. I would highly recommend this product. Also this is a hard product to buy, so luckily I found it on Amazon. This was shipped in a timely manner along with a nice welcome from the supplier. I highly recommend this product and will be ordering this again.	wonderful
Aesthetically pleasing and endearing This film became an absolute must for my film collection after watching it once with my family. The child actor, Catinca Untaru, is the centerpiece of this film. Her lovely Romanian accent, her naive mischievousness, and her chemistry with the other characters endear any viewer to the story. In addition to her presence, the film's scenes are breathtakingly beautiful, apparently without any special effects, and the richness of the colors and landscapes alone would make this film worth watching. However, the storyline is also intriguing, as are the nuances within the storyline that, while sometimes slightly disturbing (e.g. violence, tribal rituals, depression), hold the viewer's interest. I would recommend this film wholeheartedly, as would my entire family, because it inspires creativity with its exploration of the imagination.	wonderful
Love it, Love it, Love it! I would not have made it through the first 6 months of my daughter's life without this swing!

Great game!!! First off many people complain about the gore but I like it I think it adds to the action.It also has so many weapons its crazy from the plastic bag to the sawed off 12 gauge shotgun they are all good.The new radar system is ingenious not being able to see anyone on radar if they are not moving are talkin is great!My favorite weapon is the Hand Axe because if you hold the square button down long enough you chop their neck.The only downsides are no choice in characters, no customizable outfits,and no brass knuckles!So lets review.Pros:+ Great graphics+ Great gameplay+ Large amount of weapons+ Very fun when you get a killCons:+ Can be a bit slow at times+ No customization+ No choice in charactersThere you have it despite the bad things this is still a five star game and worth buying.	wonderful
Don't miss this deal! This espresso machine is fantastic! I bought one a year ago at Tully's and have enjoyed wonderful espresso since then without paying for each indulgence. When I saw them here I ordered another one for myself (in case mine ever breaks) and one for a gift. I've used the machine at least twice a day for nearly a year and it's still going strong. Remember, the grind of your beans is the key... too course and water just zips through and you get colored water, too fine and it takes forever to draw a shot. This is an amazing deal for a pump system, you won't regret it.	wonderful
PROFOUND This book explained many of the concepts I have known but never had the glue to put it all together before. Its made me realize why I've been going through the last 3.5 years of things blowing up in my face. I know this book isn't for everyone, but if you've been going through a tough time and NOTHING seems to be working, this may be the help you need. With me, I've known that fear was at the seat of my problem, but couldn't get beyond it without more understanding. Fear, and the many forms of it (hatred, anger, greed, jealousy, etc.) are discussed in depth. This book opened my mind, helped me accept what's going on and why its been going on. I now feel I'm able to more forward with new tools.	wonderful

A simple and effective way to learn basic endgame technique One of the basic advices is that you should study tactical puzzles repeatedly to improve in chess. I wonder way this advice is not given for other parts in chess, for instance endgame. Hall's "Endgame Challenge!" consists of 451 endgame puzzles. My belief is that by going through these puzzles over and over again, will dramatically improve your endgame understanding. You can buy yourselves an endgame reference book, like Muller and Lambrecht's "Fundamental Chess Endings", but in addition buy Halls puzzle book. When you have reached a rating over 1800, you can start to study "Fundamental Chess Endings more deeply. Until then, use it only as a reference in addition to Hall's "Endgame Challenge!".	wonderful

21st century Ummagumma, yet much darker There's probably nothing you can do to imagine how this album sounds, except of course seeing the film. Jonny has managed to play around with flirtacious melodies, fragmented movements, and chaotic rhythms to create 45 minutes of tense, dark and somewhat spiritual music. It's sort of a string quartet, jazz ensemble, and electronic stir fry. If you praise creative music, then you must give this album a shot.	wonderful

A delightful read! I borrowed this book from the local library not knowing what to expect, and liked it so much that I just bought a copy of my own. As a former caribbean native the wonderful stories about his childhood growing up on Cat island in the Bahamas brought back many fond memories of my own. Mr Poitier's writings are like that of a beloved grandfather telling stories about his life. And such an eventful life he's lead! Rather then letting the times he lived in limit him as an actor and human being, he found ways to go around and rise above the segragation and regulations that were imposed on colored people in those early days of his career. I hope he'll find a way to realize his dream of a one-man-show on broadway!A fun and inspirational read!	wonderful
impressive! "Impressive book and well worth the time to read. Property rights is the key difference in why capitalism works in the West and Japan but has failed in former Communist Staes and most of the Third World. The author shows that even where there are no property rights (think the slums of Brazil or The Congo), there are property ownership outside the law. If the governments made it easier for individuals to own property, this unleashed capital would benefit the government and those already wealthy as more wealth will be created. Well researched."	wonderful
I have mine over a year now...and it works wonderfully... i purchased my Shark hand vac after doing some research on handheld cordless vacs. It offered quite a few pros with 15.6V motor, quite a strong vac, and a good size for medium to light vacuuming.I have had it over a year, and it still works great. No issues with charging or the battery. The only downside has been that even though the filter is washable and works well, to find replacement filters has been hard.	wonderful

Great Multi Tool I spent some time looking around on-line at all the various multi tools available, I had narrowed the field down to Gerber tools but which one? The price is what finally made up my mind for me, at [price] it is a great deal.So far the tool has performed perfectly, the action to release the pliers works quite well ( and satisfies my juvenile delinquent self with its switch blade like opening ). The only item I wished that it had is a lanyard hole so I could tie the thing to my wrist. I spend a lot if time sailing so things dropped are things gone by-by.	wonderful
Excellent collection of its kind. The three films in this collection are fine examples of pre-code Hollywood. In this edition the prints are at release quality. It's wonderful to be able to travel back to the period and experience the movie industry back then.

Def Leppard reclaims it's title as pop-metal kings Def Leppard has done it again. Euphoria is the album which the fans have been waiting for. Euphoria is packed full of the energy which created the sound of Def Leppard. This album has a good mixture of old Hysteria sound, but has a touch of new direction such as the song "All Night". With songs such as Demolition Man, Promises, and Paper Sun, this album is definatly on its way to being a smashing success as it's previous counterparts of Hysteria, Pyromania, and Adrenalize. I strongly recommend this album.	wonderful
A must read for programmers and engineers alike! Norman does an excellent job of showing the reader that interface design is not simple a matter of putting a handle or some buttons on something. His in depth analysis of not only which interfaces are good or bad but why is an interesting and educational read for anyone who must create objects, devices, or interfaces that a person will interact with. The language is easy to understand and not heavily technical but still remains interesting. His examples are not specific to computer interfaces but to many different kinds of devices - telephones, light switches, etc. An excellent book for readers of any level - student or teacher, from junior high on up.	wonderful
The Bible for Thirtysomethings The warning from the Details'Review in the back of this amazingly funny and touching piece of literature is right: keep this book away from your girlfriend... Then again, it might be a very good idea to just let her read it, even study it, so she can understand you better or leave you right away, before the love you think you share becomes yesterday's one hit wonder.I wish I knew the right words to convince you to pick up this book. I wish I could tell you why its so great without giving away anything.

According to her, the rental one constantly leaks and fogs, was very annoying. Great deal from Amazon, was worth every penny!	wonderful
There is "Esperanza" for music after all I'll admit: I'm biased against current rock music, as much of it is generic waste. But Manu Chao is an outstanding original. The elusive Mr. Chao, former Manu Negra frontman, is a brashly inventive wellspring of talent, churning out quirky, catchy, funky tunes that embody seemingly every musical style in existence. I love the Zen zaniness exhibited on some songs ("Me Gustas Tu"), and the luxurious beauty of others ("Denia"). The musician's eclectic soul must be owed to his roots: he hails from southern France, but lives as a nomad of sorts in Latin America. Chao sings mainly in Spanish, but he displays an impressive multi-lingualism, crooning in his native French, as well as in English, Portuguese and even Arabic. Indeed, on some songs Chao mixes French and Spanish with such facility that it's easy to forget that they aren't the same language. Manu Chao embodies a true world music ethos, with a bohemian twist.	wonderful

Best Mario Party. Period I know the drill. Every Mario Party game is basically the same thing, so I'm not expecting everyone to see this game in a different light. But this game is slightly different. I think the formula is better than that of most other Mario Party games, and for the most part, I bought this so that my friends and I could add something else to our mix of Mario Kart get-togethers and whatnot and for that purpose, Mario Party 5 scores!

Valentimes Day Fun for all Barbara Park does a great job giving Junie B a personality for all to love. We all know of children in our lives who mispronounce words like Valentime with an 'm' instead of Valentine with an 'n'. Junie B. doesn't care what anyone else thinks it is, she likes it her way as usual. I love Junie B's excitement for the party and all of the Valentime's Day fun she will have at her school party. All was going well, until she got a card from a secret admirer. Nothing drives a kindergartener more crazy then a secret. She strives to find her secret admirer only to get a big surprise.I have read this story with both my son and my daughter and it was equally loved by both.

Franky, surprised. Very good quality. I bought this on a whim thinking that if it didn't work it wasn't that much money just to try it. Well, I was wrong. It works like a charm. There's a hole in the side that you can position at the height desired so you will still have overflow protection. This was great for me because my overflow drain is much lower in the tub than I would like. Not only does this allow me to get a higher water level, the water seems to stay warmer longer. Not sure why that is; perhaps the absence of the draining? In any event, a very good purchase that does exactly what it advertises.Also, I really like that there are many small suction cups all around the rim. It gives a nice tight fit but makes it easier to remove for cleaning. It was a cinch to install. I simply dipped the rim in a bit of water to wet the suction cups, put it in place and pressed around the edges to push each suction cup. Took less than a minute and was completely secured.	wonderful

Thorough and Well-Written An extraordinary book on an extraordinary place, A Natural History of the Sonoran Desert is well written for both the layperson and expert alike. Each of the diverse chapters is written by the expert(s) on those subjects, who not only know their subjects well, but also write clearly and enthusiastically. Chapters cover the expected topics -- geology, climate, human cultures, plants, and animals -- and the unexpected -- the uniqueness of the desert's air and light and its "deep" history. The Sonoran Desert is enthralling, and this book will heighten your awareness of the desert's beauty and complexity and will provide you with information on where to visit and what to expect during each of the Sonoran Desert's five seasons.	wonderful

Great storytelling. Benjamin Dill of Washington, D.C. makes his living as an investigator for an obscure Senate subcommittee. His investigative powers are put to the test when his own sister, a policewoman, is murdered.Briarpatch is an extremely well written mystery told as a third person narrative. Most of the action unfolds in Dill's hometown, an unnamed city in the southwestern United States.Just as in all Ross Thomas novels, there is plenty of urbane humor. However, unlike most Ross Thomas novels, the story itself is a fairly mainstream, straightforward one. Missing are the way over-the-top characters and situations Thomas fans are used to encountering.Briarpatch is a well crafted mystery novel noteworthy for having a very smooth narrative flow, an appealing cast of characters, clever dialogue and an engaging plot. This is a book all mystery fans will enjoy.	wonderful
I wasn't sure at first... I wasn't sure at first whether I should buy Steve Poltz's Cd or not, but after buying a bootleg of Vh1's Unplugged with Jewel, I had to get it. Two of the songs on the bootleg included Steve and I fell in love with not only his sense of humor, but his style, voice and emotion. "One Left Shoe" is an awesome album and may be compared to Jewel or Sarah McLachlan's albums, but we must remember that everyone has there own style of performing and although, you may not like Sarah's or Jewel's it's impossible not to like Steve's. I give him two thumbs up and five stars!	wonderful

B.I.G. set's the mood every time with this classic "Big Poppa" is a song that I can listen to whenever I feel like reminding myself of what it's all about. The life I'd like to live, friends, Moet, ho's, all for the show... Biggie Smalls cooked up a classic cause like him, I too love it when the girls call me Big Poppa!	wonderful
Loved it! I don't normally read autobiographies, but a friend of mine had read Lucky Man and recommended the book. I was hooked right away, I loved Michael's honesty about his feelings and all the ups and downs he encountered while managing his newly acquired celebrity status as well as learning he had PD. I thoroughly enjoyed his book and definitely recommend it. Now I want to watch Back to the Future again!!	wonderful
incredible confort i was having pain in my legs 'cause a was overweight and when i bought this product and started to use it i relaxed my pain every day and every night,you dont need anything else but this pillow.very nice and usefull	wonderful
The best U2 album..... This album has to be one of the highlights of U2's long and lustrious career. I really love the way they incorporate middle eastern rhythms and dance/techno into their progressive style of rock. MYSTERIOUS WAYS has to be one of their greatest songs, and the heartfelt ONE is a somber ode to the AIDS epidemic. UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD is one of the best dance tracks of the early '90s, and it is easy to see it as being a real forerunner to the trance songs we hear today. It's an excellent album, and one that should properly be put in the annals as a classic record...a real early '90s showcase.	wonderful
Draft inducer blower motor for '92 Janitrol (Goodman) gas furnace I was so happy to find the draft inducer blower motor for my residential Janitrol gas furnace at a good price. Internal design of shipping container needs to be improved so that the assembly doesn't move around during shipment and damage mounting flanges. Everything else was great. Fair price and shipping charges, arrived quickly.	wonderful
A Confidence Builder This book is different from the other "how to" painting books. It addresses the greatest artist block--fear. If your canvas is blank because of perfectionist's ideals and being overwhelmed by the "big picture," this book is for you. It takes you through several exercises of timed paintings intended to make you forget about getting it perfect and have fun with your painting. The idea is that with practice you will improve and enjoy painting again.	wonderful
Funky, jazzy, proggy. The Greatest Show on Earth had everything. What a great band! I love the horns and the drummer.[DW]	wonderful
A Movie With A Quiet Intensity Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson star in this movie, and M. Night Shyamalan is the director and filmaker. I love Shyamalan's work, and also recommend The Sixth Sense, which he also wrote. This movie may not be better than The Sixth Sense, but it is better than The Village and Signs (also by Shyamalan). It quietly advances leaving you wondering where the impact is going to be, then you see it and it is significant, interesting, and sometimes intense. If you watch with a careful eye, you will get the most out of this film. Be patient; you are in for a whammy of an ending.	wonderful
good chips The chips are really cool. they are heavy and seem of the same quality as the higher end chips. I strongly recommend these.but do not buy this set for the case or the cards. the case is probably gonna have blemishes and the cards are really plasticy (i understand thats not a word but you get the picture).all in all the chips are what you're paying for and the case does an ok job holding them. its a good buy.	wonderful

Creating a better world I am reading "Treating the Explosive Child" and simply cannot put this book down - if everyone incorporated this approach into everyday life, what a humane world it could be.

Conversational Brazilian Portuguese This is the next level in the Pimsleur course and it is excellent. In this course they start covering the basics (so one might skip the Basic Brazilian Portuguese course altogether) and they also explain how to use the casual and not only the formal way to address people (ie asking a friend or a child for directions vs. asking a stranger or another adult). I highly recommend this product...one short road trip and you are already able to use quite a few phrases. This course is entirely audio just like the basic course.	wonderful
Loved it! A friend loaned me Son of the Morning. We share books often, but neither of us had ever traded romance novels. I was surprised when she gave it to me. I thought I'd "outgrown" romance novels, but I was wrong! It was the first L.H. book I ever read, and I absolutely loved it! It inspired me to read other L.H. books (Shades of Twilight, Lady of the West, Touch of Fire), but Son... is still my favorite. It it a satisfying combination of romance, steamy love scenes, history, and suspense (not necessarily in that order). I couldn't put it down.My second favorite L.H. novel (so far) is A Lady of the West. Very different from Son... but very good.I haven't read a romance novel this great in a long time. I'm inspired to drag out my old Beatrice Small novels ;-).	wonderful
Essential Spanish guide Madrigal is the essential Spanish guide for all students of Spanish. You will refer to this book often in your studies.	wonderful
I love logic problems and this book has lots of them. The author says that it is not only the cards in your hand that determines your bid. He then goes on to prove it by showing a number of hands. For each of those hands he explains how the bid would be different in four different situations, i.e., depending on the bags, the bids by the other players,the score, whether its end game, etc. The explanations and the logic are very clear.The book makes you think. It brought out many ideas I had not thought of. I love to read about spades almost as much as play it, and this book was really enjoyable.	wonderful
What a Writer! Once I found one of Robert Whitlow's book, I purchase one and then another of his! He can weave a story and it' all clean and godly. Being a lowcountry gal, I identify with many of the places his characters live and visit which to me is extra special.If you've pondered about purchasing one of his books, do yourself a favor and get one. He usually writes several in a series so please read them all.ChristyCharleston, SC	wonderful

best baby "manual" on the market ...not that I am the ultimate expert, but I am a first-time mom of a six-week old son and have relied on this book. This is the best baby "manual" on the market. It is much more readable, realistic, accessible, and comprehensive than the traditional "manual," What to Expect the First Year. Robin Barker does not have an agenda, nor does she preach.Barker writes in a clear and accessible way, and Baby Love is organized in a clear, usable way. Barker also has a good sense of humor (Chapters titles "more about poo"), which makes reading Baby Love not only informative but engaging.	wonderful
Friggin' Sweet!!! How great is this CD?It has a cool cover of the song Mexican Radio and best of all is the hidden 14th track at the end of the CD,Rattlin' Bog,performed live!!! The speed with which singer Jason DeYore sings Rattlin' Bog(an old Irish song)is phenominal,buy this CD,now!!	wonderful
Deitel books are the best Everyone that thought they knew anything about PERL told me to by the Llama and the Camel books (well respected O'Reilly books), which I did. I was disappointed with them as there was too much text and not enough programming examples.I then discovered there was a Deitel book on PERL. I should have checked for that first as I have two other Deitel books and love them. This was way better than the Llama or Camel book. There are many programming examples and they are all in the context of a complete working program or several html and PERL files. That is exactly what I was looking for - examples, working code, complete programs, and not too much talk.I think the Llama and Camel books are for people with more patience. I do think the Camel book would be a good resource for more advanced programming.	wonderful

American history as it SHOULD be written This is the way history should be written. Bobrick's book gives the whole story of the American Revolution, from its origins through the war and the writing of the US Constitution. He weaves the words of the participants throughout the narrative, making a very readable account that is difficult to put down. Well researched, thoroughly annotated, and great bibliography.	wonderful
Not Only for the 3-7 Ages Just recieved my daughters Mega Tent this morning and had a hard time getting her out of it for bedtime! I have more balls on order and waiting to recieve, because it DOES need more to have the real "ball room" effect..50 doesn't cut it. My daughter is going to be 21 months and she's having a ball with this. I even took the tents and separted them into different rooms and one outside since it is too big for our livingroom put all together. And I attached them all together in a straight line so it WOULD fit one of the rooms we have and it worked out fine. I only wish that the two smaller tents had the plastic lining on the flooring like the biggest one does, so she couldn't crawl out from the bottom and get tangled in it when it tips over or the balls wouldn't escape if I put them in one of them. So much fun, I haven't been able to put it back in the bags they come with..so I don't know how hard it is to fold back up yet..but the instructions look easy enough. Thanks!	wonderful

This game was awsome! I loved this game!!!! I was so wrapped up in it that i ended beating it in 2 months (shenmue time) you were supposed to have finished disc one by around april, i beat it by the 5th or 6th of December, then disc two, finished that in a matter of (shenmue timed) days, disc 3 left you hanging though. I'm yearning for the second, which is due out this fall. The time system was excellent, fight sequences were extremely fun. My favorite part was the 70 man gang fight, i've never had so much fun! In real time, i beat this game in about 5 days, i was totally sucked into it. I have yet to find an equal match to this game, graphics-amazing, gamplay-good, story-awsome. overall one of the best games, ever.	wonderful
I wish I read this book 2 years ago (I am 22 now) I am young, and I was in a serious relation. Unfortunately, I messed it up. Then I found this book, and now I understand a lot more and know how to love a girl with her language, I wish I read this book 2 years ago. It is really good and make sense, it is probably the most worthy book I ever read. No matter you have a wonderful relation or not, you should read it, it only help you make your relation better and understand your partner more.	wonderful
A great book that;s a MUST for all Anne fans! This is a book that's just as wonderful as the rest of the Anne series. It's funny, it's romantic(though not as romantic as other Anne books), and it's interesting, not to mention being a great book that's a MUST for all Anne fans! If you haven't read this book, I strongly suggest that you do. You'll understand the following Anne books better, and besides, if you don't read it, you're missing out on a lot of good reading.	wonderful

Succinct, Fascinating Tales Courtesy of Thomas Bernhard In Thomas Bernhard's most capable hands, the 104 stories that comprise "The Voice Imitator" are succinct, often mesmerizing, tales recounted from genuine newspaper headlines and articles. These tales are quite literally, prose haiku, miniature essays recounting foibles of artists, politicians, scientists, and others from all walks of life. They may also seem like brief outlines for some as yet unpublished great novel, but Bernhard has packed so much detail that readers will recognize these as stories, not as outlines of novels. While this is a book best suited for those most familiar with Bernhard's work, others willing to take a chance on such brief tales will be richly rewarded by the elegant prose often pregnant in detail, as rendered in a fine English translation.	wonderful

Essential addition to every OH kitchen! Having loved "A Taste of Pennslyvania History", I was so excited to get this book. Taste of Ohio History is just as wonderful as the authors' first book.

The writing is wonderful and the descriptions of the restaurants and the recipes are such a great addition to my kitchen bookshelf.	wonderful

My God! Riveting! I couldn't believe this DVD was so amazing! One of our dorm mates bought it because she had been boxing lately. She put it on the big screen during finals and by the end of the DVD about 15 of us guys had gathered around yelling as these women fighters go at it. Each fight gets more hardcore. By the end of the DVD there were 15 guys standing around with beers just yelling at the screen. I hope this guy comes out with another installment. The craziest part was some of the girls in the DVD were really hot but damn could they throw down. As a dude who has some fighting skill I would be hesitant to fight the Mexican grappler, the tall Brunette or that Red head at the end. You'll see what I'm talking about!Have fun and warn your neighbors about the yelling and screaming.	wonderful
The Authorative Work On The Land Wars Unlike the previous reviewer whose academic qualifications are unknown, James Bellich is a well-known historian in this country. Whenever anyone in this country attempts to portray the truth about a shameful episode in this country, they are met with howls of protest and outright lies. History has always been taught here from the perspective of the so-called winners, very few Non-Maori know the true facts and sadly even less care. Anyone who wants to read the truth should read this book.	wonderful
Great read! This is a very entertaining and easy to read book. The book keeps you wanting more and I am hoping Ms. Mitchell will write a sequel.	wonderful
Really entertaining read I was born and grew up in Wichita, and now live out in the sticks near Udall. I loved the stories in this book, and I thought the author did a really great job in telling them.I always looked for stories close by hoping for a chance to investigate them myself. Definitely recommend this for people looking for a really creepy ghost story to get them through the night.	wonderful
Revelations Occasionally you read a book that opens the door to your heart for an amazing revelation from God. This is one of those. The author begins by showing that there is just as much death in the knowledge of good as there is in the knowledge of evil. It sounds simplistic, but this book helped me shift my focus from trying harder to growing more in love with Jesus getting to know more of him. The change is amazing. I highly recommend the book.	wonderful

great play -- feels very contemporary! I heard Franzen speak about how unfaithful the recent NY production was to Wedekind's anarchistic perspective. This is a brash and funny send up of modern society's sexual hypocrisy. Fast read, too.	wonderful
