DO NOT buy this product DO NOT BUY THIS DVD/VCR COMBO.!This is easily the worst electronics purchase I've made in the last 2 years. I returned the item after using it for 5 days.1. The remote control is terriblely made. The numbers are not organized in standard format (1/2/3; 4/5/6; 7/8/9; 0). Instead they're laid out in two rows. It's absolutely terrible design.2. It's impossible to program the VCR to record shows. The menu is nearly impossible to figure out even for a technically savvy person. I shudder to imagine my sister attempting to program a recording of her favorite show.3. The LED display is so small that you cannot see it if you're more than 6 feet away.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!	terrible
horrid Keep away. Buy at your own risk. It wasn't even as good as the Jean Rabe's past DL novels, which weren't all that great to begin with. The main character ends the book with the scale still attached to his leg even though the entire point of the book (which was the point of the last too). And another novel is due to come out. Bet it ends the same way.	terrible
Falls flat........ Listening to this, it's obvious that Danzig is in a decline. Circle of Snakes was rather weak, and this is the icing on the cake.Nowhere near as moving or powerful as Black Aria I, this piece is uninspiring and totally lackluster. Sounds like Era One of Mortiis. Only Mortiis did it better.	terrible

DARKNESS SMELLS REALLY BAD!!!! This film is the worst horror film in the last ten years. Even worse than the remake of THE HAUNTING...this absolute drivel fails on every single level. Except for the special effects which are very good. So you have a truly appalling film with cool monster effects. Remarkably banal characters that you just can't care about. The only effective part of this film is the first fifteen minutes and from then on it's a complete failure.The ghost suddenly fails to be affected by the light that is supposed to kill it or keep it at bay. DREADFUL does not begin to describe the incredible charmlessness of this sad piece of horse manure. The only good thing about it is that it made money at the box office. So at least someone got paid. I should be paid back for ever having to watch this piece of dreck in the first place.	terrible

Extreme disappointment I waited with great anticipation for the release of this latest book in the series, only to think that I was sent an incomplete novel when I ripped open the box. The book a very short; double-spaced with unnecessary pages for chapter numbers. In addition to being short the book adds zero depth to the story of Anita Blake. The last few books contained more sex than storyline but I held on to the hope that Laurell would redeem herself with Micah. I was wrong. The main topic of the book is the width of Micah's member and his tramatic past; which in comparison to the horrors that occurred before, is the least tramatic experience I have read throughout the series. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed, unentertained (I finished the book in two hours) and you will be too. Rather than "force" a book Laurell take a break and save everyone time and money.	terrible
This book was not helpful to me I bought this book expecting it would give practical advice about transitioning from breastfeeding at home while on maternity leave, to going back to work and pumping. But that was not the message at all. It turned out to be 200+ pages of "do whatever works for you and don't let anyone else make you feel bad about it." Not the worst advice ever but who needs to buy and read a whole book about that? I also felt patronized by the message that pumping at work would be too hard and I shouldn't bother trying. Helpful advice would have been information about employment laws regarding a woman's right to take breaks to express milk, information about which states ban public breastfeeding, reviews of different models of pumps and their advantages/drawbacks, etc. This sort of information was not in the book.	terrible

Will not work on Windows Vista! I purchased this only because of the fact that it stated it was compatible with Windows Vista operating system. It will not run on my Brand New high end computer.

Consumer Alert! Do not get fooled by the expensive price tag! Before you buy this one, go to the store and physically compare it to the other brands. You will see how heavy it is and how narrow the seat is. Not to mention the useless canopy and the clumsy handle. I absolutely regret buying it! My son outgrew it at 3 1/2 months which is WAY BEFORE reaching the weight and height limit. He was just so miserable in it (the seat was too tight for his shoulders) he screamed every time he was going in. I thought I haven't adjusted it properly but after reading the reviews online I understood that this is a very commom problem. I can't believe this car seat is still on the market!!! STAY AWAY FROM IT!	terrible
Rent it! Don't buy this should-have-stuck-to-the-small-screen movie. There are reasons for movie rentals. This is one. FX's are great. Script is so tedious and goes nowhere during the first hour. First five minutes are among the best. Try Cowboy Bee bop for the real thing.	terrible
Returned This phone dropped LITERALLY every call I made. I had to call 611 at least a dozen times during the 4 days that I owned this phone.The organizer and contact features are years behind in usability compared to SonyEricsson or Nokia.

Not "Hilarious" One of the worst books I've ever read. I'm sorry I ever bought and read it. It left me feeling sad and depressed. I feel sad if I even think about the ugly lives described in this memoir. When I see a review describing this as "funny" or "hilarious" I just don't get it. Did we read the same book? What is enjoyable about child rape, parental insanity, or slowly starving a cat to death?I would give this no stars if I could.	terrible
It's a movie, it's an ad, but mostly it's a waste of time Oh okay, I may have smiled once...with the ending credits. Though the previews looked sort of promising, this movie is absurd without being funny, illogical without being clever and so chock full of cliches and bad acting that the camera itself seems uncomfortable. To top it off, a large part of the movie seems like a paid advert for the Lincoln Navigator. So the joke's on us.	terrible
Bad Costumes, Bad Direction, uh...Just Bad all around Lordy. I remember watching this when I was a kid and then I saw it on TV again a few weeks ago. There were really, really hokey special effects that I could spot when I was a child. There were weird actors. The Meteor/Deep Impact/Armageddon story line make this a depressing visitation to a time when science fiction was still looked at as Sunday pulp. Somehow with all this, this Green Slime gets on one of the Astronauts, and then grows into a bunch of what looks like kids in bad alien costumes with big red eyes. If I can remember properly, this crud was produced and filmed in Japan with American actors, and it was completed quickly to try to beat 2001 to theatres. Cripes, I can still see the poor Japanese children draped in foam rubber with tentacles a danglin, getting shot by weird white dudes. I can't really recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen it when they were a kid.	terrible
Not an option for Verizon-issued KRZR. I read the other reviews regarding this headset but decided to give it a shot, since options are limited because of the stupid phone adapter. Even though the KRZR K1m is listed as being compatible with this headset, IT IS NOT ... at least not for Verizon-issued Krzr's. the seller, SF Planet, was wonderful. when i discovered the sound kept coming out of the phone and NOT the headset i contacted SF Planet and they responded right away. they sent another pair ~ along with a postage-paid label to return the original ones. the second pair did not work either. when i told them i have a Verizon Krzr, they said this happened to another Verizon customer as well. Go figure. Be forewarned.	terrible
Pro-gun control propaganda masquerading as a movie Could the pro-gun control agenda of this movie had been a little more subtle? I mean, everything from the evil gun company CEO to the portrayal of every 2nd Amendment supporter as a white trash, backwoods idiot with a mullet...I just couldn't tell what political agenda this movie was trying to advance. Even with all the cheap anti-gun emotional appeals, I still didn't catch on. I think I'll go out and do all kinds of stupid things, because after watching this movie, I no longer have any concept of personal responsibility. I can always find someone or something to blame for my own stupidity...Hollywood says I can!!Geez. Worst Grisham movie ever.	terrible
Waste of time from start to finish..I did not jump or squirm once Ok people said this movie was the scariest movie ever and I did not think it was scary at all I found Saw better and I did not really like Saw. Ok where to start there are so much bad things ok let me begging with the bad things.1.The first half hour was so pointless nothing happend.2.In the first hour theres just sex, more sex, more sex and yes more sex. Yes I can see sex in horoor movies but this was just pointless.3. The acting was beyond terriable4. There is no real plot to the movie5. The charactors are all stupid they all deserve to die. Now come on would you walk in an abanded factory NO and the main charactor dose are that stupid.6. It was not scary or grossOk now let me say the good things1. The one and only good thing was the last 20 min when things got interesting and the main charactor tries to escape.Over dont waste your time with this pointless trash moive.	terrible
Wish I had not bought this DVD Despite our love for W&G DVD's (such as Wrongful Trousers...), this was a HUGE disappointment for our 7 and 5-yo children. Dry humor, no action, hard to follow...just not fun. The entire DVD is nothing but a documentary format in which cute animals drone on and on, which after any of the W&G episodes, is just plain b-o-r-i-n-g. While we loved the W&G DVD game, this was a mistake.	terrible
Absolute garbage.. I can't believe I wasted my money This book is absolute garbage. I have actually bought this book and read it.

Bogus ad The ad for this product shows Sherill Compass 18103 as a compass with 5 degree graduations. The received product is Sherill Compass 18103 but has only 15 degree graduations. In addition, the tradename "Airguide" which shows on the picture in the ad does not appear on the received product.This is misrepresentation. The 15 degree graduated compass is of course cheaper and less applicable that a 5 degree graduated compass. 15 Degree graduated compasses of this size are readily available in many stores at about $8.00.I have no use for this product, as I already have several of this quality. What should I do?	terrible

Not such a great idea I bought this mower thinking it would be great for the environment, economical and fun. I used the previous reviews as a guide and went for the purchase. Big mistake. If your grass is even a bit high, you can't push the mower. We tried adjusting the settings, but that didn't really help. Either the mower is too hard to push, or the settings are too loose and the mower won't mow. And, forget about pushing it up hill, which means if you live on a slope, you have to push the mower downhill, drag it up to the top, and push it down again. Not fun. The handle is too low, which makes it difficult to keep the wheels on the ground and the tray gets clogged, constantly stopping the blade from turning. This is probably the worst $99 dollars I've ever spent. I won't even try to sell it at a yard sale because I'd be ripping off the person who was attempting to buy it. For now, this mower is only good for decorating my garage.	terrible
Boring I couldn't get through the whole CD because it was deathly boring. Stupid lyrics, uninspired playing, lack of originality. Some of it sounded like he was trying to imitate Lou Reed, but the imitation was poor. Every song sounded like something you've heard a million times before on one of those classic rock stations that is still reliving the 1970s. I did like the song "Candy", which briefly broke up the monotony.	terrible

Good idea suffering from terrible industrial design The four and five pin adapters are protected by two dust covers. These dust covers attach to the ground pin via an interference fit. Problem is, the pull tab for the dust cover is located opposite of the ground pin, so when you try to pull off the dust cover you bend the ground pin ninety degrees (see "customer images" for a picture of what I'm describing. The first time I tried to uncover the four pin connector the ground pin snapped off and stuck in the rubber dust cover.If you order this product, I suggest you immediately cut the lanyard that holds the dust covers, and be sure to pull the dust covers straight off while holding both sides -- if you use the pull tab alone you could pry off the ground pin as I did. This problem could be easily addressed by putting the pull tab on the same side as the ground pin.	terrible
Short term performance, long term regrets... I decided it was time to chuck the old 1960's toaster about 3 years ago. I bought the Cuisinart at the recommendation of Consumer Reports. I was bamboozled. The toaster has always been slow and results in uneven color. Never found that the defrost feature was worth a hoot. Now it will only badly toast 2 slices and than refuses the work again for 20 minutes. I have resurrected to old 60's appliance. The toast isn't perfect, but at least we can all eat the same time now!This toaster is a dog....	terrible

this does not come with a true digital copy For all of you people thinking about buying this for the digital copy and haven't heard, they are using a new system called ultraviolet. You don't actually get a copy of anything, you have to sign up for 2 different programs(ultraviolet and flixster), it IS NOT compatible with itunes, and it will only work on your device if it has an internet connection. If you want to put this on your ipod it won't work. If you're travelling in the air it won't work. If you don't have an internet connection it won't work. Again if the digital copy is your main selling point do not buy this dvd, and boycott anything with Ultraviolet "digital copies"	terrible
Insufferable The incessant self-regard in this book is cloying. According to Linda, no one has suffered as Linda has suffered, no one's pain has been as challenging a Linda's, no one's effort to overcome her pain has been more inspiring than Linda's. There is something very unwholesome about this attitude.Perhaps the self-pitying navel gazing is the core of her problems. For happiness take the focus off yourself and think of others for a change...for once!	terrible
Lindsay Wagner saves this boring melodrama I have been following Lindsay Wagner's career for years. First, of course, with The Bionic Woman, than with her numerous T.V. movies. Unfortunately, Ms. Wagner's choices have not always been the best. This is one of the examples. Voice of the Heart is sooooooooooooooo ridiculous. This melodrama is filled with poor storyline and bad acting (James Brolin and Victoria Tenant). Fortunately, Lindsay's abilities as a drama actress saves the day and this miniseries for being a total flop. The sound of Voice of the heart is also very poor. Unless, you are Ms. Wagner's fan, I do not recommend it.	terrible

If this were any more corny or flaky, I'd pour milk on it. Obviously, Steel Pulse has long passed its peak.

Waste of money The device is very flaky. It's incompatible with a lot of NICs of the leading manufactures (Intel, Realtek, Marvell). I have two PCs with Realtek network adapters and they both connect at maximum 100Mbit/s. On the other hand, my Lenova laptop and Iomega network HDD work just fine at 1000Mb/s.It's a well known problem that is not mentioned by NetGear in the unit description (and because of this I think they are cheating customers). Unfortunately, for me it's too late to return the device but you can save your money by choosing another switch/manufacturer. The compatibility problem is well discussed at Netgear official forum, for example here: [...] encourage you to read this forum BEFORE buying the switch.	terrible
Skip the first half of the book I found the first part of this book to be very boring, so I quite reading it. Then about a year later someone suggested that I read the book.

This book is garbage So I read the first 2 chapters and already 2 examples did not work at all. On the first example, the book asked me to create 2 files with the same name. Of course, when I did it the 2nd time it asked if I want to overwrites the file. Fine so I did that to move on.On the 2nd example, the book asked me to create 2 DIVs with the same ID. Of course, Visual Studio will complain about that.I kept reading over and over again in hope of an error coming from me but no, it's the book.I just ordered the book and now I'm waiting to receive it so that I can resell it back immediately.

Mystery Unsolved! Why I bothered to finish this book (when I didn't even like any of the characters!) is a mystery to me... as is the ending of Tartt's book. I guess I hoped that Tartt would form some kind of dramatic conclusion or surprise ending. But the only surprise was that there was NO ending and the mystery was never solved! I'm sure not going to hang around for a sequel. As a lover of literature, I usually come away from any book with at least one good thing to say. After "The Little Friend," however, all I could say was, "I just read really bad book!"	terrible

Don't buy used if you can afford it. I loved each of my iPods dearly...Dearly. Over the past 7-8mo I have bought 5 different ones. Each one did the dreaded "sad ipod" face either immediately or within a few days. My most recent one lasted a few months, miraculously. They all stopped functioning out of nowhere; I never dropped or hit any of them to cause this. Evidently the previous owner(s) did not take care of the ipod themselves. I would not recommend buying this used, and if you do, please buy a Squaretrade.com warranty. That saved me my money the 2 times I was unable to return my ipod to the seller.	terrible

I knew this book was full of it when.. I was reading it last year and got up to the scene where the dentist refuses to give him anaesthetic for his root canal out of concern that he would relapse into drug addiction. I knew this couldn't possibly be true. It was like a ripoff of Marathon Man. At that point, I realized I'd been had and threw the book away in disgust.I acquired the book accidentally in a mistaken book club shipment and decided to give it a try. The narrator is an annoying spoiled rich kid, extremely unsympathetic. Like most junkies, he's boring. He has no interests except himself. The writing is tedious. When I caught my neighbour reading it on the subway I actually asked him in disbelief, "You LIKE that book?" (He said yes. God knows why.)Come on, no anaesthetic for a root canal? You'll need an anaesthetic..preferably some hard drugs..in order to enjoy this ridiculous, overheated, overhyped book.	terrible
Not accurate. Bought the Omron HEM-790IT instead. Though it got very good ratings on a number of websites, I found that it gave consistently high readings.

I should have read the reviews! I also bought this for a refurbished Dyson vacuum. It was a link on the product page, so I assumed that it was a product the company covered.

Very disappointing This book was not at all what I expected. As a member of middle management I was looking for suggestions on motivating employees on more of an individual basis. Most of the ideas in this book I felt need to be implemented by upper management throughout the entire organization.

Pretty much what I expected I started reading this series of books with a jaundiced eye -- no one could possibly even begin to do Jane Austen justice. But I had a gift certificate to spend, so with nothing to lose, and very low expectations, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the first volume, but this second volume is more what I thought I'd get. Ms. Aidan's story could easily have been told in two volumes, with this book left out of the series altogether. The plot is highly improbable, and there is no character development to speak of. Jane Austen might have gotten a laugh out of "An Assembly Such as This", but "Duty and Desire" surely must have her spinning in her grave.There's supposedly a third volume... if I could find it, I'd read it, in the hope that it would bear out the potential of the first volume.	terrible
Valve leaks I bought one of these from Menards about 2 years ago. After I installed the unit and tested it I thought it worked great. The problem came when I got my water bill and noticed that it was significantly higher than normal. I went to my basement to investigate and put my ear to the water supply line going to the pump and could faintly hear that water was going through. I tried over and over to adjust the valve to eventually find out that my water pressure was too high but, if I adjust it to the 60 psi that the manufacture recommends than the pump won't keep up. I'm back to searching for a back-up solution. I thought I was sold on the water powered backups, but after reading reviews of many different brands I'm at a loss.	terrible

Caveat Emptor! I have tried to purchase this item twice from two separate vendors on Amazon. Both times the CD cover and the disc labels were as advertised, but both times it turned out to be a performance of Tannhauser, not Tristan. I don't know what is going on here but potential buyers should be aware that there are mislabeled CDs out there.	terrible
Poor comic book writing Terry Kavanagh is one writer who does the most uninteresting stories in comics. He gave us the Spider-clone saga and a teenage Iron Man. This story where he supposedly gives us the origin of one of the X-Men's most dangerous foes has now been contradicted by current stories going on in the X-Men comics and must be placed as one of those false lead stoires like those that have shown Wolverine's origins,	terrible
Quite a disappointment - except for ONE song... If there were a "no star" rating, I'd give it that. But I can't, because this CD has ONE saving grace: "Polkamon" by "Weird Al" Yankovic. It's peppy, it's fun, it's well written, and Al plays a mean accordion...! Not to mention that one line Al wrote in the lyrics for his diehard fans... you know who you are and what I'm talking about! His talent continues to amaze me. And since "Polkamon" can't be found anywhere else, it's well worth the money you pay for the CD, for this one gem of a song. Go buy it... and try not to step on little Pikachu on your way... :)	terrible
Famous "Lens Cap" Error I recorded about 5 tapes in this unit and now I get the famous "Lens Cap" error that seems to plague JVC Camcorders. It will record audio, but no video. This Camera is not on the JVC repair list. What a piece of junk.Customer Support is a mis-nomer with JVC. They know they have a problem, but refuse to even listen. Do not buy a JVC camcorder.	terrible

Yeah right ... Yet another protestant bishop attempts to 'save' Christianity by pandering to the demands of the liberal-left. It won't work Bishop Spong; the liberal-left will continue to hate Christianity no matter how you try to distort it in order to fit their creed of political correctness and so-called tolerance. Incidentally, if traditional faith is dying then how is it that membership of the Catholic Church is now in excess of one billion people worldwide?	terrible
Lame, Dumb, Waste of Money and Time Don't even bother watching it. Glade i didn't waste my money to see this in theaters. I was extremely disappointed. The preview made the movie look good, where as a whole it was just awful. Reminds me of Lions for Lambs, both were awful and pretty pointless.	terrible
Book was to old and printing difficult to read I was a bit disappointed in this book.Perhaps if there was more information about the condition, age and print size, it would have been helpful. Pages were yellowed. The book is small and bulky. I will be ordering another one because this one is not comfortable for me to read.It just so happened that my brother ordered the Dianetics book and his was practically new, large print and with pictures.His cost was less than mine.I was disappointed but not discouraged.The order was timely and packaged very well	terrible
Make the "i" in HORRIBLE sound like a "e" and u know what i mean!!! This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The story line is weak and the acting is horrible. For example, this woman got shot and she was like "I'm not dead yet, please go and kill him!" ok, that was just stupid!!!Also, they overdid the fighting and it was just too much, as if they tried hard to make it too amazing.Overall, HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!	terrible

Gates is confused. Shown throughout his book and video, Gates does not in any way understand the Afrikan experience, he blames Afrikan people for their past and as another reviewer stated the questions that he did ask were upsetting to the people and plainly 'stupid', his trip to Afrika was a waste of money, time and channel thirteen's airtime. I disagree, no black or white person should read his book or see his video, he is an Afrikan-American man with Afrikan ancestors and has totally forgotten this and has adapted to the 'hole' European world and its views.	terrible

This was the most boring piece of film I have ever seen This video had no point and was not entertaining at all. My friend was watching this video and I got stuck watching it and I literally fell asleep. This did,although, give me a better idea of their music and shallow as it may seem, their looks. I listened to their music once or twice before and Thought it was good dance music but now that I really listened to it, I really think that their voices sound awful and none of the guys really are that great looking, especially the one with the blond curly hair, I don't know what he was thinking.	terrible
Cheap oversized knockoffs that leak As sold by CS Imports, these are not vacu vin wine savers, not even close. It looks like this seller found a very cheap manufacturer to produce something resembling vacu vin wine savers in cheap black rubber that doesn't fit bottle openings and is probably the reason the seals don't work because you have to jam them into any bottle opening misshaping the rubber.They arrived in tied plastic bags with no labeling. This seller probably bought 1000s of these knockoffs and sells them as vacu vins. Don't waste your money. The cost is just cheap enough that you won't want to bother sending them back, so let this be a warning.	terrible

Clearly an amateur I cannot figure out where all these 5 star reviews are coming from,maybe the authors friends. Heavy on dialogue is one thing, but this book, if you will even call it that, is 90% dialogue. Not to mention the fact that the author's bouncing around from one time frame to another without any clear rational is the least of the problems. It's almost like someone did a first draft in a couple of weeks, and didn't bother to do any editing. I read a ton of books, and this might be one of the worst I've ever read. The humor involved is tiresome, cliched drivel.	terrible

save your money This Roomba is not worth the money. I've had one for only a few weeks; at first it cleaned well but missed large areas of my living room. Now all of the sudden it constantly shuts off for no reason. Also, seven hours charging time is too long for any device, and I think that having to clean the roller and other parts after every few uses kind of kills the convenience of having a vacuum robot.	terrible
The Best Packaging of Van's Bang Material Anyone interested in the work of Van Morrison is aware that Van recorded this material without planning for a studio album. Ironically, this work has been rereleased over and over again on one rip-off album after another. This is the only release that deserves merit. Historically, these recordings provide interesting insight into the way Van developed from the soulful pop/rock of Them into the stream-of-consciousness jazz/folk of "Astral Weeks". "T.B. Sheets" and the seminal "Brown Eyed Girl" stand out, but such lesser-known songs as "Spanish Rose" and "Joe Harper Saturday Morning" are what make this collection really enjoyable. Add the rarely heard "Chick-a-Boom",the original versions of "Beside You" and "Madame George", and an alternate take of "Brown Eyed Girl" and you get an important piece of music history. Avoid all other repackaging of this material!!!!	good
Funny movie! Worth watching. Funny movie with a good moral. I recommend this movie. Definitely not a "5" star movie, but it does deserve 4 stars without a doubt.	good

Charming, sweet, somewhat surreal throwback to silent films The three filmmakers are also all professional clowns, and about 85% of the film is without dialogue.Shot in a theatrical, low budget way, it recalls a smaller, less ambitious and philosophical Roy Andersson.It made me laugh out loud a couple of times, and smile a good deal. However, even at 84 minutesit did start to drag by the end, and some of the bits started to wear thin. None-the-less, thisis a lovely, worthwhile experimental nod to Chaplin, Keaton, et al, if not quite on their level ofgenius. But then, who is?	good
Kingston DDR 2100 Memory Memory card slid right in to the available slot. Nothing else required. PC recognized it on first power-up. And nothing fried !!	good
Good stand for a decent price At first I thought the stand was broken when I initially tried to put it together. The part that telescopes up and down would not move, and I was about to give up and start the hassle of returning, but thankfully, I tried one final time and really put some muscle into it. It was just stuck together and once unstuck, moved freely. The rest of the assembly was easy, and so far, the stand has been great. I don't really need to adjust the height that often, so I can't really comment on the durability of the plastic screws, but it serves me well.	good
BAYSIDE GOES ACOUSTIC, AND IT WORKS. I've always been a sucker for a good acoustic set. So I decided to give this new release a shot, since I have been enjoying Bayside's work so far. Suprisingly enough, these Bayside songs do transfer well into acoustic format."They Looked Like Strong Hands" would have to be the highlight of the album. The song's stripped down performance brings a new demention of feeling to it.Recommended to fans of Bayside, and those who appreciate the "unplugged" style.	good
Nice mix of tunes for multiple listenings I bought this after seeing the movie. I don't know much about reggae and after I did some research on it, and read a lot of reviews, I thought this would be a great introduction. I have not grown tired of listening to it! Most of the tunes are really great, they are classics, and I like all of the tunes. I only skip over a couple after I've been through the CD at least once (in one sitting) and want to hear some particular ones again. I do not hesitate to recommend this as an album. Only complaint is that Satta Massagana is too short!	good
Little Women: A Big Treasure I read Little Women after having seen the movie. I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these "little women" as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women.	good
This is one weird book Many in our book club liked this book, tho I found it very odd. A little too much fantasy for me. So there's that.	good

Lacing beads Bought this for my 3 year old who is finally showing interest in lacing.Pros: big, bright, colorful beads, 2 lacing strings included.Cons: box has no lid, I had to sand inside of beads (more than the manufacture did) so it wouldn't destroy the 2 laces.Overall we are happy with our purchase.	good
Not the best, but very good. Paramore's sophomore album is definitely worth buying. It isn't as great as all my friends said it was, but I liked it a lot. It has a very fast feel, but the songs tend to blend together after a while, so it took a couple of listens for me to really like it. Some of my favorite songs are "Fences", "Misery Business", and "For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic." They each have strong choruses, verses, EVERYTHING! And I love the lyrics. My least favorites were "When It Rains" and "Let The Flames Begin." "When It Rains" was a slow song, which I love, but it just didn't stick well. And "Let The Flames Begin" is basically a crappy version of "For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic." But I still sing along to every song, totally worth it.	good

Great Cast Album, Minus Franklin I completely agree with several of the other reviews of this CD posted here. While there are some great improvements over the original cast recording, Pat Hingle's Ben Franklin is often marble-mouthed and simply unpleasant to listen to.However, this only really affects a few songs ("The Egg" in particular), and ultimately the CD is well worth having.	good
Full of ideas, short on plot, loads of fun! This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.	good
Adult humor Hysteria is a funny, very good story. I thought it was good ADULT entertainment but certainly not for kids. .	good
Candle Alternative The day after I received this product our power went out. It worked very well and safe. I have used it outdoors and it was nice not to worry about the flame blowing out. Very realistic. As described. The only reason for the 4 stars is it is tricky to turn on.	good
Good but not great The design is nice, and fits perfectly under my Mac Mini. I could possibly use more ports on the front or even better on the right or left sides instead of the back. It's a little difficult unplugging or plugging anything in when you're trying to reach your fingers in between the cords for the mac mini.	good

Please give us COMPLETE rather than BEST Yes, this is a funny DVD and John Belushi really was an amazing character with both comic antics (eye brows!), mannerisms (H & L BROCK Tax Consultant with reason#3, "We lie for you...) and musical performances (Joe Cocker!!!!). However, consumers want the COMPLETE skits rather than what someone judges to be the BEST skits. Even if all seasons of SNL are released, the COMPLETE skits would sell as many of his comedic performances touched so many people in different ways. One Flew Over the Hornets Nest...... butter, butter with Raquel Welch as the infamous Nurse.	good
Great intro to the theodicy (evil) problem I used this book in a seminary class on theodicy along with two other books. By far, Inbody does the best job at presenting the many ways to look at evil in God's creation. Especially interesting was how the book takes views of evil and demonstrates how this defines our view of God. Some of the definitions were uncomfortable at best and really made me think about my belief in an all-knowing, all-powerful God. A definite weakness is the abrupt movement to the concluding chapter (the author told me his editor cut out the next-to-last chapter to make the book shorter). Inbody is definately coming from a process theology view in this book, but does so in a wonderful, fair, and comprehansive way. It's the first time I really saw much value in process theology.	good
A must for true Skynyrd fans! This DVD is truely a must for real Skynyrd Fans. Although someof the footage and sound isn't of the best quality, overall it'sgreat! It lets the fans relive some of the magic that they made.	good
Finally the voice of Penelope is heard I was drawn to this book by my love of Greek mythology. I was interested in the retelling of the Odysseus myth from the female perspective of the faithful Penelope and the twelve maids.I thoroughly enjoyed this and read it in one sitting. The voice of Penelope was believable and i loved her take on her family background and the rumours, tales and stories that revolve around her, Odysseus and her cousin Helen (another very well realised character). The only reason for scoring this as 4 out of 5 is that, although I am used to the convention of the chorus in Greek mythology, the multimedia aspect of this chorus just didn't really work for me.All in all though I would definitely recommend this book. I have been meaning to try some of Margaret Atwood's writing for some time and feel that this was an excellent introduction. I will definitely be reading more.	good
Picture Frame Picture frame was good as it was advertised. Low pixels but good picture none the less.	good
"Doctor who? What are you talking about?" I really found this episode exciting. Never before have I seen such a detailed explication of what it is like to travel through time. Who knew that the simple use of video feedback could transport one so successfully from 20th Century London to 100,000 B.C.?It may not be considered the best Doctor Who story ever, but I really found it interesting. I enjoy the historical aspect of the story--how fire was first used. Sure, it is very unlikely that cavemen would speak English, but I did enjoy how the four travellers reverted into that simple caveman talk.This was a wonderful episode!	good
all you have to know! this game is a very fun game you can do everything(fly any helicopter drive any car or tanks you find. and you can buy or hijack them.)But you cant fly any big planes or jets, and you don't have a parachute so if your enemies shoot or bomb your plane down you fall and die or you get low on health.The game is a two player game but only online.Overall its a fun game but the action like when you shoot isn't awesome like in splinter cell conviction but its still good.I would buy this game. And the fact that you can do everything is so fun. But you should buy this game if it has to be a teen game otherwise if you want another great game that you can do everything plus you have a parachute buy just cause 2 but it is a mature game!	good
almost there As usual Will Smith produced a CD that contains excellent tracks but as it is the problem of most artist...the CD is not all good.

Tales of Not So Terror This is an interesting of tales based loosely on Poe's writings. The first tells of a family reunion-the daughter returns to her family's home to discover dear ole Dad (Price) wandering around a cob web covered filty house in s drunken stupor with Mother Dear rotting in her bed (dead for 26 years). It seems that Dad sent the daughter away after the death of the mother, blaming the child for her death. ...The 2nd is based on the Cask of Amatillado, with the TellTale Heart and the Black Cat thrown in. Peter Lorre play Montressor, a drunken wino, married to a long-suffering wife. price plays Fontunato, a wine connessior. Lorre challenges price to a wine-tasting contest becomes drunk and Price carries him home,...The Case of Mr. Valdemar is the oddest and scariest. Price plays Valdemar, a old man racked with pain who uses a hypnotist, Rathbone, to ease the pain. Price also agrees to be hypnotized at the moment of death. ...A nice way to spend an evening	good
Down & out funny Yet another "Thumb" film. Bat Thumb was stop "No Face" from erasing people's faces. He is assisted by the meddlesome & whiny Blue Jay.

Better for adults than children I hesitate to give this book less than five stars because I really do appreciate good literature and Ruth Krauss. And any book with illustrations by Maurice Sendak is worth giving to a child.That said, the illustrations are the best part of the book. It is not Ruth Krauss' best. Don't get me wrong, I love creativity and the childlikeness of the poems included. But my kids didn't really get it. EVen though they are gentle and creative types, the poems appealed more to me than them. They couldn't catch the subtle sense of humor either.NOw my kids are young (4 and 6), so maybe they'll appreciate it more when they are older. And they did get some smiles out of the Song for Monkey. But I am not sure they were prepared for a new story each page, with very little connection throughout the book. Buy this for yourself and get the kids "The Carrot Seed" or something else.	good
this is a one size fits most I bought these for a 2007 Hyundai Tiburon. These partiucular mats are a UNIVERSAL fit. they are not an exact fit. These mats fit many makes and models. I brought the same brand for our other car and they are an exact fit for that car. The way to tell is to check to see how many different cars they fit. The ones I bought for our other car only fits that car.these mats are excellent and I recommend them. Just be aware that some are exact fit for one make and model and some are universal fit for many makes and models. I had to silghtly modify these universal fit mats to work better.	good

Good Enough for Me Doesn't feel exactly like a the Microsoft controller. The joysticks are a little to snappy and of course it doesn't sit in the hand the same because it has a different shape.But. Logitech peripherals are always solid and reliable, not like some of the horrible off-brand controllers that I grew up with (Matcatz, Niko, etc.) I wish it felt just like the real deal, but it's a small price to pay for a cheap, cordless controller that is so reliable.Oh and the receiver that you plug into the Xbox is big and ugly, but it's mainly because it's also a port for memory cards, instead of having them on the controller, which I don't like anyway.	good
Unique Sound I don't have the remastered version, so I can't speak for it, but I own the original version which is very good. I really like the sound on this disc, it's got a different feel for me than other Megadeth albums. It's heavy, but not as heavy as their three previous albums, but it's faster and more complex, imo. All of the songs on it are good, but my favorites are Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Rust in Peace and my very favorite, Five Magics. As I've said, while this is their fourth album is sounds different from the first three and all others that follow it. I really like this disc and sometimes throw it in when I'm in the mood for some Megadeth but with a bit of a different sound.	good
still relevant, still scandalous I became interested in this book after viewing a documentary on the 1950s entitled "Let's Play House." The story seemed very intriguing, a stark contrast to the typical portrayals of the fifties seen on "Leave it to Beaver" and "Ozzie and Harriet." While this book is no literary classic, I found myself drawn into the lives of these characters. I wasn't sure this book would still be as shocking by 2004 standards, but I was surprised to find it still rings true. Obviously, it's not AS taboo as it would have been in its day, when people only mentioned it in hushed voices to their closest friends. The author clearly HAD something with this book. I was glad to curl up with it each night, and would recommend it to almost anyone, except perhaps some younger readers.	good

SHONEN KNIFE 101 Urban legend has it that if THE MONKEES had gender reassignment surgery, wore colorful matching jumpers, ditched the goofy one and moved to Japan they'd be SHONEN KNIFE. I, however, beg to differ. Consider the evidence. Would those 60's relics be able to come up with eleven jamming tunes that would have you rocking and smiling at the same time? Would Davey and company be even remotely genius enough to swipe a killer riff from JUDAS PRIEST'S "LIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT" and fracture it into a loving tribute to brown mushrooms? Surely, I think not!!!Get the knife and see the light!!!	good

Great movie, ok quality This moving is amazing, and the plot is hilarious. Marilyn and Jane make a great pair especially with the musicals. However, the quality is a bit off, but not too bad. When they first get on the boat the whole screen look like a purplish-pinkish color, but it goes away after they leave their cabin. Buy it, its a great movie.	good
Good Choice for Easy Viewing The reason I got this unit is that I replaced my old keyboard with a new one and did not realize the new one had incredibly small and dull letters on the keys. I am not a complete touch typist, and have to look at the keys often, and I type in the dark a lot. So, since I hated my new keyboard and had to replace it, I figured I would go all out and get this. It meets and exceeds my visual expectations.The touch is a bit clickety and the volume control does not have the minute (that's 'my newt') graduations I enjoyed on previous keyboards. Hence the loss of the fifth star. Still, it's a good buy.	good
Very satisfied but, still wishing:) The lightweight compact size makes it very convertible. We bought it to keep the battery on our sailboat topped up. Start out with a fully charged battery and it will maintain. However, if you put a serious draw on the battery and run it down it will take days to recharge it. Easy to carry and keep any electronic equipment charged while out in the wilderness doing that wilderness stuff.This is the first solar panel we have ever purchased and are very pleased with its versatility. Wish I had gotten the larger one for the boat. Product was received much earlier than expected.	good
cute shoes These are really cute and my daughter loves them, but they run pretty big. They also light up, which is cute.	good
Intermatic timer works well I have the Intermatic FD60MH 60-minute Spring Loaded Wall Timer wired to a towel warmer. It works quite well, but is a bit noisy. You can hear it ticking 10 feet away. It seems very well made and will probably be quite reliable over the years. Since the timer uses a spring mechanism, it does not draw power to use it, or in standby mode, as some digital timers do. The small form factor of the timer allows it to be installed in a double wall plate - with another switch next to it.	good

Brother's fav My brother seems to like this series, I don't really get it but it does have an interesting story. Not sure what's going on in it though.	good
Great product As far as kids, they love it ... period. For me, I like that the bottom of the "tent" is the actual bed sheet so regular washing is easy. We had to convince our youngest to sit down before getting out of bed though as the elastic on that side can be a trip hazard. I don't see this as an issue if you have carpet in the room but even if you have flooring, it was an easy adjustment. We don't want them jumping out of bed anyway but they do get a little excited when playing in the tent.	good
nice collection This is the most complete collection of Dionne's Arista hits so far. The only drawback is that there are no lyrics and liner notes. Maybe a showcase of her album covers should be included too. Sony BMG can also consider releasing a DVD featuring her videos (if she has any) so that we can keep it as a collection of our memories.	good
concise resource When you're ten years out of school, and you still reach for a book you used in college, you know its valuable. I reach for Bube as a refresher very frequently. Its not flowery, but it has just enough figures and just enough math and explanation to cover most electronic phenomena. Photoemission, field emission, photoelectric effects, schottky barriers, etc. are covered well enough so that you can tackle a calculation of a particular phenomenon when necessary.	good
Term Limits The first time I have read Vince Flynn. This book so mirrors todays goverment it was uncanny. I really enjoyed it and will read more of Vince Flynns books.	good

Amazon's terrible service My daughter is a Pink Panther fan. In November,, i ordered3 Pink Panther movies in November. In November three were sent out. Somehow, two out of three were sent to the wrong address and arrived in February. She had already left for college.My wife and I love to watch the Quiet Man for St Patrick's Day. Order shipped a couple of weeks ago. DID NOT arrive before St Patrick's Day. There is no way to contact a human at Amazon. Not able to write Amazon to inquire. Can only contact them to order more items. Movie is good. You may want to get it somewhere else unless you feel like waiting three months.	good
Pointless descriptions until the ending When I was given this book to read by my grade eight teacher, I was excited at being given the chance to read a real "classic." However, I soon changed my mind when I got into the long decriptions just after the beginning of the book. I was optimistic in the first few chapters, hoping that a real plot would soon develop. I soon realized that there was no such hope. I have never heard about Dickens being paid per line, but that would certainly make sense. With the exception of Sydney Carton, the characters were flat and too good to be true, especially Lucie. The redeeming feature of this book was the ending, which, I admit, made me cry.	good
Handy Jars They're working out very well for me. Unfortunately they're not quite (sooo close) the same size of the spice jars I have, even thought they look the same, so I have to be sure to keep the right lids with the right jars. Otherwise, they're great!	good
Great listen . I really enjoyed this novel. Read it as an audible and looked for ways I could find a time to continue to listen .	good
Beautiful I've never really been into American Alternate Music before, but I don't like to limit my taste in music and when I heard "Don't I Hold You" single once on BBC Radio 1 I was transfixed. I bugged my dad for ages to help me find it hoping that the album would be as good as that single. It was! The fantasic guitar chords and beautiful words totally infiltrated my brain! The single "Don't I Hold You " is one of the most moving tunes I've heard (along side "Iris" by Goo Goo Dolls). Believe me if you're a girl at "that time of the month" you won't be able to stop crying for hours. It's haunting. "And Someone with Strength", "Body Talk" (parts 1 and 2) are fantasic examples of well written songs. Only god knows why "Wheat" haven't been promoted enough in England..they deserve more notice and recognition in the UK.	good
Interesting I found this book to be different that some of the other books I've read by Ted Dekker. Especially since there was no main killer, still villians, but not in the type of "serial killer" that seems to be prevalent in other books of his that I have read.I liked the main characters and the twists and turns this book took.Again, towards the end of the book it got a little on the long side and a bit boring, like you just wanted to get the book over with. Of course then when you are finished, you feel like you want to keep reading.Seems to happen with most of the Ted Dekker books I've read.Good mystery with lots of twists and turns.Also, not sure why but this book goes by different titles - like he wasn't sure what to call it at first, and the book jackets are always different.	good
Dreaming of You The main reason to get this CD is because it contains that "other" Diana Ross / Lionel Richie duet -- "Dreaming of You." It's a fun Motown song and only for that reason I give the whole soundtrack 4 stars. Okay, it's fun to hear KISS sing Disco (around this time Gene Simons & Diana Ross were an item), but the soundtrack could have been a bit more exciting. Ross makes it worthwhile though (if you like the song Endless Love, check out Ross's solo version of the song on Why Do Fools Fall In Love).	good
oldie but goodie i watched this years ago and for a old film it still is a good one would recommend this film for anybody that like this type of movie	good
jazz house grooves i purchased this cd because i was curious the title sounded like it had some serious grooves on it and guess what it did, the musicians on this cd are correct. this cd will satify the house music side of you and the jazz side of you some good solid hard knocking beats that will get keep your but moving,and some tight jazz that will leave you wanting more.	good
THE CHILD DEVIANT This is quite possibly as good as it's ever ganna get for this band. The lyrics are meaningful and intelligent, the music is well composed, and the album is well engineered and produced. Godhead have a typical neo-industrial/radio-gothic style that is hardley anything original....Nevertheless, it's the sincerity of this record that makes it special to fans. It's well worth checking out.	good
A nice gift: A book This book makes a nice gift for a person who heard about the event described in the book and is interested in learning more details.	good
Works as expected This is my third electric grill in 3 years. My wife says I am picky but I just want my pancakes to be evenly cooked from one end of the grill to the other. This grill does the trick at a little under 350'. I let it heat up for about 10 minutes and then cooked 8 pancakes across the entire grill. They all came off perfectly browned something my other grills could not do. I had hot and cold spots that prevented me form using the entire grill and sometimes even the same pancake was half cooked. This grill cook evenly. It sits perfectly flat and came pre-assembled. I think it is well made and it is pretty heavy which is a good thing. Some people complain about the handles being cheaply made. Well that is why I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars. They got the grill part down to 5 stars but the handles are 3 stars. If they improve them and make them a little thicker and nicer it would match the grill. They sort of put Pinto hubcaps on a Mercedes.	good
The last good SYL This is the last of the good SYL albums. Heavier than a Really Heavy Thing started the chaos. That album actually SCARED a few of my friends!! No joke -good stuff indeed. Then City came out and took it to the next level. City, IMO is still in my top ten albums of all time -one of the heaviest things you will ever hear. Alien came along and is almost as heavy and pounding as City. The song Zen is one of their best ever. But this album is where you can definitely hear the change in style starting to take place. The album after this one almost made me sick -it was terrible... and embarassing!	good
Smells wonderful and is soothing, but a little greasy The scent of this creme alone is worth purchasing it, in my book. I love naturally scented products, and this one smells nice without hitting you over the head with a baseball bat of manmade chemical perfumes. The creme is definitely soothing and terrific for dry skin on hands, elbows and even feet. I do find the creme to be a little more greasy than I normally like, but as long as you don't intend to use your computer immediately after applying the creme, you'll be fine. It absorbs into the skin in time, just not immediately as one might assume. Also, a little of this stuff goes a long way, so you get your money's worth.	good
Visceral charge... This film really digs into the core of your being and overwhelms your senses with jarring imagery and sound. The transfer of this film to the new Blu-ray format is great, considering this movie is now over 30 years old. Also, the extras and the 5.1 mix make it a worthy release. There is some grain to the picture, especially during the evening scenes, but overall, the print looks great. Tobe Hooper liberally uses tracking dolly shots in this offering, and it becomes tedious after a while, but it really sets the mood--as if the camera is another character in the piece. As a fan of more mainstream horror, it took me a while to warm up to this picture, but this edition is a prized addition to my collection.	good
Don't Listen to ... This CD is a triumphant return for Blues Traveler. I bought Blues Traveler's 1st album in 1991 and ever since I have followed the band's music pretty closely. The last two albums did not do much for me, but this one does. It is filled with inspired lyrics and musicianship. If you dig the BT sound, but lost interest when they ventured into the radio world pick up this cd. The review by ... is a joke. Open the sunroof, turn it up and enjoy! Great music by a great band.	good
Vibrant Life in a Dead City Kevin Brockmeier's novel, A Brief History of the Dead, brings a thought provoking story framework around an old idea - that the dead exist in a place based on who remembers them in life. His story: What if Everyone Dies and no one is around to remember the dead? It's so well-defined and character driven that the lives he gives to the dead are rich and beautiful. I've been thinking of this story often since reading it, and that's the true test of whether a novel works or not.It's not all great, however. Where I think A Brief History of the Dead failed is that it took a decent concept and then went "end of the world" with it. Brockmeier tried to make it too significant, too important, and in the end I thought it was an impersonal story, so for me it failed.** Note, this is an edited review. I thought about it for several months before realizing that the flaws came through with contemplation. Please accept my revision with that in mind.- CV Rick	good
Is Fox slanted? Its almost a funny thing to debate whether Fox is an actual news network. What is it that makes the devil so good at his job? He mixes truth with his lies. Of course Fox News isn't evil, but they are trying mighty hard.This film was a good documentary that succeeds in spite of itself. Luckily for the film makers the truth basically tells the story and the slow mish-mash of mediocre editing takes little from the intent.Good but not great. Preaching to the choir.	good
one wild ride This one kept me on the edge of my seat. Please, forget the horrible movie that was later made from this work, like many of Kings work it was butchered on screen. The book itself is wonderful example of why millions find his work so entralling. I think Stark is without a doubt one of Kings best villians. (rumor had it he had contemplated writing a book under the stark name...pity it never surfaced I can only imagine the severity of the violence that it would have held.) Just remember...the sparrows are flying again.	good
A really long damage control flick... and so much more I dug it. There pre-deployment party was the best scene. I've actually been to parties like that! I will have to say, when I first saw the move (in the theator) that scene alone, signaled that this movie was going to be good, no Hollywood junk but a good rendition of a U-boat in WWII, under hard conditions. It portrayed the circumstances very acurately. I've been on quite a few older ships, sailing around the western pacific, so the life-at-sea conditions were well done. The director went to painstaking detail in bringing us an excellent rendition of the times. Bravo!	good
Great supporting cast I really enjoyed this book. I thought the magic system andit's ethical questions were interesting. I somewhat agree with the reviewer that felt the women were stereotypical, but Myrrima turned out to be one of my favorite characters in a long time. My only problem with the book was Gaborn, who I just could not bring myself to care about. It seems as though much more effort was put into the creation of the supporting cast, whom I found fascinating and unconventional, with several twists on standard characterizations.	good
Thought-provoking ...or perhaps more to the point, imagination provoking. This book somehow seems to open up your peripheral vision. It gets a bit bogged down sometimes - skim those parts, but well worth reading!	good

RARE 65MM FILM FROM 1930 This is a must for people interested in the early widescreen films that were made between 1929 an 1931. (11 features). Only one has been considered as being lost.That was FOX MOVIETONE FOLLIES OF 1929 (70MM). I have nine of the films on dvd that were made and am only missing KISMET (1931) and Fox Follies. A SOLDIER'S PLAYTHING was filmed in 65mm (Vitascope).This film ,when first released, used interlocked Vitaphone discs for the soundtrack.Does anyone have a copy of KISMET (1931)? I would be interested in buying a copy.	good

Good Product The LED isn't as brite. Would prefer a hard wired voltage light instead. The batteries get weak if they are left on incidently over night. It feels good as a shifter, but you have to tighten the screw when the weather changes from hot to cold. Keep a tool in the car and you will be fine.	good

Scott's Review I am a 7th grader at Washingotn middle school. We have just read this book in class and I really enjoyed it. I feel that Clemence McLaren did a good job portraying the good side of Helen and Cassandra. In most of the other books Helen is very mean and snobby. Cassandra who is cursed by Apollo. Even with her sight of the future, nobody will believe her. In this story however she tries to do good, but to no avail. Altogether the book was very exciting filled with treachery and secret plans.Thank you, George Namilton	good
This book is an eye catcher, and a great seller. This was a great book. It tells how a Japanese American is judged by an whole island. The Japanese American, Kabuo Miyamoto, is being charged of a fisherman's murder. I like how the story first takes place in the courtroom. While I was reading it, I felt if I was watching it on television. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat making you read more into the book. This book is a mystery, a thriller, and love story wrapped into one novel. If you like mysteries and you want to find out the truth of the murder, then I really think you should read this book.	good
Nice Job! I have all the ice guides to colorado, and this one is about the only one I trust. Ratings are, in my experience, slightly conservative, which is better than being the other way, particularly for ice climbs where getting in over your head can be very serious. Route information is, for all the routes in the book I've done, very accurate.	good
Hooray for "Halting" This review is a collaborative writing project completed by the students in a "Technology and Ethics" class at DeVry University in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is based on a quick look at the book under consideration.This book has several virtues. It provides a simple step-by-step process to keep hackers out. It also provides supportive links where you can download software to protect your hardware as well as business information. The simple wording allows you to concentrate on your work while helping you protect what you are working on.Although this book is outdated, it would still be helpful in setting up a security policy. The illustrations in this book would not be suitable for some business environments; however they would be useful for the individual computer user.I would recommend this book to beginners in the computer technology field. This book comes with a useful CD-ROM that contains software and added resources.	good

Different from his other work, but a fun read. Peter Mayle has written other books of his life in Provence, but this tale is a novel, complete with a hysterical plot, and, of course, meals that will make you wish you lived in France. This book is very entertaining, and a fun, quick read.	good
A comprehensive overview of business ethics In Ethics and the Conduct of Business, Boatright presents a well thought out and comprehensive study of Business and Ethics. Tracing the historical foundations of business ethics and deeply examining the moral, legal, and economic prespectives proves to be a worthwhile reading experience. Sometimes and bit dry but easily understood with worthy case examples, I would reccomend this book to any interested party.	good
Classy debut Woody Allen stars and directs for the first time, and what a success it turns out to be. There are many great sight gags as well as the usual number of quality one-liners. The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!	good

Power Rock'n Roll! "Mary Jean" was power-rocker and rock'n roll reviver Marshall Crenshaw's fourth album. It was originally released in 1987, same year as the La Bamba movie, in which Crenshaw played the part of Buddy Holly and gave a terrific version of "Crying, Waiting, Hoping". In fact, this was the song that made me notice Crenshaw."Mary Jean" is probably one of Crenshaw's most consistent albums, featuring 9 Crenshaw originals and a cover of Peter Case's "Steel Strings".Most tracks are upbeats catchy power-pop songs; and the opening track "This is Easy" sets the right mood from the beginning. A string of similar great tracks like "Calling Out For Love", "Somebody Crying", "Mary Jean" and "Till that Moment" follows. Only "A Hundred Dollars" and"Wild Abandon" disappoint.The only ballad "They Will Never Know" closes a fine album. Besides being a prolific songwriter, Crenshaw is a fine singer and guitarist, and there is usually a lot to enjoy on his albums.	good
A good read with some good lessons I doubt "eBoys" was intended to read as a period piece, but it certainly does in the post-technology bubble world. There are a couple things that come across loud and clear: first, these venture capitalists were not blind to the bubble that was forming; second, if they wanted to stay alive and relevant in their field, they needed to keep financing new companies and unwillingly participate in furthering the bubble.The story is well-told and gives you an insider's view of how at least one venture capital firm makes the decision of who gets funding and who doesn't. It also serves as a cautionary tale about how even the most sophisticated investors get sucked into bubble mentality.A valuable read for investors, entreprenuers, and aspiring venture capitalists.	good
What a fun read! Nicely done. A very cool, tongue-in-cheek, send up of the television industry wrapped in a murder mystery. Loved the thinly veiled characters that Mr. Goldberg salts the book with - especially Esther Radcliffe.A fun read, a worthy read. Don't miss out on this one. And check out the sequel, "Beyond the Beyond".	good
Let's keep it that way. Not one of the worst books I've ever read but pretty close. Sorry I bought it and am not passing it on to friends. Perhaps it was the subject matter that first intrigued and in the end alienated me but I had to force myself to finish because I couldn't believe the plot. I kept hoping for some relevant message. Mary Magdalene, the original feminist and Mary the Mother of God, the worn out, bitter, stay at home Mom? I won't even try to describe her take on Jesus. Not my cup of nectar. I'll certainly make every effort to keep this book a "secret".	bad
Not worth the trouble of reading What I was expecting was a list of double speak terms and their definitions.What I got was a list of words with a bunch of biased opinions and allegations toward certain groups of people who may be in some way associated with those words.This book is not only politically offensive it's also outdated and in many places plain wrong.The definitions provided show a lack of research and a great deal of assumption.The book is a mish-mash of thrown together words, many of which are not even double speak. Many of the words are netisms and acronyms. Its lack of organization makes finding a particular word difficult.I was expecting words used in car commercials and medication adverts to be defined (words like "customer cash" and "APR" that are real doublespeak words), but they were not.This self-purported "dictionary" is nothing doing.	bad
Don't Plan on Keeping This a Long Time Extremely compact, above average in ease in out-of-the box setup. Playback voice quality is below average.

Boy, this is pretty basic stuff If you've just bought a boat and you have this notion to go off cruising, this may be a fun book to feed your mind. But it's awfully basic. Gleckler does take you by the hand and deals with the most fundamental questions. But there's no real "beef" in this volume. You'll need to read a lot more than you'll find in here. And the photographs are just AWFUL. Why is it acceptable to print photographs in a book that are so dark it's impossible to see what's going on?	bad
it's a rather childish book came looking for a good fantasy novel. i might have liked it in my early teens, but now (early 30s) I find the writing predictable, childish, and thus boring. stopped reading it.	bad
So far, not so good... Got this as a gift for Christmas from Amazon. After receiving the iPod (my second after my old iPod died), I plugged it in charged it for 6 hours. I used it for maybe 30 minutes, then turned it off for the night. Woke up in the morning to find that not only was the battery totally drained, but it had reset the clock and calendar to the year 2000. I recharged it now for 8 hours turned it off, and left it over night. Came back to in the morning and it had once again totally discharged. I am now returning it as I think it's defective. I have to wait now for Amazon to receive the broken iPod, then ship me out a new one. Ugh...This is the last time I buy something from an online retailer. The return process is too much of a pain.	bad
Where is the CD? The info - plus a comment by the AUTHOR - said that a CD of the music being discussed was part of the book purchase.If this is NOT TRUE you should highlight this fact in the sales offer.Ross Kane	bad
Amazingly disappointing! I love Susan Krinard books, so may be I expected too much. The book is actually OK, but I was expecting a romance. This is more a sf/fantasy than romance. If you want romance you don't get ANY. As a fanatasy the book is OK, but the ending leaves you frustrated. You feel like you just spent hours having the scene set for the next book and you really didn't get anything of value out of this one. I won't make this mistake again. I'll get the sequel from the library.	bad
Now, Nothing But A Curio This album sounded like a monster when it came out, raw, angry and unique. The mesh of samples and dance beats and muscular sound seemed revolutionary, and the band inspired a gaggle of lesser known camp followers like EMF and Certain Distant Suns. Sadly, in retrospect the disc sounds cluttered, muddy and tepid. It's hard now to imagine tracks like `Move Mountains' and `Never Enough' causing a stir, but some albums just don't stand the test of time. Liquidizor is just such an album, if you want to here the band at it's best, try Doubt, which is more mainstream but has stood up better. If you want to hear the sample heavy dance sound at it's best, try Hack by Information Society, that's an album that still has punch. This CD just seems to drag.	bad
Time Splitters is still number 1 Just like Unreal, Quake is another great computer game that was quickly converted to PS2 in an effort to put it on the shelf for a quick profit. The vendor knows the game will sell because: 1) Quake has an enormous name share in the gaming market, and 2) there haven't been any great PS2 games released lately. I hope Sony and software companies stop taking advantage of the PS2 consumers by releasing medicocore games. Quake had so much potential for PS2, but the almighty dollar blinded EA, and they chose to sacrafice quality in exchange for a quick profit.	bad
Tedious I was very disapointed to find that the most interesting thing about this book is the title. Overall, this book felt very repetitive and tedious. I thought it was an interesting take on the subject of how violence arose but there was too little evidence to support the thesis so the various examples given seemed to be used over and over. I also felt that the author used many biblical passages out of context in order to support her argument. Overall, this was a very speculative study that could have been shortened by 200 pages. If you do buy this, read the first chapter and the last couple pages.	bad
Way outdated and the author is too physical on the dogs Here is another book that was written too many years ago and needs to be updated.The rapid training pretty much come from breaking your dogs spirit to get him to do what you want. Bird dog discipline is a must but this guys techniques are poor in general and will not make it fun for the dog. He makes the dog more of a tool than a hunting companion. Thumbs down	bad
Cheap, you can do better This toaster broke one month after warranty expired. Came home one day and my 16 year old son said he tried to use it but couldn't figure out how. Probably because timer is a clumsy dial and not very intuitive. Now it turns on and off only. Light is always on. Smells like burning rubber. It has a peculiar hooking thingy that pulls out the tray when you open the door. Great when it works, but somehow it gets in the way more than it helps. I wound up bending them so that they stayed out of the way. I'm going to buy another cheap oven because I like them small like this one. But no more Black and Decker.	bad
Porte Cable is supposed to be the best I have owned 3 of these sanders and none of them will grip sandpaper very well. The clips suck. Granted if I wanted to use stick its it would work great but that is not what I bought it for. I have a dewalt 1/4 sheet sanderthat I have used the heck out of an not once has the sandpaper slid out of the clips. This a very frustrating and time wasting flaw.	bad
Pretty, comfy, but won't work IN the car! I bought this item and at first, I loved it! But after three adults tried to sit in it to tighten(not at once!) and it still moves inches, and I mean inches, side to side, I became quickly uncomfortable!! I tried it in another car and had the same problem. I think it may be where the latch system comes out...there just may be too much give when it stems from the back itself, instead of the base. I really can't recommend it. I took it back.	bad
You Get What you Pay For I bought this on sale at Staples for $99. It was a disaster.I have always bought HP printers because they have been so reliable and well designed. This unit seems to be the exception. It smears ink all over the page on printouts, even after multiple cleanings. Sometimes a 20 page print job takes 20 minutes, someimtes five minutes. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if HP tried to pack too much into a small unit and all the units are prone to defective output.On the plus side, I bought it for the scanner and the scanner semmed to work really well.	bad
Bob Larson was misleading in his perception of demonology. His true perception of demons is somewhat distorted through his christian priciples and beliefs. I would recommend this book to those interseted in light reading and slightly misleading demonology. However if one is truly compeled to study demons in their intirety then there are certainly many more accurate books with more detail that are well worth the effort to locate.	bad

Unless it's really your thing... I recommend this to someone who's coming to Belly from Throwing Muses etc. and not from following Kim Deal from the Pixies to Breeders connections (like me). I bought this on impulse, having heard "Feed the Trees" and "Someone to Die For" (both excellent tracks on here!) but the rest of the CD disappoints. The guitar sounds cheesy after listening to the same (don't know musical terms) style over and over again. Just a little too produced and smooth.	bad
There a much better books available It's obvious why this book was the first VB.NET book available. The book was obviously rushed, has many typos, pieces of code that doesn't work, and questions with wrong answers. The content of this title isn't anywhere near the quality of the study guide by Gunderloy. This book is a decent start for beginners, but if you really want to learn and pass the test, look elsewhere.	bad
Panasonic Speaker Phone I like the compactness of the phone; it is clear on both ends of the conversation. However, I was under the impression it had a speaker phone on the base (not just the handsets), so I'm a little disappointed in that. It would also have been nice to be able to see the screen or a blinking light which would tell you if you have messages waiting.	bad
Not comfortable....too much wind noise The sound in the headphones is fine and I really liked the fact they were light and fit over the head but the earbuds never really seemed to fit and they were slightly hard and uncomfortable. Maybe it is by design that they do not fit snug in the ear but while I was walking and jogging the wind kept whistling around the earbuds and I couldn't tune it out. (this wasn't a windy day either, just the normal air that would pass by you while walking or jogging.) The fact that they kept slipping coupled with the wind noise issue kept me distracted and aggitated to the point where I couldn't enjoy my work out. I'm going to go ahead and keep them and use them for a back up in case my headphones at work go out but these will not be used with my mp3 player as intended.	bad
Nantucket History and Travel Guide... This book was awful and painful to get through! Although it's a short book, it felt as though it would take me forever to finish... which is why I had to put it down. If you're thinking of taking a trip to Nantucket and want to know all of it's history and what it has to offer, then this may be the book for you. If you wanted a good, gripping true crime novel, then look up Tom Henderson, Ann Rule, M. William Phelps, Diane Fanning- PRETTY MUCH ANYONE OTHER THAN BRIAN MCDONALD! Bad writing out of what could have been made into a great book... BIG disappointment!	bad
Endurance This video poorly writen and acted. Yes! Haile is a great runner but he is not a very good acter. that is one of the reason the film fail me. I am an Ethiopian I understand most of film just because they speak Amharic otherwise for other people the film lose the follow... Haile could have make very good interview instead of video film. I have a lot of question that the video didn't answer... What is his stand about long distance runner running for other country? [Mind you I didn't ask why he is not run for other country] etc etc...	bad
Colby CX-CD241 Portable CD player Plays okay for occasional listening, but will start making a knocking noise above a low vclume or after about 45 minutes of listening.	bad
fun but very hard I like this game, but don't play it any more. I got it for new year with my own gameboy. Ok what I like about this game is that you can pick up some thing and throw it. I also like the 3D stuff like chase Dory or chase the turtle that said '' hey dude ''. Also it starts out simple like first level, going to school. Second level, going out to find your classmates and returning them to the sting ray guy. But the best part of this game is I one time just typed in something in the cheat code place, and without knowing, I got too the last level. What I don't like about this game is that it is too hard. This game is for people who want a challenge.	bad
Doen't fit 15.6V model 1510 Not realizing that there is 1500 15.6V Dust Buster model and a 1510 15.6V Dust Buster model I bought two of these for my two 1510 models. My mistake, the pre-filter description does not say it fits the 1510 model. Am providing this review only to alert other so that they don't make the same mistake. Otherwise, the filter seems fine as other reviewers have indicated.	bad
Disappointing Like previous reviewers, I found the story to be very disappointing. It had great potential, but never quite got there. I found myself wanting to finish it, only because I had already invested so much time into it. I was really hoping that the story would pick up.	bad
There is no magic, only basics Mr. Debelak has written a 'basic' marketing book; something you might read in a beginning marketing course. However, some of his information is out of date. When I started reading Marketing Magic I realized much of the infomation was common sense and didn't find any 'magic' that would make me want to continue reading. I skipped to certain sections hoping to find secrets or 'magic' information. I cite his information about trade shows. Unfortunately, it was out of date too.If you need a basic marketing book to cover introduction to business marketing, this would be the book to buy. If you have been in business and need more current information, continue your search.	bad
In Flames Continues To Slide This album is really disappointing - but expected. It is a predictable continuation of their new sound. Ever since Reroute, In Flames has adopted a nu-metal sound that is leaving fans of their old stuff wondering what happened. They have completely abandoned their raw, Gothenburg melodeath sound. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a good death metal album.	bad
Disappointed I have been awaiting this film's release on video, as it is one of the few early Disney releases I've never seen. Admittedly, "Music" is a mixed bag with some very good features and some pretty lame ones. It was nice that they included "Band Concert" on the tape too. However, my biggest disappointment was the censoring of "The Martins and the Coys" sequence! Why take that out? In reading other viewers' comments, I see that this wasn't the only aspect of the film revised. I can accept that this was one of Disney's compilation films and I wasn't expecting a "Snow White". If Disney was going to release the film on video, they should have released the entire thing in its original uncut form!	bad
ok at best Some of the confessions are good but 90% of them are boring crap tha you hear everyday. Buy it if it's dirt cheap.	bad
Cant Handle Power... i put this thing on a very strong amp and it blew the rubber sealings around the speaker clear out! looks like there was a stick of dynamite on the inside. if u plan on listening to loud music, especially for a long duration, then this speaker is not ur friend. died on me only after a few months. first power test took this thing off the planet for me. the solo baric was definitely the better choice as i still have it today, even after continuous abuse and hours of pounding on the highway.	bad
philips noise cancelling headphones I'm very disappointed with the performance of this product. I could have had a pair of headphones for a lot less money than I paid for something I thought was going to cancel noise. At the very best, it minimizes noise but I am still able to hear all that is going on around me, voices, equipment running, walking on floors, doors opening and closing, phones ringing, etc. This product is not effective in its intended purpose which is to "cancel noise". I would not buy another one of these or recommend them to any one.	bad
Bad 5.1 Sound Track The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound track sounds more like a 5.0 sound track: no audible LFE. The ProLogic track seems to be okay. Seeing as though I (as well as others) spent a fortune on digital sound with speakers, sub, etc. it seems a shame to have that low quality of a sound track on a recent dvd.	bad
My friend has one... I don't have one of these, but my friend does. he bought this nearly two years ago at Best Buy. They kept trying to sell him a warranty for it, even offering it for free, which was a little odd (but I guess maybe cause so many people have said it breaks on them). It was $120 something, which is way too much to pay for it now. It's a simple mp3 player, no screen , just play, pause, stop, rewind, forward. I thought it'd be hard to use since you can't see which song you have playing, but it only holds about 30 songs so it's not that hard. It's like the ipod shuffle in a way. Well I've read all these terrible reviews about it and I just have to say that it isn't all terrible. I guess some are crappy, but my friend got one of the good ones. It's never broken on him and it's sound quality is good. It's worked well for him, but I mean, all these reviews don't make it sound good.Best to look for another player, just to be safe.	bad
Overall Disappointment I saw this toy when my daughter was six months old and wanted it so bad for her to play with. I bought her one for her first birthday, although she already knew how to walk, I felt it would be fun for her to ride on. I was so excited to get it home and open it, once it was ready to go, she had the hardest time getting the hippo to move ( as a ride on toy). Still at 16 months the toy does not stimulate her at all. She may play with it for 5-10 minutes at a time. My daughter is very smart and needs toys that keep her doing something and this toy just has nothelp her attention at all since I brought it home.	bad
Not the best print i love everything vincent van gogh, ordered all the other prints and love them. This one is not detailed like i would like, in a frame it doesnt have any definition, and i wouldnt receommend this one/.	bad
Not really worth the effort to read As a former federal law enforcement officer, I will simply say there are just much better books to read on this subject.	bad
Learned about the sport(only good part)...but this guy is an idiot! Yes I understand how addiction can take hold of someones life and how difficult it can be to overcome, but at the same time, this guy goes from one addiction that partially ruined his life and jumped right to the next which he's allowing/allowed to ruin his marriage. He complains about how he's allowing it to happen and how he doesn't want to lose his family, yet he keeps travelling all over the world competing in events. Seems VERY selfish!!!	bad
Not much for the price It seemed to be well built but after I installed it and opened the door a few times the seams where it was put together seperated.It was poorly joined together. I repaired it with some small screws.	bad
Great for a while -- faulty earbud? These were fantastic for the few months they lasted until they just up and half-died. I would rather them fully die, but in fact, one of the ear buds doesn't work while the other one is just fine. Makes for some awkward listening. If yours were great, I am glad that you may have been lucky enough to have a non-defective pair. If not for their falling into disrepair, I would've been happy with them. However, even when they were good, I wished that they had greater ability to block out other sound. Because they fit loosely in the ear, other sounds can easily penetrate. This is good or bad, depending on your needs. If you're happy with the price, you will be happy with this as you pay for what you get... but don't expect a miracle for this price.	bad
Not worth it. It is not 3 inches like it said. More like 2.5 inches very cheap material. You get what you pay I guess.	bad
Died after 8 months this keypad died after 8 months of use. I wasn't that happy with it anyway. The keypad is flatter than my previous one. I like the pad to be raised up at an angle. Not that intuitive to touch. Overpriced for what it is. Am ordering a Targus model as a replacement which is only $19.	bad
I keep talking to myself!!! I loved the features that this phone offered, you could upload photos (not that I ended up doing it) or music to create your own ringtone. However, I would end up on the phone talking to myself at least a few times a week! If you are on the phone longer than 30 minutes the person you WERE talking to can no longer hear you, which sent you searching for the other handset! You could still hear them.So after about 3 months of this problem my friends and family already knew, if I didn't respond to them it wasn't because I wasn't paying attention!The battery began to die sooner and sooner around the 1 year mark as well.	bad
Elmo My toddler daughter did not find this movie interesting. It lost her attention after just ten minutes. I was also somewhat put-off by the language of the "Ben Stiller" character.	bad
Not worth the money The differentiating feature of this watch is the compass function. It simply does not work - not even close. In addition the watchband poorly designed - very uncomfortable and difficult to use.	bad
disappointed I have read all the "Calder" series books and was deeply disappointed with Janet Dailey's latest. The tragedy in the book ruined it for me. I felt that the plot was weak, especially with Tara, and that it was disjointed.	bad
Great album, bad vinyl I was really excited to get this on vinyl as it is such a great album, unfortunately as soon as you drop the needle you can tell the vinyl quality is terrible. There are so many bumps in the record itself it literally makes it unlistenable. I don't know how people get away with selling terrible quality records, but it happens, if you really want this album it would be better buying it on cd.	bad
muddy sound The sound of Chinatown, by The Be Good Tanyas, was muddy and overall the album was disappointing.	bad
Really, "Geroge" The Kindle edition of this book is rife with typos. The first author's name is presented as "Geroge R. R. Martin." Every other instance spells the plural of 'hero' as 'heros.' 'Ores' instead of 'orcs.' I bought the thing to have a little wallow in some things I love, so I have no real complaints about the content, but it's hard to read a book with this many errors.	bad
crackle in bass First pair I bought got stolen outta my car, somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it :(Anyway, first pair sounded great.I bought another pair, there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency. This made me extremely annoyed/angry/disappointed. I cannot stand bad crap, and I hate to give bad product reviews. But I had to send it back and now I will look for a different company brand, probably for the rest of my life.	bad
Not as fun as it looks My husband and I love the Tony Hawk game so I thought we would like this one too but I was wrong. The graphics are OK and the levels are expansive but that's about all you get with this game. Its nowhere near as fun as Tony Hawk.	bad
recycled plot I found this book and many recently published Star Wars Titles extremely predicatable and at times boring. The Star Wars univese needs to start coming up with new plots because every book seems to put the characters in similar, recycled positions...I feel that the Star Wars Universe is being polluted and exploited with too many excess novels and Bantam should stop putting out so many new stories. When Heir to the Empire came out in 91 I read it at least 3 times... now, with novels like I Jedi, I find it had to finish one... I think the publishing company should take it easy for a while for the sake of the readers and star wars itself...	bad
Anti-scratch film Better to buy at your local store. Shipping was more than the product. Need to be very careful in applying to cammera/viewer; can bubble and flare at the edges.	bad
Sheryl, what happened? If you're like me who admired Sheryl for her tough-girl attitude and great songwriting, spare yourself the agony. Most of the songs will leave you thinking "Haven't I heard this song before?" (especially "Diamond Road" and "It's So Easy") and there's a preponderance of "Love-hurts-so-get-drunk-and-cry-in-your-drink" kinda songs (ESPECIALLY "C'mon C'mon" , "It's So Easy" and "Over You") that lack both the edge and depth of Crow's previous work. NOW we understand why after this album she decided to take a break from making music. That said, there are still some tracks that are up to her usual standard. I recomend downloading "Safe and Sound", "Lucky Kid" and "Steve McQueen"... proof that while Sheryl may have missed the mark with this album, she's still got what it takes, somewhere in there.	bad
Sorry, Didn't Work for Me This product may work for some people, but our (2) little rats are either very intelligent, or they don't care. We have been trying to catch them since November (of '07), with 3 different types of traps in two sizes. This was the latest attempt.I swear, at night, I can hear them singing, "I'm al-right...."Karen S.	bad
Not great I think anyone into cologne or perfume has smelled this (assuming they haven't owned it) on at least a dozen others.Curve is the kind of scent you would expect to find littered around a college campus. Its a heavy synthetic smell, with a brutal starting point bubbling with artificial lavender and berry, and finishing to a warm but overbearing citrus and sandalwood base.Curve smells good if its applied extremely lightly, but this is never the case.The target audience would be young men ages 14-21. I bought my first bottle (the four ounce) when I was a freshman in high school, and I haven't been able to finish even half of the bottle through the years.Prospective buyers should definitely give it a test run.	bad
WHAT!!!!!!! This was a gift from heaven for about 4 years i used it all the time. Then it corrupted my data. It was sorta my fault tho. Then it just broke down on me i didn't know y. I cleaned it and everything it never worked again.	bad
Frigidly fun Consistently catchy, conversely clunky polished punk managed to strike at the right time in England and consequentially has been slapped down to earth by less-hyped perspective ever since. Nothing inherently evil here, but little more than smooth garage rock with mediocre bite.	bad
Should please high schoolers. Anyone older than that will be put off by this simplistic bit of fluff. The author has pieced together quotes and statistics from other sources and throws them around liberally. It has the feel of a high school writing project. The advice she gives reads like something out of an article in "Seventeen Magazine". For example, here are some of her tips for cultivating friends, Italian style:1)Spend the time it takes to cultivate new friends.2)Go beyond the superficial to create intimacy.3)Practice giving and receiving affection.4)Be willing to listen.5)Show loyalty in your words and actions.I bet you never would have thought of those things on your own, right?Well, pay the $15.00 for this book and you can read 205 more pages full of equally valuable "Italian" advice.Buy it for a teen, or better yet, save your money.	bad
Not bad, but . . . . I read lots of DragonLance books. And so I read this one. I expected more. It flowed okay. It was written okay. I just wanted more action. And I wanted the action to seem more realistic. So, overall it was an okay read. But I was a bit disappointed. I'll read his next to see if it is better.	bad
Not As Good As The Other Soundtracks This CD doesn't have as good of songs as the other Rocky soundtracks do. I enjoy listening to the instrumental songs from the other soundtracks way more than listening to the Rocky V CD. Rocky V is the worst of the Rocky movies. The song "Measure of a Man" is fair; I bought the CD because I liked that song. Some of the other songs aren't in the movie; they're just inspired by the movie.	bad
Tastes awful! I had high hopes for this product. Heard so much good stuff about hoodia. But this sad to say, did nothing. And it tasted like pure alcohol with grass in it! Had to drink something with a lot of flavor to it while taking it.	bad
Piffle! A crass attempt at a philosophical view of the 'human condition' which fails at all levels. We are subjected to the intimate thoughts and actions of a thoroughly meritless, shiftless and vacuous collection of misbegots without whom the world would be infintely better-off. The terms of their rehabilitation are presented to us as if they are profound and thought-provoking when in effect they are juvenile and shallow. Mr Coupland should read Darkness at Noon or its equivalent before dishing up his platitudes as truisms.For all that the literary style is readable, though unremarkable (and occasionally ungrammatical - my copy had at least one typo too).I would not recommend it for purchase but if one is bored or perhaps trapped in a holiday hotel during unexpectedly bad weather, it could be read in order to avoid being obliged to play endless games of Pictionary	bad
Cognitive dissonance I was quite disappointed by this, and a bit worried by the almost uniformly-five star reviews here (which usually mean that something has gone terribly wrong). Essentially, 'Sadeness' is the standout, although the samples sound very naff nowadays. 'Principles of Lust' was also a moderate hit in the UK, but the rest of the album is basically ambient euro-pop filler, a bit like Jam & Spoon but much more pompous - all this stuff about how the album is a serious meditation on religion and sexuality seems divorced from reality. The supposedly-controversial religious angle is actually quite funny, and I get the impression that a lot of people take this much more seriously than it warrants. Unless you're fan, you'll find this extremely naff, and if you're a fan you'll probably grow out of it.	bad
Hard to keep it clean The bottle is overcomplicated. It is full of bits and pieces which are difficult to keep it clean especially the bite valve.I stopped using after a couple of days because of the bitter taste it had.I reverted to my simple mineral water bottle (free) which is also much lighter as well.	bad
Not 2000 Hours. More like 500 Hours. Lasts 2000 hours?I have gone through 12 of these so far and they only last about 5-600 hours on average.You get what you pay for I guess.	bad
not good for making cheese Ok, call me old fashioned, but cheese cloth ought to be good for making cheese. This is a fairly wide weave which means that you have to fold it over a few times. Also it is fairly narrow. The end result is that while it does a good job of collecting the cheese curds, they end up being caught in several layers of fabric and have to be picked out.	bad
Disappointing Read If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go. Frankly, I was disappointed. After my book club read "Ain't Nobody's Business" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries. However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original. I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though.	bad
this is only one of hundred ferrari books i didn't buy this book to my man because i have read many many other very good ferrari books in the world...and i think that parts of the content is already written in other very good books...the pictures are really okay.	bad
After 2 months- Getting loose after 2 months of almost daily use, the parts are loose and the crusher does not come down straight anymore. also if you have a orange that is thick skinned, this will not work as well as a machine which you can spin a orange on. this only crushes, so you need very thin oranges, like tangerines.i would rather get a $15 juicer from walmart i think. it will work with every kind of orange	bad
compresses easily This cushion compresses really easily. When sitting on it, the cushion is only an inch thick.	bad
Script? Someone did not read the final version of this script. They began shooting hoping the writer would have it together half way through. No such luck.This is one of those films where the actors were offered so much money, they couldn't resist this piece of junk.	bad
Nothing useful here As a student of entrepreneurship and a practicing entrepreneur, I had high hopes for this magazine. I'm in the middle of a 1 year subscription but have honestly yet to take away anything useful from this magazine. Reading the articles makes me question if any of the writers have ever been entrepreneurs themselves.Each issue also contains an article with "tips" from the "Esquire Guy," which is usually full of tripe targeted towards cubicle dwellers. As an entrepreneur, I find these articles offensive to those who have shunned the 9-5.The other characteristic I find useless about this magazine is the persistent stream of topical articles about guys who have developed some random smartphone app. These apps are never practical to business owners and the articles are snoozers.I honestly wish this magazine would improve and publish more useful information since it has become one of the de-facto representatives of entrepreneurs to the outside world.	bad
Thin stuff I picked this up after reading a brief review in the NYT Book Review. The premise sounded good, but the book is oddly flat. The writers, with one exception, never really distinguish themselves enough to take on unique voices. The instructor is too stale a character--more a stereotype than anything else. I think if I knew who Carter was lampooning here, the satire would have a little more bite, but as it stands, the novel's "humor" feels too routine.The brief discussions of famous writers, experimental fiction, and genre fiction are wafer thin. This novel is as experimental as testing PH with pink strips of paper. But who, really, is going to read something more challenging in a popular novel?Still, I read to the end, which may say more about my commitment than it does the novel. There's just not a lot of meat on these bones.	bad
Redundantly Pleasing While many of these songs are available on other collections this is a well put together set. One can be exposed to all facets of this band. While many have dismissed Talk Talk as a synth driven 80s band that followed in the footsteps of others they display some wonderful talent and moods within thier music. A truly original band with thier own unique sound. You can not go wrong with this cd.	bad
Interesting saxophone pieces This CD contains some of the most interesting pieces written for saxophone. The performers have good technical skills, but unfortunately their tone quality is very poor.	bad
Can find a better case When I received this in the mail, I realized the case with it's bulky outside seams wasn't what I wanted, so I bought a Krusell with the seams turned in, and I like that better. I had lost my earpiece and wanted the charger, and have had this for a couple years, and these pieces work fine.	bad
Exactly the same as her sister No difference. Are we sure she hasn't done all of Kylie's CDs?? Or Kylie didn't do this one? Creepy.	bad
Scent is a Bummer This lotion works amazingly, but I can't use it because the scent is SO overpowering. Gives me an instant headache. Throwing it out because I can't use it. I've tried several times, but I can't deal with the headache. :(	bad
'They' had me at hello, but lost me well before the goodbye. "They" starts out with a brilliant scene introducing the 'night terrors' that disturb a little boy. The scene was creepy and very well done. Soon after, though, it all went downhill. Don't be fooled by the "Wes Craven presents..", he had nothing to do with the direction of this film. And it shows. The plotline and premise quickly fall apart and the ending leaves you wondering why you wasted your time. This movie is one of those that was totally butchered. If you're a die hard horror fan, like myself, rent it just to see it. But don't expect anything too spectacular.	bad
Buyer Beware This camera is a decent general use camera, but buyers should be VERY aware of some inherent flaws with the camera and Toshiba's lack of support for their own engineering flaws. The camera has 2 reoccuring problems. First, the tabs in the battery compartment are weak. Extreme care must be taken opening and closing the compartment to prevent wear and breakage. Second, the mode dials on these cameras fall off in normal use. The plastic pins which hold it in place break off no matter how gently used. Toshiba has stopped supporting the camera with replacement parts. If the dial falls off outside the warranty window, your only option will be to trade the camera in for a refurbished camera. The price of the trade is not justifiable considering the problems, and you will be better off buying a new camera from someone besides Toshiba. I currently have a worthless PDR-M60, and will not buy from Toshiba again.	bad
Stupid movie, cool side character I saw this movie on a plane...I wish there had been snakes on the plane so they would have had to turn off the movie to deal with the snakes or something like that. It's so stupid and cliche, with dumb characters, stupid dialouge and most eye-rolling to me was that the ending seemed to try to make the movie a grand production...as if we were all caring about what happened to the couple...I didn't care one bit, I just wanted the plane to land so I could take a nap (it's hard for me to sleep on planes, I am 6'3" and so my best bet is to get a window seat and turn my body a tiny bit sideways and let my head rest against the wall/window of the plane). So, that's it, stupid movie, but still better than Robocop 2...much better.	bad
Kalahari Typing School for Men I read this for a book club selection. Unfortunately probably the best I could say is that it is generally a feel good book, and since we had traveled there, it was remotely interesting because of its placement in Botswana. It is a quick read, but I would not recommend it to most people.	bad
Very disappointing I read this book because it was so highly recommended by so many people, but I found the actual product unsatisfying. It's got a great premise and could have been heart-wrenching and exciting, but it just ended up dumb, in my opinion. The main characters were just irritating. I found Sarah a totally unrealistic heroine, and when she finally ended up offering to be the guy's mistress, after all the jabbering on and on about her reputation, I thought, "You are just an idiot." The hero was fairly unsympathetic. The book could have said more about his mother and his relationship with her, and showed you more a glimpse of his heart, instead of going on and on about dragons. I felt totally uninvested in this story, and it's a shame because it could have been such a good one. The scene in which they finally "made love" was as stupid as any I've ever read in a romance novel.	bad
Would NOT recommend! I have owned a set of these poles for a year. I do not like them because the cork grips are hard, small in diameter (and I have small hands) and they are slippery. The second time I used them one of the baskets came off. I had to stop skiing and put it back on but it continued to come off until it was lost. There are much better poles out there for the price.	bad
Interesting but unorganized While I found the content fascinating, the author bounces around, often going off on tangents for pages before getting back to his original point. He includes lots of history about paranormal occurrences and research, but in no particular order.I was disappointed, given the the title of the book, that only the last two chapters are actually devoted to psychic detection (one of them being on the specialized field of psychic archaelogy).Overall, it reads like an interesting collection of paranormal occurrences throughout history, but by no means should it be used as research material.	bad
lcontains lead chemical!!! I bought this fishing pole for my son,butWarning Sticker read"This product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm etc"So,I return the product to amazon....I would not recomend product contain Lead Paint on fishing rod...	bad
acceptable This book has a grade-school level plot, but it presents philosophical ideas at the high-school level. I would rather read a straight-up history of philosophy and skip the fantasy crap. A sixth-grader would probably love the plot but have trouble understanding the complex ideas.	bad
brakes are dangerous Nice bike but the brakes are terrible. I had to go to the bike shop and order a pair of decent brakes. Figure on spending at least another $35+ on a set of brakes. The ones on the bike do not stop well and my 10 year old can not squeeze them. I am a grown man and I can squeeze them all my might and I still role to a stop. I am mechanical and adjusted them but it is a very poor design.	bad
Voice is good but songs arent so hot The single released 8th world wonder is pretty good. The Clay Aiken duet is not bad, however the rest isnt so good. It has nothing to do with the voice or singing, its just the songs. The song "Before" reminds me of Kelly Clarkson's "Before Your Love" and its ok sounding. The version of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is remade and doesnt sound like the one that was put on American Idol classics volume 2 cd. Totally remade. I think she has nice pleasant voice, but should have got better songs to showcase it. The song You Have Changed isnt bad more and R & B style which what I thought cd would show more of.	bad
What's the big deal? I don't know how this movie received so many raves since it's not such a big deal. A group of narcistic youths get exposed to a funky parasite/disease which makes them, like, melt. There's really no horror or suspense here. The only thing of entertainment value is how these shallow charactors deal with each other's demise. This is a 15 minute premise dragged out into a full fledged movie	bad
Shipped poorly The product arrived in a "velvet" pouch. The chain was in a complete knot and I was unable to untangle. I ended up breaking the chain and purchasing a new one, as there was not time to return before Christmas. I would think twice before purchasing necklaces from Amazon again. Disappointed to say the least.	bad
Seems to work well, but almost impossible to assemble My wife got the house and the Dyson, so I needed a vacuum for my new apartment. The Eureka 4700 seemed right.The problem: assembly required. For a vacuum?!?The worse problem: it's damn near impossible to assemble.The first step requires inserting a long screw to put part of the upright assembly on the base. The plastic part to attach would not accept the screw. I am 6'4 and 200 pounds. I had to put all of my strength and weight Into it to get this done.A later step rewires you to insert two small screws into vertical canals to affix the part. The canals were too small for the very common multiple screw head driver I use. I had to buy a skinny Phillips head screwdriver to do this step.This is ridiculous. A vacuum cleaner should not require assembly. If it does, assembly should be effortless.Don't buy this product.	bad
Marching Music I love the Soviet National Anthem. I was hoping for more marching music instead of Russian folk songs incorporating the balaika.	bad
Lacks Windows NT Driver The specifications for this printer suggest that you can use it with Windows NT, but according to Brother, the driver is not available and never will be. You will have to use a PCL 4 driver which is very slow or resort to the driver that ships with the unit, which, in many cases simply doesn't ever produce a printout on complex pages.Furthremore, I have been unable to find a way to reset the print queue in the middle of a print job. Pulling the power cord seems to be an effective solution, however, you will need to reset the spooler service on your NT Server as well.If you intend to share a single phone line for inbound fax and data, the distinctive ring feature on this unit is its only redemption.	bad
records in a weird format I've downloaded the massive k-lite codec packs for both 32 bit and 64 bit and I can't get my video editing programs to let me play with this file type. I have to use a video capture card to get the video on to my computer in a usable format. Mono sound.	bad
Great Player Who Complains Too Much About Everything In This Book I'm a huge Yankee fan and read a lot of books about the Yanks. I loved Graig Nettles as a player, but this book was a bit annoying for me. He complains and complains, non-stop. Everything is always an issue. He's not getting enough respect. He's better than this player or that player. He should be paid more. He can't stand George. He put all his thoughts out there in this book, which took a lot of guts... but reading his list of complaints gets boring and I came away from this book with a little less love for Nettles. Apparently so did the Yankees. He was no longer wearing pinstripes shortly after this book came out. I hate to say it, but he did it to himself. He comes across as a pretty selfish and self absorbed guy in this book. 3 out of 5 stars... He's still a great Yankee, but less great to me after reading his laundry list of complaints.	middle
Factual, but dry One of the interesting things about this book is that it uses standard Mandarin Pinyin (Chiang Kai-Shek is Jiang Jieshi, Sun Yat-Sen is Sun Zhongshan, etc). While this can be very helpful to those who know Mandarin Pinyin, it can be somewhat confusing to those who do not.For the most part, the book is factual and unbiased, although Ebrey does allow her anti-Maoist bias to slant her discussion of post-1949 China. The read is extremely dry, however, and often comes across as a colorless collection of irrelevant facts.	middle
The Gifts of the Jews: How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels (Hinges of History, Vol. 2) Boring book but it did arrive in good condition as described. But a very boring read. Thanks	middle
Package smaller than expected. Product arrived & I was expecting the package to be bigger. Vendor should put cubic inches or dimensions in the product description so that buyer knows better what they're getting. This package won't last long. A little disappointed. Product is good quality.	middle
Great Book (not the best condition) This book was great and had all of its pages, but it had very noticeable wear and tear on the front and back cover.	middle
It doesn't get much better than this! Thank you Steve King and Max Armstrong of WGN 720am radio in Chicago for turning me on to Big Bill Doggett. At roughly 4:53am in the morning Max comes on to do the farm report, and if the karma is right, Steve will play "Honky Tonk" (part 1).With the first notes of the guitar, Max will start drolling, and reminiscing about his youth back in Indiana when the carnivals or fairs would come to his town. Back then every carnival would have that special tent where inside ladies would disrobe, what we would call a "tease show" today. "Honky Tonk" would be one of those songs playing in the background. Doggett's music is what I would call "grunt & grind", perfect mood music (no singing) all instrumentials. If this CD doesn't take you back to the early, early 1950's, nothing will. Thanks again Steve & Max.	middle
BACK HAND SWIPE AT BUSH 41 "Three Kings" starred the ultra-liberal George Clooney in a convoluted story of U.S. soldiers trying to get rich in war torn 1991 Iraq, possibly re-creating the theme of Clint Eastwood's 1970 film "Kelly's Heroes". "Kings" is not a highly political story, but leaves little doubt that it views the first President Bush's war in Iraq, particularly the Kurdish uprising that he encouraged and did not back, as a cynical American lie.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF "BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN"STWRITES@AOL.COM	middle
I wish I could be more excited about this book I "read" the book on CD, excited that it had 19 disks and hoping that it would be a story that would keep me involved during long road trips. Alas, while it is interesting, intelligently written and somewhat intriguing, I found myself indulging in mental eye-rolls and wishing that Talcott would "just get on with it!" I was put off by Mr. Carter's constant reference to the two prominent races as "the darker nation" and "the lighter nation." Sometimes, it made no difference who the reference was about.The mystery could have held itself together better without Talcott's (Misha's) marital issues, and his constant references to his childhood, his parents, and his siblings.Cut by about 300 pages, this would be a terrific book!	middle
Not enough detail. This was an excellent book for a beginner and was an excellent introduction to Win2k Pro, but there wasn't enough detail. I made the mistake of using this as my primary reference and failed the 70-210 test. There were many questions on the test that were not covered in this book. I would recommend using more than one source. I would also recommend that Sybex fire their editor. There were dozens of grammar mistakes. Overall I would recommend this book as an introduction to Win2k Pro, but I would definitely supplement your studies with other book like Exam Cram.	middle
Good book for beginners but make sure you get one INCLUDING a CD This is a very useful little book, easy to read, however, don't make the mistake I did. I bought a "like new" edition that didn't specify whether the cd was included or not (I assumed if it was like new it would) and there are many exercises in the book that rely on images contained in that cd, as well as plug ins for your photoshop 7 for your computer.If you get the book, be sure to get an edition with a disc.	middle
WORKS WELL Product works well but the applicator is probably the best part of the kit. Velcro attachments make it easy to install and remove pads which are machine washable and quality products. The liquid cleaner is OK but I'm not sure it's any better than other quality wood floor cleaners. All in all a better product than swiffer for wood floors.	middle

Nice, but not necessary This is handy, but takes up counter space and once a person has determined which coffees they like, they will only have 3 or 4 flavors on hand which can be stored in their individual boxes in a cupboard.	middle
Error-filled and being revised While a relatively understandable introduction to the topic, it cannot serve as a reliable reference given the number of errors contained in it. Moreover, the author is working on a second edition, due at the end of the year; I can't recommend spending money on the current form.At the time it was written, it was the only thing available and valuable for that alone; but there are better alternatives today. Get the Anthony Mason/Peter Viscarola book instead.	middle
Good for two or three years As others have said, its good for a couple years before the plastic dis-colors and becomes basically unreadable.Plus the plastic spike can break if you have hard ground.But hey, its plastic, for 8 bucks, not too bad. Just buy a few extra and keep them in storage. Seems to be the best option.Glass... unless located some where safe can break too easily and it needs to be kept clean too.	middle
Very Coyle Loyal, but this was only ok. Coyle is my favorite fiction writer, but this one does not measure up. It is not as complex or well-developed as his other books are. If you are Coyle loyal, you will want to read it. If you are not, read "The Ten Thousand" by Coyle instead.	middle
Read It At The Library This is A very good book... but it if your looking for help with grants and other things this is not the book for you.. its more of usful information for silly stuff...	middle
Meh. Fine as budget item This is very much a starter set for shaving. The brush seems fine (I have no basis for comparison). The soap is cheap. The stand is just a piece of plastic (although any stand is much better than none). If I were to do it again, I'd buy the same brush/holder set and get different soap. If you're committed to the idea of shaving this way, don't buy this set.	middle
Update and Installation Problems 8920 USB At a low price the scanner is a reasonable buy. Buying this scanner used may be a good option. Users may give up trying to install it, leaving the scanner in "as new" condition.The "Check for OneTouch Updates" options starts to download then at the 30 seconds to go mark says it's unable to connect with server. When retry is chosen the time goes to 17,000 seconds. The update does not load ever after leaving the that time go by.There were a few problems with the installation, but that's not unusual with many products. The one-touch features are a waste of programing.	middle
Not the worst investment Caveats abound with this mostly okay navigator. First, don't trust that it knows which restaurants and points of interest are still open or closed. Second, in areas with lots of recent road development, don't expect TomTom to be aware that what it thinks is farmland was just recently paved over. Thrid, the voice keeps cutting out on us lately, and if we're not paying attention to the screen, there's no guarantee we'll be warned to take the next exit. We've had to backtrack at least five times based on this machine's faulty instructions. I think it's a much better tool to use when planning ahead of time (while you're on a long stretch of road) as to where you're going next than relying on the step-by-step instructions.	middle
Good game but... First, this game is fun. so many teams ao many modes. ranking acurate and bowls are very fun so is multi-player. But there is a bad part, stats r poorly organized if a db makes a tackle on a 10 yard run then rb gets the stat but not the db who makes the tackle. There is all kinds of little things like that that makes this game 3 stars. But overall the game is super fun when you play it and you probaly wont notice the other problems but anyway this is a good game.	middle
Less than great yet not awful There is less to this film and even less-er looking at the cover box of the DVD. Whom the movie provides to be the insane killer is given away.This said, it has great production values, well enough acted and gory.Overlong however.	middle
Review for "Sexual Feeling" by LaToya Jackson At first listen, I thought this song was ridiculous. LaToya hardly sings in it, and it mostly consisted of moans and sex noises. But as I listened to it more and more, it intrigued me. The beat and melody is actually pretty good and LaToya vocally does well in the few parts where she sings. LaToya tries hard to convince us that she is some sex kitten but it simply doesn't work. Don't buy the single, buy the full album (under the title "Sexual Feeling", "He's My Brother", "Bad Girl", "Be My Lover" or "Why Don't You Want My Love"; they are all the same album). Some of LaToya's other songs are much more promising.	middle
Josh Groban was good at the Greek I thought Josh was good in his second concert. He does look different and his voice seems to be changing. I loved "My December" and my favorite of all time "Alejate." This is a decent concert but not terrific. I also taped it from the PBS broadcast so I'm happy to add it to my Groban collection!	middle

Barnyard `Barnyard' is another computer animated film that seems to be saturating the movie market at the moment. This follows Otis the cow as he takes on the responsibility of being leader of the Barnyard, despite wanting to be a party animal. The animation is pretty basic and you can see a lot better in most Pixar films and the storyline is simple and formulaic. I get the feeling this film is aimed more squarely at the child audience as there seems to be no `in jokes' that parents can enjoy or those quirky touches from Pixar films that make them enjoyable for a wider audience. The soundtrack is pretty good featuring songs by both Tom Petty and Peter Gabriel, but this may have been the only saving grace for the film! If you accept that this film is one for the kids then it will be great to put on and see them enjoy it, just don't expect anything to engage an adult audience at the same time.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.	middle
A great read for 99 cents! An interesting read, especially for a book that I bought in the bargain bin for 99 cents. It wasn't written in a witty maner as I would have expected from Frasier, but a good quick read.	middle
So-So I really liked the first installment of this series. I started out loving this one too, but found myself somewhat disappointed by the time I reached the end.I though the murderer's identity was obvious from the very beginning. I also thought it was out of character for Annabelle to run out on a wedding, and then prolong her absence in order to go say hi to a friend. I also thought it was a bit too convenient how she suddenly figured everything out.The character of Leatrice must go. She adds nothing to the story except to be an annoying buttinsky, and since it's apparent that even Annabelle doesn't care for her, her continued presence in the middle of everything is just flat-out ridiculous.	middle
Mediocre, horrible sound editing -- wait for the 2005 CD I have almost every Erasure CD there is, including imports... I have been to all of their concerts in my city... and this CD is by far MEDIOCRE. The songs could be so much better, but the sound editing is so horrible that the you can hardly hear the music.	middle
They should of How the west was won was a good movie.I first saw it at the Capri theater in Dallas Unfortunately as I would later learn, that this theater had took the three projection system for Cinerama back in 1958.they had reduce the curve screen.what I saw was the 70 mm version.So i never did see the three projection version.I'm also angry that greedy time Warner did not include the smile box version for d.v.d version.	middle
Needs some tweeking I had something similar and lost it in a move (where do those things go?).I ordered this assuming it was basically the same thing. It is, with two glarring exceptions. One, the cups are abviously made to hole "small" eggs. I prefer to use Large eggs and they spill over from these cups into your boiling water. It's messy! Two, the little slots made to pick the pan up out of the boiling water with a fork are a great idea, however, they're not wide enough for a standard sized fork. I think I'll be dumping this one and buying another...live and learn.	middle

An ok book, but one thing.... This book was very exciting and what was good, I enjoyed.However, there was one thing that I really didn't appreciate.The use of four-letter words is very abundant in this book. Aside from the fact that I hate that anyway, it's not very accurate. To use words like that in those days, even in a journal, meant a severe punishment if you were caught! I don't think that an author would dare take the risk.This is supposed to be a kid's book, but I guess its gotten so course nowadays that bad language can even be used there and not be taken offensively.Parents beware, if you have a no-tolerance policy on language, you might want to read this first before giving it to your children!	middle
lurches along painfully I got motion sickness reading this book. It is clearly written by an economist, and not a writer. Reading the book feels like driving with the E-break on. The book is full of false starts. The author lays out a whole string of lead-ins, and just when you think you've about reached his point, he jumps right on back to a whole additional set of lead-ins. It's like reading the preamble of a lengthy treatise, "Whereas... and Whereas... and Whereas..."Worse yet, each whereas covers a lot of the same points. It makes it hard to skim, because buried within the repitition are the scattered pieces of new information, which could come at any time.I lurched through this book, trying to find the gold nuggets, but took away very little I didn't already know or couldn't have figured out on my own.	middle
Sling shot ammo Me, Son-in-law and grandson shot up a bag of these. They were very difficult to hold in the pouch of a slingshot by me and the son-in-law with it almost impossible for the 11 yr. old grandson. They were real fast and went a lond distance (when you weren't looking for them in the grass) with very good accuracy. Switched to some 1/2" marbles and had a lot better luck holding and shooting them.	middle

Pretty OK Cons:*Well, when I got my headphones in the mail I was so excited I opened everything right away. And I was sort of dissapointed when I noticed that the range or distance wasn't long or far at ALL. I had the base on top of my computer stack and it still doesn't go far at all.*And another thing, my headphones won't charge. I don't know if it's that I'm not setting the headphones on the base charger right, but, I cannot get the headphones to charge. So I gave these headphones a 3/5.Pros:*They are lightweight.*They can use AAA batteries and not just re-chargable batteries.*They are really neat looking and sleek.	middle
Masters the difficulty of fictionalizing real characters I wanted to read something that portrayed a German who lived through World War II and took action against the evil of his time. This book does a good job of portraying the difficulties Hitler's German opponents faced. They couldn't get assistance from the British (and were actually disdained as traitors!) and found the early German military victories, one after another, made Hitler more and more popular and harder to dispose of. Bonhoeffer was a human saint, principled yet afraid. This book is a good introduction and made me want to learn more about Bonhoeffer. I am now reading his "Letters and Papers from Prison".	middle
A Cautionary Note I have not read this book, but it is obviously based on a book by the same authors, Excel 2002 VBA Programmer's Reference.That book has numerous errors: incorrect code that will not run, code that has incorrect variables, code that has nothing to do with the text above or below it, screen shots that have nothing to do with the text.It also has an eclectic index that on occasion leads you to what you want.The authors have been let down by the Wrox editors, but on occasion one can find gems of useful information in their book. I would be quite tempted to review the present version of the text, but my past experience with Wrox-edited books makes me hesitant to spend more money on such texts.I hope someone who has actually read the book can supply us with a better review than this one.--j.r.a.	middle
Good buy I read some of the reviews before I purchased this costume. As I found out, the sizes run really small. I bought a large, and I normally wear a size 4. The fabric is really stretchy, but kind of cheap. The dress is short, even for the "large" size. For the price, I'm completely satisfied.	middle

Romance Novel???? I wasn't sure if this should have been listed in the Genre: Romance. It was a good read, but it certainly seemed to me to be a glorified romance novel. I don't think I will bother buying any further novels of Huff's.	middle
Patterson is slipping Although this book was still enjoyable, and I will still be getting the next Alex Cross book, I can't help but think that Patterson is concentrating too much on quantity and not enough on quality these days. Comparing Along Came a Spider or any earlier books with his recent in this series, the books just don't seem to have the quality of writing that they used to. I used to wait impatiently for the next in the series, but I am now content to occupy my time reading Michael Connolly and others while waiting for the Cross books to go to paperback.	middle

Big and Heavy Best you knew: It's about 12.5" high and 10.5" deep, and weighs like a couple of bricks. The pages are an unusually heavy stock. It also tends to be rather dry in spots; at least I found it so. It seems to be especially for fans who are ready for absolutely anything Python; it's not as snappy as their films and shows. But don't ignore the other reviews.	middle
Just Okay I have a lot of garnishing books... always looking for new ideas. This book is limited in what garnishes it offers. There are other books that are so much better. (Gourmet Garnishing by Mickey Baskett) or (Garnishing by Dr. Oetker) These are two of the best with wonderful garnishes we can all do!	middle
The Arabian Show Horse First, The Arabian Show Horse is not a guide on showing your Arabian. It might be more aptly titled Skippers Complaint. The Book is a critique on the development of Arabian horse breeding in context with what the author believes is breeding for show type and ignoring the classic Arabian characteristics. For the American reader, unless you are really up on British breeding programs the horses won't ring many bells as far individual horse recognition.Amid the criticisms there is plenty of historical and interesting information. Many beautiful pictures. I guess overall I could have done without the authors biases while complaining about those of other breeders.	middle
Nortons performance is all The film is just average,full of cliche's Richard Gere gives a horrible almost completely rediculous performance. The film is saved by a great performance by Edward Norton. He has the potential to be as good if not better than God AKA Robert DeNiro (Mully)	middle
Your Dragon Viet-Cong Scout's best friend! I got the Linh Dragon Viet-Cong figure and loved her. I'm obsessed with the Vietnam war for some reason. Anyway, I thought that the Ultimate Soldier VC uniform would be great to put another 12" asian figure in.I got a nude Tak figure and slipped him.... looked great! The quality is pretty sharp, and the accessories are nice, considering the simplicity of the jumpsuit. The folding bayonet on the rifle is a particularly nice detail.But once you get to trying to get the sandals on your figure.... good luck! One of the straps immediately bust when I was putting it on the figure's foot. The second sandal basically bust apart completely!Seems that the straps are attached to the sole in such a way that they're more narrow than a figure's feet!! How dissappointing. Now I'm on the look out for little black rubber bands to keep them on...All well, at least Linh's not alone. :)	middle
Great Humor but Lacking in Extras As for the actual Daily Show episodes they are sweet. The fact that this materials is now 8 years old and the jokes still hold up is a testament to the great writing. With all that being said this DVD set is barely worth the $5 I paid for it.The first 2 discs have only 4 episodes a piece on them. The extras include Comedy Central quickies and half baked commentaries. I have seen other reviews that love these quick 10 minute audio affairs. Having heard them all the humor is a lot different than that in the episodes. Non of the commentaries have anything to do with politics or the campaign.Buy this cheap or you might feel ripped off.	middle
Same old story Same complaints as many others have. Mexican train is a very fun game for all ages but this particular set earned these minor complaints:1. The tin box is too large. The Dominoes swim around in this huge box. While it's cute they made it the shape of a train, I would rather a box that is easier to store and holds the dominoes securely.2. The battery operated train whistle went dead after exactly 3 whistles. That is okay since it was very loud, long, and annoying. I've read the batteries are at least $5 to replace so once you add that into the price, the set is no longer any deal.3. The dominoes themselves seemed a little cheap and I didn't like the colors used. I've seen worse and cheaper dominoes but these were disappointing. I'm going to keep on shopping and sell these on Ebay when I replace them.	middle
Blu-ray isn't worth the price The show was only airing for about 14 episodes, so you're paying quite and bit for one season (if you pay the $90 price tag they show). The Blu-ray looks like a poor remaster and hardly worth it. Buy the standard version, save your cash, and allow your BR player to upscale. You'll have similar quality.The show was ended before it's time, thank you Fox and your discontent for all things sci-fi.	middle
Not too good player 3* for sound. ESP works great. Sound quality is good, definitely better than 2 Sony(ESP broke) units I had, but AIWA interferes with all kinds of electric equipment. While listening to my music on the train and it was picking up a static noise from the electric engines of a train, same thing happened on the escalator. For me it's a NO!	middle
Not as good as other Amish fiction I have read The book was too long, and I ended up skimming through part of it. The story did not close the stories of the characters. There was some implied final resolution of the problems of some of the characters, but the reader is left guessing about interpretation. Something I did like about the book was that it described Amish life more than some. I will not say don't read it, but don't be surprised if you find that it drags.	middle
Cheap printer, easy to use Pros:set-up is very easy, prints fairly fastCons:toners cost you extra $70, you will be surprised with lousy printing sounds.Overall, it's not that bad, but not the best one at the same time.	middle
taking a bus trip to nowhere ... its a good tho overpraised movie. i liked the cast most of all, especially greg kinnear who is as usual underrated. paul dano is kinda hot as the teen slacker, and abigail breslin (almost as fat as big bro spencer, but vastly more talented) is quite good in a disarming way, tho i doubt theres more there than what we have already seen (ill be glad to be proven wrong, btw). alan arkin, of course, is alan arkin: giving the quintessential supporting performance as the raunchy heroin-snorting family patriarch. still, the writing is a trifle too obvious to me to bring this into the ranks of the really good.	middle
Not a Movie One Would Want to Watch More than Once After having been burned numerous times by purchasing movies with great reviews by movie critics, I now generally read what the public feels about the movie before I make a decision to purchase, or not purchase it. This was one of those movies that received OK reviews by the public, but nothing special. I took a chance and purchased it. I doubt that I will ever watch it again in the future. The story is fairly weak whereas the locations, color and sets are top quality. The movie certainly has its weak points in terms of the script. Examples are when one of the students is shot and no one goes to his rescue, even though a crowd is present and the killer has fled. The police do not disperse the crowd even though the shooter is still in the vicinity. While it is implied and somewhat shown that one of the characters is innocent of a past crime, I kept waiting for an explanation of what really happened and why the person would not talk about it.	middle
Harry Potter Mom My 3 year old "loves" all things Harry Potter, especially since big brother does. Have been looking foward to something that was more on his level for him to enjoy. The book is very nice. He enjoys the pop up and action tabs. The artwork is nice. I was very disappointed that it has no words at all! A little story would have been nice. He does, however, enjoy the book and is very proud to have is "own" Harry Potter book.	middle
Not a bad Movie This was not a bad movie.Mikey Rourke was very cool and professional while Tupac was the ultimate evil. I never liked Tupac and I still dont (live by the sword-Die by the sword). The movie was a little weird but just for Rourke made it worth wacthing it. A great actor	middle

Best of EARLY Illapu This is the best of EARLY Illapu. The songs on this album are mostly older, more traditional Andean songs. It is quite different from their later recordings which have a much more mature and unique sound such as "En Estos Dias" and "Morena Esperanza." This is not the very best of Illapu, but it does have some classics such as "Candombe Para Jose." I own it because it is a good alternative to buying all of their earlier albums. For more traditional Andean music I would prefer the group, Kollahuara or Quilapayun. Illapu's greatest is their more modern fusion that uses many elements and instruments of Andean music along with sax, electric bass, and other more modern instruments. Also, their more recent works are much deeper lyrically and musically and have more layers of vocal harmony and instrumentation.	middle
Adequate system for a nice price The main influence on my purchase of this system was the cost. I was unable to find a system with half the power for the price. The system has a good, clear, room filling sound. As well, it makes an excellent starer system for a home theatre. However, I was dissapointed with the FM and AM reception. As well, I would suggest the purchase of a subwoofer for anyone seeking serious bass response from this unit.	middle
Its OK Well I love Blink 182 and Box Car Racer and figured why not with this CD. Now i wasnt going in with any ideas or thinking that it was going to be a clone of blink, but I still didnt like the style and sound. Its and OK CD but nothing like Box Car Racer was. I would rather have a new Blink or Box Car CD out than this. Listening throught the cd there are some good songs but for the most part the song all sound alike which i really do not like. Having heard Tom's new band it makes me wonder what Mark's new band (Plus 44) is going to sound like hopfully it will be more impressive than AVA has been.	middle
"Sloppy Firsts" Being a 14 year old girl, I could identify with Jessica Darling in this book. I feel the same frustration and worry she does, but this book just didn't do it for me. The author simply tried too hard to write like a teen would, in my opinion. The recent pop culture references fell flat, especially considering that most of them relate to 'flash-in-the-pan' fads.The cliques came off as over-exaggerated. Of course there are cliques and groups at my high school, but none are so blatantly obvious and territorial as these.The characters were often extremely annoying to me, as well, especially Jessica. She came off as too self-righteous, passing off almost everything and everyone as a waste of her time.All in all, I thought this book was okay. It can be hard to find a good book for my age group, so this one will do. I will probably read the sequel coming out in a few days, but this book certainly didn't make a dent in my favorite book list.	middle
Allen Key Not So Good It's a good price, but a pain to build. Allen key didn't work, had to get another one from other projects. Other than that it does the job.	middle
Dvd problems I love the series. Already owned the first season then went and bought the second and third. The only reason I'm giving this a low rating is because there is a problem with the dvds. Our main dvd player is the 360, we kept getting a disk read error, tried the PS2 and the same thing happened. Tried the computer and it happened again. They will only work in our laptop, which is ok for us but a problem if we decide to let friends borrow them.	middle
Rare doesn't always mean awesome. I love the band Stone Fox, I really do, and finally had to have more than the other two albums. I opted to pay a steep price for this rare, hard to find, nobody even knows exists, album Dirty Pillows.I was excited about finding this rare gem, but in the end I was generally disappointed, it is not nearly on the level with the albums 'Stone Fox' or 'Totally Burnt', both of which are EXCELLENT and HIGHLY recommended.Don't pay too much for this album, spend your money on their other albums.Just my opinion.Try to check out the INSAINTS and DEVIL DOLL too, great music.	middle
Ok 3D movie Ok 3D movie.Not alot of off screen jump outs,but it's way better to watch in 3D then it is in 2D...makes the movie more fun..The 3D starts to get your attention when Alice enters wonderland..I give the movie 4 stars and the 3D 3 stars.	middle

Nice shots of a select pair of Voyager regulars. The shots provided are good, but it is extremely short on B'Elanna and Kes, and extensive on 7-of-9 and especially the Captain. Anyone particularly interested in these two, you have a winner. As a female fan of Star Trek who always hoped to see stronger female characters, it's a positive thing to me to see some of the Voyager women showing their stuff, though.	middle

Great book, aweful translation! I agree with one of the reviewers who found this book "painful" to read, yet Nabokov compared it to Joyce! How could he e wrong? Well, he read the book in Russian! So what I did is to dig deeper to find another version. I am happy to say that the Maguire&Malmstad;Petersburggives justice to the book. First, it lacks the fairly pathetic introduction that the Penguin classic version has. The intro is sneaked as urtext and all it does is to vomit on Stalin and the 1937 events, which happened after Bely's death. It also has the presumption of telling the reader what to think about the book, what to "see" and what to expect. In contrast the Maguire&Malmstad; version has a meaningful and helpful introduction, the translation is thoughtful and appropriate English is used to translate the improbable Symbolist verbiage used by Bely. I read both, and I feel I read a great book )M&M;) and an awful one (Penguin). I very strongly recommend reading this book in its good version!	middle
Great price, okay quality I've now used the harness about a dozen times after having it for a little over a month and it seems to work well. My primary complaint is that one of the hooks completely rusted on the exterior after the first or second use. Still works, but looks like it is ten year old now...	middle
this game is okay this game is reallly hard to beat. i got it a couple days ago and i can't even beat the first level. the graphics are okay, not great though. the guns are cool, but the people are messed up sometimes. so if you are very good at first-person shooter games buy it. but if you are not, consider buying another game.	middle
The product is okay I use several Olay products. With this one my skin feels soft right after application, but I don't notice a real difference in overall appearance.	middle
average i found this product to be average while compared to any other products which are available in the market.	middle
I'd rather listen to Opeth. This is a decent album and everything, but it in no way compares to that of other bands like Opeth (not to be confused with the horrible band Otep). "Midian" has some great songs, such as "Her Ghost In The Fog" (which I believe is probably the band's best song ever), but this record can also be very irritating and annoying as well. The main reason? The singer.If this was just a musical album without any vocals, it'd probably get 5 stars. Musically, every song on here is brilliant. However, the vocalist sounds like a yapping dog that's been shot. If you can get past the irritating voice of Danni Filth, this really isn't that bad of an album.	middle
a dim dusk for Solo [no spoilers] "The Han Solo Trilogy" concludes with "Rebel Dawn" five years following the prior novel. What began as a promising series develops into a mediocre teen adventure where Han struggles with his emotions and becomes jealous of Bria Tharen, the former slave now a Rebel Commander. Forgotten are Han's past and other smugglers from his childhood.Several chapters track Bria in her quest to destroy the Empire yet end with a brief interlude explaining what Han is currently doing, none of which is worthwhile. I believe the trilogy is about Han Solo, not Bria Tharen. Various encounters eventually lead to incidents in the core trilogy (episodes 4 through 6) of the Star Wars saga but overall the series incorporates too much from other novels as cameo appearances and events and does not focus on being original. The hasty finale covers what occurs to most characters.A comprehensive appendix would have been useful.Thank you.	middle
A good referesher book I think this book is beyond a simple introduction. First half of the book is Vector Analysis and other half is mixture of transformations and Tensor analysis. It covers a lot and has examples for each concept. What I did not like was that the concepts were introduced from general to particular. So if you are not exposed to Vector or Tensor analysis, it is not easy to follow a new concept defined on n-dimensional space and see application on two dimensional space.So it was a good refresher with some applications to Physics but for new starter it is difficult especially for self lerner. Also definitions were very abstract, dry without any meaning attached to it. I can not considered this book as a course book by itself.	middle
Comfortable and good sound...but bad quality... ok, so I got a pair of these in Feb 2009, they almost last a year...almost. The left ear bud just died out one day.No problem shure has a 1 year full warranty on all products right? Sure enough..took a while but they sent me another pair. These lasted about 4 months if even and again left ear bud started cutting out. now a month in Im still waiting for another replacement pair.These are possibly the most comfortable ear buds once you get used to them. The highs and mids are great. The bass is there...but it's nothing to write home about.The biggest issue with these is the build quality, I;d expect them to last at least a full year and a half/2 years if not longer for the price.Honestly you can get skull candy inked buds for 10-15$ if you know where to look and they wil have more bass. Yes skul candy is HORRIBLE quality...don't expect them to last more than 6-9 months...but it;s not like shures last you much longer...Save the money get something else.	middle

Simply functional I found this item while searching for a small portable AM radio. It'll do the trick, however, it could have been made a fraction of its size - it's bigger than my last AM radio. No bells or whistles just good reception and simple controls. Single battery operation runs this unit for weeks!	middle
Not working after 1,5 years, warranty useless I bought this model almost 2 years ago. It worked fine, pretty comfortable on the head, though we had to change frequencies sometimes. The batteries lasted all this time, but gradually the volume of sound had to be increased at the source (TV). Headphones stopped working abruptly, only horrible noise and interference were heard. I changed the batteries as I thought this was the reason, but it did not help. Checked the company website for warranty info, there is a minimum $35 evaluation charge. I would rather buy a new set which costs $65 now. I expected more from this company, honestly, where is the famous german quality? Product made in China however.	middle
It's ok, not what I expected The toy is ok. If you read most reviews you will notice that it was bought mostly for 1 or 2 year old toddlers. I would not recommend this toy for any child older than two. It really was not what I expected. For a baby, this toy is good and I would say it's pretty durable, just make sure you pull the seat way up for them to reach the pedal. It did not seem to catch the attention of my little one very long. I guess I did not read the description when buying this. I assumed the screen with the car was electronic like a video game when driving, however it is just paper with a car that goes from side to side. If you're fine with that then I think you'll enjoy it. As a stated for a baby this is good.The horn has sound to it as well as the pedals.	middle
Not what I expected. I was a little disappointed in this. I thought the CD would have an African flair, or at the very least, would sound "latin". I thought it sounded more like just big band jazz, but with no latin sound. For example, Machito's "Tanga" I really love, but there was nothing remotely like this on this CD.	middle
This book is mediocre. It would help a lot if a color matching guide (palette) was included in the book. There are a variety of color interpretations made by clothing manufacturers, it is at times difficult to find the exact color match the author is suggesting.	middle

Causes Bed dives I can't really rate this product because whenever I used it with my 4 year old cock-a-poo she would run and dive under the bed immediately afterward. It got so that if she even saw me reach for the bottle she would bed dive. Obviously she doesn't like it, and doesn't want me to use it, so I haven't.	middle
Excellent movie, terrible tape quality and editing I have loved this movie since it was released. I had searched for some time to find it in a rental shop or movie store. I found it here and bought it. The tape quality is terrible, but worse is the awful edit job that was done. This is like a TV version of the original film. The film gets 5 stars, but the tape quality and editing bring the overall rating down to 3.	middle
Interesting, but too instructional. This book is a hands-on guide for Flash 8. The problem is if you want to really learn the program, you should practice creating things, not follow step by step to emulate a bunch of premade exercises. Of course, if you don't use this book you could be missing out also.	middle
Useful As an aside, after reading "Data warehouse toolkit", "Building the data warehouse", and now "Mastering data warehouse design", I am none the wiser about the supposed chasm between Kimbalites and Inmonista; the book cover promises "a cutting-edge response to Ralph Kimball's challenge to the data warehouse community", but its pages did not even tell me what that challenge was, and I would be hard-pressed to define Imhoff's own "Corporate Information Factory". More to the point, I consider MDWD a worthwhile, substantial read, while noting a certain disjointedness - it's as if five heterogeneous articles have been put together - and complaining about, shall we say, not the most helpful explanations of implementation specifics. (This caused real annoyance, so three stars). Kimball's book came across much better in this regard, hence the thought "Has Kimball written about this?", but if you like your reading with a bit of challenge, Imhoff's is a good choice.	middle
Worth reading - for inspiration Like Godin's previous book, Permission Marketing, I found this book to inspire ideas, rather than give them. Godin has a knack for making people think - though I'm wondering if that was the intent with these books. If you are looking for definitive answers to business and marketing questions, steer clear of this one. If you are looking for a book that will get you thinking about the applications of viral marketing, then pick up a copy. Godin's e-mail newsletter is worth subscribing to and you can pick up a copy of the book at his web site as well.	middle
Kinda falls short The first Afro took 10 years to create and its awesomeness shows it. This one seems more like a hurried wannabe trying to rake in some more cash off of the name. Not to say that its not top notch animation but it feels weak and was a bit boring at times. I wish I would have rented this instead of buying it.	middle
Good Music....Lousy Lyrics I purchased the album because the music was interesting and quirky, but you could still tap your feet (or whatever else) along with the tune. While I still like the album for the same reasons, I'm less happier with it now that I know what the artist is actually saying. It's not that the lyrics are particularly crude, instead its that they only rarely make any sense. The lyrics are not about a story, nor are they about a feeling or common experience, instead they are somebodies musings thrown out a random and sung along to the background music.	middle
The book that started it all The first edition of Beyond Psychology introduced the world to Metapsychology for the first time back in 1988. The third edition, featured here, includes many revisions to the philosophical and practical aspects of the book. Beyond Psychology will always be of significance since it was the first book to codify the technique of Traumatic Incident Reduction (TIR). TIR has gone on to find many applications as a brief, one-on-one, non-hypnotic technique in such diverse groups as Vietnam veterans, domestic violence and motor vehicle accidents survivors. In short, anyone with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder can benefit from TIR and this book which describes the technique.	wonderful
Good first season! Beautiful animation! And if you haven't seen the episode "Rookies", you need to check it out. There are some great stories going on in this show. It's not just for kids.	wonderful
PERFECT gate for areas that have base moldings I needed a gate for my 41" hallway for my dog....tried the safety 1st gate that is $19.99 but turns out that one only works for areas that are perfectly even and do not have base moldings (would work for a door frame but not for my hallway). Also the cheaper one is plastic lattice which my dog would chew on...This one is PERFECT, but you can not see thru the plastic panels as stated in review. Very solid gate, when you press down the lock handle to set the gate up, it custom fits to the space. Definally worth the $30...I did get mine at toys r us though :)	wonderful
Excellent urban/casual shoe Materials are first class, has an attractive design and ankle support is pretty good. I chose the "oily brown" model and it looks very well, almost like the picture. For being a boot, it is truly comfortable and feels almost like a shoe. If you're planning it for heavy duty activities, then you should reconsider this option(i find the outer get scratched somewhat easily). Overall a good product, i would highly recommend it for casual/urban wear purposes.	wonderful
the best fantasy book of all time A few years ago, I read THE HOBBIT. One day, I was telling my friend how much I loved it, and her sister said, " You should read LORD OF THE RINGS." I kind of shrugged it off and never bothered to read it, figuring it couldn't possibly be as good as THE HOBBIT. Then I saw the movie. It was so cool I just had to read the book. I bought a boxed set in August, and before the month was over, I had read it twice. It is the absolute best book I have ever read. It is written very very well, and I love the way all of the races are so different.J.R.R. Tolkien has created this amazing, realistic world; complete with countries, different cultures, and an antagonist. The members of the Fellowship are so colorful and well described, that after you finish the book you feel like you know them personally. I recommend this book to anyone who can read.	wonderful
an entrancing fantasy masterwork This book is one of those "hard-to-put-down" classics that will leave you hungry for the conclusion. If you read it, you will have no choice but to read the sequel. Stephen Donaldson has a marvelous talent for character personification. Terisa, Geraden, Myste, Elega: all of them make you grieve for hurts against them, experience euphoria at their triumphs, and suffer indignation at injustices committed to them. On the other hand, don't read this book if you are not planning to be totally absorbed by the convoluted story line and elusive climax(es). The realism of this book, in spite of Imagery, an unheard of practice in our world, is so compelling that it will drive you to return to this book again and again	wonderful
the best book ever written... and title is supposed to be "Return of the Spirit" (Awdad il Ruh). This is the best book ever written in my opinion and I have read many books. There is a tightness in the weaving of this novel. the characters are real and relate back to the country.	wonderful
Great CD From start to finish, this CD in my opinion is very enjoyable. I think the band does a great job on most songs and on some like "Thank You" and Bell Bottom Blues, they are outstanding. I've been listening to Tesla since the GRC and I have no problem with another cover album. I would love to hear many of these tunes played live along with all the old favs. Enjoy the Cd for what it is, a great rockin' CD that doesn't quit. See ya the shows.....	wonderful
great traps These quickly and humanely kill the mice; in rare circumstances we have had mice trapped by the foot but this seems to happen with other traps too, at least these don't have the problem of missing mice that are too little (the traditional wooden victor traps do). They are easy to set with little risk of hurting yourself. They are also reusable so you don't need to feel too guilty about the plastic. Avoid the Tomcat version, have never caught a mouse in one of those. These work consistently with a little peanut butter.	wonderful

FYI: Regular Print Edition (isbn: 1555838537) Sells for MUCH Less Than the Large Print Edition (Though it is Out of Print)! I haven't read this yet, but I was researching it and noticed there is a regular print (NOT large print) version that sells for a fraction of the cost of this one. The ISBN is 1555838537; but note it is out of print, so it may not stay low priced for long as this novel is considered a classic.	wonderful

creepy creepy creepy I've been a fan of the supernatural since I was a kid. Not to say I believe in it all, but I always find myself looking into it.Daniel Cohen has to be one of the most prolific non-fiction writers out there, and this book does not disappoint. I have read several dozen 'true ghost' books and for some reason this one was one of the creepiest...perhaps since it was about children, but regardless, if you're tired of stale, encylopedia style books that don't really get into the sightings, this is the book for you.	wonderful

Overall i have to say this product is great, shipped quickly and has performed flawlessly in the month that i have it. i do have to make notice of some weird lines that showed up in the first day of using the cables but i attribute that to dirty hdmi sockets, after i cleaned them up everything works great... A++++ on this one.	wonderful

Perfect for Invitations We bought these to use on our save-the-date cards and wedding invitations, and they worked out great. Just the right size for regular envelopes, and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you're not using the whole page of labels, and want to use the remaining labels later, take a piece of white paper, and tape it over the labels you are not using. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. It's hard to notice on the page, but once you affix them to the envelope, they can look a bit dirty.	wonderful

Informative and Easy to Read I did not expect much from this book that was required for a college course. I was happily surprised when I found myself not only learning from it but also enjoying it.

Cowboy Sam takes Texas by storm A wonderful new cowboy has entered the Texas scene.His name is Cowboy Sam. This book,Cowboy Sam and Those Confounded Secrets, has a special message to all young and old cowpokes alike. There is great importance in keeping someone's special secret.

While You Were Sleeping Lucy is a happy-go-lucky ticket seller, until one day she finds the man of her dreams and also sees him get mugged. After being mugged the man, known as Peter, goes into a coma. Lucy goes to visit him at the hospital and the nurse tells Peter's family that Lucy is his fiancée'. Lucy can not get the courage to tell them the truth and his family take her in as a member of their family. While with this family Lucy falls head over heels in love with Peter's brother, Jack. Lucy does not know what to do when Peter comes out of a coma and doesn't remember her. A great romantic comedy that is so pure and well-made that it is near impossible to say anything negative about it. It is not a perfect movie, but it is a very likeable movie that delivers what it promises. Sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic comedy.	wonderful

Elegant stories and anecdotes of yesteryear. Thoughts Of A Boy Growing Up was written by Kenneth Nelson to be a surprise Christmas gift for his seven grandchildren. Nelson shares the story of his life including attending a mountain school, learning about birds and animals as a child, what it was like for him when his family moved to town, being a dairyman, attending Ray Union School, his brother leaving, and a great deal more. These are stories told with the simple candor of someone reflecting on their life experiences to the benefit and entertainment of others, so that they can get a sense of the people and events of a time now gone, but which served to create the man that yesteryear boy would grow up to be. Highly recommended.	wonderful
Excellent Guideline for Losing Weight I saw the documentaries and heard all the hype about Dr. Atkins' diet and simply dismissed it as a fad diet that would fade away as do so many of these things.

He lost weight, his blood pressure dropped, and he felt better physically. Take my word for it, Dr. Atkins knows what he's talking about.	wonderful

Must have for any Rush fans... This is more than just another concert video with behind the scenes footage. It is a true documentry of the band and their lives, before, during and after and back again. If all you know about Rush is they are a great three man band from Canada, then you need to see this movie. And you are definatly going to want to keep it, not just rent it. The picture and sound quality are very good, but there is a lot of old footage that can't be helped. Candide interviews with all kinds of Rocker who are still being influienced by Rush. It's excellent and I havn't even watched all of the bonus videos yet.	wonderful

A GREAT book about the Apollo program This particular book does a great job of getting into the insights of the astronauts when they were front page news. Apollo was truly the pinnacle of NASA and Andrew Smith does a great job of creating the aura that still surrounds the 9 men still living, that walked on another world.I could've done without some of his personal musings, as he paints a picture that you would rather he keep to himself. I have my own personal perspectives and if you didn't grow up in U.K. or CA, you'll probably agree that Andrew should've kept some of his memories out of the pages.Even with the author's anecdotes, the book is 5 stars and worthy reading for any space history buff.	wonderful
Teen cruelty and teen depression captured perfectly Such a beautifully written book...the author developed her character so well, I really felt I knew her. I was terribly saddened by what she'd been through, but loved how the guy got his in the end. I love poetic justice. Ha! The author captured high school perfectly, especially that horrible mob mentality and how people will turn on you in an instant. That meanness, cruelty, pettiness. Frightening.	wonderful

For W&G Fanatics! This book is great for people who are obsessed with the show. The colorful (and I mean COLORFUL) pages are filled with photos, episode summaries (seasons 1 -6), cast and character bios (on minor characters as well), witty quotes and a lot of behind the scenes articles and tidbits. It makes a great coffee table book to pick up and flip through and relive the laughter.	wonderful
Surprised Me, Not a Typical Sequel Although I tend to shy away from sequels, I broke down and bought this at Giant to pass time away while completing a tediuous task. It was GREAT.There is zero babe factor in this movie, which was a disappointment, it could have been scripted much more engagingly, but three things really blew me away throughout:1) The staging or the access to ostensible Vatican inside and underground areas--presumably not actually within the Vatican, this was all done superbly2) The twists and turns and the ending were great. I actually had tears of surprise at the end and will not spoil it.3) Finally, Tom Hanks and the historical allusions still fascinate me. It would be great if history could be taught so ably, but more deeply and more thoroughly.Absolutely recommended.To browse all 86 of the DVDs that I recommend, visit Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog, each links back to their respective Amazon page but only there can you see JUST my DVD reviews.	wonderful

Safe, durable and long-lasting for this veteran Britax mom I bought the Marathon after having used two Roundabouts for my older sons. I had been very pleased with the Roundabout and used them until my sons were almost 4. They loved them, easy to use, and they always fell asleep in them. Worth every penny.The Marathon is a total joke and has a huge design flaw to it - the buckle is too close to the crotch/back of the seat, so there's no way that it could accomodate a 65 or even 25 lb child. I'm so disappointed in Britax for making the Marathon and hawking it as better than the Roundabout. It's not even as plush or padded as the Roundabout. And it was way too big for my minivan!Stick with a good investment and a solid, long-term winner, the Roundabout. I know I'll have it for many more years and get good resale on it like I did the other ones. And the sales cleark at BRU said that they see too many returns on the Marathon because it doesn't fit babies' crotches and it doesn't fit most cars/vans.	wonderful
Great product Very easy and super fast set up. Instructions are simple and concise. I installed it for an older Toshiba desktop (Celeron 466 MHZ), under W98SE, and it works flawlessly. It sits in a bedroom behind 2 closed doors and 3 walls with 2 large storage closets, and gets a strong signal (over 95%) from DI-713P, which is set up as an access point (infrastructure) with 802.11b. It probably would be even faster with another Airplus 22Mbps product. No configuration needed, and truly PnP and running in about 5 minutes. It supports 64/128/256-bit WEP, and carries a 3 years warranty. The price, with the current rebate, makes it an even greater value. What more can I say about D-Link that I have not said before!	wonderful
Great deal. Great masks. Okay, so gas masks are creepy for some people, but the way I look at it, it may save your life someday. These are well-made masks, and come with all the accessories. I think they look great and hopefully they'll work just as good for that day when I need one. Great deal when I got it, too. These things have really come down in price.Do yourself a favor. Get one for each member of your family, store it away in the basement, because you never know when you may need something like this.	wonderful

Good retro Always a good movie to show your children once they are old enough good memories and to see how young the actors are that are now old enough to have their own children	wonderful
A Great Beginner's Guide I had been struggling with how to start railroading for about 6 months when I ran across this book at the library. I finally have some direction and the available know-how to get going. The book covers the most basic subjects of how to get started as well as a few more advanced subjects. It's a must for new modelers!	wonderful
Beer can chicken device I like it. No longer have to search for a beer can -- I mostly drink bottled beer. The pan, though it appeared too small, is just right. Good job, Steven!	wonderful
What's worse than being broke? Being broken? Actually, no. Brokenness is something to be attained. Brokenness sets us apart from the masses pretending to be okay. We don't have to be "all that." Someone else wants to be that for us. Burnett reveals how we can live a blessed and even prosperous life when we enter this honest and vulnerable state of brokenness and allow God to be everything we need.	wonderful

A Wonderful Ninth This is indeed a spectacular Ninth. You can see Karajan's total involvement from the opening bars. What makes it great for me, though, is not only the playing and singing, but the video treatment of the conductor and orchestra. Unfortunately, I find many Karajan's videos spoiled because of really odd camera treatments. The orchestra is lined up in an artificial way, or it is highlighted in a way that it detracts from the music. None of that here. Karajan said that he made videos so as to preserve his art. This is one of the few videos that really captures the essence of Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.	wonderful
Great vibe Great mix of dance and pop music. There are two or three clunkers on this disc, but the rest of the songs are fantastic.	wonderful
excellent overview with great pictures for beginning pilots I enjoyed the book and its pictures whcihc make understanding the conceepts easier.	wonderful

Not From the Books! This is an original story written just for A&E and should be taken as a bridge to the next films that are being planned for next year.This film serves to answer questions not answered in the books: whatever happened to Archie? What happened to Captain Pelew?Don't be alarmed, though -- the Forester estate gave approval and oversaw the story construction.After sharing these films with your kids...be sure you share the books as well. Your entirely family will enjoy the films and learn a great deal about British Navel History.Enjoy!	wonderful
Meadows at his silky smooth best.... The very first Marion Meadows CD that I heard, Body Rhythm, was a favorite...I used to let friends borrow it, tell everybody about it, and used it when I was with a woman that I cared about.....I thought that there wasn't going to be another CD that I could love more....Until....Pleasure was released. I was simply blown away by the sheer beauty of the music....If you ever need a song that can take you mind off your problems.....Get Away is the song for you....It combines beautiful sound of Meadows' Sax, and the great voice of Nikki Richards. Every song is a testament to Meadows' skill and drive....If you are a true fan...then you can appreciate this beautiful piece of work. I, for one, can not wait til the next CD.	wonderful
4th Graders love to sing out loud in class to it! I am a big fan of all of Peter's music for over 10 years now. Since I am a 4th grade teacher and mother of a 3 year old, I had to get Peter's children's CD. I bought it for my kids, but play it for myself. The tunes are original and funny! It amazes me that my 4th graders can pick up the lyrics after one play of the song. (My best friend is a salamander is their favorite.) There are values in the lyrics that I hope my students take with them after listening to the song. "You shouldn't judge a friend by how he looks or by what he eats" is a great way to teach respect in my class. I look forward to more children's CD in the future.	wonderful
Wow! Vocal excellence on a variety of styles. I love the diversity on this album - funky, rock, sultry, big band. The voices blend beautifully on all songs. My only complaint is that the video isn't included for Giving Him Something He Can Feel! That video was what made me buy the album - talk about sexy!!! Although I also enjoy the other songs/videos this song remains my favorite.	wonderful

dark & depressing Well this is a very rare look at Ivan. Here is a character I didn't know much about but learned a great deal from this ballet & the description that comes with it.

Angela's story If you haven't read the first of Frank McCourt's books "Angela's Ashes," then I suggest you do so. I read that book for my college English class and realized what a talented author he is. So when I found out that he had a sequel, I had to check it out. "Tis" starts off where he left off in the first memoir. He tells about his adult life trying to make it in New York city. His biggest goal is to teach, but he must first climb over some obsticles that come his way. He wants to go to college, become a teacher, get married, and have kids like every American.This book has some funny tales of his mischeif while in New York, and I couldn't help but laugh at some of the stories he had from teaching high school. He still has to deal with past demons from his childhood with his mother and father, which makes you both angry and sad. I suggest this book to anyone who has an open mind, and a soft place in their heart for our ancestors overcoming odds in America.	wonderful
Fast paced This was a very fast paced and entertaining movie. Justin Timberlake is very good as is Amanda Seyfreid. As crazy as the world is getting, I didn't find it that far fetched.	wonderful

Muddy Waters meets The Rolling Stones = A Blast Muddy is half way through a gig, at the Checkerboard Lounge, when Mick Jagger, Ronnie and Ian rock up. This is the stuff legends are made of. Unplanned unrehearsed off the cuff fantastic music. Sixteen tracks on this DVD, including, Hoochie Coochie Man, One Eyed Woman, Baby Please Don't Go, Flip Flop And Fly, and two bonus tracks, You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone, and Black Limousine. There are also cameo appearances by Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Lefty Dizz. This is a real jam session, and Blues lovers, this is one great DVD.	wonderful
Why isn't this woman famous already... she is as good at what she does as Linda Eder and Diana Krall are at what each of them does best. A Canadian, Janice has a brassy, sassy, sensual side that is really fun to hear. Her backup band is sensational, and her song choices sizzling. In the 16 tracks here, all written originally for Broadway musicals, Ms. Hagan takes us back to the jazz/pop era of '50's standards as rendered by Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughn and other greats. Most are up-tempo, and all are at the very least, entertaining and competent. Most are somehow better than just "competent and entertaining." This lady can really sing, and demonstrates an artistic sensibility which is really nice to see in a person not yet born when most of her chosen songs were written. Check out her samples and I'll bet you'll buy this. And don't overlook her Christmas CD either.	wonderful
Faint Positive at 9 DPO I have tried a couple other early test strips, but I am thrilled with these. I ordered them on the 2nd and they arrived the 8th, short timeframe but it felt like forever. I was so anxious to test that I went against my better judgement and tested that night (9 DPO) with a nearly empty bladder. I got a faint line. I was amazed, so I used a First Response Early Result that I was saving for confirmation. It had a very faint line too. I retested in the morning (10 DPO), and I had faint lines again, but definitely not imagining it. I am high risk, so I'll be using these to monitor my hormone increases, but I highly recommend buying some if you are TTC!	wonderful
A terrific book for a student of race in the social sciences _Race in Mind_ is a terrifically well informed and enthusiastically written book, clear and direct in its prose, that explains and debunks the concept of race from within the biological and social sciences. Anthropologist Alexander Alland provides an analysis of the science and history of the concept that will serve beginning students in the social sciences with a solid foundation, and more advanced students with a thoughtful and concise articulation of race and its perils. Alland connects the science, psuedoscience, and history of race to the social facts of racism and racist practices, from slave aution listings to what he terms the "pluses and minuses of multiculturalism." _Race in Mind_ is an excellent and important read.	wonderful
5 Stars is not enough! This singer was under-appreciated for a long time, but this CD is almost perfect as Phylis works with old 'Philly Sound' producers Gamble & Huff to give us 'When I Give My Love (this time)', and 'Meet Me On The Moon', 'Living In Confusion', and more. Phyllis' vocals are on point throught the entire CD, but the hits song, 'Don't Wanna Change The World', sticks out from the rest of the songs (and not in a good way either!). While it was Phyllis' biggest hit single, it hasn't aged well, and hearing the Diva rap isn't cool at all.The rare bonus track recorded during the same sessions, 'Hottest Love Around', was previously available on inported editions of the CD, and is now available on the great 'In Between The Heartaches' compilation, which is also a must have.	wonderful
babyfaith videos are awesome My daughter is a year old she's been watching baby faith videos since she was about 7mo.She is always getting in to everything and on the move but as soon as I pop in God made music or God made animals she is content.She watches them in amazement.thats how I get my house work done. I can hear her giggling and just plain cracking up.I highly recommend this.	wonderful

Vivid images, captivating story of heart and soul Fernanda Montenegro was superb in the performance as a letter writer for the illiterate in central station. Dora performs this job in a perfunctory manner, sharing content with a friend, mocking, criticizing, choosing which letters to actually send. She is cold and impersonal. She feels obligated for a young boy whose mother just died and after "selling" him to an unsavory orphanage she retrieves him. Dora's plight is filled with her own pain of the "drunkard" of a father who abandoned her and the death of her own mother. And so, the journey begins to get Joshue back to his father regardless of his reputation. Wonderful images and realism of life in Brazil project. Great human interest story! Great performances by Fernanda and the child.	wonderful
Very Confusing and Hard to understand Since I had to read this for school I just thought of it as just another boring book. It was boring at first but once I got into it I found it intersting. It's one of those books where u think its going to be boring but it ends up being very intersting. So if you enjoyed the book good for you. Those of you who didn't hey I understand	wonderful
Lovin' Mimi This marks Mariah's second album from Universal and is better than that dismal Charmbracelet, or Rainbow, or, yes, Glitter.This is from a review from USA today, which i totally agree with:With her imitators all over radio and American Idol, it's sometimes hard to recall what pop-soul music sounded like before Carey came along. The diva herself remembers, though, as evidenced by the wistful, old-school vibe on Mine Again, Circles and other endearing new tunes. Breezy, playful tracks such as Say Somethin' (featuring Snoop Dogg) and Get Your Number (with Jermaine Dupri) prove the singer hasn't forsaken her passion for hip-hop. But it's the ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.	wonderful
awsome book This book is not only educational in the art of picking up women, but also a very entertaining and interesting story. I would highly recomend it to people wanting to boost their confidence and increase thier chances at meeting women. I would also recomend it to anyone interested in human behavour and how people (particularly women) respond in social situations.	wonderful
She Does it Again, Will She Ever Stop?? I am sitting here listening to yet another great CD, most of which was also partly written and produced by this amazing singer. This CD is very similar to all CDs she has released in the past. Her style is amazing as always.It really disturbs me that this album could receive any bad reviews from the media. I am also confused that people claim she has changed her style or that she is trying to become someone else. I own every CD she has put out and they all follow a very similar format and style. I still think she is the absolute best and will continue to do so.If you love Mariah, you do not want to miss this one. Please, go out and buy the album, show her your continued support!	wonderful
Patients Guide To Outstanding Breast Cancer Care I started reading this book as I left the surgeons office and my fears started to go away too. This book is a must if you have breast cancer. It will take you step by step through what's next to what we should be asking the doctors.But more importantly, it will and does bring back the hope. Written by a professional who understands we all get scared!I have a copy to give my family doctor. Why? So the next women who is waiting to see the surgeon can read and feel the hope and help that is out there for us all.	wonderful
Mamou Playboys Special IS! Track #1 The "Mamou Playboys Special" is about the most you can get out of a Cajun/Zydeco band! It has to be the most up and happy piece of music you want in this genre. Get it when you can. I have only been able to hear it all on KCMU 90.3 FM in Seattle, and on the web, since it is not available anymore. I keep coming back here to order it....	wonderful
Love love love this game. I played this game when I was younger (think the Leonardo DiCaprio craze) thinking it'd be based on the movie. It wasn't... but it was better. The game was a perfect mix of plot and history and the graphics were great for the time.My only concern is that there is no updated version of the game so I had to switch my computer settings to run 32-bit color (I think?) to make it display correctly. Ugh. It would also crash a lot. Well worth the frustration- though I have never stopped the darn ship from sinking. Oh well. =)A couple different alternate endings which made for lots of fun at the end.	wonderful
Great for a chocolate lover I gave this as a gift to a favorite cousin who is an admitted "chocoholic". She reported that there was nothing included that was "throwaway". All the products first class and the kind of truffles, chocolates, cocoa and so on that a true lover of the bean likes. Quantities were sufficient to give you a decent taste of each one. I had become discouraged with gift baskets that had a couple good items and a bunch of stuff nobody would love. This one is not that way; actually safe--and satisfying--to send someone you really like!	wonderful
Great DVD! My son saw this version of "Wheels on the Bus" on TV and loved it! It's realxing and he would often fall asleep to it. When we got the DVD and he started watching all of the other songs, he grew to love them all. Not an annoying type of DVD for adults :)	wonderful
the best motorhead album ace of spades was the greatest album from lemmy kilminister and his boys.this album is a great hard rock classic with superb songs like shoot you in the back and live to win.very highly recommended.[...]	wonderful
Hilarious! This movie is one of the funniest documentaries I've ever seen. I saw this at the Bside release in Austin and laughed from beginning to end. The SAP developed these pretty normal, yet hilarious characters and watched them go through the most grueling and comical of competitions. From drinking while running through a creek to carrying your partner on your back, the amount of alcohol consumed is absolutely stunning. The final event is, by far, the most impressive. I won't spoil it, but to watch these guys drink so much so quickly is an amazing feat that few could pull off, but everyone should try.Anyone who went through the typical college experience will absolutely love this film. It reminds us of all our youth and how we should grow up but never old. Great film! Highly recommended!	wonderful
What a Wonderful Book! I watched the film version of this book first. I've never heard or read about "Howl's Moving Castle" before. I enjoyed the film very much then I decided to read the book. After finishing the book this has became my favorite fantasy book along with the Harry Potter books.I like the charactors, the setting, the magic and the story very much. It is quite fun to read. I couldn't stop reading it. It's full of humor and some parts are very touching. I like every bit of it and I like the ending, too.	wonderful
AWESOME READER! This book, was short but sweet, all of her adventures were so heartfelt and touching! I really hope the author of this book decides to continue the adventures of Winn-Dixie and India Opal, because i would hope the adventures would never end.	wonderful

Way too popular an item Ok now I have bought 3 of these things. The first I bought at a store and my Mom has yet to return it. The other didn't make it home from a party. For heat resist to 500 F it is amazingly flexible. Bowl lickers will hate it as it will get it all. Blueberries and raspberries haven't stained it. Better than a regular scraper as it 'spoons' out batter perfectly for cupcakes and toppings for cherry cheesecakes.	wonderful

Great Detector for the price. This detector is being closed out, and can be had really cheap. For the price it can't be beat. It's an average detector as far as radar detectors go. There are some that are smaller and perform better. There are also much worse. It works well, and the prcie is less than $50 now. What else can you ask for. It also has an electronic compass that works well if you mount it correctly and follow the instructions to calibrate it.	wonderful
Small but mighty radiant heater I actually bought two of these little heaters last year. One for myself and one for my daughter who lives next door. I wanted a quiet, small and efficient heater. I read the reviews, which were what convinced me. It has proven to be what I wanted, so I bought two more this year for us.	wonderful

Dope,Dope,Dope This cd is dope, phat, fresh, ridiculous, exceptional, spectacular and any other adjective that expresses satisfaction. This is a completely original piece of work and no one will be able to duplicate it ever. Slick Rick is the original storyteller and he tells 'em the best. He makes you feel like your going through what he's saying on record. He's the Richard Pryor of hip-hop. Very talented and even though his other cd's haven't lived up to this one he changed the game with this one alone. If your a true hip-hop head you must have this cd.	wonderful
