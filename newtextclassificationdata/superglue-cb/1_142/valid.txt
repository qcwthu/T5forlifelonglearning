A: Right. And I think even in the elections, they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not, and basically you know, if a candidate can get them to follow, then the news will, you know, kind of publicize his name.

I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last, uh, several years.

Right. B: you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too. A: Yeah.

Uh, because I think it's something that's going to take them a while to come up with a, uh, vaccine for. A: Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. B: I don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with [SEP] hypothesis: it is going to be that easy to come up with	contradiction
