premise: During passive transport , molecules move naturally through a semi-permeable membrane from a high concentration area to a low concentration area. [SEP] hypothesis: Passive transport requires no energy and occurs when substances move from areas of higher to lower concentration.	entailment
premise: Both Bornean and Sumatran orangutans generally live alone in the wild, but Bornean orangutans tend to be more solitary than do their Sumatran counterparts. [SEP] hypothesis: A(n) orangutan generally lives alone.	entailment
premise: The sun dwarfs the other bodies in the solar system, representing approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system. [SEP] hypothesis: The largest body in our solar system is the sun.	entailment
premise: food is the main reason why birds fly down south during the winter. [SEP] hypothesis: Many species of birds in new england fly south for the winter months to find an environment with more food.	entailment
premise: Water below the ground's surface is called groundwater. [SEP] hypothesis: When the ground absorbs the water and it settles below the surface it is called groundwater.	entailment
premise: Learned behavior patterns enable animals to adjust to changes in their environment. [SEP] hypothesis: Learned behavior is adaptive because they are flexible, capable of changing if the environment changes.	entailment
premise: Cells are living systems, and so are the various tissues and organs of the body, the human brain being the most complex example. [SEP] hypothesis: The brain is the most complex organ in the human body.	entailment
premise: The poster board is opaque (doesn't allow light to pass through). [SEP] hypothesis: Opaque is the term for matter that does not let any light pass through.	entailment
premise: Thermoregulation is a survival trick that helps humans to maintain a constant body temperature. [SEP] hypothesis: Thermoregulation is the process when animals maintain an internal temperature.	entailment
premise: This creates a bulge called a groin hernia. [SEP] hypothesis: A wall of rocks or concrete a called a groin.	neutral
premise: Oxygen decreases, carbon dioxide increases, the blood becomes more acidic, the heart rate drops and blood vessels in the lung constrict,&quot; says Umlauf. [SEP] hypothesis: Blood flow decrease when blood vessels constrict.	neutral
premise: Gap junctions are clusters of transmembrane channels that connect the cytoplasms of adjacent cells. [SEP] hypothesis: Plasmodesmata connect to cytoplasms in the plant cell.	neutral
premise: Basic kinds of learning, studied with rats, that have applications to human behavior. [SEP] hypothesis: Learned behavior occurs only after experience or practice and describes most human behaviors.	neutral
premise: We will study the liquid and solid states of matter, phase transitions, solutions, electrochemistry, coordination complexes, spectroscopy and the principles of thermodynamics that explain observed chemical reactions. [SEP] hypothesis: Electrochemistry is the study of the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions.	neutral
premise: As a group, Pfiesteria -like dinoflagellates are non-photosynthetic (heterotrophic) and require suspended microalgae (phytoplankton) prey as a primary food source. [SEP] hypothesis: Because all animals require an external source of food, they are called heterotrophic.	neutral
premise: While it seems paradoxical, exercising a chronically tired but healthy body supplies energy. [SEP] hypothesis: A healthy diet is important because it supplies the bodyâ€™s needs for growth and energy.	neutral
premise: The higher the thermal inertia the more it takes to change the temperature of the mass. [SEP] hypothesis: The term thermal expansion is used to describe the change in size or volume of a given mass with temperature.	neutral
premise: The term does not include acquired immune deficiency syndrome or the human immunodeficiency virus. [SEP] hypothesis: The term immunodeficiency means a failure, insufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited.	neutral
premise: prokaryotic cell A cell having no nuclear membrane and hence no separate nucleus . [SEP] hypothesis: Prokaryotic cells have a cell wall outside their plasma membrane.	neutral
premise: The science of this process is called acoustics. [SEP] hypothesis: The process for developing knowledge is called science.	neutral
premise: CO2 lasers and YAG's produce very different wavelengths and beam shapes. [SEP] hypothesis: You call a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just one wavelength and color a laser.	neutral
premise: In naming compounds with cations of variable charges, the charge of the cation must be deduced from the charge of the anions. [SEP] hypothesis: In naming ternary compounds, the cation is stated first.	neutral
premise: Before the discovery by Woese and Fox, scientists thought that Archaea were extreme organisms that evolved from the organisms more familiar to us. [SEP] hypothesis: Carl woese constructed a tree diagram, separating living organisms into three domains.	neutral
premise: Xenon is an &quot;inert&quot; element, which means it doesn't combine with other elements easily (if at all). [SEP] hypothesis: Reactive elements are able to combine more easily with other elements.	neutral
