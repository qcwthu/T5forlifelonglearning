premise: Then, if carbon dioxide is formed of one atom of carbon and two atoms of oxygen, the proportion must naturally consist of 3 parts of carbon to 8 of oxygen. [SEP] hypothesis: Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms.	entailment
premise: The amount of air that snow contains affects its volume (the amount of space it takes up). [SEP] hypothesis: The term volume means the amount of space matter takes up.	entailment
premise: 1 Â The gastrointestinal tract is a 30-foot tube running from your mouth to your anus. [SEP] hypothesis: The term gastrointestinal tract describes the long tube that connects the mouth to the anus.	entailment
premise: As the level of Blood cholesterol increases, so does the possibility of plugging the arteries due to cholesterol plaque build-up. [SEP] hypothesis: An increase in the body's cholesterol levels can lead to your arteries filling with plaque.	entailment
premise: These chemicals can cause metabolic acidosis (formic acid is the same poison found in the stinging chemical of fire ants ). [SEP] hypothesis: Formic acid is found in the secretions of stinging ants.	entailment
premise: Humans have 46 chromosomes that are organized into 23 pairs. [SEP] hypothesis: Humans have 23 pairs pairs of chromosomes.	entailment
premise: Gas is a form of matter that does not have a definite volume or shape. [SEP] hypothesis: The gas form of matter has neither a definite shape nor a definite volume.	entailment
premise: If the displacement and the wave move at right angles to each other, the wave is transverse. [SEP] hypothesis: Because the fields that make up an electromagnetic wave are at right angles to each other and to the direction that the wave travels, an electromagnetic wave is considered a(n) transverse wave.	entailment
premise: The density of that very dense matter was originally so high that it was then opaque and light could not pass through it. [SEP] hypothesis: Opaque is the term for matter that does not let any light pass through.	entailment
premise: Then we invoked each of the four elements necessary for the plants' growth. [SEP] hypothesis: Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements necessary for plant growth.	neutral
premise: All natural carbon occurs in three isotopes...carbon-12 and -13, non-radioactive, and carbon-14, a radioactive isotope. [SEP] hypothesis: Carbon 14 isotope of carbon is typically used to date ancient items.	neutral
premise: As the brain deteriorates, so does its ability to control body parts and functions. [SEP] hypothesis: Not surprisingly, controlling flight is the function of the most developed part of a bird's brain.	neutral
premise: As recent experiences with human heart transplants have shown, this organ can function perfectly without the help of the nervous system. [SEP] hypothesis: In humans, the heart is the first organ to form and become functional.	neutral
premise: summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. [SEP] hypothesis: The tilt of earth on its axis causes summer to be warmer than winter in the northern hemisphere because the rays of the sun strike the northern hemisphere more directly in the summer.	neutral
premise: This can kill cells, cause tumors, and cancers, and mutations in genes. [SEP] hypothesis: Mutations in regulatory genes that normally control the cell cycle cause cancer.	neutral
premise: Size Cell walls Cytoplasmic membrane Nucleus and other organelles Nucleic acids Reproduction Environmental niches Describe the principle structures in a prokaryotic cell. [SEP] hypothesis: Prokaryotic cells have a cell wall outside their plasma membrane.	neutral
premise: The most biologically important types are ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds. [SEP] hypothesis: Hydrogen chloride is a covalent compound.	neutral
premise: And Ridge - [SEP] hypothesis: Iceland sits on the mid-atlantic ridge.	neutral
premise: The Nucleus and Nuclear Energy CH18. [SEP] hypothesis: In the nuclear fusion process, two light nuclei combine to produce a heavier nucleus and great energy.	neutral
premise: This process is known as exocytosis . [SEP] hypothesis: The cell expels waste and other particles through a process called exocytosis.	neutral
premise: Rocks of the earth's crust and the landscapes they produce. [SEP] hypothesis: The earth's crust is composed of igneuos rock.	neutral
premise: Tumor relapse in the prostate was classified as noninvasive (prostatic urethra and ducts) or invasive (stroma) with intraurethral or direct prostatic invasion. [SEP] hypothesis: The prostate gland secretes its products directly into the urethra through several small ducts	neutral
premise: Learn how to tell the invasive exotics from other species. [SEP] hypothesis: Exotic species are also called invasive species because they threaten other species.	neutral
premise: Output at fixed input increases with increasing filling gas pressure and decreasing cooling gas temperature. [SEP] hypothesis: When gas particles heat up, pressure increase.	neutral
premise: If there is little air movement, the ozone forming compounds buildup and more ozone can be formed. [SEP] hypothesis: Ozone is a compound formed when there is sparking electrical equipment.	neutral
