premise: The ribosome (composed of both rRNA and protein) has two subunits and the transcribed mRNA fits between the two subunits. [SEP] hypothesis: A ribosome consists of two elements, rrna and proteins.	entailment
premise: Each human cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. [SEP] hypothesis: Humans typically have 23 pairs pairs of chromosomes.	entailment
premise: Kinetic Energy Energy of motion is called kinetic energy. [SEP] hypothesis: Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.	entailment
premise: Normal human cells have 46 chromosomes, including either two X (female) chromosomes or an X and a Y (male). [SEP] hypothesis: Other than gametes, normal human cells have a total of 46 chromosomes per cell.	entailment
premise: We have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs of chromosomes. [SEP] hypothesis: Humans typically have 23 pairs pairs of chromosomes.	entailment
premise: Voltage is a measure of electric potential energy that makes electric charges flow through a circuit. [SEP] hypothesis: We use voltage to keep track of electric potential energy.	entailment
premise: Snakes use their tongues to smell. [SEP] hypothesis: Snakes use their tongue to smell things.	entailment
premise: Snakes smell scents in the air using their forked  tongue (see Figure 19.22). [SEP] hypothesis: Snakes use their tongue to smell things.	entailment
premise: Electric motor An electric motor , is a machine which converts electrical energy into mechanical (rotational or kinetic) energy. [SEP] hypothesis: Electric motors transform electrical energy into kinetic energy.	entailment
premise: That is, if two different animals have similar bone structures, then they must have evolved from the same original ancestors. [SEP] hypothesis: The conclusion that two animal species evolved from a common ancestor in recent geological history is best supported by the observation that the species have similar bone structure.	entailment
premise: Smoking reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen and increases the heart rate and basal metabolic rate, thus counteracting the benefits of physical activity, including cardiovascular fitness. [SEP] hypothesis: Smoking tobaccowould  most likely have a negative impact on the ability of an individual to succeed at physical activities because it it decreases stamina and cardiovascular efficiency.	entailment
premise: The organisms that live in and on the ocean floor are called benthos . [SEP] hypothesis: Living things on the ocean floor are known as benthos.	entailment
premise: When a snake flicks its tongue, it is smelling the air. [SEP] hypothesis: Snakes use their tongue to smell things.	entailment
premise: Benthos' are the organisms (usually invertebrates) that live on, in, or near the bottom of water bodies (i.e., stream, lake, pond, wetland, or ocean). [SEP] hypothesis: Living things on the ocean floor are known as benthos.	entailment
premise: When referring to the energy content of food, the actual calories are kilocalories (1000 calories) and should be written with a capital &quot;C&quot;. [SEP] hypothesis: The energy content of foods is often expressed in calories.	entailment
premise: Urea forms chiefly in the liver, and is eliminated mostly in the urine. [SEP] hypothesis: Urea is made in the liver and excreted in urine.	entailment
premise: wavelength The distance between adjacent peaks (or adjacent troughs) on a wave . [SEP] hypothesis: Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points of adjacent waves called.	entailment
premise: Homogeneous Mixture (same category as a Solution) A system of two or more substances (elements or compounds) that are interspersed like the gases making up the air. [SEP] hypothesis: Solution is the term for a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.	entailment
premise: In general, a lunar eclipse takes place when the Moon falls -- either partially or entirely -- into the Earth's shadow. [SEP] hypothesis: When earth’s shadow falls on the moon, the shadow causes a lunar eclipse.	entailment
premise: Scientists have forecast global temperatures warming by up to four degrees centigrade over the next century, melting polar ice caps, raising sea levels, flooding low lying islands and threatening thousands of species with extinction. [SEP] hypothesis: Global warming will eliminate some islands and reduce the area of others because it will raise sea levels.	entailment
premise: wavelength The distance between adjacent peaks in a series of periodic waves. [SEP] hypothesis: Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points of adjacent waves called.	entailment
premise: The answer is upwelling -- a movement of deep, nutrient rich water to the surface. [SEP] hypothesis: Upwelling is the term for when deep ocean water rises to the surface.	entailment
premise: The spleen acts as a filter against foreign organisms that infect the bloodstream, and also filters out old red blood cells from the bloodstream and decomposes them. [SEP] hypothesis: The main function of the spleen is to filter the blood and remove unwanted red blood cells.	entailment
premise: Wind is the movement of air parallel to the Earth's surface. [SEP] hypothesis: You call air flowing over earth’s surface wind.	entailment
premise: Voltage is the amount of stored electrical energy (potential) provided by an energy source and its units are given in Volts. [SEP] hypothesis: We use voltage to keep track of electric potential energy.	entailment
