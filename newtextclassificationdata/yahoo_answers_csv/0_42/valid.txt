L'angleterre va t elle gagner la coupe du monde?  Je crois qu'il faut se faire à l'idée qu'il est manifestement 10 fois plus difficile de gagner une Coupe du Monde quand vous êtes l'Angleterre que quand vous êtes un autre pays. \n\nIls ont inventé le football (et ne manquent pas de le rappeler), vivent pour et par le football. La pression des medias sur l'équipe nationale est énorme, en témoignent les récentes affaires qui ont eu la tête de Sven Goran Eriksonn. \n\nLors de l'Euro 2004, l'Angleterre alignait probablement le meilleur milieu de terrain au Monde (un losange Gerrard-Lampard-Beckham-Scholes qui aurait fait rêver n'importe quel entraîneur) avec de belles pointes devant, ils n'ont pourtant pas réussi à passer les 1/4 de finale. \n\nTout ceci pour dire que, comme d'habitude, je vois bien l'Angleterre prometteuse par moments, irrésistibles à d'autres, et perdante à la fin !	sports

I am wondering where to go or who to talk to about selling an autographed 49ers football.? it is signed by the Superbowl winning team of the early 90's (I can'r remember what year) but is signed by the whole team, including Steve Young and Jerry Rice. My husband has been the only owner, it came from an employee of the team. First off, GET THE YEAR EXACTLY IN YOUR HEAD.  Otherwise, when you talk to someone, you'll look like you don't know what you have for sale.\n\nSecond, find an auction house, preferably one that specializes in sports paraphenalia, and see what they would start it for at auction.

Taekwon Do & Kickboxing? At the moment i am doing TKD,im on my yellow tag, me and a friend (that doesnt go TKD) are thinking of joining the nearest kickboxing class, i would like to know if joining kickboxing as well as TKD would confuse my work in TKD.\nIf anybody has any info on what kickboxing does please post that too. thanks you probably would confuse the two. they are pretty different: fighting stance and technique\n\ntaekwondo- you kick with your foot and its normally a more snapping motion, kicks are more flashy require more flexibity and uses a good number of high kicks, different stances such as attention, ready, horse, forward, back etc..., have a lot of point sparring with pads\n\n\nkickboxing(thai)-you kick with your shin and its more of a twisting motion with your whole body, kicks are simpler, stance is in typical western boxing stance i guess you can count two traditional and southpaw, more full contact sparring\n\nby the way i dont necessarily think one is better than the other i personally enjoy kickboxing more; however any art can be very effictive \n\nmost people would say take kickboxing becuase it would be easier to learn and less flashy therefore easier to use in a fight, but a good number of moves in taekwondo you can pull off too\n\nso take the kickboxing class and see which one you like more and stick with that one and maybe later go back to the other one if you want.\n\noh by the way if you are into titles(which really dont mean much in a real fight) kickboxing doesnt have belts so after so many years you cant say im a black belt in kickboxing but you could in taekwondo	sports

why is it when I'm ill; i end up with loads of wax in my ears.?  just gone through the same thing. It  when your ill ie; a cold then its not  ear wax its a build up of Flem(snot) in your ear then the ear has to produce more ear wax to stop the Flem  from entering the ear where it may cause damage to the ear drum. That is the function of ear wax to stop dirt and dust etc from entering the ear canals. Blow your nose until you feel the pressure in your ears this will help relieve the blocked up feeling for a bit, also putting you head over  a bowl of hot water with a towel over you will help.	health

Is there a chance I have one too?

Im not obese nor skinny- Im about 6'0'' 185-190.  Thanks!!!!!! Usually when people 'binge eat', they go to the bathroom and vomit the food so that they do not gain weight.  It is not a nice thing.  Perhaps that's why she is 'noticeably underweight' as you say.\n\nYou do not appear to be the same since you simply seem to have a healthy appetite or you love to eat, and plenty, too.  But your weight is normal for your height, and you don't mention any ailments or abnormalities.\n\nYou did not say if she had just one meal per day, only that she ate late at night, so it is a little difficult to determine anything further.\n\nShe does need help. though, and support.	health

I've read the speed of sound is 330 and 340m/s, but which one is right?  The speed of sound varies depending on the material it is travelling through, the pressure, altitude and temperature.\n\nOn the assumption you're talking about air and that you're at sea level under normal atmospheric conditions then 340m/s would be the speed at 14 degrees C and 330m/s would be the speed at minus 1 degree C - so they're both right.	science

what are some equations for a quantrum? does anybody know something about transforming matter from one place to another? You mean quantum teleportation? I can point you to some layman's sites explaining how it works. . . Keep in mind, you are only teleporting the state of the "matter" (the experiments I am aware of only move photon states, though in principle you could apply them to electrons and protons), not the energy itself. Also, entangling macroscopic quantities of matter with some stream that could teleport its state (making a copy at the other end) is currently an intractable engineering problem.	science

Why is there an air buble in the injection Lovenox?  More to the point, to allow complete injection of the drug- When giving injections intraperatoneally or intramuscularly(in the gut or butt) we take a tiny bit of air into the syringe so that there isnt any drug left over-to make sure you have your full dose.  This isnt done in IV injection because of the (low) risk of air embolism blocking a vessel.\nBut, the first answerer was correct as well, and they got here first...	science

why is the sky blue?  The first steps towards correctly explaining the colour of the sky were taken by John Tyndall in 1859.  He discovered that when light passes through a clear fluid holding small particles in suspension, the shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more strongly than the red.  This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses.\n\nThis is most correctly called the Tyndall effect, but it is more commonly known to physicists as Rayleigh scattering--after Lord Rayleigh, who studied it in more detail a few years later.  He showed that the amount of light scattered is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength for sufficiently small particles.  It follows that blue light is scattered more than red light by a factor of (700/400)4 ~= 10.	science
Can someone explain to me the last few minutes of lost on the season finale(2nd season)?I didnt really get it? LOST What we found out tonight was that this entire show, from the beginning up through tonight, has been about one person.....DESMOND\n\nPenny's billionaire father is bank-rolling this Dharma Project. It has something to do with the giant magnet under the island. Penny knew about this experiment, but never knew which island.\n\nShe knew that Desmond was going to be in her father's "Around the World" boat race. She knew that the magnet would draw Desmond's boat to this particular island. Her father knew this also, since he was still seeking revenge on Desmond for never taking the bribe to stay away from Penny.\n\nPenny has had her team of scientists searching the planet for this magnetic anomoly. When Desmond turned the "fail safe" key, it started the electro-magnetic pulse which were picked up by Penny's scientists in the Artic. Now Penny knows where the island is, and will start looking for Desmond.\n\nThis whole show has been about the lost love between Penny and Desmond, and the revenge that Desmond and Penny's father seek upon each other....who knew??..:-)	entertainment and Music

how do you write a proposal for a television show? I need to learn how to write a proposal for a new television show and pitch it.  Any pointers, suggestions, or examples would be nice. Hey there.  I've been down this road before, and think I can help.  Let me start by saying that if this is for class, that's one thing.  If you plan to pitch to a network, it may seem blunt, but don't bother until you've worked on some shows and have enough credits that anyone at the network level will actually let you in a room.\n\nAlso... hear me, now... nobody buys the "idea" for a show.  You'd be surprised how many people think that their "idea" is worth something.  An idea is worth nothing until it's executed in a way that can be sold to and understood by the industry.\n\nIf you're planning to pitch a scripted series, you'll need a pilot script (full first episode script), a well-rehearsed two to five minute verbal presentation of your ideas, and a basic two or three season arc mapped out.  The network development folks will want to know that the idea is sustainable for multiple seasons.\n\nIn the reality genre, you'll need that two to five minute verbal presentation, but will also probably want to be able to share how long it'll take to shoot the series, what kind of budget you're talking about, and so on.\n\nIn either case, a newer writer will need to pair up with a showrunner in most cases in order to be taken seriously.  A showrunner is someone who's been in charge of a few shows in a supervisory capacity.  In my case, I was paired with a showrunner by my agency, who also represented the showrunner.  When we started going to networks, she had the clout that made the development execs think "well, if she's attached, it must be worth a listen."\n\nI don't want you to think I'm being a jerk about not taking an original series to network until you're more seasoned.  It's really just they way things work.  Nothing here just comes over the transom, and those walls are in place for a reason.\n\nDoom and gloom aside, please be sure to learn proper format when creating a spec script for television.  Final Draft software(www.finaldraft.com) can be a big help, but I'd suggest you just go to www.script-o-rama.com and download a few tv scripts so you can see what they really look like.  There is no straying from format --- it separates the writers from the hacks immediately.	entertainment and Music
