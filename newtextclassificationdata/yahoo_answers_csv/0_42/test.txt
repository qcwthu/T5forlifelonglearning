If God exist do UFO's also exist? Does God manage more than one property? Explain why or why not. Over the centuries in many cultures there have often been sightings, drawings and abductions. What do you think? Is there a connection? If God is a construct of how mankind views a supreme existence, and UFO's are a construct of how we percieve the existence of life outside the boundaries of the known realm which we know life exists; then why wouldn't they both exist simultaneously.\n  You're correct that there have been many depictions in a variety of cultures throughout man's recorded presence upon Earth, but what man calls God, has also had a multitude of names and faces.\n\n If God exists, and he created mankind, and mankind has created the machines which we use daily to travel across our planet, to the moon, and beyond. It seems to be that  other beings which God, or perhaps another God that 'manages other property' would also create machines which would accomplish similar tasks.\n\nMaybe the Universe itself is God, and we are just a singular cell of a mighty living organism.	science
What is therapeutic cloning? how does it work?  Therapeutic cloning (also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell nuclear replacement, research cloning, and embryo cloning) involves taking an egg (or oocyte) from which the nucleus has been removed, and replacing that nucleus with DNA from the cell of another organism. The result is a blastocyst (an early stage embryo with about 100 cells) with almost identical DNA to the original organism.\n\nThe procedure is controversial, and this is reflected in the language used to describe the blastocyst created. Some people believe it should not be called a blastocyst or embryo, since it has not been created by fertilisation, but others maintain that since, given the right conditions, it could still grow into a fetus and eventually a child, it doesn't seem misleading to call it an embryo.\nThe aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain stem cells that are genetically matched to the donor organism. For example, if a person with Parkinson's disease donated their DNA, then it should be theoretically possible to generate embryonic stem cells that could be used to treat their condition without being rejected by the patient's immune system.	science
Do muscle cells utilize energy  (ATP) on relaxation? According to sliding filament theory, ATP is used for contraction, but whatabout relaxation? When cardiac muscles forcefully relax, do they utilize more energy or ATP? I would like to throw in my two cents to this question. First, in order for actin and myosin to attract, calcium is required. Where does it come from? Well to start a muscle contraction, the neurotransmitter ach must be present at the myoneural junction. Now an action potential will travel down the t-tubules and open gates that allows calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum . The calcium stored there simply diffuses down its own concentration gradient. Now for the muscle to relax the calcium must be re-stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, now it is against its concentration gradient, and it takes ATP energy to put it back. So to answer your question it takes ATP energy to cause muscle contraction and it takes ATP energy to cause muscles to relax. In fact as ATP stores deplete, it takes muscles a longer period of time to relax. I have actually measured this.	science

What Polish Astronomer said the sun was the center of the universe?  Nicolaus Copernicus (February 19, 1473 – May 24, 1543) was an astronomer who provided the first modern formulation of a heliocentric (sun-centered) theory of the solar system in his epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres). Copernicus was born in 1473 in the city of Toruń (Thorn), in Royal Prussia, an autonomous province of the Kingdom of Poland. He was educated in Poland and Italy, and spent most of his working life in Frombork (Frauenburg), Warmia, where he died in 1543.	science

An excess of sodium hydroxide is treated with 1.1 L of dry hydrogen chloride gas measured at STP. What is the? An excess of sodium hydroxide is treated with 1.1 L of dry hydrogen chloride gas measured at STP. What is the mass of sodium chloride formed? One mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters  at STP.  We can safely assume that HCl gas under STP conditions behaves pretty much like an idea gas, so 1.1 liter of HCl gas contains 1.1/22.4 moles of HCl.\n\nEach mole of HCl that reacts with NaOH produces one mole of NaCl.  Because we are told that the NaOH is in excess, the amount of NaCl formed will be equal to the amount of HCl gas.  In other words, 1.1/22.4 moles of NaCl will be formed.\n\nThe molecular mass of NaCl is 58.44 grams/mole, so the mass of NaCl formed will be:\n\n58.44 gm/mol * 1.1/22.4 mol = 2.87 grams.	science
what is the composition of solar wind? does it have any effect on the Earth's magnetic field? The solar wind is a continuous stream of ions (electrically charged particles) that are given off by the sun. Since the particles are emitted from the Sun as the Sun rotates, the solar wind blows in a pinwheel pattern through the solar system. It takes the solar wind about 5 days to reach Earth; it has a velocity of about 500 miles/hour (800 km/sec). The solar wind travels along vibrating magnetic waves which are propagated by the Sun	science

Why can the Insulating Jugs can keep hot water warm?? Science All materials have a heat transfer coefficient.  materials used for insulating have a much lower coefficient so the overall heat that gets transferred from one point to another over a given time is much less.  Given enough time the water would be the same temperature as everything else in the system if no other heat sources are introduced.  Insulators just slow down the process by making it harder for the heat to escape.	science

What is the exact cause of a stitch? (The sort you get when you're running, walking, doing lots of exercise, etc.) A side stitch is a piercing sensation just below the ribcage, usually felt when you're running. In the past, several different theories tried to explain the cause: trapped gas, swollen liver, stomach muscle cramps. However a recent and fairly conclusive theory holds that strain on the ligaments connecting the liver to the diaphragm is the cause. \nThe liver "hangs" from the diaphragm by fibrous bands called ligaments. Running exerts a steady downward force on your liver, stretching these ligaments. In addition, when you exhale (usually as your left foot hits the ground), your diaphragm is pushed up. That means your liver falls with gravity as your diaphragm rises, placing considerable strain on those poor ligaments. \n\nThe result? A stitch. The cure? Stop running immediately and press your hand just below the pain. This should raise your liver up, relieving the strain on the ligaments. Inhale and exhale evenly as you press down. \n\nAs a preventive measure, take deep, full breaths while running. If you take shallow breaths, your diaphragm is consistently raised, which wreaks havoc on your ligaments. Exercise is great, but remember to be kind to the rubber bands keeping your organs in place.	science

Why are people so susceptible to concepts like religion? Humans worship their fathers' fathers' fathers' Gods. Why does no one attempt to question the origin of their faith? People are susceptible because people are afraid. Just like everything else in life, they are afraid of their bodies, their minds, their thoughts. When we grow up and realize that we don't have an infinite amount of time of this planet, people turn to what they have been taught. That there is a better life after death but you have to follow a path to get there. Therefore religion steps in and tries to turn your fear of death to faith instead giving hope. However, no one really knows what happens after we die so its a crap shoot.	science
Is 5/16 less than or greater than 0.313?  5/16 equals 0.3125.  It's less than 0.313 unless .313 is a rounded off number.  It's considered acceptable to round off a decimal in this fashion.\n\nWhen to Round Up\nRounding up means that we increase the terminating digit by a value of 1 and drop off the digits to the right. If the next place beyond where we are terminating the decimal is greater than or equal to five, we round up. For example, if we round 5.47 to the tenths place, it can be can be rounded up to 5.5.\n\nWhen to Round Down\nIf the number to the right of our terminating decimal place is four or less (4, 3, 2, 1, 0), we round down. This is done by leaving our last decimal place as it is given and discarding all digits to its right. For example, if we round 6.734 to the hundredths place, it can be rounded down to 6.73.	science

Question regarding hyperbolas? What is the vertices, asymptotes and foci of this hyperbola? \n36x^2-4y^2=4??\n\nPlease show me the step to reach the answer!\n\nPoints will be awarded ASAP!!!! first you have to put the hyperbola in standard form. Divide everything by 4.\n\n9x^2 - y^2 = 1\nWhich is the same as\n(x^2)/(1/9) - (y^2)/1 = 1\nHere, a^2 = 1/9, so a = 1/3,\nand b^2 = 1, so b = 1\n\nIn this case, the center is (0,0)\nSince the "x" term is first, then it opens left and right. The vertices will be left and right from the center by "a" units, so the vertices are (1/3, 0) and (-1/3, 0).\n\nThe foci are left and right of the center by "c" units. In a hyperbola, a^2 + b^2 = c^2, so c^2 = (1/3)^2 + (1^2) = 1/9 + 1 = 10/9. c = root(10)/3. The foci will be (root10/3, 0) and (-root10/3, 0).\n\nThe asymptotes have slopes that are +b/a and -b/a, and pass through the center, in this case, (0,0). So these slopes are +1/(1/3) and -1/(1/3) or 3 and -3, and the equations are y = 3x and y = -3x.	science

need info on the trilobite? helpppppppppppppppp mongst the earliest of all known arthropods are the trilobites.  The first species of trilobite are found in rocks of Lower Cambrian age, above the non-trilobite 'Tommotian' Cambrian fauna.  The last known species to have existed are found in the Late Permian.  Throughout their 350 million years of existence in the ancient seas the overall morphology of the earliest and latest trilobites did not vary greatly, however their individual characteristics had many variations and it is these changes that can be studied and used to determine age ( Levi-Setti, 1975).  However it must be remembered that no individual feature is a sufficient guide for classification on its own, it is only with a collection of characteristics that a reliable classification can be made.\n\n Well over 1500 genera are known (Clarkson, 1994) and there are several thousand species, many of which have a stratigraphic value, especially those found within Cambrian and Ordovician rocks.  It is the fact that trilobites are found world wide which makes some of them serve as excellent index fossils, and it is their short life periods which allows precise dates and correlations to be made about the rocks in which they are found.\n\n  Most trilobites were sea floor dwellers, living in the soft sediments, while others were free swimming.  They appear to have been exclusively marine organisms since the fossilized remains of trilobites are always found in rock containing fossils of other salt-water animals, e.g. brachiopods, crinoids and corals.	science

What is meant by Vertical Takeoff and Landing in aircrafts?.?  It is an aircraft with modified swivel wings that does not require the aircraft to have a long runway for take off. Instead it raises the turbine wings and rises in a vertical manner from where it was parked, when aloft the wings will readjust to an angle and thus the aircraft will be flown in a forward motion. It is usually used by the military for operations in areas withour adequate landing space.	science
I had a seizure and the doctors dont know why...any ideas? Yesterday morning about 5-10 minutes after i woke up, all of a sudden i became extremely dizzy and i blacked out. The moment i hit the floor i went into a hypofusional seizure that lasted about 15-30 seconds. When i gained back conciousness after seizing for about 15 seconds, i was still in the seizure, yet very calm and immidiately aware of what was happening.  I have never had a seizure before and I'm only 13 years old, and when i was taken to the hospital, i was put through a catscan and the doctors didnt find anything abnormal.  I have just started taking Cingulair 5mg pills once every night about 3 weeks ago for my asthma, and i dont know if that could have anything to do with the sudden drop of blood pressure.  My father took my blood pressure less than 3 minutes after my seizure and it was 76/36. The normal blood pressure is about 120/60.  I wasn't dehydrated and my blood sugar was normal and I am not a diabetic.  Any ideas why my blood pressure dropped so low suddenly? have they checked all your electrolytes?  perhaps just a vasovagal response?	science

Why is the nature of science? ......That we replace old beliefs with new beliefs based on incoming evidence and facts? science is the mechanism which we use to purify generalizations.   the action of science is exactly the replacement of old beliefs with new ones based on incoming evidence, and human determination, and decision, about what is "fact".\n but this is only the hard machinery of science, the method, the facilitation of the nature, and the vehicle of the essence of science. i am no prophet, and do not intend to subjectively interpret the universe in the manner of pronouncing some concrete, end-all, answer, so in the spirit of science, let us consider science, make some observations, and stab at some generalizations.\n    while observing science, we humans have come to one of the most startlingly obvious, and startlingly powerful, realizations; that of the principle of natural selection. this principle classically refers to biological evolution, and the ever-present consequences which acts on living things and environments when they interact.\nthe principle more recently has embodied a somewhat more anthropocentric form. richad dawkins [1] was one of the early and explicit proponents of visualizing the effort of natural selection as the "selfishness" of genes, and that the driving force of the principle was the expressed selfishness of genes trying to do nothing but replicate themselves, and propagate into the future. the longer that they survive, the more likely it is that they will replicate.  this embodies the cut throat behaviors in nature, as well as the collectivity and cooperativity. this is all very well, and nice, and has been very well recieved in the world of biology  (but not because we are biochauvinists, overly able to relate to something once it is reminicent of human face, but because, the muse of science it the same as the muse of poetry, and imagery enhances scince on a grand scale, so that a better analogies will lead to easier, and better visualization, which will lead to easier and better work). this notion is just precursor to what this question has lead us to. in his book, richard dawkins goes further to introduce the notion of "memes" (mee' ms), which are intended to be the analogue of genes, only in the mental realm. they are ideas, tricks, songs, poems, sloagans... truly, anything which can be abstracted, realized, and passed from one mind to another. so that the idea of memes is a meme itself, and it replicated itself from the mind of an author, to my mind, via language, and if  you have not heard of this already, then it has replicated itself again into your mind. very much like genes, memes continue to exist only through replication, and they may mutate as they pass through different minds. yet, unlike genes, a meme can be very sucessful in replication, and yet be very destructive to its host. take for instance, heroin use. it is a learned trick, which has some concrete subjective effect, and yet ultimately has a negative effect on the life of the host, the replication of their genes. for the most part, memes have no regard for genes. this is dangerous for a society which is driven by memes.\n science seems to be the principle of natural selection, but not gene selection in the way of darwin, but a sifting sort of meme selection, acting on a very small class of memes, serving to develop them into the most powerful and planet altering memes that humans have ever seen. because of the power of these things, the careful selection of the memes of scientific principles is very important. the memes which are selected by science are the human interpretations of the principle(s) of the universe. certainly, natural selection existed before it generated the human mind. it was simply left to science to put it into worded interpretation. this did not take very long. not only that, but more than one person came upon the idea, independent of each other. how universal is the action of science then? \n   in a sense, science is a special case of the principle of natural selection, if you g	science
do anti-biotics become less effective if you have taken them before? do you get immune to them? What happens is that bacteria, which the antibiotics attack, become immune to the antibiotics. Over-prescribing anti-biotics is bad because it causes bacteria to develop resistance. This is why in the past very small quantities of penicillin-type drugs were necessary to treat a bacterial infection, whereas the dosages are now 100s of times greater. This is also why scientists are always struggling to keep up with bacteria which obtain resistance quickly.\n\nThe best strategy is to use antibiotics only when you are sure you need them. If you have a viral illness such as the flu, antibiotics are useless. Also, if you take way too many antibiotics, you risk fungal infections. The reason is because fungi and bacteria are always in competition, and when you eliminate one, the other starts to grow out of hand. Some people have had urinary tract infections from fungi because they took too many antibiotics.  Not a pretty sight. \n\nJust take antibiotics when you have a bacterial infection. If you don't know the origin of your infection (if it is bacterial or viral), your doctor may initially prescribe antibiotics until he can confirm the origin of the infection in lab work.	science

How on Earth do they insulate transmission towers? Transmission towers carry cables which, as we know, like to take a 40kV short cut to Earth if they get hit with a kite or whatever. Yet one can go up to one of these towers and touch it quite safely... That's because there are ceramic insulators that hold the wires/cables to the tower.  You will notice something that has a jagged-looking profile between the metal of the tower and the wire, that is the insulator.  Insulators are up to several feet in length, depending on the designed voltage potential in the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer the insulator.\n\nHigh voltage transmission lines, the types you commonly see on metal towers are usually in the range of 115kV (kilovolts) to 320kV.  In air, it takes roughly 5000 volts per inch for an arc to develop.  At 320kV, you need an insulator over five feet long just to prevent the electricity from arcing to the tower and grounding out.   \nWith this in mind, you do not even need to touch a high voltage wire to get electrocuted, just close enough for the electricity to arc to you.	science
Is it possible to distinguish you if the characteristics by which you are distinguishable from others vary? Taken from invariantology Yes. Even though they change, they are still distinguishing.

what do you know  about gravity ?  It seems that every object has its own gravity, or attractiveness to other bodies. Scientists are still puzzled about gravity, but it seems that the larger the mass of an object, the larger the gravity. The further away from the object, the lesser the attractive force.\n\nAlso...human beings and all other animals on Earth evolved to operate effectively in the gravity on the surface of the planet. When we are in less gravity environments or greater gravity environments for extended periods, the body experiences ill effects. For example, in weightlessness, the body loses muscle mass and bone mass. We need our Earth gravity.	science
How does an oil rig stand in the water where is it anchored to?  Im sorry I've not got the sources for this but I've had experience on several rigs. For a start there are two main kinds of rigs.  \n\nFor drilling a mobile rig is usually used (cos theres no garuntee of oil!). This is usually a large floating structure which is held in place with anchors. Barges carefully transport the massive anchors about 3-4km away then they're dropped and winched in until the line is taught. Were talking 20-30 ton anchors and 4 inch thick cable. The anchors have to be in a close to perfect triangle/square as possible.\n\nThis rig will drill down, hopefully strike oil and cap the well.  \n\nThen a production rig will be moved into that place.  The most common technique these days is to have a huge hollow metal cylinder, capped at each end (i cant remember the design name, help me!) about 100-150m long 20-50m wide. This is dragged out to sea then pumped with water until it stands slightly above the surface. Its amazingly stable and can deflect strong currents.(some dynamics principals I can't remember). All the production lines are protected very well inside the cylinder. Sometimes anchorage is used but its rarely neccessary.  \n\nThe production unit/platform is then neatly plonked ontop of the cylinder. \n\nIn the olden days most offshore oil was close enough to the surface you could built a structure from the sea bed up. This almost never happens anymore.\n\nSorry I can't be more precise!	science

As for the sky...\nhttp://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blue.html\nhttp://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Why%20is%20the%20sky%20blue%3F\n\n"Contrary to popular belief the sky is not blue because of refraction.\n\nRefraction is not a significant enough effect to have this sort of affect although it can change the apparent position of the sun\n\nThe real reason why the sky is blue is due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh Scattering whereby blue light is absorbed by gaseous molecules in the atmosphere ( ie air ) and then re-emitted in a random direction. \n\nThus as white light from the sun travels through the atmosphere the blue light is scattered away from its original direction of travel, and some of it is scattered down towards us which causes us to perceive the sky as blue. \n\nThis is also the reason why the sun is yellow."	science
what are the origins of modern medicines? Beyond medicine, in what other ways do humans depend on plants?  The earliest type of medicine in most cultures was the use of plants (Herbalism) and animal parts. This was usually in concert with 'magic' of various kinds in which: animism (the notion of inanimate objects having spirits); spiritualism (here meaning an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits); shamanism (the vesting of an individual with mystic powers); and divination (the supposed obtaining of truth by magic means), played a major role.\n\nThe practice of medicine developed gradually, and separately, in ancient Egypt, India, China, Greece, Persia and elsewhere. Medicine as it is practiced now developed largely in the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century in England (William Harvey, seventeenth century), Germany (Rudolf Virchow) and France (Jean-Martin Charcot, Claude Bernard and others). The new, "scientific" medicine (where results are testable and repeatable) replaced early Western traditions of medicine, based on herbalism, the Greek "four humours" and other pre-modern theories.[citation needed] The focal points of development of clinical medicine shifted to the United Kingdom and the USA by the early 1900s (Canadian-born)Sir William Osler, Harvey Cushing). Possibly the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection in the 1400's of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general - see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). People like Vesalius led the way in improving upon or indeed rejecting the theories of great authorities from the past such as Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna/Ibn Sina, all of whose theories were in time almost totally discredited. Such new attitudes were also only made possible by the weakening of the Roman Catholic church's power in society, especially in the Republic of Venice.	science

Conditional Probability Help!!! Arg!! I can't get this!? Gateway and Micron are computer stocks that frequently move together because they represent the same sector of the economy. During a 25 day period, the value of Gateway stock went up 17 days. On 10 of these 17 days, the value of Micron stock also went up. On the 8 days when Gateway stock did not go up, Micron stock went up on 2 of these days.\n\n\nIf Micron goes up, what is the conditional probability Gateway goes up?\n\nIf Micron does not go up, what is the conditional probability Gateway will go up? The conditional probability is the likelihood of an event, given the occurrence of another event.  It is usually written,\n\np(A|B)\n\nwhich is read as "the probability of A, given B."  This conditional probability assumes B has happened.\n\nIn your problem, assuming Micron goes UP, then on 10 of 17 days, Gateway goes up.  Thus the probability of Gateway going up, given Micron going up, is 10/17.\n\nSimilarly, p(Gateway up | Micron not up) = 2/8.\n\nThe key is, you take the first event as given and go from there.	science

do yall think the chupacabra came from another planet or realm because its rarely seen that much.? the chupacabra is a  streange creature that sucks blood from animals like chickens and was sighted in mexica and the united states it has red eyes, grey skin spikes along its back. Actually, chupacabra are an unusual prosimian primate, genetically modified for a phlebotomous lifestyle by American scientists in the early sixties.  \n\nThe chupacabra was originally intended to be released into Cuba as part of a ploy to demoralize the people and topple Castro.  As most elaborate CIA plots, this one failed as the chupacabra escaped during the final testing phase in the American southwest.\n\nEssentially, the chupacabra is a sifaka, but with four razor sharp incisors with which it can slice a small wound.  Its saliva is an anti-coagulant and keeps blood flowing long enough for the chupacabra to take a meal.  Then the chupacabra bounds away quickly, back to the trees to digest its meal.  Sometimes two or more chupacabra will attack one animal.  The more of them that attack, the more likely they will go beserk with bloodlust and start shredding their prey.\n\nThe reason they are seldom seen is their ability to remain completely motionless while they are digesting their meal.  Hanging high in a tree, they resemble largish, hairy coconuts, and often go unnoticed.  Even in areas where coconuts are rare, and unhairy, few people actually look up high in the trees for the critter, and even if they see the hairy ball, they rarely connect it to the cattle mutilations.\n\nEither that or they're completely made up.  That would also explain why they're so hard to find.	science

How can you find the heat of vaporization of water according to the experimental values given? Scenario:\n\nA beaker of 300mL of water at 64 degrees Celsius is placed into a vacuum bell.  Pressure is relieved and the substance is allowed to boil.  When the bell is removed there are 284mL of water left and the temperature is 44 degrees Celsius.\n\nProblems:\nAssuming that there was no heat lost or gained through a temperature difference of the remaining air inside the bell jar during the time of boiling and that the rate of cooling and boiling was constant,\n\n1. Explain the drastic change in temperature of the water.\n2. Calculate the heat of vaporization of the water in cal/gram according to the energy change of the water that was evaporated. I don't have a calculator handy, but I'll help where I can.\n\nEvaporation is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat.  The amount of heat taken in when one mole of water evaporates is its molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nSo, first, find out how much of the water evaporated.  Assuming standard conditions, 1 mL of water weighs 1g.  So that means that 16g of water evaporated. (With me so far?)  Now use that to find out that you have a bit less than on mole of water vapor.\n\nWhere did the energy that the evaporating water use come from?  The other molecules of water.  You know that the amount of energy released when 284g of water decreases temperature is related in the formula q=mC(Tfinal-Tinitial).  (Only the other 284g of water decreased temp...the other 16g gained temp.)  Now you can figure out how much energy the water vapor absorbed when it changed into a gas.\n\nTake the energy # and divide by the # of moles... and you are set.\n\n\nOh side note: since you are dropping the pressure, you do not need to worry about heating the water up inorder to make it boil.	science

Fish don't live bery long in water that has been boiled and brought back to room temperature. Why do you think this is? Boiling does not remove anything but gases dissolved in the water. Minerals are actually concentrated by boiling since water is removed, but the dissolved solids remain. So, the correct answer is that the oxygen is driven off. Oxygen has no significant solubility in water that hot.  If you really need to boil the water to kill bacteria or something, you can re-aerate the water with an aquarium air rock designed for this purpose. It releases zillions of tiny bubbles into the water. I'd suggest running it for a day or two for a 20 gal tank before reintroducing the fish.	science

Is Diet coke and/or Pepsi really diet? i've heard rumors that they will make you gain weight as much as reg  yea, as with what everyone else said thus far, here's another fact: one of the substitute sugars they've been inserting in low calorie/diet foods and drinks, I think the Amphet..somethingsomething, isn't even digestable to us humans. It's a total manufactured chemical that our bodies are no knowledge or digestive bacteria to properly digest it. Therefore, it is not good for you. I'd say diet sodas are worse than regular sodas, period. If you want a soda, drink a regular. Otherwise, here's another fact: you can lose an average 10lbs in one year just by cutting soda out of your diet completely. Think about that. The shet is useless to begin with.	health
can you take tramadol with trazodone and rozerem? I need trazodone and rozerem to sleep at night, like I should be doing now, but I also have a bad back where I occasionally need tramadol, can I safely take tramadol with these products I take for sleep? if the same doctor prescribed the medications, it is probably okay but always ask if you arent sure.  \n\nif it was two different doctors, and I am assuming it was since two are psychiatric medications and the other is general - you better ask first because the one who prescribed the tramadol may not be aware of the other medications you are on.  \n\nAlways update doctors on what medications you are taking.	health

Please help me :( Why am I so worried? Ahh, okay here I go. I know this may sound stupid to most of you, but I don't know :( Well, I was with this guy from September 8th -12th and although we did not engage in sexual intercourse, I gave him a handjob and he fingered me. Although his fingers weren't like "dripping" with his semen or anything, I'm worried MAYBE there might have been *some* of it on him. He also never went inside of me, he was just rubbing "down there"\n\nWell, I got my full period three days later (on Sept. 15) and got my period again on (although it was late like 2-3 days) October 16th. Usually, I spot around ovulation, but this month I didn't. My breasts hurt a lot and stuff, and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated (Oct. 31st) I should have my period next week some time, if everything is "normal"\n\nThe question is, is there any way that I could still be pregnant? I am SO worried, I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head. I understand I am not ready for this stuff. Any help is appreciated. I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do). Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck, enjoy yourself!	health

How can I get rid of razor burn on my legs? Whenever I shave my legs I get little red bumps which I assume are razor burn.  Is there anything to get rid of or prevent them? get rid of them:\nlet your skin heal, you're abusing yourself.\n\nprevent them:\nyou could try a dipilatory like neet but wait until after you've healed.  I've heard bad things about the type of hair removal systems that *pluck* your hair out.  If you're prone to ingrown hair you may want to avoid these and the dipilatory as well.  \n\nA lotion and an electronic razor may be your salvation.  They're smooth and don't cut deeply.  Your pantyhose may stick soon after shaving though but it won't look bad.\n\nGo natural?  Some men like that.  Whatever you do you'll adapt to your own body and learn what to do and when to balance being comfortable and presentable as well.  Heal first though, then try something that doesn't hurt you.  Eventually the razor burn will go away but leave your skin rougher and harder if you continue with what you're doing now.	health

He said "I know what I can do you just shut your trap little missey" I am 21...NOT A LITTLE MISSEY. Well, anyways, He left and came back with a shot. I asked him what was in it. He said "water, plain old water" He then told me to roll ovr onto my back,and pull down my panties. well you know where I got that shot..IN THE BUTT. It hert like HELL!! should a doctor be able to do that? You never mentioned what your symptoms were. The only reason I can think of your getting the shot would be for vomitting ( it will dehydrate you), and it was a shot of finegrin. It numbs an upset stomach to calm the nasea. Also, if you were dizzy and dehydrated, a doctor will administer the same for precaution to keep you from vomiting. How much you drink does not mean that's how much your body would retain. As far as his tone and the words he chose, there he was wrong. The rest he was probably correct. If you were dehydrated too much he would have put you on an IV. My opinion is that the shot was a precaution to save you the burden of an IV.	health

How can I prevent my Asthma from acting up so frequently while still on my regular medication? The question is sort of self-explanitory Hi Sentaka\n\nHere are some ideas on how to heal your condition.\n\nCause: \nAsthma is caused by malnutrition. Only by diligent and consistent effort to change embedded habits will one get permanent relief. The cough is a result of nature's effort to expectorate mucus from the lungs, after which breathing becomes easier. Ofttimes the cause of asthma is basically a nervous condition because the nerves are irritated \n\nHerbal Aids: \n1. Convulsions: When a person is in a convulsion there are certain herbs that will give very fast relief. One of these is tincture of lobelia, and a valerian decoction with a little cayenne added to relieve spasms. If such an attack comes after a meal one should use an emetic, such as a large dose of lobelia or use the Yoga finger method. (see # 2 below) \n\n2. Yoga Finger Method: Drink several cups of warm water, then place the middle finger deep down the throat and press the tongue until regurgitation starts. Mustard is also good to clean the stomach and lungs. Prior to the emetic a peppermint or spearmint tea should be used to soothe the area and alleviate the discomfort of continual vomiting. Hot fomentation of castor oil, comfrey, lobelia, mullein, etc., may be placed over the stomach, liver, spleen and lung areas. Frequent hydrotherapy baths or lengthy sweat baths are beneficial, followed by a cold shower or sponging. \n\n3. Vapor Bath: Another helpful method is to take a vapor bath twice a week, inhaling steam from a decoction of cudweed ragwort, wormwood, or a decoction of the following herbs, taken warm, (equal parts) will prove very beneficial: elecampane root, horehounds, hyssop, skunk cabbage root, vervain, wild cherry bark (and to this preparation add tincture of lobelia or antispasmodic tincture. Clear the bowels with an injection of catnip or barberry bark. This affliction also calls for plenty of outdoor exercise, deep breathing, and good ventilation while sleeping. The whole body system should be built up with tonic herbs such as chickweed, comfrey, marshmallow, mullein, etc. Diet should be mostly fruits and vegetables, avoiding all processed devitalized foods. \n\n4. Dr. Christopher's Herbal Respiratory Formula: (Resp-Free) It is wonderful for asthma. This combination of herbs in tablet, tea and capsule form is an aid to relieve irritation in the respiratory tract--lungs and bronchial. This is an aid in Emphysema as well as other bronchial and lung congestion such as bronchitis, asthma, tuberculosis, etc. Suggested amount for an adult is a cup two or three times a day, or 2 or 3 capsules or tablets two or three times a day with a cup of comfrey tea. For additional help in the program, it is good to add three to six drops of tincture of lobelia to each cup of tea. This formula consists of comfrey root, mullein, chickweed, marshmallow root and lobelia. \n\n5. Dr. Christopher's Hay Fever Formula: (Sha Tea) It is good for asthma also. This combination is a natural herbal aid working as a decongestant and antihistamine to dry up sinuses and expel from the head and broncho pulmonary tubes and passages the offending stoppage and mucus. Combine this with the respiratory combination to speed up the process. The wise person will turn to fresh wholesome food and beverages to keep the body in a perfect state. This will guarantee permanent relief, by going to the cause. \n\n6. Elder: The inner bark is used, although it should be aged before used. The fresh bark is violently irritating and poisonous to children. It is specifically used for spasmodic asthma with copious phlegm and stringy mucus. For asthma, take a tablespoonful whenever an attack threatens. Powdered Cloves can alleviate excessive vomiting when using the bark. To avoid bowel cramps, add a tablespoonful of powdered Ginger to the infusion. (ShoA:58). \n\n7 Lobelia: Most people agree that Lobelia is a specific treatment for asthma, as well as other bronchial or spasmodic troubles. Because the herb removes obstructions, g	health

sexual abuse... by a female? My cousin's best friend was sexually and physically abused when she was 10 by another female. I can't see how a female is capable of such actions, is it really true that females are just as capable of sexual abuse as guys? It just really weirds me out... I hope that so-called 'female' is locked up for life. Sure .. a woman is capable.. sexual abuse isn't just about a man forcing a girl/woman to have sex...  sexual abuse involved anything that one person does to another person against their will that involves any kind of sexual act... touching..  making somebody remove their clothes for the purpose of looking at them... making the person touch the one doing the forcing.. and much more...  so, if this woman made your friend touch her..  or she touched your friend.. in any manner considered sexual, it's sexual abuse.. that includes kissing.. and can include some types of hugging...  could be in some countries the laws are somewhat different... but I believe in Canada and the USA, the laws are similar. I hope your friend files charges if she really feels she was abused.	health

My hands andmy ELBOWS get really dry help?!?!?  Dry skin\nDry skin is common; as skin loses moisture the surface cracks. \n\nThe inherited forms of dry skin are known as ‘ichthyosis’ (fish-scale skin). There are various kinds of ichthyosis. Dermatologists often call dry skin arising in later life ‘xerosis’, ‘asteatosis’ or ‘acquired ichthyosis’. \n\nThe dry areas may result in dermatitis, i.e. the skin becomes red and itchy. This may result in a crazy-paving appearance on the lower legs (‘eczema craquelé’), or round patches scattered over the trunk and limbs (a dry form of nummular dermatitis). Sometimes the dry skin is just itchy, without much of a rash (sometimes known as ‘winter itch’, ‘7th age itch’, or ‘senile pruritus’). \n\n \nIchthyosis   \nClose-up of ichthyosis   \nDermatitis from dry skin  \n\nCauses of dry skin\nFactors which contribute to dry and cracked skin include: \n\nInherited factors \nMetabolic factors such as an underactive thyroid gland, or excessive weight loss. \nIncreasing age, resulting in decreased natural lubrication. \nCool weather, especially when windy or the humidity is low. \nAir conditioning, central heating or sitting close to a fire or fan heater. \nExcessive bathing, showering or swimming, especially in strongly chlorinated hot or cold water. \nContact with soap, detergents and solvents. \nFrictional irritation and chapping. \nTreatment of dry skin\nAn important aspect of treatment is to identify and tackle any contributing factors (see the list of causes above). \n\nReduce how often you bath or shower, and use lukewarm water. Showers may be better than baths. \nReplace standard soap with a substitute such as a synthetic detergent cleanser, water-miscible emollient, bath oil, anti-pruritic tar oil, etc. \nApply an emollient liberally and often, particularly after bathing, and when itchy. The drier the skin, the thicker this should be, especially on the hands. \nTreat eczematous patches with a topical steroid for a 5 to 15 day course. These are prescribed by your doctor and should be only applied to the red and itchy areas. \nLong term control\nDry skin is usually a long term and recurring problem, especially in winter. When you notice your skin getting dry, resume your lubricating routine and use a non-soap cleanser. If the itchy dry-skin rash returns, use both the lubricating routine and the prescription steroid cream or ointment. \n\nso now u can work out what u got...so is the treatment...\n\nis it usfull...if not pls contact me..\n\nget well\ngood luck	health
sleeping with prostitutes ! is it right or wrong ? i occasionally sleep with prostitutes (when have no girlfriend )i do enjoy it , i would prefer it when having sex with girlfriend . i find it frustrating when getting no sex and thats why i sleep with prostitutes , is it right or wrong to pay for sex ? You seem to be conscious about what you are doing so if you can afford it, hey why not?  In a way it's the same thing or maybe even better than picking up a girl at a bar and taking her home for a one night stand and then never calling her again cuz you just used her for sex and if she is innocent and not on the same vibe, she'll feel crappy and used.  The only thing is be careful!!! Use protection - more than one method.  I guess there is always a risk when sleeping with a prostitute which is a risk that can cost you your life - STDs.  But this is true for anyone you sleep with that you don't really know (like what happens amongst college kids all the time).  Man, I used to be a crazy in university and was very promiscuous so the same is true.  Some people even know the people the sleep with but there is a lack in trust or education.  Case in point, unfortunately in this day and age, sex is a bit of a risk.  And regardless, even when you are careful, often condoms can and do break.  Just be smart, educated, and careful.  Go with a good escort agency instead of picking up a sketchy hooker on a shaddy street that would do anything to get cracked up.  And don't forget that there is also a certain pleasure in renting a good porn and being with yourself.  It's very underrated but feels so good to give yourself pleasure - you know what you like, how you like it, etc.  Even this you can make exciting instead of just a wack off.  If I'm horny, I go home and take a bath and rub myself and then I wear some secy nightie just for myself and then I'll drink some wine and watch some porn and get on a table or on the floor or infront of a mirror and let myself pleasure me.  It's totally enjoyable sometimes even more than sex with a partner.	health

Why would my upper spine (neck) hurt while doing squats? what could the problem be? it was a cramping pain that lasted around 30 min. and was sore after that there are numerous possibilities \n\nyou may have slightly pulled one of the upper back muscles such as the trapezius that run up and into the neck - if you posture is slightly off when you load this can happen \n\nice the area, use ibuprofen and lay off for a day or two\n\nyou may have slightly irritated a disc in your neck  same as above for treatment but if it persists or you have any pins and needles in your shoulders, arms or your neck mobility is reduced seek medical attention\n\nI am assuming you squat with a bar on your neck?

what is milk thistle for?  Milk thistle is used to treat inflammatory liver ailments, especially chronic illnesses, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. Gallbladder ailments and related digestive symptoms, varicose and spider veins problems in the legs and jaundice are helped by milk thistle treatment, as well. A silymarin injection is an antidote to poisoning from the "death cap" mushroom, amanita.\n\nTherapeutic Effect\n      The active ingredient in milk thistle seeds is silymarin, a combination of three different flavonoids that supports the walls of liver cells, preventing poisons from penetrating them. It also stimulates the regeneration of these cells. Bitter principles and amino acids help support the entire digestive system.\n\nSilymarin as a liver tonic\n      People with acute liver problems should follow a six-week treatment with tea made from milk thistle seeds (below, in healing tea mixtures) several times a year. This tea treatment program is often recommended for people with liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake and cirrhosis.\n\nHow silymarin works\n      Silymarin helps prevent liver poisoning in two ways. It changes the liver cell walls in such a way that it is very difficult for poisons, such as cabon tetrachloride, to penetrate the walls. Silymarin also stimulates cell division so that new liver cells will grow continually.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMethods of Administration\nTea\n      For poor digestion, drink this tea 30 min. before meals. To support blood vessel integrity for the treatment of spider or varicose veins, drink 2-3 cups of tea throughout the day.\nPour 1 cup of boiling water over 2 tsps. of crushed seeds. Steep 10-15 min. and strain. There is no time limit on treatment with this tea; its use may be ongoing. \n      Peppermint increases the effectiveness of milk thistle tea and improves its taste. When you make the tea, add 1 tbsp. of peppermint leaves to the mixture.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTincture\n      For gallstones or other gallbladder concerns, take 20-30 drops up to 3 times daily until the condition improves. To prepare the tincture, mix ¼ cup of crushed seeds with 1¼ cups of rum in a clean glass jar. Cover tightly and shake well. Let stand for 4-6 weeks, shaking every few days. Strain out the seeds and bottle the liquid. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNutritional Supplement\n      To support good liver function, eat 1 tbsp. of ground seeds daily. In a coffee grinder or spice mill, grind seeds to add to hot cereals, muffins, rice dishes and other whole-grain meals. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMedicinal Uses\nTincture for intensive treatment\n      Silymarin is only partly water soluble, so for an intensive treatment to protect and regenerate liver cells, you should also use a tincture made from milk thistle seeds to increase the effect of the tea. Put 10 drops of the tincture into 1 cup of milk thistle tea. This tincture can also be purchased in health food stores. Caution: Because of its alcohol content, never use the tincture if you are suffering from acute liver inflammation or alcoholism.\n\nLeaf tea for aiding digestion\n      You can also make therapeutic teas from the leaves of the milk thistle. They do not contain silymarin, but they have an overall positive effect on the liver and gallbladder, and a tea made with them is valuable for improving digestion and for easing mild digestive complaints. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1½ tsp. of finely chopped leaves. Steep for 5-10 min. and then strain. Drink 2-3 glasses per day.\n\nCompresses for varicose veins\n      The external application of the tea in a compress can help varicose veins and open leg sores. Make the tea; cool. Soak a cloth in the cooled tea and apply as a damp compress 	health
how to be a good businessman?  I consider myself to be a very good businessman. I have the perfect solution and it has worked for me for over 39 years.\n\n1. Be a listener, not a talker. I learned more from listening and retaining than speaking.\n\n2. Be honest, conduct yourself in a humble manner. Humility and Honesty are 2 of the greatest Virtues.\n\n3. Surround yourself with people smarter or more intelligent than you and listen to them, pick their brains and learn from mistakes.\n\n4. Lastly, pick up Donald Trump's book "The Art Of The Deal".\n\nThis book will give you everything you will ever need to know regarding being a good businessman.  Good Luck to you and I hope I have been helpful.\n\nGreg120750	health

If two people with HIV or AIDS slept together unprotected, would that be ok? Surely you can't catch HIV if you already have it. So is it ok? \n\nThere should be a club, like a dating service where people who have HIV and AIDS can meet up and go out. Because people who have it could never really have totally risk free sex with a non-carrier, the condom could always break. If they slept with another HIV carrier they wouldn't have to worry about explaining their illnesses to the other person or worrying about their reaction. Well if you want to risk getting further complications why would you?\n\nI would be contacting those  STD organisations to seek clarification rather than accepting what anyone here would be telling you....	health

If I don't drink it , I get headace. what should I do. I tried all sweetners.....I don't like them. Please give some natural ways to control sugar. Thanks. Eating or drinking sugar does not cause diabetes..Family history,being over weight, lack of exercise..is the main reasons people get it.\nWhen you have diabetes your body doesn't produce and or use insulin properly,,That is why a person with diabetes has to watch what food/drinks they consume..because their body doesn't use insulin the way ..say yours does.. \n If you don't have major risk factors for it 4 teaspoons of sugar a day will not cause you to have diabetes..If you want a good alternative to real sugar try splenda..it tastes just like real sugar...I use it in my kids kool-aid and they love it. Also my mom used to be a sugar hound and I gave her a bag of splenda last year and she hasn't bought real sugar again..she even bakes with it..

$40 copay but no deductable. what does that mean? I am trying to figure out if my insurance covers NuvaRing.

Im new to this and would like to know what this means. it also says that coinsurance was 80%. oh and my insurance is BlueCross BlueShield Tenneesseee You have to pay $40 each time you get a presciption filled, but there is no yearly minimum you have to reach in out of pocket expenses before the insurance kicks in.\n\nFor example, If you have a $50 deductible and $10 copay, you would have to pay $10 each time you got a presciption, but first you would have to spend $50 of your own money on presciptions.  Then you would pay just the $10 copay and the insurance would pick up the rest.\n\nDeductible is how much you have to spend of your own money before the insurance will cover anything.\n\nCopay is the portion you pay once the insurance starts covering costs.	health

Is being dramatic/impulsive a learned behavior or just part of a persons character? My bf thank for God for him, point it out to me that I was both dramatic/impulsive. I honestly didn't know but hes helping me to think more before I speak and to not get to excited or overwhelmed when something happens. Are these extremely bad behaviors? Can they be corrected are will they just be apart of my character? First Dramatic and Impulsive are 2 totally different things. Being dramatic to a situation usually means you are wanting attention, good or bad by taking the situation to the extreme.  Impulsive is to react without thinking, that can be to yell and get angry over "nothing" or to blow your entire paycheck on a pair of shoes when rents due.  To answer your question they are part of character, and can be altered.  But any behavior you don't like can be changed.  Just like your boyfriend pointed out, you can think before you react, that goes a long way.  You should do that even if you don't think your a drama queen and/or impulsive.\n\nMore importantly you are not making these changes because HE wants you to.  You have to make the change for yourself.  Otherwise it really doesn't do any good.  You'll revert back to your "old ways" once he's no longer with you.  If this is something you've found to be a problem then make the change, fact is no one like a drama queen only in small doses, and there are good and bad sides to being impulsive.  I'd like to see you keep a part of each and use in moderation when the time is right.\n\nGood luck!	health

What's the best way to lose 40 pounds in 3 months?  Two pounds per week is (generally) the most you can shed without risking harm or unwanted side effects of a diet.  There's no quick magical way to drop 40 lbs in a very short time, although product ads will try to convince you otherwise.  A strict well-disciplined Weight Watchers Diet for example, can allow you to lose the 40 lbs in about 20 weeks (5 months).	health

i'm trying to get pregnant now and today is ovalation day can i try or what to do pleas help me out?  You really should have started trying a few days ago. The best time would be about 2 days before ovulation to give the sperm time to reach the egg. Sperm are not very fast and could use the extra time especially since the egg has limited viability (24-48 hours). If you don't get pregnant this month, you may want to test next month with a predictor that gives you a day or two advanced notice. If I find the exact speed for sperm I'll modify my answer to give you a more exact idea. Good luck.	health
What does it mean if your sweat is brown? I have never before had an issue with my clothes staining or anything like that, but I have noticed in the past few days my underarms are leaving BROWN on my bras, deoderant stick, shirts, etc.  This is pretty embarrassing for me, as you can imagine.  Does anyone know what could cause this? I'm not saying your probably dirty but try using a loafa with your soap or body wash in the shower.  Shower in the mornings before you start your day to know you are clean and apply deoderant on freshly cleaned skin.  I know that your sweat can smell stronger when you've eaten spicey foods and a lot of greasy foods, so maybe the tent is from the foods too.  Or maybe you aren't drinking enough water either.  When you urinate, is your urine dark or clear?  Dark soda could be the cause.  Try more water and cut out soda and eat fruits and veggies too.	health

I broke my back at work .....? and tried to get better for a year, not knowing it was too late to sue the employer who fired me a month after this all happened (becasue they said I was working too slow)  I was there 8 years and just got a new superintendent (boss) who wanted there own people in, who made me do a job I kew was not safe, who now got fired herself for no one will say why. The only thing I could do is apply for disability (I did) What is the best way to get disability was turned down twice and now hired a attorney, still seeing doctors who say they cant do much becasue of where it is L5 dont know what to do. The one year statute of limitations does not apply to all cases.  Make sure that your attorney does personal injury law.  There are many areas of law.  Do you have any evidence to support your claims?  Medical records, work schedules, work assignment sheets could be used to prove that there has been a substantial change in your ability to do work for that particular employer.  Some states allow up to three years for medical claims due to the outcome of the treatment not being immediately available.\n\nFiling for unemployment compensation should be sought; whether it is awarded or not.  This is done at state level and usually involves filling out paperwork to substantiate your claim.  Your employer will be asked to submit a statement.  This step will help to validate the reasons for your dismissal from work.\n\nSee resource reference:  www.merck.com  \nExtensive loss of body functions can be devastating, causing depression and loss of self-esteem. Learning exactly what has happened and what to expect in the near and distant future helps people cope with the loss. Physical and occupational therapy (see Rehabilitation: Physical Therapy) helps preserve muscle function. Therapists teach people special techniques to help them overcome lost functions. For most people, compassionate and skilled nursing care, psychologic counseling, and emotional support from family members and close friends help. Family members may also benefit from counseling.\n\nPerhaps a neurosurgeon could better diagnose your condition.  A trauma spinal injury may be of several types (see source).  Your attorney should have their (doctor's) statements on file as it pertains to your particular case.  Contact organizations such as the Christopher Reeves Foundation to learn of advancements in spinal cord research.\n\nSome states have departments that specialize in Rehabilitation Services.  They offer training to those who qualify (and pending funding availability).  They test to determine areas of interest and types of work that you can do.  They often pay for education or training that will enable you to continue working.  Learning to do other work may enable you to continue working.  It would help prevent a sense of helplessness and depression due to lack of personal fulfillment.  If your state offers Job Service, speaking with them about Rehabilitative Services may provide a name and telephone number to get things started.\n\nOften physical therapy is part of spinal injury treatment.  One should be careful not to irritate the injury site or create further damage.  If disability was denied on two separate occassions, they probably feel certain of your ability to work.  They, too, may be able to refer you to services designed to help in your recovery from your injury.	health

What is the perfect time to work out on a treadmill for?? You would think the longer the better right??? But ive heard that you only really need 30-45mins a day, any longer isnt really achieving anything more. Im just curious as to if thats true or not. Im not HUGELY overweight, but im very unfit. When i finish on the treadmill my face stays bright red for at least 30 mins. I can handle a very fast walking speed but jogging is so hard, i feel like im going to die! But i jogged anyway for a couple of minutes until i made myself sick from it. Now i stick to the level under that, a very fast walk. \nAny ideas or suggestions about the perfect amount of time to work out for and what to do when im on there? First of all, you can't exercise "too long". It depends on what your objectives are. If you stay longer than 40 mins on the treadmill, you're losing more fat and building up more endurance. If you stay on for 30-45 mins, that's a good time for people who just want to lose weight and keep in shape. After 30 mins, you start burning fat instead of just calories. So the longer you stay on, the more fat you're burning. People who train for marathons and races definitely stay longer than 45 mins! \nBut in your case, I think 30-45 mins is a great time to start off with. And don't worry, my face also gets extremely flushed after working out, this has nothing to do with your level of fitness.\nYou will see that the longer you stick with it, the better your overall fitness will become, and eventually you can start jogging. I can also recommend that you perhaps try the uphill mode on the treadmill - it'll burn more calories and tone your butt as well. So, I think you should keep up the brisk walk for now, and start jogging whenever you're ready for it (and you will be). However, if you really don't like jogging, just keep walking. It definitely puts less stress on your knees and as long as you're exercising, there's nothing wrong with walking! The key is to work up a sweat and get your heart rate up.	health

I am HIV+. Does that mean that it is impossible for me to have children via natural means?  I'm in my 30s. I am HIV+. Does that mean that it is impossible for me to have children via natural means?  What risks would there be to my partner?  To the child? I am amazed by the amount of misinformation in the responses thus far.  Although statistics vary, current estimates are that between 15% and 35% of the time HIV will be perinatally passed from pregnant women to their children.\n\nThe rate of perinatal transmission among babies studied since 1986 by the NYC-based maternal transmission study is 28%, which follows the rule that not every exposure leads to HIV infection. There is some evidence that transmission is more likely if the woman is HIV symptomatic, but asymptomatic women can also pass the virus to their children.\n\nInfants born to HIV positive women will test HIV antibody positive at birth due to passive immunity - being born with some of their mother's antibodies. As infants develop their own immune systems (including antibodies) they replace the passive immunity antibodies with their own antibodies.\n\nThis process is usually completed by 8-10 months of age, but not later than 15 months. Most medical practitioners use 18 months as the cut-off point for a definitive antibody test result.\n\nBottom Line:\nThere is no way for a male to infect a fetus directly. However, every sexual encounter you have while attempting to impregnate a women increases her risk of contracting HIV from you. If she becomes infected then there is a chance 15-30% chance that she may transmit it to her fetus. Regardless, if you plan on having children, both you and your partner need to have serious discussions with experts in the field of HIV medicine.	health
When working out do I eat lots of protein after OR before hand?? I drink weight gainer and eat a LOT of protein...should I take it right before or right after working out? before and after would be best.  also having something about an hour or two before bed is good as well...you dont want anything fatty just something packed with protein like tuna w/ water (right out of the can) because when your body is at rest that is when it also repairs itself.  try to make sure you give your body time off and plenty of rest otherwise the muscles do not have to time to repair and grow...hope that helps!	health
What can a person drink or eat to act as natural mucolytic to help alleviate sinusitis?  I assume we're talking about chronic stuffiness, right?  If so, I find that, in my personal experience, it's not so much what I eat as it is what I avoid.\n\nIf you were my client, I'd suggest that you keep a food diary for a couple of weeks and see if you spot any patterns.  Common foods that cause stuffiness include refined starches, rice and dairy.  (A plate of spaghetti will do it to me every time!)\n\nBest wishes.	health
is it normal for a woman to urinate when climaxing?  I would say it is not common for woman to urinate during a climax. What you might think is urination, could be an orgasm. Some females will squirt during their orgasm, but this is usually about 5-10 ml. Some maybe a little more, but not much. If you are passing more than say a big table spoon then you need to go and get checked out by your doctor. \n\nWeak bladder can cause this, but like I said, its not common. Hope this helps out, kind of hard to diagnose over the Internet cause lab tests and exams are a key part of it.	health
More information about radiation and chemo treatments together?  Not real sure what you're looking for, but yes, they sometimes go together.  The side effects of both are generally somewhat heightened when the two go togther, but there are things to lessen those too.

can chlamydia be transmitted through saliva from an infected woman to an uninfected male through oral sex?  If the woman's infection is in her throat, then it can me transmissible via fellatio, but this is rare because chlamydia has a moderately-sized infectious dose. A certain minimum of bacteria have to move from the throat to the urethra. Biologically, men do have less ability to pick up infection as insertive partners compared to women who receive (into the pharynx or into the vagina).\n\nSo it's difficult for this to happen, but not negligible. Always use a flavored condom during fellatio.	health
What are chances of pregnancy once a fallopian tube & 1 ovary removed..plus D&C? She has had severe indometriosis this was cleaned up also. The chances are still good that she will get pregnant. The concern would be more if she will successfully carry a pregnancy. Once women get scarred with things such as endometriosis or infections, they are more likely to have ectopic pregnancies (pregnancies that happen outside the uterus). These are pregnancies which can not be sustained as they will do severe harm to the mother, even death if untreated. And the pregnancy would not survive past the first few weeks anyway. I am not saying she will have this problem, but it is a possibility.	health

Anyone want to tell us if taking ecstasy helped them good or bad? If you experiemented with ecstasy, did it help or mess with your mind? Are you glad or regret taking it? There is no doubt that ecstasy feels good, but there is a price to pay. I work with drug addicts and they suffer from damaged immune systems, chills, fevers for no reason, depression, anxiety, infections, weight loss, memory loss, blurred vision because ecstasy stretches the eye muscles when they over-react to the drug, etc. Even 6 years after they stopped taking the drugs they experience these symptoms. Ecstasy messes your hormones around and damages the neurons in the brain and throws your brain chemicals out of balance. If you know of anyone who is suffering from these symptoms after using drugs, L-tyrosine capsules (a natural amino acid) helps to increase Dopamine in the brain (a natural chemical to help with depression and memory). It takes about 2 weeks to start working. It might help (but first speak to a doctor before taking supplements). People who used drugs lose their sharp thinking and don't feel the same as they did before they took it. I would stay away from drugs if you want to live a normal and fulfilling life and not suffer from mental/health problems later in life.	health

Why do women go on Maury Povich and say they are 100 percent sure of the father, when obviously, they lied? and why do I watch this crap talk show anyway?

Anime Characters? Why do some people think that the characters in anime and manga books are hot? Jeeze people, they're drawings. Same for avatars on some web sites. They're fake. How can they be "hot" or "sexy"? Some people think characters in anime/manga are hot because they are ideal. Meaning that if we, as human beings, could have the guy/girl of our dreams they would be like the characters from our favorite anime/manga. Unfortunatly this isn't good because if we only look to our dream guy/girl we will miss out on meeting a great guy/girl in real life.

how do you play the guitar?  1. Get a half decent guitar. Don't learn on a cardboard box, it will put you off.\n\n2. Get a decent teacher. It's DEFINITELY worth the money. You can't learn any instrument properly from a video or book, no matter what it says on the cover. How's a book or video going to tell you that you haven't got it quite right?\n\n3. Practise regularly, daily if possible, for a decent length of time. 10 minutes twice a week will not make you a guitarist. Having said that, don't go mad and try to do 3 or 4 hours every time you practise, your brain stops absorbing new stuff after a while. 30 minutes is a good starting point, build it up from there.\n\n4. Expect it to take some time. You won't be out-playing Brian May in 6 months. It takes years of work and dedication.\n\n5. IT'S WORTH THE TIME! Playing an instrument is one of the most rewarding things you can learn.	entertainment and Music

What does everyone think about the Chris Daughtry Controversy? The version he sang of "Walk the Line" was originally done by a group called LIVE in 2001.  He let American think he made this song his own and the Judges commended him for "being himself"  What are your thoughts and opinions? I never heard it said that it was Chris' own arrangement of the song.  I don't think that Chris tried to pass it off as his own arrangement because just the week before he gave proper credit to the Red Hot Chili Peppers for doing a similar version of "Higher Ground". The judges just said that he knows what songs are right for his voice. There has been speculation as to whether Chris mentioned Live's version in the pre-performance monologue and that it was edited out.  I think it is getting completely blown out of proportion and I hope it doesn't hurt Chris' chances.  He is one of the best performers in the competition in my opinion.	entertainment and Music

Where are the real men who live for music? I would like to read your answers to questions about the industry, no matter what part of the world your in.\nLove for music is something that is deep with in. Please tel me question you. Email me crystalsingers@yahoo.com.au Please take a chance on me. Everthing will be private if you wish. Well, there are two different topics here:\n\n1) The music creation / artistic part of making music\n2) The music business itself (i.e., lawyers, labels,\ncontracts, profits, royalties, paychecks, etc).\n\nWell, obviously, creating the music is the rewarding part emotionally.  You get to create something from your imagination and also something that reflects your personality and give it to public listening.  This is the part that is also the most fun portion.  It should not be tied down by business rules.  But, in many cases it is.\n\nThe music business is, as is all other money making industries, just a business solely interested in making money.  So, as long as the music is popular and it continues to make money, that artist is at the top.  If that stops, then the artist becomes a has-been.  If the artist was industry created (like so many artists of today), then that person becomes a nobody as fast as they became a somebody.  Today, the music business is almost solely focused on piracy without regard to anything else.  They are so entranced by this issue that they have forgotten that they really need to provide quality music to the listening public.\n\nSo, because of the piracy issue, the music of today is really not that great.  Much of today's music is primarily created in the producer's mind and by the producers... hiring people solely to fill the roles (just as as a film might hire an actor).  In the past, a group of musicians would get together and create music and then be discovered.  Today, it's just the opposite.  Producers create the music up front and then find someone with the look and a reasonably decent voice to fill the role.  Rarely is commercial pop music actually created by talented musicians.  It's now almost solely created by a producer who then hires musicians to play the music to what was already written (requiring only musical instrument skill, but little, if any, writing talent).\n\nThe contractual part of the music industry is where most new artists get bitten hard.  If you're undiscovered, then they rope you in to signing a horrible contract with small amount of pay and lots of concert work.  So, you get little in the way of pay, but you do a lot of work for them (that you are contractually obligated to provide).  So, if you ever get into the position of signing a record contract, be careful to read the verbiage exactly (and have a lawyer that you have hired go over it with you).  Don't blindly sign it simply because you want a record deal.	entertainment and Music

Is anyone else utterly bored with mainstream porn? Bi-sexual porn is great. But mainstream porn is terribly boring and tired. The same old positions over and over again, no creativity at all. And how many money shots must a man see before he is completely disguisted by the robbing of a woman's dignity?\n\nCome on people, let's unite. Enough of this boring, uncreative, male dominated mainstream porn. Has anybody else had enough? That's the trouble with porn -- you get case-hardened pretty quickly.  Then everything seems bland, but you're addicted and so you seek something a bit more, a bit different.\n\nOn top of that, images get 'burned' into your brain, and emerge into your consciousness at inappropraite times -- like when you're having sex for real with a real living person -- and then it seems that you are uninventive, unoriginal and a poor second best to the porn.\n\nTake my advice, keep the porn at extremely softcore and do not let even that become a habit.  Instead get out and try to get as much social interaction as possible -- work, find a cure for cancer, have as much sex as you can.\n\nThe moment when you do not 'own' your own sex acts is a particularly sad point indeed.\n\nGet out man.  Now -- while the going's good...	entertainment and Music

Anyboby got any interesting info on Aquarius? If you can break it down to the day, January 25, that would be nice too.  I am just wondering if anybody has any new info that I don't know. Aquarius\nJanuary 21-February 19 \n"I Know"\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nPlanet: Uranus\n\nKey phrase: "I Know"\nSymbol: The Water Bearer\n\nQuality: Fixed\nElement: Air\n\nDuality: Masculine\nColor:  Electric Blue\nGem: Amethyst\n\nBody Part: Shins and Ankles\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nMany people get confused that Aquarius is a water sign, as it's symbol is the water bearer and the 'aqua' in the name. However, these people are most definitely air signs. They have a way with other people, they really do. If they're a bad Aquarius, they're good at manipulating. If they're a good Aquarius, they can really change the world and get things into motion. Another reason they are obviously not water signs is that they find extreme emotional displays as kind of a put-off. They say what they feel and that's it. There's usually nothing else behind it. If they're mad, they're mad and that's that. But if a cancer's mad, they're sad, too, they just won't say it. They're the people who want to say the right thing, and when you're done crying they'll go with you to kick the other guy's ass. They also have a tendency to make weird noises, be humming or fidget. They can't help it, however. And don't be offended if they just start talking in the middle of a sentence of yours, because it really isn't their fault they haven't been listening, as their minds WANDER. There is no doubt about that. I think every Aquarius could be diagnosed with ADD at one point or another. That's not to say that they can't be good listeners when interested, or when they know it's important. They're actually quite good at listening, when they focus on it.\nAnd maybe it's just me, but I've noticed that they all have some tacky sentimental thing that they lugg around with them. My boyfriend Zak wears these shoes that are basically extra socks they're in such bad shape. But he loves them. And my mother had the same hat for 15 years. Christ.\nIt was no mistake when someone called Aquarius the 'banner carrier', as they are well known to start revolutions and reform. It even gets down to someone being picked on or a rather nasty over-the-shoulder comment being completely blown away by the Aquarius righteousness. They can't STAND to see the underdog picked on. They feel sorry for wounded puppies to whole nations of people. They're the one politely telling you that you're an asshole for making fun of the fat kid across the room. First they'll come in with the "Hey, you wouldn't like it if they did that to you" attitude, and if that doesn't work they'll come back with a "Fuck you" attitude.\nThey don't analyze as much as they reflect. And people naturally flock to them for advice. It isn't always advice the Aquarius will take themselves, however. They usually let people fuck them over or oppress them once or twice, but once they swear it off, it never happens again. The will these people have is incredible, and I think all of them are artistic in some way.\nThey LOVE to try new things, unless this aspect is outweighed by other signs in their chart, they'll also be the first person next to Pisces to say "Oh my god" after hearing some particularly heart wrenching tale from some victim. \nThey've all got a style all their own, and the house of a wealthy Aquarian would be a sight to behold. The other day I went to a restaurant in Baltimore, and let me tell you, my inner Capricorn fucking DIED. There were beat up mannequins on the ceiling, the walls, and they were painted weird, tacky colors and little army men were melted on as hair...and guh. The place looked like shit.

Please please please, what happened on desperate housewives?  Mrs. McCluskey has spread the word about Art, so when he shows up dressed as Santa Claus at the holiday block party the mothers won't let their children near him. \n\nLynette is on her cell phone, arranging a meeting with all the concerned mothers when Art's wheelchair-bound sister, Rebecca wheels herself over to tell Lynette that everyone's treating Art like a pariah because of her. She says she doesn't need this stress in her condition. Lynette is sorry but says she has her kids to think about. \n\nBut when Lynette goes to the meeting, she's alarmed to see they're making anti-pedophile signs for a protest outside Art's house. She tries to tell the women that they don't know anything for sure, but they won't listen to her. She and Tom watch the protest from their yard and Lynette says she knows it's all her fault. An ambulance arrives and they find out Rebecca has had a heart attack. As Art is leaving the house, a protester throws a rock that hits him in the head. Lynette tries to get the protesters to leave, but to no avail. \n\nLater that night, she finds Art packing and offers to help. She heard on the news that Rebecca died and she's feeling incredibly guilty. To her surprise, he thanks her. He says that because he had to look after Rebecca he always had to keep himself in check because he didn't want her to know the truth about him. But now that she's dead, he's free to do whatever he wants in a new town where no one knows him. Lynette backs away, horrified by what her actions set in motion. \n\nGabrielle and Vern want to dump a girl named Amy from their roster of beauty pageant contestants since she has no talent. But when Gabrielle lays eyes on her handsome father Bill, whose wife died a year ago, she offers to give Amy private tutoring instead. Amy sees Gabrielle flirting with her father and says she doesn't want her dating him. She already has a plan for Bill to marry her best friend Sheri's mother. Gabrielle seems to have met her match, but she turns Sheri, the most talented of their contestants, against Amy by saying she's planning on making them dance together in the show. With the girls' friendship over, she's free to move in on Bill. \n\nIan wants his parents to meet Susan and for her to make dinner for them. She confesses she's a horrible cook but he isn't satisfied until she promises to try to make them a nice roast. She asks Bree to help her out and she agrees, saying she's glad for the distraction since she just threw Orson out after finding out about his affair with the murdered Monique. She still believes Orson is innocent, but Susan is telling her that you have to face the facts, even if it's someone you love, when they see Mike being arrested. \n\nEdie visits Mike in jail to let him know she's dumping him. Susan is his next visitor. She tells him she knows he's innocent, even if he doesn't know that for sure himself. \n\nSusan arrives late for their weekly poker game and asks if Bree has told the police her suspicions about Orson yet. Bree cheerily informs here that her suspicions are gone now that Mike, who was previously convicted of a murder, has been arrested. The two women argue over who's more guilty, Mike or Orson, and an infuriated Susan heads for the door. She loudly slams the front door and only pretends to leave. She tiptoes back in and steals the key labeled "Orson's office." \n\nShe goes to the office and finds Orson there, watching a game and eating pizza. She's just starting her search when Bree arrives and she has to hide. Bree tells Orson she's there to take him back because Mike has been arrested for Monique's murder. But she says she still needs to know the whole truth from him. With Susan listening in, he confesses that he never loved Alma, but that his mother pushed them together and then Alma got pregnant, so he did the honorable thing and married her	entertainment and Music

Does anyone know any REALLY effective workouts for hockey?  Jumping Rope\nWorkout Suggestions- change workouts to include jumping with both feet, one foot, and alternating feet. Jump rope 2-4 times per week. Alternate between the following two workouts: \n\n1) Quick Bursts- 30-45 second intervals at the fastest tempo possible without breaking your rhythm, with 1 minute rests between each repetition. Try 3 sets of 3 reps. with a 2 minute rest between each set. \n\n2) Endurance- Jump 20 minutes at a moderated pace, alternating your foot patterns throughout the workout. Set goals of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes without a "miss". Jump with a walkman on, listening to your stereo, or while watching TV. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Primary: wrists, ankles, calves. Secondary: shoulders. SOFT FEET. \n\nInline Skating\nYour primary objective should be to reinforce correct skating techniques. Anytime you are in skates, hockey or inline, correct skating motions should be executed. This will develop good habits, not bad ones. Assuming you do this, enjoy a nice sunny day on your blades and remember to ALWAYS wear a helmet and sufficient protective equipment. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training and technical skills training. Train on your inline skates 2-3 times per week. To avoid dehydration and sun burn, skate in the morning or evening and drink plenty of fluids. Select a safe, newly paved surface. \n\n1) Distance Training- skate a 50% speed for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend. Try to find a route with changing scenery. \n\n2) Technical Skills Training- Work on your skating and puck control skills for 30-45 minutes. Create drills to develop your forward and backward strides, crossunders, turns, stickhandling, passing, and shooting. This is a mental workout, rather than a physical workout. The emphasis is on precise execution, not power or speed. Skills must be practiced at a learnable rate. Again, for technical skills training ideas and effective drills, call 1-800-320-7545 for our latest hockey skills training video. \n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\nSlideBoard Training\nA training tool widely used by international speedskaters and competitive hockey players to develop leg strength, correct striding, and to provide a challenging cardiovascular workout. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Vary your workouts to include distance training, quick burst training, and technical skills training. Incorporate slide board workouts 2-3 times per week. \n\n1) Distance Training- stroke a 50% thrust for 20-30 minutes maintaining a 90 degree kneebend and a consistent head level. Swing your arms back and forth to involve your upper body and to finish the transfer of body weight. Adjust the slide board to a challenging length. \n\n2) Quick Burst Training- Adjust the board to a shorter length. Maintain controlled strides, pick up the tempo of your strides to approximately twice that of your distance training. Three sets of three 30 -45 second bursts at 80-90%. Rest 1 minute between reps and 2 minutes between sets. \n\n3) Technical Skills Training- Complete, explosive leg thrust and upper body control must be maintained throughout any workout involving striding motions. \n\n\nMuscles Worked- Quadriceps, hamstrings, cardiovascular. \n\n\nRunning Steps/Stairs\nThis could very well be one of the best cross-training activities, one that simulates game-like situations, challenges you mentally and physically, and allows you to breathe fresh outside air on a nice summer day. Step training will develop explosive leg strength and quick burst speed. \n\nWorkout Suggestions- Go to your local high school or stadium and run 2-4 sets of 3 reps, 1-2 times per week. Each repetition should involve a 20-30 second burst up the steps, with 45 second rest intervals between each rep. Concentrate on exploding off deep kneebend, swinging arms front to back, and maintaining a level head position. Change your step workouts to include running every other step, or using only 	sports

how do I teach my dog to walk with a leash?  Your dog is probably testing you. You have to show him/her that you are the master, not him/her. Male dogs are more likely to be unruly. To train him to do as you want, give him a slight tug on the leash when he does not respond properly and tell him no--a slight tug not a jerk. Also give him encouragement when he does well--a treat and a good boy or good girl.	sports

In Portugal if you do this, they throw bottles at you." - on Manchester United \n\n"Pressure? What pressure? Pressure is poor people in the world trying to feed their families. There is no pressure in football" - Speaking in a post-match interview \n\n"Everybody wants Chelsea to lose a game. When they do they should declare a public holiday." - Speaking in a press conference about Chelsea's leading Premiership start in the 2005/06 season \n\n"We are on top at the moment but not because of the club's financial power.

I cycle a hybrid but want to switch to a proper road bike. Which would be a good, cheap entry level brand? I cycle in London and commute to work. But enjoy cycling fast!\nI'd like a bike that's basic, but good enough to upgrade later on.\nHopefully something not too stiff - south london roads are rough! I actually preferred a mountain bike with the narrowest semi-slick tyres I could find for riding regularly in London traffic, but thankfully I don't have to do this anymore. It looked strange with Marzocchi race forks, but had a good riding position, was fast, could jump over traffic islands and I never had an on-road accident on it in years of London (ab)use.\n\n Commuting just under 40 miles a day outside London, I used to mainly use an Italia fixed wheel machine from Condor in Grays Inn Road. This was practically maintainance free and very unattractive to thieves - the complete bike with aluminium frame and carbon forks should be around £600. This was also a wonderful bike for 50 mile training runs on a sunny spring morning and I even used it for youth hostelling.I had great fun on it until my knees gave out - and I'm not blaming that on the bike. The same frameset and forks with a Mirage groupset will cost around £800. A couple of clip on crud guards will make it more practical in British weather.\n\nF W Evans have several branches in South London and a huge stock of 2005 models at discounted prices. Check out http://www.evanscycles.com/ for details. They sell quality gear and the staff are enthusiastic and knowledgable - recommended.\n\nPersonally, I'd scour the ads in Cycling Weekly - I picked up a second hand pro level custom built cyclocross bike here for £500 at a time when the new frame and forks alone would have cost £650. Quality wheels plus Dura Ace and other top end components would have taken it way out of my price range new, but second hand it was cheaper than many entry level bikes. This has prooved to be an amazingly practical bike for everyday use with the addition of an USE suspension seatpost and using 32 mm tyres. There's plenty of clearance to fit clipon guards for road use in winter and it's an awesome tool for blasting down bridleways and canal towpaths in three seasons a year. Mine was made in 853 by a Manchester based firm called Atom.\n\nSteel will be more comfortable than aluminium and you can afford decent steel if you're buying second hand. Anything that fits you and has a Reynolds 531, 653 or 853 frame will be suitable, as would bikes using equivalent Italian steels from Deda or Columbus. The best all round compromise for speed, comfort and weather protection will be an audax bike. Anything by Chas Roberts, Bob Jackson, Brian Rourke or Condor is desirable and offerings from Mercian, Thorn, Ribble and Dawes are well worth investigating. Mine is a Condor which I bought new and there is no way I would want to part with it. It does everthing you want as long as you don't put much more than your wallet, passport, camera, keys, first aid kit and maps in the barbag - it gets twitchy on climbs when you're out of the saddle if you do. The only problem I've had is that the dynamo lighting system they fitted never did work, apart from in their workshop - I got so fed up with taking it in that I just gave up and scrapped it.\n\nI've just modified this after finishing training and hope it's of some small use. You know that whatever you choose is going to be the right choice. Just go for it and enjoy.	sports

who is marco van basten?  Marco van Basten\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\nMarco van Basten  \nFull name Marcel van Basten \nNickname(s) San Marco \nDate of birth October 31, 1964 \nPlace of birth Utrecht, Netherlands \nCurrent club Netherlands \nPosition Manager (former Striker) \nYouth club(s) \n1981-1982 Ajax Amsterdam \nProfessional club(s) \n1982-87\n1987-93 Ajax Amsterdam\nA.C. Milan 132 (127)\n147 (90) \nNational team \n1983-92 Netherlands 58 (24) \nManaged club(s) \n2003-2004\n2004- Ajax B\nNetherlands \nMarcel van Basten, known as Marco van Basten (October 31, 1964, Utrecht), is a former Dutch football player who played for Ajax Amsterdam and A.C. Milan in the 1980s and early 1990s. He is regarded as one of the finest strikers of all time and scored 276 goals in a career cut short by injury, known for his strength on the ball, his tactical awareness and spectacular volleys. His grace earned him the titles "San Marco" and "The Swan Of Utrecht". Van Basten, who was named European Footballer of the Year three times (1988, '89 and '92) and FIFA World Player of the Year (1992) is currently the coach of the Dutch national team.\n\n[edit]\nPlaying career\nVan Basten played very briefly for Elinkwijk before Ajax signed him. He played his first game for Ajax in April 1982 and was proclaimed the new Johan Cruijff.\n\nIn 1987 Silvio Berlusconi brought Van Basten to Milan along with fellow countrymen Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard, joining them in 1988. In his first season Milan won their first scudetto (league championship) in eight years, but Van Basten played only eleven games and was constantly troubled by an ankle injury. Despite this, in Euro 88 Van Basten showed a dazzling run of form, including three goals against England and a spectacular volley in the final against the Soviet Union.\n\nHelped by his form in international competition, Van Basten had an excellent season in 1988-89, winning European Footballer of the Year and scoring nineteen goals in Serie A as well as helping Milan demolish Steaua Bucharest to win the European Cup. In 1989-90 he was Capocannoniere (Serie A's leading goal scorer) and Milan defended their European Cup successfully. The Dutch national side had a very poor World Cup in 1990, finally going out to West Germany in the second round.\n\nMilan's 1990-91 European season was ruined in the semi-final against Olympique Marseille and the club received a year long ban from European football. Van Basten had been banned for four matches earlier in the competition following a cynical elbowing offense. Domestically the club's season was also disappointing and Sampdoria won the scudetto. Van Basten fell out with Milan's manager Arrigo Sacchi and Berlusconi sacked Sacchi to placate him. Undistracted by European football in 1991-92 and managed by Fabio Capello, Milan did not lose a single game in the league and won the championship, Van Basten scoring 25 goals and becoming Capocannoniere again. Internationally the Dutch went out of Euro 92 to Denmark in a penalty shootout, Van Basten missing one.\n\nMilan stretched their unbeaten run into the 1992-93 season, going 58 matches in total before they lost a game. Van Basten played exceptionally well in the early part of the season and was voted European Player of the Year for a third time before his troublesome ankle injury recurred in a game against Ancona. Van Basten underwent another in a series of operations and returned to Milan for the final few domestic games before they lost the Champions League final to Marseille. The final was Van Basten's final game for Milan; despite enormous effort, he was unable to recover from his injuries.\n\n[edit]\nCoaching career\nVan Basten officially left Milan in 1995 and retired from football, stating he would never try management. However, he eventually realized that football was too important for him and successfully took a course with the Royal Netherlands Footba	sports

Who would the fans be rooting for ? \n\nAnd if your first choice is Mcgwire ; doesnt race or ethnicity come to play here ? ( And dont tell me Mcgwire is clean ; if you think Bonds took Steroids why wouldnt you think Mcgwire did ) Well contrary to public opinion...I'd pick Bonds. First I'd like to say I'm from Atlanta and have never lived near or in California and I'm not a huge Giants fan. That being said, lets take Canseco out because he is a snake who is profiting on ratting out players for doing exactly what he did. I wish nothing good for Canseco! That being said it's down to McGuire and Bonds. Assuming they both took steroids(which is a pretty safe assumption) lets look at their raw numbers. Bonds has 7 MVPs, 8 gold glove awards, and 13 all star games...all while batting .300 and having over 500 stolen bases. McGuire on the other hand has 0 MVPs, 1 gold glove, and 12 all star appearances...all while batting .263 and having 12 stolen bases. \nWhile people may not like Bonds as much...I think he is a much better athlete the McGuire and I'd be rooting for him to beat Ruth over the other 2 guys.	sports

You can never "catch" the ball, but in most levels of volleyball, you can contact the ball with any part of your body (including the foot).  \nThe only level that does not allow this is High School.

Not to blow my own horn, but i predicted they would lose to Cincy and to WVU. Another person on here said they were better than OSU because they beat the only common opponent (Illinois) by a larger margin. OSU crushed Cincinnatti by the way. I just don't see why they were so hyped, when earlier in the year they only beat South Florida and North Carolina by two points each game. \nHow far do you think they will drop in the polls? My guess is 22, or 23. They have had a decent team for two years now and went to a bowl last year. You have to remember where they were only 3 years ago and where they are now: a Top 25 Team. Were they a little overraated at #7 (depending on which poll you believe) maybe but are they a legit Top 25 team: YES!!!!! And i'm no fan but they did beat Louisville which is no pushover. I think they will drop out of the top 10 but not as low as 22 . I say 14.	sports

Tony Romo took his job.\n\nAndrew Walter - Ummm....No.  You would probably get more points if you didn't play anyone.\n\nSeneca Wallace - Might not be a bad pick either.  Has better weapons than Huard, and more mobility.  And, Alexander is going to be out for another week, so they might end up throwing more.\n\nTrent Green - Concussion.  Going to be out at least one more week.\n\nJoey Harrington - Stay away from.  Has decent weapons in Miami, but no O-line to speak off.\n\nJohnson wouldn't be bad to stay with.  He doesn't put up great numbers, but he is solid.  Go with either Huard or Wallace.  Wallace has better receivers, but Huard will be able to work the play-action pass better with LJ in the backfield.	sports

how do i finish my bmx? ive built a bmx and finished it all, but then my chain kept falling off ,so a freind told me i need to replace the axle because the rear wheel wobled,  so i took the axle out.\nwould a mountain bike axle fit on to my bmx its a 20" frame?\nand what would you sudgest i do? cheers pete Pete,\n\nFirst, you need to make sure the chain tension is appropriate. you should be able to move the chain a half an inch up or down. \nIf there's too much slack, the chain will of course fall off if you hit any bumps. Try loosening up your rear wheel axle nuts and pulling back on the wheel. Don't forget to make sure the wheel is straight in the dropouts before you tighten the nuts again. Also, check to make sure the wheel has equal spacing up at the joints of the chain and seat stays. \n\nThis is the other issue. If your wheel is crooked, that means your cassette is crooked too, which would create sort of a twisting effect, causing the chain to pop off. Just make sure your wheel is as straight has possible, and the chain is relatively tight (half an inch of slack maximum), and you should be good. \n\nI wouldn't suggest putting a mountain bike axle in your hub. It's not going to be very cost-effective, and if your BMX bike is high-quality brand (not Next, Huffy, Magna, Vertical, etc...), chances are it has a 14 mm axle. The mountain bike axle won't fit in your dropouts correctly, which is a safety hazard, plus you could potentially damage your bike.\n\nIf none of this works, take a look at the teeth on both your rear cassette and your front chainring; if even one tooth is bent, that could cause your chain to fall off. Sometimes you can get lucky and bend the teeth back with a small pipe wrench, but in many cases the parts will need to be replaced.\n\nHope that helps some, Pete!	sports

Gymnastics Anyone?? does anyone like gymnastics?? i love bars and floor and i am in level 3 and i have 10 medals and 6 trophys!! if you answer this question and do gymnastics can you tell me what level and the amount of medals and trophys!! I am in level 4, have 12 medals & 12 trophy.\n\nGymnastics is a sport involving the performance of sequences of movements requiring physical strength, flexibility, and kinesthetic awareness, such as handsprings and handstands.\n\nIt developed from fitness and beauty practices used by the ancient Greeks, including skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and circus performance skills. In ancient times the term implied exercise taken in the nude in the context of a gymnasium, a venue for intellectual and physical education.\n\nIt is often considered a dangerous sport, as the difficult acrobatic maneuvers often performed on equipment high above the ground puts the athlete at risk of serious injury.\n\nDisciplines\nModern gymnastics, as regulated by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique incorporates six distinct disciplines:\n\nArtistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics and Women's Artistic Gymnastics) \nRhythmic gymnastics \nSports aerobics \nSports acrobatics \nTrampolining \nGeneral gymnastics \nPower Tumbling \n\nOf these disciplines, the two sub-disciplines of artistic and rhythmic gymnastics are the best known, having been part of Summer Olympic Games competitions. Individual Trampoline has been included in the Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nThe discipline of rhythmic gymnastics is competed only by women (although there is a new version of this discipline for men being pioneered in Japan, see Men's rhythmic gymnastics), and involves the performance of five separate routines with the use of five apparatus — ball, ribbon, hoop, clubs, rope — on a floor area, with a much greater emphasis on the aesthetic rather than the acrobatic. Rhythmic routines are scored out of a possible 20 points.\n\nSports aerobics  \nSports aerobics involves the performance of routines by individuals or pairs, emphasizing strength, flexibility, and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills. Routines are performed on a small floor area and generally last 60-90 seconds, being judged out of a total of 10 points. \n\nTrampolining  \nTrampolining consists of four events, individual, synchronized, double mini trampoline and power tumbling. Only individual trampoline is included in the Olympics. Individual routines involve a build-up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height, followed by a sequence of ten leaps without pauses during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial tumbling skills. Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points. Additional points (with no maximum) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves. Synchronized trampoline is similar except that both competitors must perform the routine together and marks are awarded for synchronicity. Double mini trampoline involves a smaller trampoline with a run-up, two moves are performed and the scores marked in a similar manner to individual trampoline. Tumbling involves a sprung track, athletes must perform a succession of tumbling moves and are marked on difficulty and execution.\n \nGeneral Gymnastics  \nGeneral gymnastics, sometimes called group gymnastics, enables people of all ages and abilities to participate in performance troupes of 6 to more than 150 athletes. They perform synchronized, choreographed routines. Troupes may be all one gender or mixed. There are no age divisions in general gymnastics. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. \n\nArtistic Gymnastics  \nArtistic Gymnastics is usually divided into Men's (MAG) and Women's Gymnastics (WAG), each group doing different events; Men compete on Vault, Parallel Bars, the Pommel Horse, the Rings, the High Bar, and on the Floor, while women compete on Floor, Uneven Bars, Vault, and Beam. Though routines performed on each event may be short, they are physically exhausting and push the gymnast's strength, flexibility, endurance and awareness to th	sports

In your opinion: Which NHL team got the ugliest logo and colors? My vote goes for: Columbus Blue Jackets (even the name of the team lol) and Carolina Hurricanes (reminds me of a Tide laundry detergent box) Colors: The Ducks\nLogo: The Sabres\n\nAnd whoever said Chicago as the ugliest colors and/or logo, you have got to be kidding me.

Is it fair to drop Ganguli from Indian Cricket Team??  I dont think its fair because just bcoz of a short bad patch of form( those fights between coach and captain shud never be brought in front) earlier he is not being given the chance.

What is best for Mike Sweeney's career? I'm a huge Royals fan and also a huge Mike Sweeney fan.He has played his whole career with the Royals and is known to be one of the nicest players in the game.This is the forth year in a row that he has spent significant time on the disabled list.He is signed through 2007.There has been talk of trying to trade him, making him some kind of coach, and even letting him just retire early.He is a huge fan favorite in Kansas City so what will be best for the fans and for him? Sweeney has been one of my favorites and was a permanent fixture on my fantasy team due to his talent and being one heck of a great guy.  Unfortunately he is also very fragile and is constantly acking with one thing or another.  I don't think many teams are willing to pay his price tag, and eventually will end up signing for a very low contract full of performance incentives or as a role (read bench) player.	sports
Do you guys think De la Hoya will actually retire "if" he loses? He was on Jay Leno Monday night and announced he would retire if he loses vs Mayorga. It's not the first time he said that and kept on fighting. Altought i don't think he will lose, will he really retire? I find it hard to believe that. If he lost to Mayorga, he would probably set a rematch for September 16th. He was looking forward to fighting Pretty Boy Floyd then, but how could he resist going out with a vengeance? ;D\n\nI do believe he's going to retire soon, but unless Mayorga finds a way to completely dominate Oscar (which I doubt), I see De la Hoya sticking to that one last fight he has planned.	sports
