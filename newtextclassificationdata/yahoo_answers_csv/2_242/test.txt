how many molecules are in 1.00g of iodomethane? how many molecules are in 1.00g of iodomethane?\nwhat is the relative mass of methane?\nhow many moles of methane are there in4g of pure methane? I'm not going to give you the answers, because you can really work them out for yourself.\n\nYou need to work out the molecular weight, which is just the sum of the atomic weights in the appropriate proportions. Say that works out to be 100 for a particular molecule: that means that 100g of the substance contains 1 mole (6.022 x 10^23) molecules - so 1 gram contains one hundredth of that, or 6.022 x 10^21 molecules.\n\nApply that to each of the molecules in your questions, and you'll be home and dry.	science

What are some interesting facts about meningitis???????? i need answers quick plz , to who evers reads this answer no matter what , and plz give me the symptoms if u know them The classical symptoms of meningitis are headache, neck stiffness and photophobia (intolerance of bright light); the trio is called meningism. Fever and chills are often present, along with myalgia. An altered state of consciousness or other neurological deficits may be present depending on the severity of the disease. In meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia, a petechial rash may appear. A lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually indicated to determine the cause and direct appropriate treatment.\n\nConvulsions and hydrocephalus are known complications of meningitis. If symptoms occur see a doctor urgently as treatment needs to occur early to be effective.	science

Since diamonds are composed of almost pure carbon,would ash and water be a good way to clean the diamond??? Thanks for your info....Tom Science 4 First of all, ash isn't pure carbon.  It contains particulates of unburnt material, etc.  Secondly, it doesn't matter what the cleaning agent is made out of that counts.  Just because diamond is carbon, doesn't mean you have to clean it with carbon.  What you need to find out is whether or not a particular agent will dissolve whatever you have on the stone, plus not dissolve the stone itself.  Acetone, alcohol, or most other solvents will do this just fine.\n\nHope this helps.	science

do you think our IQ level is in our genes? I mean, say the first time you take an IQ test, and it is determined that you have an IQ of 102, does that mean that you were born with an IQ of 102, and that it's in your genes? Or does it depend on your life style, education...? Intellingence is thought to be influenced by many factors, genetics being but one of them.\n\nObviously, injury or disease can damage the brain, and result in lower intelligence, as can other factors such as malnutrition.\n\nAlso important are the conditions encountered during early childhood development.  The brain has certain "critical windows", when it is most open for developing language, reasoning, spatial relationships, and other skills.  Children who do not receive the proper stimulus during these windows find it difficult, if not impossible to learn the skills in later life.	science

general mechanism of action and routes of adminestration of Local Anaestheasia?  There are several theories put forward by which a local anesthetic  agent works. The commonly accepted theory is the "Specific Receptor Theory".. The local anesthetic agent binds to certain receptors on the cell membrane and exert their action.The sequence of action are as follows:\n * Displacement of calcium ions from nerve receptor site..\n * Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site..\n * Blockade of sodium channel.\n * Decrease in sodium conduction.\n * Depression of rate of electrical depolarization.\n * Failure to achieve threshold potential level.\n * Lack of development of propagated action potential.\n * Conduction blockade.\n  \n   As for as the routes are concerned, LA can be given as:\n * topical application.\n * infiltration under the skin or mucous membrane to block peripheral nerves.\n * intramuscular to block a nerve, e.g. mandibular nerve   block for extraction of lower molars.\n * intrathecal ( into the spinal cavity), e.g.as in cesarean section.	science
how are foundations for bridges stuck on the river beds? I mean in the water, how is the concrete poured , if it's always wet There are many ways to do this. \n\n1. Engineers pour the concrete into metal forms, and remove the forms when the concrete dries.\n\n2. Another way is to temporarily divert the whole river through a side channel or tunnel, but I think this is usually done only when they want to build a dam across it.\n\n3. They can put a temporary barrier across a part of the river to build the foundations there, then build another temporary barrier across a different part of the river to build the next foundations, and so on till all the foundations are build.  \n\n4. Some rivers flow seasonally, so they just wait till it is not flowing to build the bridge.	science

What evidence suggsts that oxygen delivery to tissues has been compromised after total hip replacement?  To answer your question I really need to know more specifically what you are asking.\n \nDo you mean compromise acutely during the operation or chronically in the post-op setting? Do you mean compromise to all the tissues of the body or only those tissues at or distal to the operative site.\n\nIn general signs of inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) under anesthesia depend on the severity of the hypoxia. Lactic acidosis would be evident via blood gas analysis. As the hypoxia progressed changes in the EKG would begin to manifest ultimately leading to cardiac arrest. Signs of severe hypoxia that had occured in the operative setting include possible changes (temporary or permanent) to every organ system including:\n\nneuro:loss of mental capacity, seizures,blindness\nPulmonary: post hypoxic syndrome \nGI: bowel ischemia \nGU: renal failure, ATN\nHepatic: failure, elevated transaminases\nCardiac: EKG changes, muscle necrosis\n\nOngoing compromise of oxygen delivery in the post-op setting (in the absense of pulmonary disease) is of course a function of blood flow. The signs and symptoms of inadequate blood flow also depend on the severity of the same. If mild- delayed healing might manifest. If severe- changes in color, temperature, cap refill, and pulse volume would manifest as well as possible numbness or tingling distal to the site. \n\nThe problem is that most hip replacements occur in the senior population. The same population that may already have some level of cardiopulmonary impairment to begin with. Most noteably if they have COPD, or they smoke, or they are overweight, or have poor diets or genes that have left them with partially clogged blood vessels.	science
What is the function of the glottis?  The space between the vocal cords is called the glottis. As the vocal cords vibrate, the resulting vibration produces a "buzzing" quality to the speech, called voice or voicing.\n\nSounds production involving only the glottis is called glottal. English has a voiceless glottal fricative spelled "h". In many accents of English the glottal stop (made by pressing the folds together) is used as a variant allophone of the phoneme /t/ (and in some dialects, occasionally of /k/ and /p/); in some languages, this sound is a phoneme of its own.	science

What are the polarity differences that occur in a soap molecule?  Soap is polarized at one end, and non-polar at the other.\n\nYou know how water and oil don't mix?  That's because water is polar and oil is non-polar.  As a rule, "Like dissolves like."  So polar things dissolve in water, non polar things dissolve in oil.  We call polar things "hydrophilic" ("water-loving"), while non-polar things can be called either hydrophobic ("water-fearing") or lipophilic ("oil-loving").  Since oil and water don't dissolve well in one another, they tend to separate from eachother.\n\nSoap is special because it is hydrophilic at one end and hydrophobic at the other.  This makes it act as a bridge between the two.  Oil gets washed away with soap because the soap molecule will orient itself around little droplets of oil with the hydrophobic end in the oil, leaving the hydrophilic end facing the water.  This allows the water to carry away the small droplets of oil packaged in a coat of soap, and hence cleans you by removing things not normally soluble in water.	science

Partial Pressure and mass? In a mixture of   Ne   and   H2   gases, the partial pressure of   Ne   is   0.180 atm.   The total pressure is   0.410 atm.   The temperature is   28.0oC.   If the total volume of the gas mixture is   421 mL,   what is the mass of   H2   in grams? The partial pressure of H2 is just the total pressure minus the partial pressure of Ne.  The ratio of the H2 part press and total press gives the mole fraction of H2.  \n\nNow just calculate the number of moles in your 421 mL using the ideal gas equation  PV = nRT.  Solve for n, multiply this by the mole fraction of H2 to get the moles of H2, then multiply this by the mole weight of H2.\n\nI'll let you do the math.	science
Mass percent using two algebraic equations? A sample of a mixture containing only sodium chloride and potassium chloride has a mass of 6.4100g. When this sample is dissolved in water and excess silver nitrate is added, a white precipitate (silver chloride) forms. After filtration and drying, this precipitate has the mass 12.7559g.\nWhat is the mass percentage of sodium chloride in the mixture? Your two basic algebraic equations are:\nmoles Na + moles K = moles Cl \n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (g Cl-) = 6.4100 g\n\nThe mass of the final precipitate means that there are 7.50921 x 10-2 mol of chloride ions present in the initial mixture.\nSee:\nmol Cl = mol AgCl = g AgCl/MW AgCl = 12.7559/169.87 = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nThe mass of the chloride component of the starting materials is then determined by:\n\ng Cl = MW Cl x mol Cl = (7.50921 x 10-2 mol) x (35.45 g/mol) = 2.662 g\n\nPlug that back into the second eqn and you get:\n\n(g Na+) + (g K+) + (2.662 g) = 6.4100 g\nor\n(g Na+) + (g K+) = 3.748 g\n\nConvert back to moles and plug that into the first equation and you get:\n\nmoles Na + moles K = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\nmoles Na + ((g K+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\nor\n((g Na+) / (22.99 g/mol)) + ((3.748 - g Na+) / (39.1 g/mol)) = 7.50921 x 10 -2 mol\n\nAnd now solve for g Na + \n\nDivide that by 3.748 g and you're there!	science

Who loves science? Okay, I have a science question.  Why do frogs have so many more eggs than chickens? Like the above person said, the more eggs you spit out, the more likely there is of some of them surviving to adulthood. It also depends on the development of the species. Chickens are relatively developed in comparison to frogs (tadpoles) when hatched, so more energy is put into each egg and ensuring its survival (the hen incubates the egg). Most frogs however, lay a mass of eggs and leave them to their own defences. \nTry and compare some animals that lay eggs and the state of development of the offspring and that gives you a pretty good understanding.	science

What effect do u think this has on the bird populations of the local ecosystem? Read this first! Some people place bird feeders in their yards. "It's safe to say that feeders are more important to the people who maintain them than to the birds that use them. For people, bird feeders are a great way to connect with nature and enjoy close-up views of some of nature's most colorful and agile creatures. For birds, feeders merely supplement their normal intake of food. Even birds that regularly visit feeders obtain only a small percentage of their overall diet from them. However, research on black-capped chickadees has shown that chances of surviving a harsh winter may be greater for birds that have access to feeders. It's likely that this is true for other birds as well."	science

what is meant by corriolis principle?  Christina is wrong. When you drop something, it is already rotating along with the earth, and continues to do so as it falls, for there is nothing to stop it.\n\nIn fact, the real Coriolis effect DEPENDS on the fact that an object dropped, or thrown, or shot out of a gun, is rotating along with the earth. Consider this. A spot on the equator is rotating eastward at about 1,000 miles per hour. Places north of that are rotating eastward slower than that. Places near the north pole are rotating eastward very slowly. A circle around the north pole having a circumfrence of 24 miles is rotating eastward at 1 mile per hour.\n\nIf you position a gun on the equator, the bullet contained therein is travelling eastward at 1,000 miles per hour, along with the gun. If you shoot the gun northward, the bullet wlil travel over land that is travelling eastward slower than 1,000 miles per hour. The bullet, however, will continue to travel eastward at 1,000 miles per hour because there is nothing to stop it. The bullet will appear to have an eastward force applied, but there is no such force.	science

2 percent incline after one mile?  Not sure what you're asking here - 2% incline means that the height you go up is 2% of the horizontal distance (not the slope distance) travelled.\n\nSo 2% will mean for every 100m horizontal you travel - you will go up 2m.\n\nSo are you saying you have travelled 1 mile horizontally - in which case you will move up 0.02 miles (or using pythagoras' theorem you could get the actual slope distance travelled d² = 1² + 0.02², which gives 1.0002 miles)\n\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile vertically - in which case you will have moved 50 miles horizontally (since there are 50 2%'s in 100%) (or do you want the actual slope distance travelled, d² = 1² + 50², which gives 50.01 miles)\n\nOr are you saying you have travelled 1 mile up a 2% slope.  In which case we need to use pythagoras' theorem backwards to get the horizontal and vertical parts.  The horizontal we can call x and the vertical is 2% of this, ie 0.02x.\n\nSo we get:  1² = x² + (0.02x)²\n\n1 = x² + 0.0004x²\n1 = 1.0004x²\nx² = 1/1.0004 - 0.99960\nx = 0.9998\n\nSo we will have travelled 0.998 miles horizontally and 2% of this (which is 0.019996 miles) vertically.	science

Explain the actions of the physiological buffer system? (details below)? there are 3 physiological buffer systems:\n\n1. the bicarbonate buffer system\n2. the phosphate buffer system\n3. the protein buffer system All of them stabilize pH (concentration of H+).\n\n1. Carbonic acid (weak acid) dissociates partly bothsides:\nH2O + CO2 <=> H2CO3 <=> HCO3-, H+. Whatever you add, the equilibrium of this reaction shifts to one or another direction and H+ concentration of the solution (acidity) remains the same.\n\na) If you add acid ( more H+ then), a disbalance occurs. Excessive H+ react with HCO3- and a larger quantity of H2CO3 is formed. And it dissociates to water and CO2, neutralising addition of some acid.\n\nb) When a base is added, a part of H+ is removed (H+ and OH- form water, which is neutral). Then also a disbalance occurs, which causes CO2 combination with water, formation of H2CO3 and appearance of new H+. \n \n2. Na2HPO4 <=> 2Na+ + HPO4/2- + H+ <=>  H2PO4-  \nAnalogically, a shift occurs when adding acid or base, neutralising their effect:\na) HCl + Na2HPO4 => NaH2PO4 + NaCl \nb) NaOH + NaH2PO4 --> Na2HPO4 + H2O \n\n3. Different proteins act as buffers. Hemoglobin (located in red blood cells) buffer is one of strongest. Imidazole groups of histidine residues of this protein are most significant for this effect.\n\nHemoglobin without O2 <=> reduced hemoglobin \nReduced hemoglobin takes on H+, decreasing amount of free H+ in solution and the solution becomes not so acid.	science

In the northern hemisphere this is on 21 or 22 December, in the southern hemisphere it's on 21 or 22 June.\n\nThe summer solstice is the day when the days are the longest (on 21 or 22 June in the northern hemisphere and 21 or 22 December in the southern).\n\nSo, on the solstices the length of the day and the altitude of the sun (at noon) are the maximum or the minimum compared to all the other days of the year.\n\nAn equinox is when the sun passes over the equator, which happens twice every year, around March 21 and September 23.  On those two days the night and the day have equal length on every location in the world.	science

Did Descartes really said that Pascal has too much vacuum in his head?  Yes.\n\nSince 1646 Pascal began a series of experiments on atmospheric pressure. By 1647 he had proved to his satisfaction that a vacuum existed. Descartes visited Pascal on 23 September. His visit only lasted two days and the two argued about the vacuum which Descartes did not believe in. Descartes wrote, rather cruelly, in a letter to Huygens after this visit that Pascal had too much vacuum in his head.\n\nIn August of 1648 Pascal observed that the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height and deduced that a vacuum existed above the atmosphere. Descartes wrote to Carcavi in June 1647 about Pascal's experiments saying: "It was I who two years ago advised him to do it, for although I have not performed it myself, I did not doubt of its succes"\n\nIn October 1647 Pascal wrote New Experiments Concerning Vacuums which led to disputes with a number of scientists who, like Descartes, did not believe in a vacuum.\n\nRene Descartes (1596-1650) \nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662)	science
Should there be guidelines regarding Q&As about medical conditions discussed here? I've only just joined Answers this week but have noticed the crazy number of people that ask questions about about medical conditions.\n\nObviously we are all just trying to be helpful but what if wrong and unfounded opinions are taken for fact? \n\nCould this be a disaster waiting to happen? I've been thinking the same thing. Because of the wacky answers I've seen on this site, I have spent the last few on-call nights directing people to get proper treatment. \n\nI think this section is a disaster waiting to happen.

After whom is Mount Everest named and why?  The mountain was given its English name by Andrew Waugh, the British surveyor-general of India. With both Nepal and Tibet closed to foreign travel, he wrote:\n\n…I was taught by my respected chief and predecessor, Colonel Sir Geo. Everest to assign to every geographical object its true local or native appellation. … But here is a mountain, most probably the highest in the world, without any local name that we can discover, whose native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal.… In the meantime the privilege as well as the duty devolves on me to assign…a name whereby it may be known among citizens and geographers and become a household word among civilized nations.\n\nHence Waugh chose to name the mountain after George Everest, first using the spelling Mont Everest, and then Mount Everest.	science

Using conceptual physics to support religon? My beliefs are pretty much a mix of methodism/deism/quantum physics, and i believe that your perception of the world, its gods, and your ideas about the afterlife and the state of the universe will determine what you percieve as your afterlife.  In quantum physics, time does not exist.  Also, in order to exist, something must be observed.  As time does not exist, and the perception of time is simply our minds viewing the different probabilities the world may exist in.  Therefore, all people are both alive and dead.  In order to observe ourselves and observe others, we must exist.  As something cannot both exist and not exist, only change form or be transfered between dimensions, the sentience that inhabits our bodies must persist after death for us to observe our lives, as both life and death occur simultaniously according to this worldview.  \n\nTherefore, there must be something beyond death.\n\nYour thoughts? Nice ideas, but do they keep you up at night? I prefere to think of life as something that may not last, so I go ahead and enjoy it as much as possible. If there is an afterlife, yippee. If not, then I've spent the time I had well. I sleep well at night.	science

link to the electronic circuit design for control of oscillations in real life phenomena? can neone provide a link to a circuit which controls oscillations of a pendulum or an oscillator in real life?for example in a mechanical swing. Not to a pendulum but to control oscillations in a circuit sense, on ecould use a phase lock loop (pll).  Its whole life revolves around using a reference oscillator, locking onto it and outputting a new oscillation of frequency f or some multiplier of f.\nThe major components are as follows\n1) Phase Detector:  It determines if you are locked or not\n2) Charge pump: Produces an up or down control signal depending on the output of the Phase Detector to either speed up or down f\n3)Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO):  Takes the up/down control signal from the Charge Pump and produces a new f that is either faster or slower.  This is the output of your new oscillator.\n4)Feedback loop: Taken from the VCO, it is compared with the reference oscillator you started with and determines if the two are locked.  If they are, you have a locked pll and can know that the output from the VCO is a good clean clock.\n\nThis is a reeeeaaaallll basic overview.  Some pll designer will probably come in and correct me!	science

how do you split water? science project Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction or process in which a molecule is split into two parts by reacting with a molecule of water, which has the chemical formula H2O. One of the parts gets an OH from the water molecule and the other part gets an H from the water.\n\nWhen performed using electric current, the process is called electrolysis\n\nOne important use of electrolysis is to produce hydrogen. The reaction that occurs is\n\n    2H2O(aq) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)\n\nIn the future, this could play a central role in shifting our society over to a reliance on hydrogen as an energy carrier for powering electric motors and internal combustion engines. (See hydrogen economy.) Electrolysis of water can be achieved in a simple hands-on project, where electricity from a battery or low voltage DC power supply (eg computer power supply 5v rail) is run into a cup of water (in practice a saltwater solution or other electrolyte will need to be used otherwise no result will be observed). Using platinum electrodes, hydrogen gas will be seen to bubble up at the cathode, and oxygen will bubble at the anode. Using any other electrode for the anode however, the oxygen will react with the anode instead of being released as a gas. For example using iron electrodes in a sodium chloride solution electrolyte, iron oxide will be produced at the anode, which will react to form iron hydroxide. When producing large quantites of hydrogen, this can significantly gunge up the electrolytic cell - which is why iron is not used for commercial electrolysis.\n\nThe energy efficiency of water electrolysis varies widely. Some report 50–70%, while others report 80–94%. These values only refer to the efficiency of converting electrical energy into hydrogen's chemical energy. The energy lost in generating the electricity is not included. For instance, when considering a power plant that converts the heat of nuclear reactions into hydrogen via electrolysis, the total efficiency is more like 25–40%.	science

Among the variety of humans, are there any different species? If another meaning for race is actually "sub-species", then does that mean that there are many kinds of homo sapiens sapiens? No.  We're all Homo sapien sapiens.

Just wondering since they tend not to be so big on environmental issues...\n\n____________\nCarter, FYI the biological species concept definition of a species (the one you attempted to apply to humans) isn't actually used anywhere outside of a high school classroom.  Lions and tigers and interbreed (and produce fertile offspring), as can wolves and cyotes.  However, I don't think anyone would argue that lions and tigers are the same species.  You've arrived at the correct conclusion, but for the wrong reasons.\n\nOh, and Homo sapien is two words, although the proper name for modern humans is actually Homo sapien sapien.\n\n_________\n>>>"put it on the endangered species list" as in, genocide, \n\nWhat???  That doesn't make sense.  The endangered species list is a list of species we're protecting, not species we're trying to eliminate.  Putting a species on the endangered species list make it illegal to kill members of that species under most circumstances.\n\nTo answer you question about genocide, however, what stops genocide now?  I don't see where it would be any different if we were talking about a group that is officially a separate species.  Although, species being driven to extinction or "exterminated" is usually look upon as a *bad* thing, so I don't see where their being a separate species is an inherent justification for genocide, although I think it would be human nature to use it as such.\n\n\n_______\nThanks for pointing that out, Calimecita, I went back and capitalized the genus names.

Biology or Zoology Degree? I'm going to start school soon and plan on studying Biology. I love animals and absolutely think they are very interesting to learn about. Now my question is should I continue on recieving my bachelors in Biology or Zoology? I know a BA in Zoology isn't very useful when trying to get jobs as apposed to BA in Biology. But I certainly think I'd be more interested in Zoology. Any Zoologist out there have adivce for me? Also what jobs have you gotten with either degree? zori there isn't really any difference between the two. Some universities have only a biology department, while some will have the disciplines divided up into zoology, botany, micro, etc. And now there are molecular biology departments. What matters is the courses you take, and that will depend on what you are interested in. Being in a zoology department - or in a program where that is the department that will grant your degree shouldn't preclude you from taking courses in botany and micro, etc. In fact they may well insist on it. I have an undergraduate degree from a biology department, a master's from a bio department and a PhD from a zoology department. I studied whatever I wanted, didn't think about what the degree was going to say and nobody else did. When looking for a job, your coursework and experience will do the talking not the department or degree name.\n\nGood luck - good to have another biologist/zoologist joining the team!	science

He also never went inside of me, he was just rubbing "down there"\n\nWell, I got my full period three days later (on Sept. 15) and got my period again on (although it was late like 2-3 days) October 16th. Usually, I spot around ovulation, but this month I didn't. My breasts hurt a lot and stuff, and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated (Oct. 31st) I should have my period next week some time, if everything is "normal"\n\nThe question is, is there any way that I could still be pregnant? I am SO worried, I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head. I understand I am not ready for this stuff. Any help is appreciated. I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant!

For more on this topic, read the article Is Masturbation Addictive?(http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/addict.html).\n\nHow can I masturbate less often, or quit altogether?\nIt's tough; it takes a lot of will power. It can be done, especially if you're driven by very strong religious feelings. However, JackinWorld's position is that it's not worth it. We think you should enjoy the harmless pleasures your body can provide.\n\n\n\n\nConnection between ejaculation frequency and prostate health \nhttp://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/4961.html\n\nQUESTION:\nI have been coming across articles on the connection between masturbation, ejaculation, and overall health. I was very surprised about this article from the Cancer Council Victoria in Australia . It was a study that confirmed that ejaculation frequency is important for a healthy prostate. The protective effect was most significant in men in their twenties who ejaculated on average 7 or more times per week. It compared this against same-age men who ejaculated less than 3 times per week. I made a New Year's resolution to pay attention to my body and to ejaculate at least once a day. I feel much better for it and my penis strength and sexual urge has increased immensely. I feel balanced. After a year, I can't imagine going back to my old repressed frequency and probably couldn?t keep from cumming for a whole day if I tried now. Why aren?t people made aware of this need? After getting used to daily +, I often have the urge to do it even more, but hold back. Are there any physical problems with over ejaculating? \n\nANSWER:\nWhat a fabulous New Year’s resolution to pay attention to your body!  Your efforts are worth applauding, as being in tune with yourself and your new masturbation schedule seems to have paid off, as you note that you feel “balanced” and “much better for it.”  Happily, no physical problems are associated with over-ejaculating, so don’t worry about giving in to the natural urge to enjoy and pleasure yourself more often.  You clearly have a strong awareness of the positive effects of masturbation on your body, so go ahead and experiment with masturbation frequency – in this way, you can determine what frequency feels best for you and your regular routine.\n\nYou also ask why people aren’t made aware of the “need” to masturbate often.  Good question – especially in light of the study’s findings that frequent ejaculation helps reduce the risk of prostate cancer.  Unfortunately, self-stimulation – as with most sexual acts – is often viewed as shameful, dirty, immoral, and all sorts of other negative adjectives.  Wouldn’t it be great if masturbation could be seen as the healthy, enjoyable, and beneficial activity it really is, openly talked about and (gasp!) endorsed?  Perhaps one day it will be – with more people like you who are open-minded and bold enough to talk about it in a positive light.  \n\nEnjoy – and pass that article along to friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, and anybody and everybody else!	health

Do you work in a mental health facility or do you know someone who does? is their a slang term for when the orderlies rush in and subdue a patient. I'm writing a story and I want an orderly's perspective... I know when they rush in sometimes, they may say "Get me 1 and 5!" or "2 and 10"... this means 1 mg. of Ativan (anti-anxiety drug) and 5 mg. of Hadol(antipsychotic drug).  That combo usually knocks 'em out.	health

You’re her mother, and I'm not saying force feeding her will work but your daughter not eating could just be her trying to manipulate you, so she just might need to be disciplined.

is it true introverts are prone to neuroses when compared to extroverts?  I guess you need to be careful when learning about the introverts. And I find this question is a bit offensive, because you measure us from an extrovert point of view.\n\nYou must know, that most of the psychological criteria just list the condition of certain mental illnesses or disorders. There are no clear words or lines in the DMS-IV-TR, says that we introverts are prone to suffer from Neurosis.\n\nI believe there are many different reasons behind for people to suffer depression, anxiety, low sense of self-worth, and so on. Having such conditions, doesn't really mean that a person suffering from Neurosis.\n\nWhy we introverts have similar conditions? Is just simply from excessive loneliness that we experiencing, which cause by incapable of making and keeping friends.	health
what is the best way to work out your inner thighz?  Do a variety of hip adduction exercises (movements that bring your leg sideways across your body). You can do this by squeezing a stability ball between your legs. You can use a multi-hip machine or hip adduction machine at the gym. You can also use a resistance band; connect one end securely around an object, such as the leg of a bed. Connect the other end around your ankle. Stand with your side to the place where the resistance band is connected and with the ankle that has the resistance closer to the wall (other foot out). Stand far enough from the wall so that there is some resistance to moving your foot. Now slowly bring your foot with the resistance band forward and across in front of your other leg (so your legs are crossed) and bring it back to regular standing position. Use the wall/bed/furniture for balance.	health

On Birth Control Pill and skipped a period? OK, I have been on Birth Control (Ortho Tricylen Lo) for 2 months now. This month, I have not gotten my period yet. I have taken the pill around the same time (4:00) daily, give or take 2 or 3 hours depending on my schedual that day.  My boyfriend uses the withdraw method, and has only 'come' in me once, consequently, it was right after my last period and on the day I started my new pack.  Now, I am not on my period, but have no other pregnancy signs, and I have a slight brown discharge, and feel as though I am going to get my period ... Could I be pregnant? Or, is this just a side affect of being on birth control for the first time? That is a very common reaction to birth control. I wouldn't worry too much unless you really think you are pregnant. Of course it's always best to be cautious; for $10 a pregnancy test wouldn't hurt.	health

Do you feel......? Hi friends,\n\n       I have a strange...(mmm what to say..?)...ok. ...I have a strange characteristic.....I can sense what is gonna happen in the future beforehand......for eg.....If something bad is gonna happen I can feel it in my mind, it makes me cry suddenly without any reason and something bad happens the very day...n' if something good is gonna happen I feel that too and it happens,,,,is it strange..should I consult any psycologist? Do any one of you feel like me....help me. Before I start, I want to give you the link for a support group so you have a solid place to hear others opinions and ask anything you want about the problem you have. Here is the link: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/psychic-ability/\n\nThere are 2 more sites for you. I am not psychic nor would I ever claim to be. I am not some weirdo who is into whitchcraft either. I am a 37 year old wife and stay-at-home mother of 3. I am however, a strong believer in the fact that some people just have abilities that I do not. I have watched, read, looked into this psychic thing. I also believe that for the most part, the psychic abilities can be "channeled" in a positive way. I have often read of people who have abilities as you said you do, learn how to turn that entire situation into good. You can learn to expand on the bad feelings you get and possibly get to a point where it doesn't just make you cry, you are able to see exactly what bad thing is going to happen and possibly stop it from happening. I see the psychic's all the time where they are called in by the police department to try and find missing people, solve crimes, many times solve murders. The psychic has to experience the pain that the murder victim went through but I don't know about you but I would do it every day of the week if I could help a family find their loved one, help solve a murder, help put a murderer or rapest behind bars so they can't hurt anyone else. Don't look at this as an all bad thing. I wish I had the ability because my main goal would be to help law enforcement as much as I could no matter how muh it hurt to do it. Look what the rewards would be...you could help keep a community safe and end the hell that a family of a victim had been in. I do have to also say BE CAREFUL THOUGH.... You can develop this so it's a good thing. There are scams all over though. Psychic's and people and web sites that claim to be able to "help" you develop your abilities are one of the highest scams out there. Read..READ...READ...I can't tell you what to do, I can only tell you what I would do. I would get books on the subject from my local library 1st. I would do all sorts of reading online but DO NOT PLEASE give anyone even a red cent online. Even on the sites I am sending you below...the second someone asks for any type of money be it membership fees, buy my book, donations for others who are also trying to sharpen their skills, or fees for them to teach you. After I read non-stop on the internet and from my library, I personally would look for free introductory or free session of any type in my local area (internet is a good place to find out about them). Then I would be looking to my local community college and take classes, as many classes as I could on the subject. That way, you are getting the knowledge at the rate YOU are comfortable with, if anything makes you uncomfortable at any time, you can just stop right in your tracks. Lastly, NOBODY IS RIPPING YOU OFF. It sounds to me as if you possibly could have abilities, you can direct them to where you want them, and not have such a negative effect coming from this but watch your back. For someone people, money is all that matters. They will claim they are wanted to help and teach but in reality, they have their hand in your pocket. I wish you the world of luck. I can be contacted via email by, I think just clicking on my log in name on yahoo ask /answer if you would like to. This is a subject that I have studied/read about for a few years now. If you have any questions that I can answer, feel free.	health

Why do people salivate while sleeping? Is there any remedy to stop it? I know people aged 35 doing it !? I know it about guys but not sure about gals that if they salivate during sleep or not.

I am a grown man drolling like a baby !! It is normal for someone who sleeps with their mouth open to drool.  We all do it.  You should try sleeping in a different position.  It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder.  It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist.  If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.	health

Would you confront someone you know has a disease and think they already know but aren't telling? I have a cousin who (from all I've learned) has cervical dystonia.  She has repetitive head movements and also the fingers on one hand stay contracted most of the time.  Her son has been diagnosed with the disease but it involves one leg only.  He's been treated with it for about 10 years.  Everyone knows he has it.  The mother who shows symptoms of cervical dystonia has never admitted she has it also.  (It would mean the son got it from her genes and that evidently is not wanted)\n\nKnowing she has it, should I confront her with it and urge her to seek medical help for her own case of dystonia?  Or do I just play dumb and act like I don't see the signs.  I want her to get help if there is something that can keep her from getting worse, but I don't want her mad at me either. Hello.\nI am a doctor with dystonia, and I have passed it along to at least one of my kids.  Your cousing could be helped, and should be helped; but she needs psych help with facing this stigmatized disorder.  Dystonia is a strange dz in that it causes great family shame.  I know this 1st hand as my wife is having a hard time facing our reality.  I have 3 other children who are at risk.  Tell your cousin you love her; give her some articles on Botox, and tell her that there are people risking their entire careers on creating new solutions for her and her son.        FYI, I have closed my cardiology practice to invent new treatments for movement disorder pts.  There is great potential to help your cousin and her son.  I am working on a form of gene therapy as well as a novel and noninvasive manner to rewire the abnormal brain circuitry.      Best of luck.  Ross	health

What's the best sunscreen?  There's no one brand that's the best - but you do want one with a UVA-blocking ingredient as well as a UVB-blocker.  UVB ones are easy to come by - they're in every sunscreen - it's the UVA ones that are more difficult to find.\n\nLook at the ingredients list - there are only THREE tried-and-true UVA blockers (no matter what the label says).\n\nAvobenzone (aka Parsol 1789)\nTitanium dioxide\nZinc oxide\n\nAvobenzone is a chemical block - it absorbs the sun's rays and basically neutralizes the effect chemically.  The bad part about Avobenzone is that it does degenerate over a period of a few hours, so you need to reapply fairly frequently.\n\nTitanium dioxide and zinc oxide are physical blocks - they reflect the sun's rays, so they don't ever hit your skin.  Unfortunately, if you have darker skin and are using a product in which the particles of titanium/zinc have not been micronized properly, these products can leave a whitish cast on your skin.\n\nThe best thing to do to find a good-quality ZO or TD sunscreen is to check labels and expect to pay about $10-$12 for a tube.  It may seem expensive but isn't your skin worth it?\n\n[If you live in Canada or Europe there is a newer sunscreen ingredient available called Meroxyl - it's VERY effective at blocking UVA and UVB rays when blended with Avobenzone in a product - L'Oreal's Ombrelle line has this combination and it's great.  It's what I use, but it's not available in the U.S. - yet.]	health

I'm on Quinapril and I have a horrible head cold.  I used to take Dayquill. What do I take now? I usually take OTC stuff for colds/allergies but I think the stuff I'm on now isn't supposed to be taken with OTC stuff.  What do I do to alleviate the sneezing, drippy nose, stuff head congestion? Take a hot bath, wrap yourself up in very heavy blankets (it will sweat your body out and release the toxins that are causing you to feel so badly). Drink hot herbal tea with lemon every hour or so. Avoid spicy food or cold drinks -anything that will aggravate it as sometimes colds can go to the throat too. Rest your head but sleep in an upright position so that you can rest easier. Get plenty of vitamin c and water. Honey also has some healing effects and can be good on warm toast. Soup is also perfect. But I don't recommend taking anything otc as nowadays they are having so many recalls (like the recent one on acetominiphin pain reliever pills). Just let it run its course and be sure to stay warm and keep your head and feet warm and dry. You'll feel better gradually but sleep, fuids, and rest are best.	health
what are cancer brain mets and do they hurt want info on this subject please?  If you are talking cancer with brain mets, this means that the cancer has spread to the brain area.  It may or may not hurt depending on the symptoms or where the cancer is first located in the body.  If there are tumors in the brain you may experience some headaches, vision changes, dizziness or balance problems, or neurological changes with numbness and tingling in the hands and feet or limbs of the body. It may have paralyzing limb changes, speech changes, memory changes, and stroke like symptoms as well.  This also depends on the staging of the cancer that the doctor decides with further testing, such as CT scans, MRI's and blood tests.  The mets ususally means metastasized, that it is more advanced and has originated in a different spot in the body to begin with.	health

Does tobacco itself have harmful elements? Cigarettes have a lot of thing added to them that are harmful, how about the tobacco plant itself? for example would be it bad if someone just smoked dryed out tobacco plant leaves? Good question, I think.  Nicotine is a physically addictive drug that acts as an euphoric and vasal-constrictor.  It can raise your blood pressure.  Tobacco also has tar and burning the leaves, burning ANYTHING gives off carbon monoxide.  Tar sticks to your lungs and gets in your blood.  It can cause body cells to turn into cancer cells.  Carbon monoxide makes it hard for your blood to carry oxygen.  So.... smoking the leaves is still dangerous.  Sorry.	health

I have M.E. I get income support (I was asked to choose between I.S and I.B- I chose the former because of the free NHS stuff). I also get DLA- middle care and high mobility. I also get blue badge/parking space at home and travel pass. \n\nAPPEAL!!! Get specialist help. A Welfare Rights Officer is who you need to see. I went to see one after being refused DLA for the third time to help me appeal and she went mad that I was refused after she read the medical report (which I requested a copy of). She also told me that the 2nd time I applied, the doctor who examined me was struck off and told me to appeal for that as well (as a late appeal). I won not only the appeal, but the backdated one too.\n\nGet to a Welfare Rights Officer now (they know what they are doing and seem to be feared by the DSS- they changed their mind about my recent appliction when I mentioned that I wanted all the info because I was going to see a Welfare Rights Officer). Its all very confusing. The DSS were at my appeal and were rude and scary and made me cry. \n\nBut just so you know, I don't think you can get Carers Allowance if you get DLA.

Do men get morning wood every morning?  Usually, but not EVERY morning. It is a morning erection that is naturally caused as the brains enters the REM-deep sleep phase. At this stage, the body's skeletal muscle structure relaxes and causes hypervasodilation in the capillaries of the body, resulting in said erection. The person has to be in the REM-deep sleep state.	health

to the doctors : is there a complete cure for reflux eosophagitis?? and irritated stomach? and how?  Still in medical school, but I'll give it a go.  Approximately 80% of people with esophagitis (esophageal irritation/inflammation) caused by gastric reflux have a non-progressive form that can be managed by  medications and lifestyle modification (losing weight if overweight; avoiding alcohol, chocolate, citrus juice, tomatoes, peppermint; avoiding large meals and waiting for 3 hours after eating before lying down; raising the head of your bed approximately 8 inches).  Medications used basically decrease the production of acid in your stomach and include things such as Pecid, Zantac, and Prevacid to name a few.  Antacids with meals are also a good idea.\n\nThere are a remaining 20% or so of people whose esophagitis will continue (despite medicaitons) to progress and cause permanent scarring which can increase a person's risk for esophageal cancer.  For those people, the best option is surgical.  Surgery consists of a procedure called a Nissen Fundoplication.  This can be done laparoscopically (camera with small holes, small instruments, small scars, quicker healing).  The procedure basically consists of wrapping the upper portion of the stomach partially around the esophagus.  What happens is that after a meal, the stomach fills up, causing the portion of stomach wrapped around the esophagus to tighten up a bit, creating a valve of sorts.  This prevents acid from refluxing into the esophagus.  Assuming all goes correctly, the procedure typically lasts 2-2.5 hours, you go home in 2 days, and you're back to normal more or less in 2-3 weeks.  ~92% of patients have resolution of symptoms.  No surgery is without it's complications,   so do some reading about it if you're considering.  In addition to "the usual" (bleeding, infection, anesthesia complications, etc.), it's always possible that the valve they make will be too tight and you won't be able to properly swallow your food.  Rare, but it happens.  \n\nAs for "irritated stomach", I would need more information to know what you mean precisely.  Hope this at least offers some answers to one of your questions.  Good luck to you.	health
Yellow dye # 5 ? --in Mountain Dew. Does Yellow #5 cause cancer? Doesn't Mountain Dew still contain Yellow # 5? I read LONG ago that Yel.#5 might cause cancer (bladder cancer). I've been hooked on Dew 22 yrs! any comments/advice, etc. Don't listen to these people. They would rather fool themselves into thinking that the FDA actually has their best interests at heart. The same FDA that passed Vioxx and the evil aspartame (phenalanyline) for use in "Nutrasweet".\n\nHere is what is known about "Yellow #5" (also see source):\n\nFD&C Yellow No.5; known to provoke asthma attacks (though the US FDA** do not recognise this) and urticaria (nettle rash) in children (the US FDA** estimates 1:10 000); also linked to thyroid tumours, chromosomal damage, urticaria (hives) and hyperactivity; tartrazine sensitivity is also linked to aspirin sensitivity; used to colour drinks, sweets, jams, cereals, snack foods, canned fish, packaged soups; banned in Norway and Austria	health

What are some causes for a bloody nose? I have never gotten a bloody nose before, but I've had a bunch just this year.  I had surgery on my sinuses last march, but the first time that I got one was this January.  It only bleeds on my right side, and afterwards my head hurts on that side.  It hurts for at least a day. well it could be because u have nasal polyps, bloody noses and headaches are common signs and symptoms.  poylps are just little outgrowths of tissue, you can get them anywhere in your body where there is tissue.  Another sign/symptom is snoring - ask your significant other if u snore at night.  but either way, u should get it looked at.  these types of polyps can be removed by nasal sprays or by outpatient surgery.  deffinatly get it looked at! (I wonder what u mean when u said u have sinus surgery last year)	health

Is there any personal trainers out there who could give me a few tips? I am 15, 135-140 pounds 5'5. I want to tone my stomach and thighs. I am not fat, just chubby. I don't want to lose weight necessarraly, just sculpt and tone. i dont have weights and hardly have time to do even an hour of workout. I also have a really hard time eating right b/c my parents won't buy me diet food. I need some easy tips so tone and sculpt within the next 2 months that won't cost hundreds of $'s. You are not overweight!!! You are an ideal weight for your height.  The best way to focus on your goal of toning is to pay attention to what you eat.  Eat a healthy diet of vegetables, chicken, fish, turkey and whole grains will help.  Do not starve yourself and do not eat too many greasy foods.  It is ok to eat fast food from time to time but I recommend you fix your own foods or eat what your parents fix at home because these foods are much better for you.  Eat baked chicken instead of fried.  Any meat the is baked or grilled is better than fried meat. \n\nDo not deprive your self of things you like just make better food choses for example a double cheese burger versus a home made grilled chicken sandwich with no toppings but lettuce and tomato on whole grain bread.....or a healthy salad with chicken and various vegetables.  Take one multi-vitamin.  Evercise for 45 minutes a day.  This should include cardio.  Cardio is running, bike riding, and aerobics.  Cardio is what makes you sweat.  If you sweat you will lose the fat.  \n\nFocus on muscle groups not body parts.  There are various exercises you can do to tone the lower abs and upper abs.  When working on your abs focus on upper lower and sides.  Belly dancing helps tone abs.  Walking up stairs a lot makes you have a nice butt.  \n\nYou could also turn on the music and dance to your favorite tunes at home.  What I recommend is for you to get an exercise tape such as a pilates work out. Pilates works very well.  It will give you the results you need.  Then make sure you have 8 cups of water a day to flush out the fat.  So, just eat right and evercise.  \n\nFocus on overall toning not zone toning.  Last of all accept yourself some parts of you may just be naturally big.  This is what I learned from a personal trainer.  I have big legs and a big chest.  I will always have big legs...the goal here is to just make the big legs look good.  I also have always had a ruler body and had the misconception that everyone should have an hour glass figure.  As a teen, seeing the models on tv made me really believe this.\n\nAccept your body is still beautiful.  A little plumpness is not a sign of being a little too chubby.  Plus my daughter has a little belly poking out but she is not fat.  My advice to her was that she was no longer a size 5 and should be wearing a 7.  After going to the store she found out I was right.  She exercises and eats healthy.  She does not diet.  She just is aware of what she eats making healthier choses and maybe an occasional fast food dinner.  \n\nSo you do not need to really go on a diet. About.com has a whole bunch of information that will help you.  It is loaded with information.\n\nIf you still feel uncomfortable talk to your doctor and he or she will help you understand healthy weight, healthy eating and getting enough exercise.  He or she will be able to let you know what you are doing right or wrong or whether you need to do anything at all.  \n\nBut I still think nothing is wrong.	health

The pill?? Hi there.\nI am an 18 year old girl from the UK. I'm going away for 2 months this year, and wouldnt like to have my period while I am away.... I would like to get the Pill, but how/what should I ask my doctor? \nThanks Talk to the doctor, get the pills and take them. \n\nAsk if he would prescribe pills so you won't have your period for longer than the normal 28 days. Standard bc pills make your body think it is pregnant so the menses are suspended. At some point the pills turn into placebos, or they run out and your body goes back to having the period. So, you have to ask the doctor if you can do it. He will give you pills that won't go to placebo or won't run out before your next desired period.	health

what can one do you get rid of chronic hives ?...Antihistamines dont work...nothing works !?  Oh you poor thing.  I suffered with the same thing for months after the birth of each of my children.  My Naturopathic Physician said it was the anistetic that was causing the reaction in my case and nothing worked.  Diet helped some (no acidic foods),  I also drank lots of water and no alchohol (well, little and extra water on those days).\n\nI had an MD say that he could get me on the list with the best dermatologist in town, but no body really knows exactly what causes hives and all the derm will do is allergy stress tests and tell you to alkalinize your diet (no meat, sugar, etc.) until the problem goes away. I told him that I had success sleeping through the night using Claritin, so he didn't prescribe me anything stronger (I was nursing anyway - I didn't want anything stronger really).\n\nI think that the hive reaction was caused by stress - tremendous amounts of stress brought on by having a new baby, each time.  I think the single best thing I did for myself was turn to Louise Hay to help have a positive and relaxed attitude about my situation and I think that more than anything helped.  According to Louise Hay, hives are caused by small, hidden fears and making mountains out of mole hills.  She says the cure is to remind yourself as often as you can "I bring peace to every corner of my life".\n\nThat's what I did.  I tried to relax and bring my own peace to my own life and before long the hives were gone - I hardly noticed.  Someone said "How are those hives?"  one day and I said "wow, you know they haven't bothered me for a while".  I had just stopped thinking of them.\n\nIn the mean time, cold water compresses can help and soaking in a warm epsom salt bath.  There's also a great product called Coral Calcium, you can put that in the bath and in your drinking water to futher alkalinize your system - lots of veggies will too.\n\nTake heart - it will end.  Peace!	health

What is the best way to keep up motivation in an attempt to lose weight? I need to lose 25 pounds by December. (And I'd really like to lose 10 by the time I go back to college...in August!) \nThing is, I have willpower, but only in spurts. What is the best way to stay motivated to do all the things to lose weight (like, limiting calories and going to exercise and all that jazz)? Sometimes keeping a food diary can help. Sometimes we don't remember how much we have snacked on during the day. The food diary can help you see if you are snacking excessively or help you see a bad habit. \n\nIf snacking is your problem you can look into a couple of options. You can cut down on your snacking or plan for healthier snacks. Don't drastically change your diet unless you know that you can stick with it. Otherwise you just gain all of the weight back because you go back to old habits. Just change a little at a time. Try having two "healthy meals" a week. Something as simple as having grilled food, instead of something fried. \n\nAlso, to lose weight you really need to do some type of exercise. Find something that you enjoy doing. You will be more likely to stick with it. Maybe walking, swimming, yoga, dance, aerobics. Just whatever you find interesting. If you bore easily you may want to try doing more than one thing. For instance, walking with friends on Monday and Wednesday, yoga on Tuesday and Thursday. The next week try dance on Mon. and wed. and aerobics or Tues. and Thurs.. You just have to find what works for you. The most important thing is to keep it fun and interesting. Take time and try some new things!\n\nI hope these suggestions were helpful. Good luck and just keep the faith in yourself. You can do it. You just have to decide that you are ready to.	health

Oh Geeez...\n\nOk here's one..\n\nTwo men went to mechanics school to learn how to put a car engine back together from all the parts.\n\nThe final exam was upon them which was to actually assemble the engine. The person that made the highest score had a position waiting for them with a well respected car manufacturing plant where they would be on a team to design new systems for the future.\n\nThe first guy was into engineering before this course the second was a former gynocologist, so naturally the gyno was nervous about passing the final exam.\n\nThe engineer was able to put his car together in record time, while the former gynocologist took twice the time to put his car together.\n\nThe instructor gave the highest score to the gynocologist, and the engineer was baffled, and upset.. then he questioned the instructor on the fairness of his grades.\n\nThe instructor said "It's true you both assembled so the engine ran perfectly, I gave each of you credit of 100% for being able to accomplish that.. but I gave an additional 100 points to the other guy because he did all the assembly through the tail pipe."	entertainment and Music

Do you think Prog Rock is becoming a lost art?  To a certain degree, yes. \nBut things run in cycles. There was a lull in progressive music in the '80's after the "art-rock" explosion of the '70's. Then, during the latter part of the decade, "Prog" started to make a come-back. \nNow, it seems as though it's hit another lull in the amount of true prog-rock bands that are out there. However, there are several excellent "Prog-Art-Rock" bands around.(The Mars Volta, Univers Zero, Cryptic Vision, Kino, The Flower Kings, etc.) The real trick is finding any of their material - especially, in the U.S. (Try these websites: www.prog4you.com - or - progarchives.com)\nProg music will always be around - it just will never gain any sort of mainstream acceptance. Which is good, because look what happened to "Metal" in the '80's when it became popular. I'm glad something finally came along to slay that monster. But why did it have to be "Grunge"?	entertainment and Music

what song makes you cry??..? every time you hear it you cant help it but a tear comes to your eye??.... Landslide by the Dixie Chicks.\nMy partner and I had been together for five months and everything felt so great. I was at University in a town far away from my home town and he lived in the town my University was in, working in a warehouse. My mother wasn't in favour of our relationship even though I was nineteen at the time, and told me I had to come home for the Summer. At the time, I didn't want to make her mad- and my father was really abusive and would have hurt either me or one of my sisters who still lived at home.\nI announced I had to go home for the Summer. I wrote it in a letter because I couldn't bear to tell him. We were and are really inseperable. \nI went into the bathroom and burst into tears, as he read the letter. When I came back into the bedroom, he was sobbing on the bed and had put on a song he said reminded him of me. It was landslide by the Dixie Chicks. The lines 'I'm afarid of change because I've built my life around you', really moved me and he was inconsolable. \nI managed five days back in my home town before I realised I could have a new life away from the abuse and emotional blackmail. I think that song tripped a switch in my brain that told me to go back to the man I love.\nI can't listen to that song now, it reminds me of our struggle to be together and how we had to build everything from scratch- how when I returned to him I did not bring anything because if I took a suitcase my parents would surely have realised what I was doing and made it so I couldn't go anywhere. My partner bought me clothes, he worked extra hours, and later I found a job so we could have a life together.\nWe are getting married in Feb and that song will play at our wedding.\nSorry this was so long, I just felt like telling someone...	entertainment and Music

the band "Him", do they have satanic lyrics?  Well to start off, the bands name, if I'm not mistaking, means His Infernal Majesty, if you look at my sources dictionary.com states the meaning of infernal as "Of or relating to a lower world of the dead."  So the name alone refers to the "Majesty" or king of the "underworld".  That alone would lead you to believe it so, but it is all about how you interpret things, "Wings of a Butterfly" , a song by H.I.M. and a personaly favorite of mine, refers to sacrafices and rituals, and ripping the wings off of a butterfly as if to save a soul, and refers to many gods, which isn't quite Christian, but theres constant talk of love and the bands symbol is the "Heartogram" dare I mind you it resembols the symbol of "witchcraft", "satanism", "wicken" or what have you it is more or less a symbol of a heart, which can be taken as love or loyalty to the devil.  Another aspect to concider is these guys are Finnish (as in they are from Finland) their culture is much different from America I imagine.  All in all I don't find their lyrics satanic or offencive, and personaly like H.I.M.  But you should read up on a couple songs and make your own judgement, I provided the partial lyrics to WoaB below and a link to its full lyrics, and you can search yahoo for the rest.\n\n"Wings of a Butterfly" - H.I.M.\nHeaven ablaze in our eyes \nWe're standing still in time \nThe blood on our hands is the wine\nWe offer as sacrifice \n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, and show them your love \nRip out the wings of a butterfly\nFor your soul, my love\nRip out the wings of a butterfly\nFor your soul\n\nThis endless mercy mile \nWe're crawling side by side \nWith hell freezing over in our eyes \nGods kneel before our crime\n\nBest of Luck,\nBrad D.	entertainment and Music

i need help to learn the violin? i'm very much interested in learning to play the violin but i am 22 so is that too late? (i can play the piano) .. i have no idea what do, i don't know what kind of violin to get and whether to get an instructor or not and where to get an instructor... how much should i pay for a violin and where can i buy one? i don't want something fancy....   please help To find a good, basic violin, search eBay under antique or vintage violins......Look for the Strad copies from around 188--1910.....These are mass-produced German/Czech violins, the type that our grandmothers or great-grandmothers ordered from Sears Roebuck and Wards mail order catalog......They will run from $100 to $300, depending upon age and condition. When these types of violins are fitted with a low bridge, they usually have a very good bright tone, with good sustain, and because of the wear and age, are easy to play.  Find a bow with some age on it, eBay, fleamarket, etc., preferably a Glasser horsehair bow.  With these two items combined, you should have a violin set that sounds good, and is easy to play.......very, very important when you are beginning to learn......The best fiddle players I've heard are self-taught......I've found a lot of instructors just have too much ego going with an adult player, and sometimes it's better to grasp at a few basics own your own. I have played and built violins for over 20 years. Good luck to you.	entertainment and Music

In addition, a lot of (in fact, most of) the people on the US Olympic team in speed skating are former inline-skaters. So the skills do transfer, to a certain extent.	sports

If the top 16 teams in the BCS played in a playoff, this is what it would look like:? 1) Ohio St. v 16) Tennessee\n2) USC v 15) West Virginia\n3) Michigan v 14) Virginia Tech\n4) Florida v 13) Rutgers\n5) LSU v 12) Oklahoma\n6) Louisville v 11) Auburn\n7) Wisconsin v 10) Notre Dame\n8) Boise St. v 9) Arkansas\n\nAssuming that the bracket played out similar to an NCAA Basketball bracket, who do you think would win the "national title" at the end of the playoff?\n\nI see it like this:\n1) Ohio St. v 9) Arkansas\n2) USC v 7) Wisconsin\n3) Michigan v 11) Auburn\n4) Florida v 12) Oklahoma\n\nRound 3:\n1) Ohio St. v 4) Florida\n2) USC v 3) Michigan\n\nFinals\n1) Ohio St. v 2) USC\n\nI think the same two teams would play, but with much less controversy.  Your opinions? I think playoffs are definetely the answer, but i'd go with 8 teams and only 3 rounds total. \n1) Ohio St. v 8) Boise St\n2) USC v 7) Wisconsin \n3) Michigan v 6) Louisville\n4) Florida v 5) LSU\n\nthen\n1) Ohio St v 4) Florida\n2) USC v 3) Michigan\n\nThen Final\n\nOhio St vs USC\n\nI don't actually think it would play out exactly as ranked, but i just used their rankings as a guideline. The point isn't who would be in the final game, but rather that there is no doubt that the real top 2 teams are in the top 8 and this way they would have a chance to really prove their worth.	sports
When was cricket game first originated?  A basic form of the sport can be traced back to the 13th century, but it may have existed even earlier than that. The game seems to have originated among shepherds and farm workers in the Weald between Kent and Sussex. Written evidence exists of a sport known as creag being played by Prince Edward, the son of Edward I (Longshanks), at Newenden, Kent in 1300.\n\nIn 1598, a court case referred to a sport called Creckett being played at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford around 1550. The Oxford English Dictionary gives this as the first recorded instance of cricket in the English language.	sports

Removable insoles in soccer cleats? I need new cleats that have removable insoles in them (for my custom orthotics).

These are also thick and I have bad touch now.  Nike's don't fit me well (heels fall out).  I can't really try my orthotics at the store because I can't find any shoes where the insoles come out so it's always a crapshoot on if the shoes will fit once I rip the insoles out.  I have always worked well with adidas sambas for indoor and whatever kind I had for outdoor so I know they tend to fit well.  Please help.  I need to get back out there without pain!!

Should a snowboard be completely flat against the ground when laid down? I'm still a beginner and I bought my first board.  When I lay the board on flat ground it kind of bows in the middle (the toe and heel touch the ground but not the middle).  Is this okay and how will this affect my riding?  Is there any way to fix this? It's actually called camber (I think) as the same principal is used when producing snow skiis.  According to wikipedia: "In skiing, the curvature in the base of a ski."\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski\n\nBasically it's built on the premise that once you step onto the board, then by virtue of your body weight, you are guaranteed to have the entire board touching the snow.

Can anybody Give me tips how can india bring world cup for 2nd time?  is there any difference created in the team selection or approach of BCCI towards game through our tips ? Then why should we think about it ? No doubt winning world cup is a matter of pride and honour for us and our country. But when the people sitting at top have no respect of our expectations, then what we can do. They are just happy with the politics. So there is no point in disussing this. And as far as world cup is concerned then forget @ India. It will be great if they could go ahead from  even league matches. So now just stop supporting the team. This is my request to all of u. \nJust wasting 9 precious hours in watching India's match is foolishness now. Its @ wasting almost 600 hours (that is, more than 25 days) per year, if india plays 45-50 days cricket in an year !!!!  Its difficult to stop ourselves but we need to do this, becoz there are many more important things in our life... Forget Chappel, Forget Dravid, Forget Ganguly.... and Forget Indian team... if u just remembers cricket any day then just watch highlight of Sachin's inning against Aussie at Sarjah of 1998. Entire cricket is in that inning.... Cricket is not more than that...\nSorry for being so emotional... but i m too much disturbed due to team's performance, strategies, and the main point, selection.	sports

I am going to start to skateboard what is the best deck, bearings.......? What is the best deck, bearings so on so on. I am a begginger. Also what addvice do you have to me. listen up kiddo cuz i know what im talking about.\n\nFirst off, there are two good beginer's boards. Zero, which is my personal favorite, and Alien Workshop, which I've heard a lot of good things about. Alien Workshops are over all good boards, and zero is good for street skating and getting high ollies. \n\nThe next thing, is trucks. I think that the top trucks brands are Krux, Grind King, and Phantom 2. But really, all the trucks are virtually the same.\n\nYou can ask anyone, Zero Black Widdow Bearings are the best.... \n\nSpitfire wheels are the best wheels...\n\nStay away from brands like Blind [which cracks easily] and Birdhouse [They are designed for vert skating, and are VERY VERY hard to ollie with because they are really heavy.] Also element are generally cheap and flimsy. \n\nShoes are all the same, just pick whatever looks good. ^__^\n\nIf you already know how to ollie, thats great [Push down with your backfoot on the tail of the board, and slide your front foot up the board and jump]. But it takes a while to ollie, so you really need to keep practicing as much as possible [It took me around 2 months to finally ollie], and watch as many skate videos. If you follow those two things, you will be ollie-ing in no time. \n\ngood luck.	sports

If the SF 49ers and Houston Texans end up with the same record, who gets the 1st pick? If the SF 49ers and Houston Texans end up with the same record, who gets the 1st pick? I heard if their records end up the same, then the first tie-breaker is easiest schedule. In this case Houston would get the 1st pick since Houston has an easier schedule. Or is it the head-to-head matchup that determines the tie-break? So if Houston beats the 49ers in the regular season finale, and both teams end up with the same record, the 49ers would get the first pick. So which is it? Or is there another tie-breaker scenario that takes precedence? • Strength of schedule for the previous season is the first tie-breaker for teams with the same winning percentage.	sports

When was the first .410 gauge shotgun made?  The genesis of the .410 does not coincide with the heyday of shotgun design, which occurred from circa 1850 to 1870. It wasn't until about 1900 that the cartridge is making its appearance in catalogs and the proof houses of England. No one today knows who invented it. There is a good amount of speculation that the .410 was originally a rifle caliber, the .444 Marlin. This is probably so, due to the rather recent discovery of older "rook rifles" that were originally rifles that were converted to shotgun use.	sports

Bleach is the only thing that will kill the mold/mildew and if you don't kill the mold/mildew it will spread.

I need info on the 2 deaths at Talladega Speedway this week?  TALLADEGA, Ala. (AP) -- Two NASCAR fans were electrocuted in a campground outside Talladega Superspeedway when a flagpole they were erecting touched power lines. \n\nDonny Lynn Wright, 42, of Remlap and Keith Alan Stell, 39, of Birmingham died Monday, said track spokeswoman Kristi King. Talladega County Coroner Jerry Castleberry pronounced them dead at the scene.\n\nThe Aaron's 499 race will be run at the track on Sunday. Fans commonly use poles to fly flags touting their favorite driver.\n\nWitnesses said Wright and Stell were attempting to anchor a flagpole when it was caught by wind and pushed into power lines running along a road outside the track.\n\n"They were trying to pull the flagpole back off the lines," said James Snider, who was sitting about 30 yards away from the victims' camp site. "I heard a loud pop that sounded like a firecracker, and I went running because the power lines fell. They were both lying on the ground, and two women were trying to get them away from the wires."	sports

I would like to know,what size a soccer court have. And does every court have to have the same size?  The length of the field (pitch) should be in the range 90-120m (100-130 yards) and the width should be in the range 45-90m (50-100 yards). Anything that falls within those limits is acceptable.\n\nThe only other requirement is that the pitch must be rectangular, meaning it can't be 90 X 90.\n\nSo all fields are (literally) not created equal. I think there's been an effort at standardizing the new fields at 100m (long) X 80m (wide) but I can't give you any more details on that.	sports

Does anybody know if Umberger was hurt by the hit that Brian Campbel gave him? that was the best hit i have ever seen by the way. Is a Flyers fan and that was an awesome hit on Umberger.  Though I really hope then get the BS out of the way so they can play the game and not have something cheap happen.  I say let Campbell and Brashear drop the gloves get it over with and play the game the last thing either team needs is for someone to do something cheap and hurt someone else.  This way the Flyer get there revenge and everyone is happy.  \n Update: Umberger learned a lesson about skating with his head down in Game 1 of the playoff series with the Buffalo Sabres, getting clocked by defenseman Brian Campbell in the first overtime, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. \nRecommendation: "I was in the right position.

He remains questionable for Monday night's game, although he says he is fine. Coach Ken Hitchcock seemed optimistic, saying Umberger's only symptom was stiffness in his neck.	sports

who is Azumah Nelson?  Azumah Nelson (born September 19, 1958) is a former boxer who was a three time world champion. A native of Ghana, Nelson is not a prince: He is not related to the Ashanti royal family. He is from a different tribe. He is from the Ga tribe. He used to wear a crown into the ring before his boxing fights.\n\nNelson also has endured personal loss: His wife of many years died during the 1990s of cancer.\n\nNelson's professional boxing debut, in 1979, did not cause much furor, except in Ghana, where he was known because of his family ties. Internationally, Nelson lacked the recognition for such an event to be given its due importance. With the years, however, all of that changed because he garnered world wide fame as a boxer.\n\nHe beat Billy Kwame in Accra by a decision in eight to mark his professional debut. In his third fight, he fought on March 3 of 1980, he knocked out Henry Sadler in the ninth round to win Ghana's regional 126 pound title. On December 13 of that year, he knocked out Joe Skipper in round 10 to add the African continent's belt to his Ghanian regional championship.\n\n1981 was a productive year for the young fighter. He beat Bozzou Aziza in his first fight abroad; held in Togo, and then he beat Miguel Ruiz in his first United States fight, held in California. He added the British commonwealth's Featherweight title with a five round knockout of Brian Roberts.\n\nDespite all his early achievements and being undefeated in 13 fights, Nelson was virtually unknown outside Ghana. Because of this, he was a decisive underdog when he challenged WBC world Featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez on June 21 of 1982 at the Madison Square Garden in New York. Despite losing that fight by a knockout in round 15, Nelson's stock as a boxer rose after that fight, and he established himself as a deserving leading contender in the eyes of many fans. Sanchez sadly passed away almost two months after this fight, suffering a car accident in Mexico City. Sanchez-Nelson was Salvador Sanchez's last fight.\n\nIn his next fight, Nelson knocked out fringe contender Irving Mitchell in eight rounds.\n\nNelson won all four of his fights in 1983, and he began 1984 by beating Hector Cortez by decision on March 9 in Las Vegas. Then, on December 8 of that year, he became boxing royalty by knocking out Wilfredo Gomez in round 11 to win the WBC world Featherweight championship. Behind on the three judges' scorecards, Nelson rallied in that last round to become champion in Puerto Rico.\n\nNelson held on to that title for three years. He could not fight for 9 months after the Gomez bout, but when he returned, he retained the title in Miami with a fifth round knockout of Juvenal Ordenes in September 1985, and then in October of that year, he retained it again with a first round knockout of Pat Cowdell in Birmingham, England. The Cowdell knockout in particular became a highlight film material: Cowdell was left frozen on the canvas by Nelson's knockout punch.\n\nIn 1986, he retained the title two times, beating future world champion Marcos Villasana and former Barry McGuigan challenger Danilo Cabrera (once again, in Puerto Rico).\n\nIn 1987, Nelson retained the title against Mauro Guitierrez, by a knockout in round six, and in a rematch with Villasana, once again, by decision. After the second fight with Villasana, Nelson abandoned the WBC's World Featherweight title.\n\nNelson began 1988 by fighting former Julio Cesar Chavez rival Mario Martinez for the vacant WBC's world Jr. Lightweight title. He beat Martinez by decision in 12 rounds on February 29 at Los Angeles to become world Jr. Lightweight champion, and then he defended the title with a knockout in round nine against former world champ Lupe Suarez and with a knockout in three over Sydney Del Rovere.\n\nHe proceeded in 1989 by beating Martinez in a rematch, by knockout in round 12, and then fighting Jim McDonnell, with exactly the same result.

What is the best wetsuit on the market for surfing in southern california in the winter?  These days, it's tough to go wrong.\n\nJust to start out with some perspective, during the winter in Southern California the water gets down to the mid to high 50's. Sometimes it'll pop back up to the low 60's for a few days. Other days it'll drop down to the low 50's. \n\nAnd since (as you well know) water temps are controlled by currents and ocean swells, even in the summer it can get pretty chilly.\n\nSo, with that said, here are my suggestions:\n\nFor the winter months, get yourself a good 2/3 fullsuit (most surfing wetsuits are a different thickness in the arms/legs than in the torso, the logic being that your arms and legs need more flexibility). A 2/3 has 2mm thick arms/legs and 3mm thick torso. \n\nThe best fullsuits on the market are widely considered to be the Rip Curl "Bomb" series and the O'Neill "Psycho" series. Xcel, Hotline, Hurley, Quiksilver and Billabong all make good suits, but 80% of the guys in the water here wear Rip Curl or O'Neill.  \n\nThe Rip Curl "Bomb" series comes in two versions - the "E-Bomb" and the "F-Bomb". They're basically identical suits except that the F-Bomb is coated inside the torso section with this fuzzy insulation stuff, which supposedly keeps your mid-section a bit warmer. The E-Bomb doesn't have the coating and is 100% pure "Elastomax", which is this super squishy, stretchy neopreme. \n\nRight now I'm using a 2/3 E-Bomb. I find it to be astonishingly warm. However, I also have a 2/3 O'Neill Psycho II. It's made of an almost identical super stretchy material. \n\n6 months ago I would have suggested the O'Neill over the Rip Curl because they always seemed to be better constructed (the Rip Curls have always been more flexible, but had a tendency to start falling apart after a few months). However, with this new E-Bomb, I stand corrected. It's just as sturdy as the Psycho II. Maybe even better. \n\nOne more factor to consider is the fit. I've always found O'Neill wetsuits to be a bit tighter fitting than the Rip Curl. Then again, I'm on the bigger side (at least as far as surfers go). While you want your suit to be as snug and form-fitting as possible, a few wrinkles here and there can sometimes equal a bit of extra free movement.  \n\nAgain though, I'm nit-picking. Bottom line:\n\n2/3 O'Neill Psycho II\n2/3 Rip Curl F-Bomb\n\nYou can't go wrong with either one. If you get cold easily, go up one thickness. OR, just pick up some booties for those really cold mornings. \n\nCheck out the Rip Curl store in San Clemente or check out Jack's Surfboards in Huntington Beach. Both have a MASSIVE selection of suits. Or just order online. \n\nQuick note: If you plan on surfing in the Fall/Spring, your 2/3 fullsuit will still work beautifully and keep you extra warm. \n\nBUT, if you have the extra cash and like the idea of shedding a little rubber when the conditions warm up, get a short-sleeved "comp" (used to stand for "competition wetsuit" back when they inroduced them in the 80's). The only drawback to the comp is that you can get a nasty farmer's tan on your arms. Another option is a long-sleeve springsuit or short-arm springsuit.\n\nFor the summer, get a thin wetsuit top to wear with your boardshorts. Keeps you warmer than a rashguard and keeps you from having to find someone to smear sunblock on your back.\n\nProbably more information that you wanted, but there's a LOT to choose from and the conditions can vary quite a bit. But with the links below, I think you'll be all set. \n\nSee you in the water!	sports
i just purchased a Remington 710 and am in need of a scope. any reccomendations? my budget is 125$ or less, tx looking for a scope to fit this model, something that is strong, durable and provides me with visual distance Forget Tasco!!  I have a Nikon on my Browning A-bolt and it is just fine.  I normally prefer Leupold, but I got the Nikon with a rebate and on sale.  I think unless you really shop around, your going to have a hard time finding a dependable scope to take the punishment for $125.  Learn to shoot your iron sights well and wait until after the season for some sales.	sports

Should Bill Cowher get Fired?  While the Steelers are playing below their potential, and a lot of that can be blamed on the coach, you absolutely can't fire Cowher.  Think of what he's done long term, playoff appearances, division titiles, Super Bowls.  The man clearly knows how to run a football team (even if that hasn't been clear this year) and is entitiled to continue coaching because of what he has done and can contiue to bring to the franchise.  He's better than anyone that would replace him anyways.  Why would anyone, especially someone as classy and loyal as Rooney, fire someone so accomplished just because of one unfortunate year?  If you want to blame someone, blame the offense and special teams for turning the ball over so much.  That's the real reason we're 2-5 and not 4-3 or 5-2.\n\n\nBesides, he's going to retire in a year or two anyway.	sports
