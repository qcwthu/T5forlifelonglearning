Whether Mohd. Kaif will retained with his form??????????  First of all..Mohd. Kaif is not a dashy player who can come to crease and start slashing. He is a batsman who requires time to settle down ..get his feet in and start knocking around the singles.  \n  In most of the previous matches..he came in around the 40..45th over and had to get moving quicly...no wonder he couldnt deliver.\n  It is clear from yesterday's performance that he takes time but ultimatelty delivers..dropping him now would be a big blumder.	sports

I am writing a persuasive essay against performance-enhancing drugs in sports.any opinions?any sports included  Steroids seem to be the easy way out. Working out at the gym is hard work, and some players are so lazy, they want to do it the easy way. Barry Bonds--and probably plenty of other athletes--could have been respected, great athletes if they had been willing to work. But they just took steroids. Athletes like Barry Bonds, Mark Mcquire (sp?), Rafael Palmiero--they all broke huge records. People celebrated--until they found out the horrible truth. It caused so much confusion in baseball. What to do with them? Did they have to put asterisks by all the records? (715*\n*used steroids)\nI mean, that just gives kids bad ideas. Steroids\na) RECK your body\n2) injure your chances of being a respected athlete\nd) are just plain cheap\nMost of those athletes are liars, too! They say that they didn't intentionally take steroids. That's why I respect Jason Giambi--he admitted his mistake.\nI saw a story on the news about a high school football player who died. He had been taking steroids and they recked his body.	sports

Prozac?????? I've just started taking prozac four days ago, I know it'll be a few weeks before I feel any effect, but I want to know if anyone has suffered from any side effects while taking it. Since I've started I've had moderate pains in my stomach and sides but nothing too bad. Also will I need to take any vitiman supplements with it like you do when you take an anti-biotic? What you're experiencing are typical side effects to SSRI's - All psychotropic drugs come with side effects and they should go away in a week or two.  As per the effect, you'll feel it full blast in about a month, maybe even two, with any SSRI.  You're essentially changing the chemical response to serotonin production in your brain.  Once the reuptake inhibitors kick in, you will feel very different, but it takes a little while so be patient.  You sound really open minded to taking meds and I think that's great!\n\nHere's some info written by this crazy dude who knows everything about psychotropic drugs.  \n\nProzac's pros and cons:\nPros: Prozac's long half-life makes the issue of med compliance a little less of a big deal, hence the approval for depressed teenagers. It also has studies backing it up for PMDD, by Lilly and independent researchers, including the Amen clinic, where I'm treated. You can see at the Amen Clinic's case studies in practice the more common form of PMDD that responds to SSRIs will respond to whichever SSRI you get along with the best. Prozac Weekly does have an advantage for certain forms of PMDD.\n\n \n\nCons: That really long half-life means it takes forever to wean yourself off of  Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) to avoid SSRI discontinuation syndrome.  But only if the discontinuation syndrome hits you hard, which is fairly uncommon with Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride).  In fact some more enlightened doctors will prescribe the liquid form to help wean patients off of other SSRIs and Effexor (venlafaxine). The sexual side effects, though, are pretty bad.  For being the weakest of the SSRIs the side effects are pretty gnarly.\n\nProzac's side effects:\n\nTypical Side Effects: The usual for SSRIs - headache, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, sleepiness or insomnia, and diarrhea or constipation, weight gain, loss of libido. Most everything but the weight gain and loss of libido usually goes away within a couple of weeks. With Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) it's a coin toss as to losing or gaining weight. Sometimes it will just kill your appetite.\n\nNot So Common Side Effects: Rash, 'flu-like symptoms, anger/rage.\n These may or may not happen to you don't, so don't be surprised one way or the other.\n\n \n\nFreaky Rare Side Effects: Bleeding gums, amnesia, anti-social reaction (oh, come on, like we're not anti-social already), herpes (again, blaming the med for an STD), excessive hair growth, engorged breasts, involuntary tongue protrusion (in one 77-year-old woman who stopped sticking her tongue out at everyone after they stopped giving her Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride)).\n\nYou aren't going to get these. I promise.\n\nInteresting Stuff Your Doctor Probably Won't Tell You: Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) has been found to make a lot of other drugs work better. Great, huh? Not always, as with some meds it can be to the point of overdose. But it was that effect that lead to the breakthrough of the antipsychotic & antidepressant cocktail to treat bipolar depression. Anyway, Tegretol (carbamazepine) could suddenly get toxic on you and Xanax (alprazolam) could knock you out if you add Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) to them, or add them to Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride), so be careful and always check your drug-drug interactions! A big part of this is the usual pharmacokinetic stuff of liver enzymes being able to deal with only so much, and Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) gives your liver a bit of a workout.  But that doesn't explain the entire effect of all of the drug-drug interactions.  There's some pharmacodynamic (how meds work in your brain) stuff going on as well.\nProzac (fluoxetine hydrochloride) isn't such a hot idea for anyone with diabetes, and not because of potential weight gain, rather it messes with your glycemic control.\n\n \n\nProzac's Dosage and How to Take Prozac: I'm just going 	health

Harmful effects.....? Does anybody know any harmful health effects of using Turmeric excessively? Turmeric is a spice used in Indian food and i read a lot of health benefits of using it but could not find a single site which talks about harmful effects, if used excessively. Even though I know so many health benefits of it, i wanted to know the other side of it as well (harmful effects if used excessively).\n\nI request you to give serious answers and please do not give funny answers. I appreciate that. I am a huge fan of Turmeric as well and have never hear of any ill effect or seen any writings on it - unlike excessive carrot consumption which can cause you to turn orange-there is not even an anecdotal side effect I have ever come across.	health
is it safe to masturbate everyday ?  Masturbation is common in both males and females, but more so in males. The frequency depends on the individual but also by the opportunity. Many boys even masturbate in the restrooms at school. It is not good or bad, it is normal. Some boys can masturbate 8 to 10 times a day. High strung people tend to masturbate more frequently and strangely, less intelligent people tend to masturbate less frequently. Some people can masturbate without lubricant, others use soap, oils, or Vaseline but caution is needed to prevent irritation. Does it do any psychological harm? No, it is a normal part of development and as men age, those over 40 years often masturbate to obtain sexual gratification as their partner is unwilling, or the vaginal tissue is too flaccid to obtain ejaculation. The normal amount of ejaculate is about 5 ccs but varies with frequency	health
Alzheimers? What are some of the symptoms, treatment, and what is the life expectancy of someone who suffers from Alzheimers? Alzheimer Disease Symptoms\nAlzheimer disease begins with a mild, slowly worsening memory loss. Many older people fear that they have Alzheimer disease because they can’t find their eyeglasses or remember someone’s name. \n\n\nThese very common problems are most often due to a much less serious condition involving slowing of mental processes with age. \n\n\nMedical professionals call some of these cases benign senescent forgetfulness, age-related memory loss, or minimal cognitive impairment. \n\n\nWhile these conditions are a nuisance, they do not significantly impair a person’s ability to learn new information, solve problems, or carry out everyday activities, as Alzheimer disease does. \n Early warning signs of Alzheimer disease include memory problems such as the following: \n\nDifficulty recognizing familiar people or things (not just forgetting a name) \n\n\nTrouble remembering recent events or activities \n\n\nInability to solve simple arithmetic problems \n\n\nProblems finding the right word for a familiar thing \n\n\nDifficulty performing familiar tasks \nAs the disease progresses, however, the symptoms become more serious. They may include the following: \n\nInability to carry out everyday activities, often called activities of daily living, without help - Bathing, dressing, grooming, feeding, using the toilet \n\n\nInability to think clearly or solve problems \n\n\nDifficulties understanding or learning new information \n\n\nProblems with communication - Speaking, reading, writing \n\n\nIncreasing disorientation and confusion even in familiar surroundings \n\n\nGreater risk of falls and accidents due to poor judgment and confusion \n In the later stages of the disease, the symptoms are severe and devastating: \n\nComplete loss of short- and long-term memory – May be unable to recognize even close relatives and friends \n\n\nComplete dependence on others for activities of daily living \n\n\nSevere disorientation – May walk away from home and get lost \n\n\nBehavior or personality changes – May become anxious, hostile, or aggressive \n\n\nLoss of mobility – May be unable to walk or move from place to place without help \n\n\nImpairment of other movements such as swallowing – Increases risk of malnutrition, choking, and aspiration (inhaling foods and beverages, saliva, or mucus into lungs) \nThese symptoms typically develop over a period of years. The disease progresses at different rates in different people. \n  \nEmotional problems such as depression and anxiety are common in older people. These problems can leave elderly people feeling confused or forgetful. Because these emotional problems are reversible in many people, it is important that they be distinguished from Alzheimer disease and other brain disorders. \n\nAlzheimer Disease Treatment\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. Treatment focuses on relieving and slowing down the progress of the symptoms, behavior changes, and complications. \n \nAn individual with AD should always be under medical care. Much of the day-to-day care, however, is handled by family caregivers. Medical care should focus on optimizing the individual’s health, safety, and quality of life while helping family members cope with the many challenges of caring for a loved one with AD. Treatment most often consists of medications and nondrug treatments such as behavior therapy.\n\n\nSelf-Care at Home\nMany individuals with Alzheimer disease in the early and intermediate stages are able to live independently. \n\n\nWith regular checks by a local relative or friend, they are able to live for some time without constant supervision. \n\n\nThose who have difficulty with activities of daily living require at least part-time help from a family caregiver or home health aide. \n\n\nVisiting nurses can make sure that these individuals take their medications as directed. \n\n\nHousekeeping help is available for those who cannot keep up with household chores. \nOther affected individu	health

Doppler Question? In one of the original Doppler experiments, one tuba was played on a moving platform car at a frequency of 75 Hz, and a second identical one was played on the same tone while at rest in the railway station. What beat frequency was heard if the train approached the station at a speed of 26.0 m/s? (26.0 m/s) / (the velocity of sound) = 1/13\nSo the relative increase of the f is as well 1/13.\nSo the frequence heard in the train is (1 + 1/13) x 75 Hz = 81Hz.	science

Again to fall down there should be a force pulling the person from somewhere down below. This is the same force Newton discovered when an apple fall from the tree.	science

How can I tell the difference between chipmunks and squirrels? Do all chips have stripes? I'm trying to win an argument with my dad, so I need proof of sort. We have this "chipmunk" with _no_ stripes, but body/tail shape of a true chipmunk. It also stuffs itself and its cheeks, unlike the squirrels I've observed. My dad says its a squirrel. Its tail is small and fairly straight, with a tiny curve at the end. \n\nI've researched on the net, but can find only chips with stripes. Anyone? (I would really, for once, like to win an argument with my dad! lol)\n\n\nThanks! Well, you're not going to win this argument.  Check out this link (http://www.montereybay.com/creagrus/chipmunks.html) about North American chipmunks, which says:  Chipmunks are small striped squirrels (genus Tamias) in North America. The first thing for a field observer to recognize is that a chipmunk is different from the only other squirrel that is vaguely similar, the Golden-mantled Ground-Squirrel. That colorful squirrel is widespread and easily visible in wooded open country in the mountains throughout western North America.  Note that although the Golden-mantled Ground-Squirrel has black-and-white body stripes it lacks any stripes on the face. It is not a chipmunk. All chipmunks have facial stripes. \n\nSo yours is probably some type of ground squirrel.  Check out this site (http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/view_default.asp?searchText=squirrel&curPageNum=4) for some possibilities (with photos), so maybe you can ID it.  Hope that helps!	science
the way static electricity pulls water towards it, is there a way to repel like that?  Static charge is a charge that is not moving. Therefore it is a build up of opposite charges accross a medium where the current is unable to flow.\n\nWater has a net negative charge. Therefore it would be possible to arrange a pair of plates over a bowl of water with the net negatively charged plate closer to the water.. \nI've never seen this but it should be able to be done and it should repel the water....\n\nOil and Water suffer from this problem.. they are both negatively charged.. This is why they need an "emulsifier" to mix them.. The most common emulsifier in this situation is called DETERGENT.	science
f is defined on [0,1] by f=0 if x in rational,=[1/x] otherwise.Show intregration f in [0,1]=infinity?  If you mean to use the Riemann integral, the function is not integrable since it is not bounded. For the Lebesgue integral, the rationals are a set of measure 0, so are irrelevant. In the interval (1/(n+1), 1/n], the function has value n, so the integral over that interval is [1/n-1/(n+1)]*n=1/(n+1).\nThe sun of 1/(n+1) from 1 to infinity diverges to infinity.	science

How does a triode differ from a diode?  A Vaccum tube diode uses the applied voltage to create thermionic emmisions which results in sending electrons from the cathode filament to the Anode plate. This was replaced by a Semiconductor diode, which  depends on the applied electric voltage to break the barrier formed at the p-n junction. \n\nA triode is similar to a Vaccum tube diode, but gets a helping hand by concentrating the electrons using a Grid. This allows a small change to the Grid voltage to vastly increase the flow of electrons between Cathode and Anode, thus allowing Amplification.\n\nTriode Tubes were later replaced by a Semiconductor Transistors, Field effect Transistors and Bipolar Junction Transistors. However, even today, Tubes can work at far more higher voltage ranges than a semiconductor device.	science

how can i invent a new music style/genre ? anyone have any ideas ? First, you have to know enough about music so you don't come up something that you think is new but it has been done before; then, experiment with rhythms and sounds and structures, until you find something.\nAnyway, in music it is more discovering the combinatins you can make than inventing it; like maths (i'm not trying to say here that music is like maths to me, I hate maths and love music, but there is a lot of maths in music too).	entertainment and Music
How do they film a sex scene in a movie? I've always wondered, do the actors actually have sex? And I mean movies like Terminator for example, not pornographic videos. They do everything except the actual sex, but of course, even that is dependent on the contracts. If the actress is not willing to bare anything, then the director will find ways to keep her privates hidden while still trying to keep the scene erotic. There is no editing and stuff if all is needed is nudity. Actors and actresses bare as needed. As someone above said, for the sex scenes, sly camera work and appropriate props (like bedsheets) are needed. It's just simulated sex, i.e. they move in ways as if they WERE having sex, but it's not actual sex.	entertainment and Music

Does a guy have to be a rich celebrity to be good enough to marry Brittany Spears without being a leech? People are always downing Kevin Federline for being a leech because he isn't rich and he is only famous because he married her, but no one ever says anything about a woman married to a rich man. Are women the only ones that get to marry someone rich without being a celebrity themselves without people giving them a hard time about it? Do you have to be Nick Lachey to marry Jessica Simpson? Do you have to be Mark Anthony to marry J-Lo? What is the rule exactly? I think if you have a lot to offer someone, it shouldn't matter if you are rich, a celebrity or  in the public eye.  It's a shame people can be so shallow that they pass up "golden opportunities" when they are presented.  I think it also has a lot to do with what circles these people run in.  "Birds of a feather flock together" kind of thing.	entertainment and Music
Why are FOX and ABC always ripping off each other's idea's?!?!? Okay, FOX first had Nanny 911, then ABC started Supernanny. ABC had Dancing with the Stars, then FOX had Skating with Celebrities. ABC had Trading Spouses, then FOX had Wife Swap!!!!  Why is there no originality left in reality shows?!?! FOX will see that ABC (or vise versa) will see that the other one is making more money then they are so they will start a show about that.	entertainment and Music

top ten dirtiest joke on the internet?  A prisoner escapes from his prison where he had been kept for 15 years. As \nhe runs away, he finds a house and breaks into it. He finds a young couple \nin bed. He gets the guy out of bed, ties him up on a chair, ties up the \nwoman to the bed and while he gets on top of her, he kissed her on the neck, \nthen gets up, and goes to the bathroom. \n \nWhile he is there, the husband tells his wife: "Listen, this guy is a \nprisoner, look at his clothes! He probably spent a lot of time in prison, \nand has not seen a woman in years. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't \ncomplain, just do what he tells you, give him satisfaction. This guy must be \ndangerous, if he gets angry, he will kill both of us. Be strong, honey. I \nlove you" \n \n \n \nTo which the wife responds, "I am glad you think that way. Sure, he has not \nseen a woman in years, but he was not kissing my neck. He was whispering in \nmy ear. He told me that he found you very sexy, and asked if we kept any \nVaseline in the bathroom.	entertainment and Music
