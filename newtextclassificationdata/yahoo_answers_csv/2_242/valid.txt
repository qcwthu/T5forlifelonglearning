Who knows something about Steaua Bucharest?  FC Steaua Bucureşti is a Romanian football club based at Ghencea Stadium, Bucharest, Romania. It was founded on June 7, 1947 as ASA Bucureşti (Asociatia Sportivă a Armatei - English The Army Sport Association). The club changed its name several times before settling on Steaua (English: "The Star") in 1961.\n\nBeing the only Romanian football team and the first in Eastern Europe, to win the European Champions Cup in 1986, having also won the European Super Cup in 1987, Steaua is the most successful and the most popular football club in Romania. Alongside the two European trophies, they have also won 23 National Football Championships, 20 Romanian Cups and 5 Romanian Super Cups	sports

What are the rules/scoring stuff for football? I'm curious and clueless. Objective: American football is played by two teams who will have eleven players on the field at any one time. The object of the game is to get the ball to the opponents end of the field, and score more points than the opposing team.\n\nTo start a game, the referee will toss a coin. The visiting captain calls. The winner of the toss can decide whether to start in offense (receive the kick) or defense (deliver the kick). When play restarts in the second half, the captain who lost the toss at the beginning of the game chooses.\n\nIf a game goes into overtime, the first team to score wins, so the captain will almost always choose to go on the offense. Teams change ends at the start of the quarter.\n\nPlaying time lasts for one hour, divided into four fifteen minute quarters. There is a fifteen minute break between the second and third quarters (each half of the game).\n\nThe clock is stopped when the ball is not in play, when a foul has been committed, or when a fair catch has been caught. The clock is also stopped for time outs. Both teams are allowed three time outs, lasting a maximum of two minutes each, in each half.\n\nBoth the clock and the game itself are stopped two minutes from the end of each half by the referee to allow the teams to plan their strategies.\n\nIf the scores are level at the end of the fourth quarter, overtime will be played. In NFL games, only one period of overtime is played, and if the scores are still level, the game is declared a draw. For championship and playoff games, periods are played until a winner is decided (the first team to score).\n\n\n\n\nMORE COMPLEX RULES\n\n\n\nKick off \nTop of page\n\nPlay starts with a kick off at the start of the second half, but when the teams turn around and change ends at the start of the first and third quarters, play is started from the same position on the field as where it finished, but in the opposite half of the field. The same team will keep possession.\n\nThe kick-off is used to restart play after all point-afters and field goals. The kick-offs are always taken from the 35-yard line, unless a penalty has been given. The team making the point after always restarts the game with a kick-off. If the kick is unsuccessful, the defense starts play from their own 25-yard line and so they become the offense.\n\n\n\nScoring \nTop of page\n\nAs with many sports, the object is to score more points than the opponents. There are several different ways of scoring in American football.\n\nThe largest single score comes from a touchdown. This is worth six points. It is scored when an offensive player runs into the opposing end zone while in possession of the ball. A receiver can also make a catch delivered into the same area. The ball does not have to be actually 'touched down' on the ground for the points to be scored.\n\nA successful touchdown is followed by a kick through the goalposts, known as the conversion, or 'point-after'. This is worth one point. For this, the ball is placed on the 2-yard line and snapped (passed backwards through the legs) to the kicker, who tries to kick it over the crossbar and between the upright posts.\n\nA player can touch the ball onto the ground in the end zone without their whole body being in the end zone, and the touchdown still counts. However, the scoring player must not be pushed or helped in any way by other players.\n\nThe next type of scoring is called the field goal. A field goal counts as three points. It is taken from 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage (the line where the last play ended, so the next play is made from there), to give the kicker more time, and some protection from the defense. Again, the ball must be kicked through the posts. The kicker is credited for the kick from whatever distance it was taken from.\n\nThe fourth and final way of scoring is called the safety. Two points are awarded to the offensive team when the defensive team are caught in possession of the ball in their own end zone.\n	sports

How to increase my height? I want to increase my height without surgery,I know Aminoacids+Vitamins and calcium+ protein + sport will help ... \nand I know it is related to genetics too,,,my uncles are 1M:85CM and 1M:90CM but mother is short 1:60 . \nI am 22 my height is 1(meter):72CM ,,, I want to be 1:77 or min 1:75,,,\nplease help me ,,, is it possible?   how? Hi Amir, three factors that affect your growth rate are as follows :\n\n(1) Your Genes\n(2) Your Pituitary Gland\n(3) Your Nutrition\n\nThe Pituitary gland sits as the bottom of the middle of your brain. Its secrets various harmones, one of them including the growth harmone. Growth hormone is the key factor that controls how tall you grow to be, and the amount of it that gets produced can vary from year to year and even month to month as you grow.\n\nNutrition can help, in the sense that undernourishment can cause growth to go more slowly. Eat well-balanced meals, with protein, vegetables, and all the vitamins and minerals you need.\n\nYou certainly can't control your genes, but with a well balanced diet, you centainly can suppliment the rate of increase. The only limiting factor is your age. By 19 years, the growth of an average person stops. There are medicines available in the market, but I am certainly not in favour of using those. In case you want to , consult your doctor before using those.\n\nJust a note:\nScientists have cloned the gene for human growth hormone, and so the purified factor is now available for doctors to use. But they only use it in special medical cases where severely low levels of growth hormone can cause problems. \n\nFor a detailed explaination of how to increase your height, check out the following articles :\n\nhttp://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=96896\nhttp://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/Sports/15469.html	health

If you have felt sad most of your life, is that depression? Most of my life, even as a child, I have felt an overall sadness.  Sometimes it gets worse and sometimes better.  I have taken medication for it and had counseling but none seem to make a difference.  All of the screening tests ask if you feel worse in the last 2 weeks, well I never felt any better so no I don't feel worse.  Do I enjoy activities less?  Never enjoyed them that much.  Have I considered suicide. Decided a long time ago that I did not want to put family through that.  Is this depression or just a personality disorder?  Where do I go for help? I have had a drinkin problem in the past but have overcome it, mostly due to social situation.  I now overeat and am trying to overcome that. Perhaps you need to look at your childhood and what you were sad about.  They say that depression is "anger turned inwards". Were you abused, molested, traumatised or experienced great loss in some way as a child? Keep in mind that things we adults would take in our stride can be overwhelming or seem life-threatening to a child. And there will be long-term emotional effects even if we then block, forget or repress those childhood feelings. \n\nDrinking and overeating are both ways to numb one's emotional pain. I think you may need to understand the source of that pain before you can try to heal it. \n\nHave you been to many different counselors or just one? Keep trying them out till you find one you relate to .. it's a bit like shopping for clothes with the size-labels cut off .. you've got to try them out to know for sure if they fit for you! :)   In my experience the most helpful ones have been therapists who practise CBT or Transactional Analysis (CBT is cognitive behavioural therapy).\n\nPerhaps if you work on reducing fatigue and increasing your energy, that might help some. Try drinking plenty of water, eating fresh fruit and veg, breathing and stretching exercises, go for walks in the fresh air, and get about 7 to 8 hrs sleep. Oversleeping can make you feel just as tired if not more, than insomnia. There are lots of simple things you can, mostly with your lifestyle, to reduce the impact of your depression and feel better about life.	health

Is centrifugal force gravity? Sounds funny, I know.  A friend of mine INSISTS he saw or read somewhere that centrifugal force and gravity are one and the same.  But the more I think on it the more it doesn't make sense.  It seems to me that they should be opposites. No centrifugal force is not gravity. Gravity is a real force, and centrifugal force is a fictitious force. Centrifugal force usually works in a direction OPPOSITE to gravity. \n\nCentrifugal force is the force we invent in a moving frame to explain what appears to be a force pushing out from the center of rotational motion (but it is just the law of inertia, really, not a force). For example, if you spin a rock tied to a rope, the rope stretches out as the rock spins. It looks like there is a force pulling the rock outward; this is the fictitious force, centrifugal force. While the rope is holding the rock in the circular path, the rope is pulling the rock in to the center of the motion, so the tension on the rope is providing the opposing force, called centripetal force. \n\nIn the case of the earth, gravity from the sun provides a centripetal force to hold the earth in a roughly circular orbit around the sun (or actually around the center of mass, and the orbit is elliptical). So the centripetal force is gravity, and centrifugal force is the apparent force, but fictitious, that makes the earth appear like it wants to fly off into space, if gravity was not there. If the sun's gravity just shut off, the earth would travel off into space, and an observer on the sun would say it looked like a force was pulling the earth outward away from the sun. We call this force centrifugal force.	science
