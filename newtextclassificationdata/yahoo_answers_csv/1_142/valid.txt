Gas mileage? Why does my car go 125 miles on the first quarter tank, 100 on the second and third quarter, and only 75 on the last one. Every car I have had is like this. If we can go to the moon, have the vastness of the internet, replace body parts, why not have a useful and accurate gas gauge? Car manufacturers also own the towing services that come and take us to the nearest gas stations that OH, incidentally, the car manufacturers own too. So with this monopoly going on they gouge us with the gauge since we over estimate how long we can go especially on that last quarter of a tank of gas. So in short......it's a racket. A gauge gouging racket. :D	sports

Any man here had breast reduction surgery? Keep the jokes to yourself, people, I'm serious.\nI'm interested in hearing if any guys had any problems, or if you're happy with your surgery, and what I should know going into this. Breast Reduction surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.	health

What is a mustard gas? Mustard gas compositon,formula ,uses,harmful effect The sulphur mustards, of which mustard gas is a member, are a class of related cytotoxic, vesicant chemical warfare agents with the ability to form large blisters on exposed skin. In their pure form most sulfur mustards are colorless, odorless, viscous liquids at room temperature. They are usually yellow-brown in color and have an odor resembling mustard plants, garlic or horseradish, which is how they got their name. However, these compounds have absolutely no relation whatsoever to culinary mustard.\n\nSulfur mustards are variations of "mustard gas" (bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide), which was first synthesised by Frederick Guthrie in 1860, though it is possible that it was developed as early as 1822 by M Depretz. V Meyer published a paper in 1886 describing a synthesis which produced good yields. Mustard gas is referred to by numerous other names, including HD, senfgas, sulfur mustard, blister gas, s-lost, lost, Kampfstoff LOST, yellow cross liquid, and yperite. The abbreviation LOST comes from the names Lommel and Steinkopf, who developed a process for mass producing the gas for war use at the German company Bayer AG. This involved reacting thiodiglycol with hydrochloric acid.\n\nMustard agents, including sulfur mustard, are regulated under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Three classes of chemicals are monitored under this Convention, with sulfur and nitrogen mustard grouped in the highest risk class, "schedule 1".	science
What is the best analogy for a black hole? Best analogy wins. keep it simple. :) An open plug hole in a bath full of water. All the water is captured by the plug hole. Nothing escapes.\n\nBlack holes are the evolutionary endpoints of stars at least 10 to 15 times as massive as the Sun. If a star that massive or larger undergoes a supernova explosion, it may leave behind a fairly massive burned out stellar remnant. With no outward forces to oppose gravitational forces, the remnant will collapse in on itself. The star eventually collapses to the point of zero volume and infinite density, creating what is known as a " singularity ". As the density increases, the path of light rays emitted from the star are bent and eventually wrapped irrevocably around the star. Any emitted photons are trapped into an orbit by the intense gravitational field; they will never leave it. Because no light escapes after the star reaches this infinite density, it is called a black hole.	science

How does natural selection help bacteria to sdapt to their environments?  Natural Selection is a process where the weaker individuals are "culled out" and only the stronger ones survive.  A good example of this concerning bacteria is the overuse of antibiotics.  Eventually, the resilient individuals will survive antibiotic treatment and become resistant to that particular antibiotic.  Eventually, that population will grow enough and be untreatable with that particular treatment and another antibiotic will have to be used.  Some speculate (myself included) that this is how Bird Flu was created except on a viral level instead of bacterial.  In summary, new environment (heat, cold, antibiotics, etc.) weaker bacteria die off, strong ones survive and propagate and therefore, live on. . . thus adaptation.  Hope this helps.	science
How does one manufacture nitric acid? It is the key chemical for smokeless powders. Nitric acid is made by mixing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with water. Creating a very pure nitric acid usually involves distillation with sulfuric acid, as nitric acid forms an azeotrope with water with a composition of 68% nitric acid and 32% water. Commercial grade nitric acid solutions are usually between 52% and 68% nitric acid. Commercial production of nitric acid is via the Ostwald process after Wilhelm Ostwald.\n\nNitric acid can be made from Copper(II) nitrate or by reacting 200 g of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 106 ml of 96% sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and distilling this mixture at nitric acid's boiling point of 83 °C until only a white crystalline mass, potassium hydrogen sulfate (KHSO4), remains in the reaction vessel. The obtained red fuming nitric acid may be converted to the white nitric acid. Note that in a laboratory setting, it is necessary to use all-glass equipment, ideally a one-piece retort, because nitric acid attacks cork and rubber, and leaks can be extremely dangerous.\n\nThe dissolved NOx are readily removed using reduced pressure at room temperature (10-30 min at 200 mmHg or 27 kPa). Obtained white fuming nitric acid has density 1.51 g/cm³. This procedure can also be performed under reduced pressure and temperature in one step in order to produce less nitrogen dioxide gas.\n\nThe acid can also be synthesized by oxidizing ammonia, but the product is diluted by the water also formed as part of the reaction. However, this synthesization method is important in producing ammonium nitrate from ammonia derived from the Haber process, because the final product can be produced from nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen as the sole feedstocks.\n\nWhite fuming nitric acid, also called 100% nitric acid or WFNA, is very close to the anhydrous nitric acid product. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2 % water and a maximum of 0.5 % dissolved NO2. Red fuming nitric acid, or RFNA, contains substantial quantities of dissolved nitrogen dioxide (NO2) leaving the solution with a reddish-brown color. One formulation of RFNA specifies a minimum of 17% NO2, another specifies 13% NO2. In either event, an inhibited fuming nitric acid (either IWFNA, or IRFNA) can be made by the addition of 0.6 to 0.7% hydrogen fluoride, HF. This fluoride is added for corrosion resistance in metal tanks (the fluoride creates a metal fluoride layer that protects the metal)	science
Not why?... How? When I took AP Chemistry last year, my teacher would tell me never to ask why, only how. And my father has explained to me that in Science, as in Math, you can't ask why because some things just are. My question is: Do people declare something as an "it just is" when Science can no longer probe its mysteries? Or is that just the furthest point Science has gotten or is needed to go to before exploration of the subject becomes unbeneficial to society? Hasn't anyone been curious enough to explain the whys... or just got too lost to explain them? Why implies there is a reason something happens.  There is no reason chemistry is the way it is (unless you want to attribute it to God, but that's not the question here).\n\nHow implies there is a mechanism by which something happens.  This can easily be tested, reported, critiqued, duplicated, etc.  \n\nScience does not declare something "just is".  Science tries to determine the mechanisms that govern our world, so we can best work within our world.  We cannot determine the reason these mechanisms exist.	science
help please - MATH? An automobile radiator contains 16 liters of antifreeze and water. This mixture is 30% antifreeze. How much of this mixture should be drained and replaced with pure antifreeze so that there will be 50% antifreeze?\n\n\nPlease explain so I learn. Here's how to think about it.  In the end you will be mixing so many liters of 30% mixture and so many liters of 100% mixture.\n\nLet a be the amount of 30% mixture.\nLet b be the amount of 100% mixture.\n\nAdded together these must equal 16 liters:\na + b = 16\n\nAlso, you want the mixture to equal 50%.\n30% x a + 100% x b = 50% x 16\n\nYou have two equations and two unknowns, so this should be solvable.\n\nLet's solve for a:\na = 16 - b\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n30% x (16 - b) + 100% x b = 50% x 16\n\nYou could do this all with decimal amounts (30% = 0.30, 50% = 0.50) etc.  But it is easier to just do them as whole amounts (30, 100, 50).  The answer will work out either way.\n\nDistribute through:\n30 x 16 - 30b + 100b = 50 x 16\n\nSimplify:\n480 - 30b + 100b = 800\n\nCombine like terms:\n480 + 70b = 800\n\nSubtract 480 from both sides:\n70b = 800 - 480\n70b = 320\n\nDivide both sides by 70:\nb = 320 / 70\nb = 32 / 7\nb = 4 4/7 liters\n\nSo you will need to drain 4 4/7 liters of the 30% mixture, then add 4 4/7 liters of the 100% mixture.\n\nAs a double check:\na = 11 3/7\nb = 4 4/7\n\n30% x 11 3/7 + 100% x 4 4/7 =? 50% x 16\n30% x 80/7 + 32/7 =? 8\n24/7 + 32/7 =? 8\n56/7 = 8 <-- check\n\nSo the correct answer is you must drain 32/7 liters, or 4 4/7 liters (as a mixed fraction).\n\nAs a decimal, the answer is approximately 4.571 liters.	science
why isn't anyone Else's favorite color clear? isnt clear a color also. A prizim is clear, yet it can reflect all color. Sorry but clear isn't a colour. And i think  a prism is a refraction of light not a reflection.In optics, a prism is a device used to refract light, reflect it or break it up (to disperse it) into its constituent spectral colours (colours of the rainbow). The traditional geometrical shape is that of a triangular prism, with a triangular base and rectangular sides. Some types of optical prisms are not in fact in the shape of geometric prisms.\n\nAs light moves from one medium (e.g. air) to another denser medium (the glass of the prism), it is slowed down and as a result either bent (refracted) or reflected. The angle that the beam of light makes with the interface as well as the refractive indices of the two media determine whether it is reflected or refracted, and by how much (see refraction, total internal reflection).\n\nReflective prisms are used to reflect light, for instance in binoculars, since they are easier to manufacture than mirrors. Dispersive prisms are used to break up light into its constituent spectral colours because the refractive index depends on frequency (see dispersion); the white light entering the prism is a mixture of different frequencies, each of which gets bent slightly differently. Blue light is slowed down more than red light and will therefore be bent more than red light. There are also polarizing prisms (also known as birefringent prisms) which can split a beam of light into components of varying polarization.\n\nIsaac Newton first thought that prisms split colours out of colourless light. Newton placed a second prism such that a separated colour would pass through it and found the colour unchanged. He concluded that prisms separate colours. He also used a lens and a second prism to recompose the rainbow into white light.	science

How do i become a movie agent? I have friends who act in some low budget movies and commericals how do i become an agent and land them some deals? Are there any resources or qualifications to have? well most agents have law degrees.  due to the legalities of everything and all the contracts you have to deal with.  But if these are people you know that would be willing to sign with you i would draft a contract and have them sign it.  The only problem is that you will need to do a lot of leg work in the beginning because noone will know who you are.  Youre also going to have to get them into acting unions because most bigger movies only take actors from the unions.  It is quite a process but if you put the work in you can be very successfull.	entertainment and Music

Is Eastenders getting unrealistic or am I just getting old? I think the stories are getting relly stupid.  I mean, why would Jane fancy Grunt?  Why would anyone think Pauline Fowler is a good catch? Yeah Pauline Fowler is annoying I agree but it wouldn't be the same if she wasn't in it moaning about something.  I don't think Grant is nice looking but there is something about him, just the bad boy look probably thats what actracts her plus if you with a dork like Ian you would be attracted to anything lol	entertainment and Music

I Need a good laugh, so got jokes.? If any one has a good joke i'll rate them for best answer.  Please i am so depresed right now. : ( "There was a midget down in Texas who complained to his buddy that his testicles ached almost all the time. As he was always complaining about his problem, his friend finally suggested that he go to a doctor to see what could be done to relieve the problem. The midget took his advice and went to the doctor and told him what the problem was. \n\nThe doctor told him to drop his pants and he would have a look. The midget dropped his pants. The doctor put him up onto the examining table, and started to examine him. The doc put one finger under his left testicle and told the midget to turn his head and cough-the usual method to check for a hernia. "Aha!" the doc and putting his finger under the right testicle, he asked the midget to cough again. "Aha!" said the doctor and reached for his surgical scissors. Snip, snip, snip, snip on the right side then snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip on the left side. \n\nThe midget was so scared he was afraid to look, but noted with amazement that the snipping did not hurt. The doctor then told the midget to get dressed and see if they still ached. \n\nThe midget was absolutely delighted as he walked around the doc's office and discovered his testicles were no longer aching. "Gee, what did you do, Doc?" he asked. \n\nThe doc replied, "I cut two inches off the tops of your cowboy boots.""	entertainment and Music
What  was the funniest movie you ever saw. Mine would be the Pink Panther with Peter Sellers.? Or any movie with Peter Sellers such as Being There and Dr. Strangelove. Pink Panther is classic and most excellent choice.  It transcends time and is always funny.  Midnight Run with Charles Grodin & Robert DeNiro, Annie Hall (Woody Allen, Diane Keaton) The In-Laws (the original one) The Jerk,  Meet the Parents (and Fockers) Shampoo (Warren Beatty)most recently I did love The Wedding Crashers	entertainment and Music
Ever have an embarrasing moment like these? I was at the Rio hotel having dinner with some friends in Las Vegas.  Some of us were playing Keno.  I won $10.  I gave the Keno ticket to the Keno runner, who was a tall, attractive dark skinned beauty.  I asked someone sitting with me, "Am I supposed to tip her or something?"  The Keno girl turned around quickly and looked at me, held up her hand, and half yelled "No!"  I was so embarassed that I gave her 5 bucks as a tip.\n\nOne time I saw this guy in a restaurant with a piece of toilet paper stuck to the bottom of his shoe - it was about a foot long - no kidding!  What made it even more funny, was this was a buffet restaurant - so he was walking around with tp on his shoe!\n\nHave one you want to share? I was playing linebacker in a football game, and instead of wrapping the player up like i was supposed to i pushed him exteremely hard instead. And of course, he happened to land in the endzone. :(	entertainment and Music

A nurse walks over to the first guy and says,"Congratulations!You're the father of twins!" "What a coincidence," he says. "I work for Twin City Federal." A while later, the nurse comes out to congratulate the second guy. "You are the proud father of triplets!" "That's funny," says the new dad. " I work for AAA." The third expectant father jumps up, a look of terror on his face, and runs out of the room. "Sir, where are you going?" the nurse calls out. He yells over his shoulder," I work for 10,000 Auto parts!"	entertainment and Music
