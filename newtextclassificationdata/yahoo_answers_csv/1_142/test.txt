binomial distribution? Is binomial distribution only describe ture experiments? wt about the natural experiment? The binomial distribution can describe both ture and natural experiments. A natural experiment occurs when your dog knocks over your jar of coins, and some of the coins land heads up and some tails up. If your dog does this many thousands of times, most of the time the coin distribution will be close to 50% heads and 50% tails, but hardly ever exactly 50% if you have lots of coins. But on some days you will get 75% heads and 25% tails, of course much less frequently than close to 50%. The binomial distribution describes the number of days that you will get each different kind of heads-tails outcome.\n\nAs for ture experiments, you are on your own.	science
Why does colored plastic turn white under stress?  Polymeric materials like plastic are made up of big molecules, and these very long molecules are disposed in a chaotic way, and there are links between molecules, It's something similar to a spaghetti dish and this structure is defined amorphous because there is no order. When plastic is put under stress these molecules are stretched and in that places the structure become more tidy , so it became crystalline, and crystalline structures are opaque, while amorphous structures are transparent.\nPigments are not important in this phenomenon.	science

how did paper get its name?answer in paragraphs?  The word paper comes from the ancient Egyptian writing material called "papyrus", which was woven from papyrus plants. \n\nPapyrus was produced as early as 3000 BCE in Egypt, and in ancient Greece and Rome. Further north, parchment or vellum, made of processed sheepskin or calfskin, replaced papyrus, as the papyrus plant requires subtropical conditions to grow. \n\nIn China, documents were ordinarily written on bamboo, making them very heavy and awkward to transport. Silk was sometimes used, but was normally too expensive to consider. Indeed, most of the above materials were rare and costly.\n\nArcheologically, true paper had been excavated in China dated from the 2nd-century BC. It spread slowly outside of China; other East Asian cultures, even after seeing paper, could not figure out how to make it themselves. Instruction in the manufacturing process was required, and the Chinese were reluctant to share their secrets. The technology was first transferred to Korea in 600 and then imported to Japan by a Buddhist priest.\n\nAfter further commercial trading and the defeat of the Chinese in the Battle of Talas, the invention spread to the Middle East, where it was adopted in India and subsequently in Italy in about the 13th century. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The oldest known paper document in the West is the Missel of Silos from the 11th century.	science
What adaptations does a xerophyte have that makes it able to store water? I need this for school?  Desert Plant Adaptations\nDesert plants have adapted to the extremes of heat and aridity by using both physical and behavioral mechanisms, much like desert animals.\n\nPlants that have adapted by altering their physical structure are called xerophytes. Xerophytes, such as cacti, usually have special means of storing and conserving water. They often have few or no leaves, which reduces transpiration.\n\nPhreatophytes are plants that have adapted to arid environments by growing extremely long roots, allowing them to acquire moisture at or near the water table.\n\nOther desert plants, using behavioral adaptations, have developed a lifestyle in conformance with the seasons of greatest moisture and/or coolest temperatures. These type of plants are usually (and inaccurately) referred to as perennials, plants that live for several years, and annuals, plants that live for only a season.\n\nDesert perennials often survive by remaining dormant during dry periods of the year, then springing to life when water becomes available.\n\nMost annual desert plants germinate only after heavy seasonal rain, then complete their reproductive cycle very quickly. They bloom prodigiously for a few weeks in the spring, accounting for most of the annual wildflower explosions of the deserts. Their heat- and drought-resistant seeds remain dormant in the soil until the next year's annual rains.\n\nXerophytes\nThe physical and behavioral adaptations of desert plants are as numerous and innovative as those of desert animals. Xerophytes, plants that have altered their physical structure to survive extreme heat and lack of water, are the largest group of such plants living in the deserts of the American Southwest.\n\nEach of the four southwestern deserts offers habitats in which most xerophytic plants survive. But each is characterized by specific plants that seem to thrive there. The Great Basin Desert is noted for vast rolling stands of Sagebrush and Saltbush, while in the Mojave Desert, Joshua Trees, Creosote Bush, and Burroweed predominate. The Sonoran Desert is home to an incredible variety of succulents, including the giant Saguaro Cactus, as well as shrubs and trees like mesquite, Paloverde, and Ironwood. The Chihuahuan Desert is noted for mesquite ground cover and shrubby undergrowth, such as Yucca and Prickly Pear Cactus.\n\nCactus, xerophytic adaptations of the rose family, are among the most drought-resistant plants on the planet due to their absence of leaves, shallow root systems, ability to store water in their stems, spines for shade and waxy skin to seal in moisture. Cacti originated in the West Indies and migrated to many parts of the New World, populating the deserts of the Southwest with hundreds of varieties, such as the Beavertail Cactus and Jumping Cholla.\n\nCacti depend on chlorophyll in the outer tissue of their skin and stems to conduct photosynthesis for the manufacture of food. Spines protect the plant from animals, shade it from the sun and also collect moisture. Extensive shallow root systems are usually radial, allowing for the quick acquisition of large quantities of water when it rains. Because they store water in the core of both stems and roots, cacti are well-suited to dry climates and can survive years of drought on the water collected from a single rainfall.\n\nMany other desert trees and shrubs have also adapted by eliminating leaves -- replacing them with thorns, not spines -- or by greatly reducing leaf size to eliminate transpiration (loss of water to the air). Such plants also usually have smooth, green bark on stems and trunks serving to both produce food and seal in moisture.\n\nPhreatophytes\nPhreatophytes, like the mesquite tree, have adapted to desert conditions by developing extremely long root systems to draw water from deep underground near the water table. The mesquite's roots are considered the longest of any desert plant and have been recorded as long as 80 feet. Botanists do not agree on the exact c	science

hey guess im doing a project and i really need ur help please!!!!!!!!!!? im doing a history project on the great wall of china and i dont know wat else i can write about please help The Great Wall of China (Simplified Chinese:  Traditional Chinese: Pinyin: Wànlĭ Chángchéng; literally "10,000 Li¹ long wall") is a Chinese fortification built from 3rd century BC until the beginning of the 17th century, in order to protect the various dynasties from raids by Mongol, Turkic, and other nomadic tribes coming from areas in modern-day Mongolia and Manchuria. Several walls were built since the 3rd century BC, the most famous being the Great Wall built between 220 BC and 200 BC by the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, which was located much further north than the current Great Wall of China built during the Ming Dynasty, and little remains.\n\nThe Wall stretches over a formidable 6,352 km (3,948 miles), from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Sea in the east, at the limit between China proper and Manchuria, to Lop Nur in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (refer to University of Washington: A. The Main Caravan Routes (b) The “Central Route” or “Middle Route.”)\n\nHISTORY \n\nA defensive wall on the northern border was built and maintained by several dynasties at different times in Chinese history. Its purpose, to defend the China mainland from nomadic Mongolians. There have been five major walls:\n\n208 BC (Qin Dynasty) \n1st century BC (Han Dynasty) \n7th century CE (Sui Dynasty) \n1138 - 1198 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period) \n1368 - 1640 (from Hongwu Emperor until Wanli Emperor of the Ming Dynasty) \nThe first major wall was built during the reign of the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. This wall was not constructed as a single endeavor, but was mostly the product of joining several regional walls built by the Warring States. The walls that were linked together at this time consisted of rammed earth with watch towers built at regular intervals. It was located much further north than the current Great Wall with its eastern end at modern day North Korea. Very little of this first wall remains - photos reveal a low, long mound.\n\nThe government ordered people to work on the wall, and workers were under perpetual danger of being attacked by brigands. Because many people died while building the wall, it has obtained the gruesome title, "longest cemetery on Earth" or "the long graveyard." Possibly as many as one million workers died building the wall, though the true numbers cannot be determined now.\n\nThe later long walls built by the Han, the Sui, and the Ten Kingdoms period were also built along the same design. They were made of rammed earth with multi-story watch towers built every few miles. These walls have also largely vanished into the surrounding landscape, eroded away by wind and rain.\n\nIn military terms, these walls were more frontier demarcations than defensive fortifications of worth. Certainly Chinese military strategy did not revolve around holding the wall, instead it was the cities themselves which were fortified.\n\nThe Great Wall which tourists visit today was built during the Ming Dynasty, starting around the year 1368 and lasting till around 1640. Work on the wall started as soon as the Ming took control of China but initially, walls were not the Ming's prefered response to raids out of the north. That attitude began to change in response to the Ming's inablilty to defeat the Oirat war leader Esen Taiji in the period 1449 to 1454. A huge Ming army with the Zhengtong Emperor at its head was anihilated in battle and the emperor himself held hostage in 1449.\n\nAppearently the real focus on wall building started as a result of Altan Khan's siege of Beijing which took place one hundred years later in 1550. The Ming, faced with the choice of trying to defeat the Mongols with direct military force, choose instead to build a massive defensive barrior to protect China. As a result, most of the Ming Great Wall was built in the period 1560 to 1640. This new wall was built on a grand scale with longer lasting materials (s	science

Why are the clouds before a tornado green?  While, dangerous thunderstorms that drop hail and spin up tornadoes seem to be routinely observed as turning green ("going green" in the movie Twister), scientists are trying to find out what exactly is going on. \n\nThey have confirmed that some thunderstorms do turn green, and have various theories about why. \n\nOne possibility is that thick, thunderstorm clouds, with their water vapor, rain and hail, scatter sunlight in such a way as to give the clouds a blue hue. \n\nWhen the sun is low in the sky, such as before sunset when most severe storms occur, the reddening light of the sun when shining through Earth's atmosphere makes the bluish cloud tint turn green. \n\nOr, maybe storm clouds act as a kind of canvas upon which low sunlight, scattered by particles in the air, paints a greenish color. \n\nBoth of these could be correct, and they may play in concert with each other to create the observed green tint. \n\nIn the spring of 1995, a University of Oklahoma graduate student used a special device called a spectrophotometer to measure the wavelength of light emitted from thunderstorm clouds during Project VORTEX, a major study of tornadoes. (Related: U. of Okla.: Green thunderstorm presentation).\n\nHis research confirmed green, greenish-yellow, and greenish-blue colors of the clouds, while ruling out lush farmland as the source of the green color. \n\nBut the researcher concluded that the actual green color observed may be different for different people. In other words, what may look strikingly green to one person, might be more greenish-blue or greenish-yellow to someone else. Maybe not even green at all. \n\nAll that's known for sure is that green thunderstorms do exist. It's not known whether all green thunderstorms are severe, nor whether all severe thunderstorms turn green.\n\nThe best advice: don't wait to see green clouds before seeking shelter from severe thunderstorms.	science
During sunrise and during moonrise on full moon nights, why does the sun and moon respectively appear large?

People tend to perceive objects on the horizon as larger than they really are, but you can destroy the illusion by looking at the horizon upside down. Really! I have tried it. And it is not only the Moon, but trees and buildings too. As you tilt your head more and more things on the horizon start to look smaller. I notice that sideways is enough tilt for me to see things on the horizon as noticeable smaller than when looking upright. The usual suggestion is to bend over and look at the horizon between your legs, but that is just to embarrassing for me so I tilt my head sideways until I am looking upside down to one side of my legs and notice the size changing when I am about half Way to being upside down. Try it, it is easy!	science

How WMAP  took picture in infrared of the universe aged about 400000 years old after the big bang ?? How COBE and WMAP could talk a picture in infrared of the universe aged about 400000 years old after the big bang ? The “Big Bang” really refers to one simple hypothesis:  that the Universe is expanding from a state when it was once much hotter and denser than it is today.  One can think of a “zero point” at which the Universe was unimaginably tiny, etc., and that point is what we often refer to as the “Big Bang,” but that presupposes a bit more than we need to.\n\nSo…  If the Universe was indeed once much hotter and denser than it is today, it may have been too hot and too dense for light to travel very far—a bit like the interior of a cloud, which is too dense for us to see inside.  We would then only “see” (i.e., be able to detect) radiation from a time after that epoch, after the Universe had cooled to the point that photons could zip around relatively unimpeded, as they do today.  That point in time corresponds to the equivalent of the surface of a cloud in our sky—also called the “surface of last scattering,” which isn’t a distinct, smooth surface at all, but kind of a fuzzy region that represents the limit of how far we can see into the cloud.  (Or, in the case of the Universe, the surface of last scattering, is the fuzzy boundary between when the Universe was too hot for light to travel far and when it was cool enough for photons to travel basically inifintely far.)\n\nSo far, so good (I hope).  It turns out that we can calculate the temperature at which this transition would took place—something like 3,000 Kelvins (or 5,000° Fahrenheit).  Something that hot should radiate light in a highly characteristic way, which we call “blackbody” radiation—the same effect that causes the Sun or other stars or a red-hot poker to glow a certain color.  As it turns out, a 3,000-Kelvin blackbody would glow reddish-orange—not just a single wavelength that we’d call “reddish-orange,” but a collection of wavelengths that peak around the color reddish-orange.\n\nBut wait!  The Universe is expanding, and light expands with it.  So that reddish-orange gets redshifted down into microwave light.  COBE and WMAP detect exactly the kind of microwave light we’d expect from a blackbody some 13 billion years in the past.  This is a remarkable confirmation of the Big Bang hypothesis.  Furthermore, we can look at the characteristics of the blackbody “curve” (another name for the collection of wavelengths of light emitted by stuff of a certain temperature) and determine lots of other things about the early Universe.  Including the time that the light was emitted, about 370,000 years after the “Big Bang.”\n\nOf course, other sources of microwave radiation get in the way, but because we’re looking for a collection of wavelengths (not just a single color, but a collection of colors that correspond to a specific temperature), we can weed out interference.  So we can determine which photons have travelled to us all the way from the early Universe, some 13 billion years ago.\n\nThe WMAP website explains all this pretty well, if you want another description:\nhttp://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html\n\nI hope that helps…\n\n\nRyan Wyatt\nRose Center for Earth & Space\nNew York, New York	science
Why do planets turn over the sun on ellipse ways?  The elliptical orbits are the result of Kepler's Law; the shape of a planet's orbit around a larger mass is a function of each planet's mass and the distance between the orbits.  One can derive the elliptical orbit path from Newton's Laws; when you start from Newton's Laws and perform this derivation, your result will be an equation in the form of an ellipse.\n\nSometimes orbits are not elliptical, but are circular.  Consider binary stars - when the masses of 2 binary stars is equal, the respective orbial path traced by each star is a cicrle in the complex plane, not an ellipse.\n\nBy the way, symmetry is one of the most natural phenomena observable.  To say that symmetry is not found in nature very often is an indication of lack of advanced physical and mathematical study.  Consider rings, field, and group theory.  Symmetric wavefunctions of identical particles and allowable energetic transition states in a molecule or, in some cases, an atom.  I could list 1000 different natural PERFECT symmetries based on solid foundations of laws of conservation and irrefutable mathematics, but only because I am limited as a human being in my knowledge of symmetrical processes.  There are many more than 1000 examples.  You get my point.	science

rubber band car? Hi...I have this project for physics to build a rubber band car. It HAS to go at least 4 meters, and we can use any types of rubber bands we like without a number limit. We can use any and all supplies (even already made cars). The only thing we can't use are electronic powered devices, so we have a very wide variety of choices. What is the best way to make a rubber band powered car that goes beyond 4 meters? I would say somehow build the car so that the untwisting of the rubber bands rotate one of the wheels or 2 wheels by way of an axle like the old toy wind up balsa airplanes work.	science

If we invent a device which makes us see all wave lengths of light, can we see god?  God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to.	science

What Kind of embalming practices are out there? I want to know more about different ways people do embalming or funerals or at least when a person dies. Embalming is a way to prepare a dead human body for a viewing or funeral. Essentially, embalming removes the blood and other fluids from the body and replaces it with chemicals which temporarily restore the appearance of the body, sanitize the surface of the body, and slow down the decomposition of the body. \nArterial embalming is done by opening an artery, pumping embalming fluid into it (usually mechanically), and draining the blood through a vein. Sometimes many arteries are used if the body condition warrants it. Any incisions are sealed. Arterial fluid usually contains a pink dye to restore an "capillary flush" look to a person.\nCavity embalming is done by removing all the contents of the hollow organs (stomach, lungs, intestines, etc.) with a   tube-like instrument hooked up to a suction machine. An entry point is usually near the navel and all the fluid and blood is removed from the pelvic, abdominal and thoracic cavities. A strong embalming fluid is then introduced to the cavities, and the entry point is sealed. \nMost people who are embalmed have both arterial and cavity embalming done. Often these procedures are followed by cosmetizing the person to restore their coloration.	science

What kinds of radiation have to be observed from the atmosphere? Visible light, x-rays, gamma rays, cosmic rays? "Electromagnetic radiation from space is unable to reach the surface of the Earth except at a very few wavelengths, such as the visible spectrum, radio frequencies, and some ultraviolet wavelengths. Astronomers can get above enough of the Earth's atmosphere to observe at some infrared wavelengths from mountain tops or by flying their telescopes in an aircraft. Experiments can also be taken up to altitudes as high as 35 km by balloons which can operate for months. Rocket flights can take instruments all the way above the Earth's atmosphere for just a few minutes before they fall back to Earth, but a great many important first results in astronomy and astrophysics came from just those few minutes of observations. For long-term observations, however, it is best to have your detector on an orbiting satellite ... and get above it all!"\n\nFor those frequencies that do get through, it's a lot cheaper to build the telescopes on the earth, even if you do need to put a lot of effort into correcting the wobble in the images caused by turbulence in the atmosphere. It's far cheaper to make a huge earth-bound telescope with fancy adaptive optics than it is to send up a space telescope... but you only get a few slices of the spectrum.	science

thank you for quick response,however im still at aloss.how do the atoms in a pencil for example"know" know that it is part of the eraser and not the metal fastner or the wood or the black ink in the name stamped inthe side?if they are constantly in motion why doesnt the pencil not begin to blur and dissisipate? .  The atoms in the pencil are in motion, but not freely in motion.  The atoms are bound up in molecules which make up crystaline or cellular structures.  The metal atoms in the eraser holder are part of the metal crystaline matrix.  The carbon and other atoms of the eraser are parts of organic molecules which form strands which are interlinked.  The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the wood are parts of cellulose molucules which formed the cell wall of the tree from which the wood was taken.  The "lead" of the pencil contains carbon molecules in fractured crystals of graphite, which are mixed with clay, which contains silicon, aluminum and oxygen in a crystaline structure.\n.  If you picture a ping pong ball tethered by a weak rubber band and knocked around by a mild shifting breeze, the ping pong ball would be "free" to move, but the rubber band would keep it moving about the same center.  A stronger breeze might have enough energy to break the rubber band and let the ping pong ball be blown wherever the wind goes.\n.  Atoms are of just the size that puts them on the brink of quantum mechanical uncertainty.  They are large enough that the uncertainty about their position is very small, even when their energy is know to a high degree of precision.  In quantum mechanics, this means that the amount they will wander is quite small, small enough that they remain bound to their neighbors in their molecular or crystaline arrangements.  Adding energy in the form of heat both increases the uncertainty about their position and increases the probability that their bonds will be broken.	science

What are the methods to solve an equation with more than one variable? First I would like to know how to solve equations that both have x, and y.I've managed before with help, but forgotten. Then, maybe examples of equations with 3 variables? I am sure such an equation is present in higher algebra and precalculus, and whatnot, but I'm curious.If anyone gives an example, how would the rules differ for a system of solving equations? Here is the rule: you have to have the same number of equations as you have variables to solve.  For example:\n\nx + y = 1\n\nx - y = 1\n\nHere you have two equations and two unknowns.  The process is to solve one equation for one of the variables, and substituting that into the other:\n\nx = 1 - y\n\n(1-y) -y = 1\n\nNow you solve the new equation for y:\n\n-2y = 0\ny = 0\n\nNow you plug y into any of the equations (preferably the easier one), and you get x.\n\nx + 0 = 1\n\nx = 1\n\nOf course this gets more complicated with each new variable and equation, but the process is the same.  You keep substituting until you get one equation with one variable.	science
why do some concrete mixes contain flyash? are there alternatives to flyash in a mix design? There are a few explainations.\n\n1.) Fly Ash is much cheaper than cement.  With the prices of natural gas and the fact that production of cement requires a rotary kiln that is heated by natural gas the cost of cement has gone through the roof.  From my understanding a ton of cement has increased in price by like 20% over the last year or so.\n\n2.) Fly Ash is a natural pozzulan and water reducer.  Fly ash lowers the water requirements of the concrete mix making for a much stronger concrete.  Fly ash slows early strength gains but increases late strength gains as well as increasing workability.  Think of it like this.  You put rocks in a jar and there's voids, then you fill in those voids with sand, water, and cement but there's still small voids so you use fly ash to fill those in.  You can still have voids and use other things to fill those in but that's for another question.\n\n3.) Fly Ash is a waste material (from coal fired power plants i believe don't quote me).  The federal government requires its use in some of its projects or at the very least recommends it.  It is considered a green material and i read an article in Concrete Construction magazine (Jan 2006 issue) about HVFA (high volume fly ash) mixes.  They will replace like 51% of the cement with Fly Ash in the mix and get tremendous late strengths out of the concrete.\n\nThese are three of the main reason's for the use of fly ash.  As sustainable building (green construction) continues to gain backing you'll probably find more use of fly ash in concrete.  Also with it being cheaper people will want it used.\n\nStrictly speaking Fly Ash DOES NOT increase the density of the concrete.  Fly Ash has a specific gravity of about 2.00 (meaning for a given volume it weighs 2 times the same volume of water), Cement has a specific gravity of about 3.15.  If you have 3 cubic feet of cement then it will weigh 589.68 pounds (3 x 62.4 x 3.15).  If you substitue 1.5 cubic feet of that for Fly Ash then you will have [(1.5 x 62.4 x 2.00)+(1.5 x 62.4 x 3.15)] or 187.2 + 294.84 = 482.04 lbs. (a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds i believe).  Fly ash actually lowers the unit weight of the concrete, because for a given volume it weighs 63.5% of what portland cement does.	science

The rules of math are always consistent.  I'm not really sure what you're asking about x, but different problems are solved in different ways.  In algebra, adding or subtracting x is usually enough to get your solution, while calculus often involves multiplying by x or dividing out powers of x.  More complicated math requires more complicated formulae, but that doesn't mean that the rules of the more basic formulae have been changed.	science

When I workout at night the effect doesn't seem to stay the next day.? I work out at night, about 30 or so minutes before I go to bed. I lift weights, I do sit-ups, push ups to try to get myself back inshape from being slightly obese, Im 5'11'' and weigh 187. After I workout I go and look at myself in the mirror and I think wow I look good, better than I did before. So I go to sleep and I wake back up and it seems, looks and feels like all the weight flab came back. Any insight to this? your not suppose to work out at night, you're suppose to do it first thing in the morning (wake up extra early) you will feel the effects for the rest of the day and sleep better at night	health
I have a question about my period....ladies can you help? Sometimes, like this month, when I get my period about halfway through the period the blood gets BRIGHT red and it looks slimy and mucuosy...(kinda how it is when you ovulate---that slippery substanse) but, it is like my blood is that way too ONLY when it is bright red....otherwise, it's just regular darker red w/clots....usually when it is BRIGHT red, there are no clots to be found....does this happen to anyone and if not, what do you think it sounds like....I plan on bringing it up with my OB/GYN in June, but I thought I'd check for similar experiences here first...thanks! The brighter the red, the quicker its come directly from the cervix. When you are having your period, you are going through a process of "getting rid" of the dead skin, mucous, etc that you aren't going to need to sustain a child that month.  The stuff that is coming out of you is perfectly normal.	health

My bodies tired but my mind seems restless, how can i go to sleep?  Self hypnotize yourself to sleep. Close your eyes. Picture a place that makes you the most happy..mountains,beach,green pastures, something you can picture in detail. Then begin to 'build' it in your mind. Begin with things closest to you and then work outwards, and as you imagine outwards imagine yourself moving slowly forward. It helps if you think the sentence"slowly I walk....." as you move outwards.\n Best way to describe it is for me to tell you mine I guess. I imagine the sky dark,the only light being the moon..it's full. I hear the ocean as it comes in and out. Slowly I walk toward it feeling cool sand on my bare feet. I creep closer and closer to the shoreline. First just my toes get submerged in the warm water, then my calves(you have to actually see and hear your imagery it'll take practice before you can do it real good.) Long imagery short I eventually end up fully submerged and swim slowly to the very bottom of the water where there is a small pin prick of light (the pinprick of light is important you need it in yours too) I slowly make my way to it and as I move closer it gets gradually bigger. If I'm still awake after I reach it I imagine going through it until I am on the other side which is sky blue and I 'float' through the air. You have to make your senses cooperate with you...hearing smelling and feeling everything imagined. This really works and it's a technique I read in a book years ago when I was younger. Can't remember the book just the technique. It puts me to sleep every time and everyone I have shared it with has found peaceful slumber also. Oh big detail make sure your room is quiet and dark unless the dark bothers you.	health
Is urticaria deseases harmful?  Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is a frequent complaint of patients in the ED. It consists of circumscribed areas of raised erythema and edema of the superficial dermis. Urticaria can be acute or chronic, and a variety of urticarial variants exist, such as hereditary angioedema and anaphylaxis. \n\nBy definition, the acute form of urticaria lasts less than 4-6 weeks, and the chronic form lasts more than 4-6 weeks. Although the treatment for urticaria is specific and straightforward, the list of causes is extensive. When a patient presents with acute urticaria within 24 hours of onset, a cause often can be determined. However, in many cases of both acute and chronic urticaria, the cause can be difficult or even impossible to determine. Thus, although the determination of the underlying etiology of urticaria represents a diagnostic challenge, the management of urticaria remains straightforward and generally successful.\nPruritus (itching) and rash are the primary manifestations of urticaria, and hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation are rare. Acute urticaria is usually self-limited and commonly resolves within 24 hours but may last up to 4-6 weeks. Chronic urticaria lasts more than 4-6 weeks. Neither acute nor chronic urticaria results in long-term consequences (other than depression) or death	health

I have a concern about the pill...? I have been on the pill for about 3 months, and it has been working great, but this month has been weird. Every so often I get those menstral cramp feelings, and I bled a little before I was supposed to start my period. Is that normal? Yes its very normal.  You are on your third month of the pill and your body IS still getting used to it.  Usually after the third month there are no more problems with the spotting and cramps before the period.  Some birth control even reduces your menstrual pain drastically  after the 3rd month.	health

Why we r yawning? When? How our body act? It's a mechanizm the body uses to regulate the O2 levels in the body tissues. If you are in a confined room you are more likely to yawn because of the decreased O2 levels in that room. When you are tired, you yawn because your body has decreased O2 levels in the tissue therefore when you yawn you actually take in a deep breath of air which helps elevate your O2 saturation rate.	health
Is there anyway to increase the size of penis witout using suppliments..?  Dear Buddy,\n\n   Suppliments and gadgets are all a huge scam. I don't care if it's endorsed by the pope himself, it's a ploy to get your money. The only way to increase penis size is through an operation. This operation is about $4,000 and will give you an extra 1in-2 1/2 in. So if you have the money go for it,but I think you should just focus on other aspects of pleasing your partner. A larger or longer penis won't lead to happiness, more dates, or a happier life. You'll just have a funny lookin longer penis. There are tons of ways to please your partner besides beating (him/her) down with your man stick.LOL So good luck and relax dude:)	health

when your arm feel funny? my arm fell like shake and could not stop it Did you feel any cramping at all? Sometimes this can happen from cramping, otherwise Spasticity (muscle spasms) tends to affects larger areas of the body - arm, leg, trunk, neck.. Which is what it sounds like you had/have.\nHere is a little information on muscle spasms in this is the case. \nhttp://www.alsa-or.org/treatment/MuscleSpasms.htm\n\nAs for what Fuschiahedgehog said above\nThat is just absurd to say "Could be anything from a seizure to a stroke" who seems to think they are a doctor.\nRidiculous!\nHere are the signs of a stroke to better educate yourself... I can almost see "Seizure" because epilepsy causes muscle spasms/seizures which can cause an arm to shake out of control, but usually there are more signs of a seizure than just that:\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4742\n\n\nAnyways, you are better off seeing a doctor other than reading what others have to say who have no medical background.\n\nEdit:\nFrom reading all of your questions I would strongly suggest you see a doctor right away... Fever and involuntary jerking/shaking can be a danger and something has to be causing it. If Insurance is a problem, there should be some form of clinic near you that can work with you.. Also an ER in a hospital can't turn you away and won't charge you on the spot.. usually they will work out some sort of payment plan as well.	health
anyone know what a septic infection, How could U get this inf, inside U? Please read this one,I'm scared HELP* I have a knee replacment some how I have ended up having a spetic infection around the knee replacement. They took the replacement out and now I have no knee inside, The Doc:said it my take up to a year to clear up, They had me on antb. though IV, at home for over 6 weeks, along with oral antb., They put a spacer inside,  where the knee was with antb. in the spacer. There I alot of heat  Sweeling, redness, heat,& pain, When I talk with the doctor. before the surgery in early April, after I have the surgery done. He treats me like another #  When I try to show him, what  is going on with my knee he changes the subject and tell me I have a drug problem, I think NOT I went into his office he grab my purse and took my pain pills. he said, He would send them to me in a week he has not. I am under pain mangment\nHe keeps trake of my med. That one week still has not happen at all. My ? is. what happen to the meds. I am in pain mangament. and he keeps close trake of how much pain meds, I have ! well.....  'need an answer' you state you are a medical professional. All I can say is thank god I dont have anything to do with you. What a closed mind. As someone also in the medical profession, what you allude to certainly does happen however you are being extremely judgemental here, and remember it's the internet here. sounds like you are purely siding with the doctor.... people usually do that to protect their own.\n\nI prefer to have an open mind and treat each patient as an individual, have in my mind the potential reasons why patients have complications... but assess each case on it's own merits.\n\n'treefrog' - nice answer. Hope you are going well.\n\nTo help the person asking this question however ----\n\nSepsis and septic infection literally means an infection around the site.. which has the potential to travel around the body and cause many more serious problems. It is not uncommon to have infections after a surgery. The professionals involved do everything they can to reduce the risk however  they cannot reduce the risk to zero. We all have bugs that live on our skin happily, healthily fighting off other viruses and bugs that we come into contact with. It's when these bugs get into your system, into a spot they shouldnt that they cause trouble. The treatment you have undegone is fairly standard for your condition and complication ( in regards to the antibiotics) It is vitally important that the infection get under control so that your knee surgery can finally be finished.\n\nHowever if you had told me this story... I would have the following concerns - \n\n1. Sounds like the doctor, by what you describe here, isnt listening to you, or is... but not allaying your fears. that is all about communication. If potentially he isnt hearing what you are saying, or not explaining things properly because you may be too upset to listen properly, my suggestion is to take a friend along to your next appointment. Have a list of questions written down and ask them, one by one. Do not give your doctor the list, just ask them the way you have written them - its your list, you need to understand it.\n\n2. The doctor removing medication from your handbag. I am afraid no professional has the right to do this. The medication is legally prescribed, you have had it legally dispensed from a pharmacist, it has your name on it. It is yours. My question here to him would be... why did you do that... why havent you sent them to me... If he thinks you may be starting to have an addiction to pain medication... then he has handled it poorly. Communication is the key again. He has taken your pain medication and not sent it.... maybe I can jump to conclusions like 'need an answer' did and say the doctor is taking the medication himself and he is addicted????\n\nAssumptions dont help. Getting you comfortable and pain free and on the right treatment is the goal here.\n\nTake a friend along, ask the questions, if you dont get satisfactory answers, then seek a second opinion. Maybe it isnt your fault, but a fault of the doctor in question.\n\nAfter all.... we are all human. sometimes everyone needs to be reminded of that. ( including you, 'need an answer' )	health

pain during intercourse? what might this possibly be? I have been tested already for every std possible even though I do not have unprotected sex. Sometimes when I wear a certain pair of jeans, I get pain in my pelvic region. I have regular pap smears. Also sometimes I get swelling in the left side of my pelvic area accompanying the pain. I have been to the doctor who does not do the proper testing, been to the ER when pain is severe for them to tell me nothing is wrong after doing NO testing whatsoever, give me an ibuprofen and send me home because I'm  uninsured. \nI need to know what this may be so I can demand that they check for it. Something is wrong and I need to find out what it is. please help. I do agree that you need a new doctor. First, you need to determine the kind of pain you are having during intercourse. Your doctor should do a thorough pelvic exam on you so that he can determine where the pain is located. If you are having pain in the entire vaginal region (as your question may suggest), you may have vulvar muscle degeneration, chronic vulvar pain, or a vaginal infection. Since the pain is exterior as well, it may not be endometriosis and it may not have anything to do with your uterus or ovaries. You should get a complete pap smear, a pelvic ultrasound or CT scan or MRI of your pelvis. You definitely need to go to a doctor who will take you seriously and will treat you, regardless of your insurance situation.	health

If a pill gets stuck in your windpipe and disolves, is it still effective?  Firstly, I'm guessing it was "stuck" in the esophagus.  If it were in the windpipe, the person wouldn't be able to break, speak, etc.  Second, most of the time when it feels as if a pill is stuck in the esophagus, it is really just a leftover feeling from going down without a lot of fluid to buffer it. And lastly :),  a liquid taken afterward would help get rid of the feeling and no matter what (unless it really is in the windpipe), it will be effective.	health

what is the difference between a nervous breakdown and a panic attack? And is there anyway a person (me) observing either behavior would be able to distinguish the two states? Nervous breakdown: What is it?\nWhat is a nervous breakdown? What causes people to have them?\n- Linda / Minnesota\nMayo Clinic psychiatrist Daniel Hall-Flavin, M.D., and colleagues answer select questions from readers.\nAnswer\n\nNervous breakdown is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses. It's not a medical term, and it doesn't indicate a specific mental illness. Generally, it describes a person who is severely and persistently emotionally distraught and unable to function at his or her normal level.\n\nOften, when people refer to having a nervous breakdown, they're describing severe depression. Signs and symptoms of severe depression include:\n\n    * Agitation or restlessness\n    * Difficulty or inability to stop crying\n    * Sleeping difficulties\n    * Indecision\n\nThe causes of mental illness usually aren't clear. But these factors may play a role:\n\n    * Stress\n    * Drug and alcohol use\n    * Co-existing medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders and certain vitamin deficiencies\n    * Genetics\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nervous-breakdown/AN00476	health

how to cure multiple personality disorder?  DID is usually caused by some sort of early trauma, usually severe, sustained trauma like abuse, living on the streets, being a refugee, etc. Memories and experiences that are too much for a young child are then "given" to a separate personality, who is strong enough to handle them. \n\nWhen a psychiatrist deals with a person with more than one personality, he usually has to start out dealing with each one separately... The goal is to get them "talking" to each other, and cooperating. Ultimately, they may re-integrate into a single personality again. Before this can happen, the original trauma usually has to be dealt with and accepted as part of the person's past.\n\nMedicines can help--depression, PTSD, and anxiety are very common comorbids to DID, and these often respond to various antidepressants, tranquilizers, and antipsychotics. However, most of the work is done by the patient in counseling; the medicines in this case are helpers but not the main treatment.	health

Prescriptions? Why does rx mean prescription? "Rx" and "medical prescription" are sometimes used interchangeably. The use of Rx in prescriptions originated as an astrological symbol that was written for talismanic reasons at the start of medical prescriptions. Later it changed into ℞ (an uppercase R with its tail crossed), and was used as an abbreviation for the Latin word recipe = "take" (imperative), i.e. an instruction to the pharmacist to take the items listed in order to prepare the medicine. When printing came, it was rendered as "Rx".	health

You need to stand up for yourself and don't let any rude comments get in your way. I don't let any one stay in my way by saying mean things to me. I just brush it off and that is what my friends love about me. My best friend is like are you offended. I was like no. He kept saying he thinks he is fat and he is so not fat. I don't think he has a 6 pack or anything. I can tell you one thing, don't let your weight affect you like it did to my best friend. I still care about him and I am always there for him no matter the situation and I love him to death. I won't let anyone be mean to my friends and to me. You need to keep your head high and don't care what other people think. Just do your own thing. I hope everything goes well but don't feel bad about what your body looks like.

When you approach a staircase is your first instinct to run up it?  no, but i want to skip certain steps for no reason at all.  not because i'm in a hurry, nor because there is something wrong with the step.  sometimes i have to make sure to stand on certain steps for a period of time for no rational reason.  when i descend a staircase, i have to count each and every step	health

what are regulated drugs?  Regulated drugs are drugs that are considered "controlled drugs", usually that means that they are addictive and they are monitored by the doctors, pharmacy and I THINK the government (not sure about that one).

How do you help a friend who is cutting her arm to relieve stress? I have a friend who suffers from anxiety, stress, and depression. Nothing seems to be going right or helping. She has eating issues and everyone is worried. To releave her stress she has resulted back to cutting her arms. I know she won't really cut her wrists as a suicide attempt. But I hate seeing her suffer though, and I don't know how to make her stop cutting. She needs other options. Make sure she has clean blades and wipes her arm down with alcohol first. You don't want her getting an infection.	health
Swollen diabetic feet shoes? Hello, my motehr in law suffers from diabetes and her feet are always swollen ,she usually uses slipers but I will like her to have comfortable shoes that fit her feet, do anybody know where to get very wide shoes, not the XTRA WIDTH they sell at regular stores but very wide shoes. thanks.\n\nLou It may be more than just swollen feet and/or diabetes.  Does she constantly work on her feet?  Is she grossly overweight?  How is her blood glucose control?  Many things come together to determine diabetic foot problems and the sorting out of them is better left to her diabetic Dr and a good podiatrist . Second guessing is dangerous, it could also be her heart or kidneys  or something known as Charcot Foot disease.  Know exactly what the underlying problem is before you self treat.  Living with diabetes is hard enough without foolishly putting yourself in harms way. Good Luck! PS The pros know where to find the shoes too!	health
Regarding Yoga: Any inofmation on the Plough position? I HAVE BEGUN A YOGA SCHEDUAL, ON MY OWN, AS I AM A STUDENT AND CANNOT PAY FOR A TRAINER, BUT I AM MOVING ALONG QUITE NICELY.

I'd strongly recommend you to do either of the below:\n1. Find a good teacher and show him/ her how you do the pose for diagnosis\n2. If you cannot afford #1, stop doing the pose\n\n#1 is preferred to #2 if you can afford.\n\nIf you intend to continue learning on your own, remember this: Despite all the potential benefits of yoga, it can also do harm if not careful.	health
what natural home remedy prevents razer bumps and ingrown hair bumps?  take a loofah and scrub the area to be shaved more coarsely than you would if it were soapy and you were just washing your body.  the scrubbing will prevent as many ingrown hairs, and will also allow the area to be smoother longer, because you're scrubbing away dead skin, and shaving at the new skin level.  it might not sound like that big of a difference, but we're talking like 2 bonus days here, depending on how fast your hair grows.	health
what is the best way to work out your inner thighz?  Do a variety of hip adduction exercises (movements that bring your leg sideways across your body). You can do this by squeezing a stability ball between your legs. You can use a multi-hip machine or hip adduction machine at the gym. You can also use a resistance band; connect one end securely around an object, such as the leg of a bed. Connect the other end around your ankle. Stand with your side to the place where the resistance band is connected and with the ankle that has the resistance closer to the wall (other foot out). Stand far enough from the wall so that there is some resistance to moving your foot. Now slowly bring your foot with the resistance band forward and across in front of your other leg (so your legs are crossed) and bring it back to regular standing position. Use the wall/bed/furniture for balance.	health

What are the side effects of 1.-ripped fuel (or any fat burning pill)and 2. Buying protein powder? I am on my second month of weight lifting and there are so many products on the market! Is the protein poweder only for men? Should I buy whey or soy protein, And When I should use it? How about fat burning caffeine loaded pills? Should I or shouldn't I use them? What about creatine? 1. Fat burning pills\nMost of them contain random herbs, caffeine, and green tea. With the exception of ephedra, common side effects would be jitters (from caffeine), alertness / insomnia, decreased appetite, and possible increased heart rate. With ephedra-based, every one of those side effects would be enhanced. I take them not for weight loss but to stay awake in the morning. Studies are mixed as to whether they actually promote weight loss. I would be cautious about exercising while taking any pill containing ephedra, especially high intensity. \n\n2. Protein\nHow "intense" are your weight workouts? Are you getting enough protein in your diet? 1.6g of protein per kg of bodyweight is enough, so unless you're not eating right or are training intensely I wouldn't worry about protein powder. Whey is a fast acting protein and is typically taken directly after a workout to get protein to muscle quickly. Cassein (sp) is a slower protein that would be taken during the day. I wouldn't buy soy protein unless it's already part of your diet. Protein powders can be used by anyone. Women should only avoid the hormones and prohormones on the market.\n\n3. Creatine\nCreatine won't hurt you, but unless you care about larger muscles / increased strength it's not important. Most people (that are not vegans) get enough creatine through diet ie. meat. Beware that some people are non-responders, which means consuming creatine has no effect as their muscles have enough of it. Responders see an increase in muscle size and in some cases muscle strength. There are hundreds of studies of creatine and results vary.\n\nJohn	health

Am I Depressed? i found out a while ago that i wasnt allowed to return back to my home overseas. Ever since then i have been agruing with my freinds all the time, and been angry or sad all the time and im just not happy, am i depressed or just unhappy? You dont need a doctor..all a doctor is going to do is give you medication and way to may people are on medication that dont need to be. I know because my doctor tried to do the same thing to me and I dont need medication. Your depression sounds situational..in fact the reason you are depressed is because you cannot go home. You really want to go home so your frusterated that your not getting what you want. All you can do is be patient and accepting of the situation you are in now and make the most of it..try and be kind to your friends, and speak to those who may have similar experiences to yours. If worse comes to worse speak to a councellor, but dont run off to the doctor and get meds unless you feel like killing yourself etc. Im sure once you come to terms with not getting what you want youll feel a bit happier again.,	health

Please help me :( Why am I so worried? Ahh, okay here I go. I know this may sound stupid to most of you, but I don't know :( Well, I was with this guy from September 8th -12th and although we did not engage in sexual intercourse, I gave him a handjob and he fingered me. Although his fingers weren't like "dripping" with his semen or anything, I'm worried MAYBE there might have been *some* of it on him. He also never went inside of me, he was just rubbing "down there"\n\nWell, I got my full period three days later (on Sept. 15) and got my period again on (although it was late like 2-3 days) October 16th. Usually, I spot around ovulation, but this month I didn't. My breasts hurt a lot and stuff, and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated (Oct. 31st) I should have my period next week some time, if everything is "normal"\n\nThe question is, is there any way that I could still be pregnant? I am SO worried, I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head. I understand I am not ready for this stuff. Any help is appreciated. I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do). Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck, enjoy yourself!	health

Why does eating  asparagus make your urine smell funny?  "As you clearly know, the human digestive processes are typically able to break asparagus down into smelly by-products with an amazing quickness, often within 15 to 30 minutes after eating. When you use the lavatory, those odorific by-products are released as a rather pungent form of "asparagus urine." \n\nThe website WebMD blames this smell on the break-up of a chemical called mercaptan. That said, asparagus contains a half-dozen sulfur-based chemicals identical ones found in other such lovely smells as rotten eggs, garlic breath and skunk spray. There is some controversy in the scientific community over exactly which by-product, or combination of by-products, causes the asparagus urine smell. The first published study on the phenomenon, written in 1891 by a man going by the name of "Nencki," found that the smell was caused by a metabolite called methanethiol. So far, this conclusion seems about as sound as any.\n\nBut the story of asparagus urine is far from ending there. Some people eat asparagus, go to the restroom, and-amazingly-no smell. Further research suggested that, likely due to genetics, some people did not possess the enzymes required to create asparagus urine. Perhaps you've heard it said that a person who's pee smells after eating asparagus has high intelligence? Well, maybe there is some genetic corollary for that. (Just kidding, all you eugenicists out there!) \n\nTo complicate matters even further, however, around 1980 a scientist had the good sense to pass the urine of the non-asparagus urine population in front of the noses of the asparagus urine population, and lo-and-behold, many found they could smell that asparagus urine smell. People are now debating whether genetics controls the ability to produce asparagus urine, the ability to smell asparagus urine, or possibly both."\n\n http://www.greenworks.tv/askgreenworks/asparagus.htm	health

what is vipera? homeopathic It is actually a homeopathic remedy, not herbal.  It is made from the venom of a viper (snake).  \n\nHomeopathic remedies use the original substance, in this case the venom, and dilute it greatly via a methed called potentization.  This is said to remove any toxic properties of the substance, but to keep in tact the healing aspects of the remedy.  The urls listed previously have some decent information, but homeopathy can be very complex and it is often better to seek professional help for homeopathic treatment.\n\nThe number and letter next to the name indicate the potency, or how diluted it is.  There are two scales, C for x100 and X for x10.	health
Aren't STDs(Sexually Transmitted Diseases) called STIs(Sexually Transmitted Infections) now?  Sometimes the terms STI and STD are used interchangeably. This can be confusing and not always accurate, so it helps first to understand the difference between infection and disease. Infection simply means that a germ – virus, bacteria, or parasite – that can cause disease or sickness is present inside a person’s body. An infected person does not necessarily have any symptoms or signs that the virus or bacteria is actually hurting their body (they do not necessarily feel sick). A disease means that the infection is actually causing the infected person to feel sick, or to notice something is wrong. For this reason, the term STI – which refers to infection with any germ that can cause an STD, even if the infected person has no symptoms – is a much broader term than STD. \n\nThe term STD refers only to infections that are causing symptoms or problems. Because most of the time, people don’t know they are infected with an STI until they start showing symptoms of disease, the AIDS Resource Center uses the term STD, even though the term STI is also appropriate in many cases.\n\nDepending on the STI, a person may or may not still be able to spread the infection if no signs of disease are present. For example, a person is much more likely to spread herpes infection when blisters are present (STD) than when they are absent (STI). However, a person can spread HIV infection (STI) at any time, even if they haven’t developed symptoms of AIDS (STD).	health

What are LP's and EP's? I know that bands release albums that are either LP or EP, and I fairly certain that LP's are full length albums, but what does it stand for and what do they mean? Terms from the days of vinyl records. As I worked in a record store selling Vinyl for 2 years during the 80s, I got to work intimately with them... so...\n\nLP = Long Play (full length album) - 33 1/3 speed\nEP = Extended Play (as in extended from a single) - 33 1/3 speed\nSingle = one song a side - 45 speed\n\nLP records could be a maximum of about 40 minutes with microgrooving, less without.\nEP records were from 3-20 minutes (as I recall).\n\nAn LP could hold 5-6 songs per side.\nAn EP could hold 1-3 (cramped at 3) per side.\nA single could hold one song per side.\n\nHow they were used.  Bands generally used LPs for full length album releases.  EPs were used commonly to release a short album release (a few songs or extended remix singles).  The EP format was also typically used on 12" singles.  12" singles also ran 33 1/3 speed.  45's (singles) were obviously used to release two songs from an album (not usually remixes).\n\nSizes for vinyl include 12", 10" and 7" diameter.  EPs could be 10" or 12".  LPs were only 12".  45's were only 7".  \n\nAnd finally, there were picture disks.  These were a special process to overlay the vinyl grooves on top of a picture.  They were generally heavier and the vinyl didn't hold up as long.  Picture disks were, as I recall, always 12" in size.	entertainment and Music

Who is Stravinsky?  Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Russian: И́горь Фёдорович Страви́нский Igor' Fëdorovič Stravinskij) (June 17, 1882 – April 6, 1971) was a Russian-born composer of modern classical music. He composed in the primitivist, neo-classical and serialist styles, but he is best known for three works from his earlier, Russian period: Le sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring), Petrushka and L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). For some, these daring and innovative ballets practically reinvented the genre. Stravinsky also wrote in a broad spectrum of ensemble combinations and classical forms. His oeuvre included everything from symphonies to piano miniatures.\n\nStravinsky also achieved fame as a pianist and conductor, often at the premieres of his own works. He was also a writer. With the help of Alexis Roland-Manuel, Stravinsky composed a theoretical work entitled Poetics of Music. In it, he famously claimed that music was incapable of "expressing anything but itself". Robert Craft transcribed several interviews with the composer, which were published as Conversations with Stravinsky.\n\nA quintessentially cosmopolitan Russian, Stravinsky was one of the most influential composers and artists of 20th century music, both in the West and in his native land. He was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people of the century.\n\nStravinsky was born in Oranienbaum (now Lomonosov), near St. Petersburg, Russia. Brought up in St. Petersburg and dominated by his father and elder brother, Stravinsky's early childhood was a mix of experience that hinted little at the cosmopolitan artist he was to become. Although his father Fyodor Stravinsky was a bass singer at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Stravinsky originally studied to be a lawyer. He switched to composition later. In 1902, at the age of 20, Stravinsky became the pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, probably the leading Russian composer of the time.\n\nStravinsky left Russia for the first time in 1910, going to Paris to attend the premiere of his ballet L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). During his stay in the city, he composed two further works for the Ballets Russes—Petrushka (1911) and Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring) (1913). The ballets trace his stylistic development: from the L'oiseau de feu, whose style draws largely on Rimsky-Korsakov, to Petrushka's emphasis on bitonality, and finally to the savage polyphonic dissonance of Le Sacre du printemps. As Stravinsky noted about the premieres, his intention was "[to send] them all to hell". (He succeeded: the 1913 première of Le sacre du printemps was probably the most famous riot in music history).\n\nStravinsky displayed an inexhaustible desire to learn and explore art, literature, and life. This desire manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations. Not only was he the principal composer for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russes, but he also collaborated with Pablo Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), Jean Cocteau (Oedipus Rex, 1927) and George Balanchine (Apollon Musagete, 1928).\n\nRelatively short of stature and not conventionally handsome, Stravinsky was nevertheless photogenic, as many pictures show. He was still young when, on 23 January 1906, he married his cousin Katerina Nossenko whom he had known since early childhood. Their marriage endured for 33 years, but the true love of his life, and later his partner until his death, was his second wife Vera de Bosset (1888-1982). Although a notorious philanderer (even rumoured to have affairs with high-class partners such as Coco Chanel), Stravinsky was also a family man who devoted considerable amounts of his time and expenditure to his sons and daughters. One of his sons, Soulima Stravinsky, was also a composer, but is little known compared to his father.\n\nWhen Stravinsky met Vera in the early 1920s, she was married to the painter and stage designer Serge Sudeikin, but they soon began	entertainment and Music

Why do most cars have speedometers that go up to at least 150 when you legally can't go that fast on any road?  First, the Speedometer predates the Speed Limit.\n\nSecond, they tried reducing the numbers on the Speedometer and drivers didn't like it. In fact, they paid extra to buy racing gauges.\n\nAnd Third, speedometers are usually spring activated. The more the go to the right the more the spring is strained. Over time the sping gets spung and the needle begins to float and stick and give you inacurate readouts. So. if you keep the needle on the left hand side of the dial it should keep functioning longer and designing the dial to do so makes perfect sense.	entertainment and Music

What is this Simpsons episode a reference to? I don't remember what season this was in, but Homer gets a computer and starts his own investigative blog. He wins a Pulitzer prize, but realizes that if he simply makes outrageous stories up, he can attract a larger audience. One of these fantastical stories turns out to be true and Homer uncovers an immense international conspiracy. To make sure that he doesn't talk they kidnap him and take him to "the Island". What is "the Island" a reference to? The setting, rituals, and characters that are on the Island all seem to come from somewhere but I don't know where. Any help would be great.

why are tennisballs fuzzy? doesnt the fuzz make more air resistance and stuff like that? the point of the fuzziness is so that it can grab the tennis court better than a smooth ball.

What's your opinion about Australian cricket players using abuse words against oponents in the field?  locktheglock...I dont think the game of cricket has anything to do with speaking/writing english. If you think so you are a hell of a racist, I know where you are coming from. \n\nAnyways, getting back to the question, I think over the years Austrailan cricket team is getting a little better over verbal abuse. If we are talking about the time before 2004, Austrial cricketers did use foul language on the ground despite the fact that ICC doesn't allow it. Anyways, from what I have seen in last year, they are calming down. The verbal abuse has gotten lesser.	sports
Who should the 49ers draft in the 1st round of the 2006 NFL draft? I would like to hear who you think, and why? If you think they should trade, what should the trade be? Keep in mind they have both the 6th pick and the 22nd pick From everything ive been reading the 49ers have two players that are their top picks, AJ Hawk from The Ohio State and Mario Williams NC State.  There have also been reports that their reasoning for trading theit  second and third round picks with Denver was to position themselves to move up to the top 3, the thinking would be that Williams and Hawk will both be gone at 6.  But for the question asked I'll assume they stay put.\n\nFor the 6th pick Id go with Michael Huff.  Its really a bit of a reach at this high a pick, but I believe that his versatiltiy of playing either corner or saftey in the NFL would benefit the very thin defensive backfield of the 49ers. \n\nAs for the 22nd pick, it would be ideal if either WR Santonio Holmes of The OSU or Chad Jackson from Florida were available to select one of them.  Another option ive been hearing of lately would be DE/OLB Manny Lawson, but any 49er fan knows that the offense is miles behind the defense in every aspect.	sports

baseball university? My son is in grade 12 here in Canada where he attends a baseball academy.  He is undecided where he wants to go for University.

He is also a great hockey player but is looking for a career in baseball.  He is wanting a good program in Chemical Engineering.  does any one have any ideas on a great school. If his SAT is high, and he has a good class rank, he should check out the University of Notre Dame, located in South Bend, Indiana. Depending on where you live in Canada, it may not be that far away. \n\nThe academics are second to none, and the baseball team went to the College World Series two years in a row two years ago.

What is the difference between the Champions league and the UEFA? What is the difference and WHO and HOW do teams qualify for both of them, thanks. Champions League (More prestigious)\nAli sort of had it, but it is more complicated than the top four teams from each country league qualify.  The different countries have rankings based on how good the league is.  The top 3 leagues each get four teams, the leagues ranked 4-6 have three teams, the leagues ranked 7-15 get two teams, and leagues ranked 16 and lower get one team.  So the Spanish league, ranked number one, gets four teams qualified, while the Dutch league, ranked number seven, gets two teams qualified.  But then it gets even more complicated because they don't all enter the tournament at the same time.  The champions from the top 9 ranked leagues all automatically get to the group stage (32 teams in total), along with second place teams from the top 6 ranked leagues and the Champions League returning winner.  The other 16 teams come from previous round qualifying stages.  The link provided has a good breakdown of all the stages.\n\nUEFA Cup is basically the best teams that don't make it to the Champions League.  In fact, some teams that get eliminated from the Champions League in the group stage get thrown back into the EUFA cup competition.  \n\nCheck out the link.  \nThe second link shows the ranking of the leagues (scroll down to where it says "League Coefficients")	sports

is judo a good form of martial arts to learn for fitness?  I think the answer to this question depends on the type of dojo you train at. I trained in judo and at my dojo, the first hour was nothing but cardio drills, footwork, push ups, abdominal work with medicine balls, calisthenics, stretching,etc. Then the next hour was actual Judo where we learned techniques with repositioning, throws (Tachi waza) as well as ground fighting (Ne waza), pins, joint locks, arm bars,etc. Even the second hour was tough because it takes energy to grapple. That was my school. Other judo schools, you will just see a bunch of fat guys standing around working on throws and what not. But overall, I think Judo is great for fitness.	sports

Who will win more NBA championships, post-Shaquille O'Neal, Dwayne Wade or Kobe Bryant?  Kobe Bryant simply because he is learning how to be a team player. He was averaging 6.3 assists in the playoffs. He knows that he has a quality team, they just need someone else to complete the triangle. Ron Artest would have been the perfect addition.  I think that the Lakers are going to find a really good center this off-season. They are in the building mode right now. Give them a few years, and they will be hot. But, the Heat on the other hand have many players that are on their way out the door. Payton, Mourning, Shaq... all players that will retire in the next 5 years. Who will Wade be left with?

His uniform number is 42, which has been retired by all Major League Baseball teams since 1997 in honor of Jackie Robinson.

Given the many uniform numbers retired by the Yankees, it is very likely his number would have been retired by them after his career ended anyway.	sports

Why didn't Roy Oswalt win the Cy Young Award? Please, no answers saying he didn't get enough votes. It was a tough call, and it just went against Oswalt.  He had the best ERA, but he pitched fewer innings than Webb, had one fewer win, and had a slightly higher WHIP.  Oswalt may also have been overshadowed by his teammate Roger Clemens, who had better numbers albeit over fewer innings.\n\nYou could definitely make the argument for Oswalt, just as you could for Webb or Carpenter.  This was a tough voting year.\n\nEDIT - You're right about Adam Everett - He's by far the best defensive shortstop in baseball by any measure, but he never gets the credit.

How can I meet Ozzie Guillen in person?  I am sure that if you go to see a Chicago White Sox game and got to the ballpark early you might be able to meet Ozzie Guillen and a few of the players. Or go online to the Major League Baseball website and go to the Chicago White Sox site and look and see if they have a way to contact the ballpark. I know this isn't much but I hope that it helps. I don't live in Chicago and I am not a real fan of the White Sox so I don't know do much about them.	sports

What does it mean when a pitcher is in the stretch? I hear the commentators talking about it all the time but I never figured out exactly what is and what it means.  How does it affect the pitcher/strategy? It is when a runner is on base. The pitcher has to "hold" the runner on, meaning keep him close to first so he doesn't steal second. If he was in the wind-up (his regular motion), the runner could get an enormous jump to steal second. In the stretch, he holds the runner better. \n\nThe stretch is basically pitching without the wind-up. The pitcher comes to a set (hands come down to a point and he pauses) before raising his leg and going home. Compare that to a full wind-up and you'll notice a huge difference.	sports
Can the Florida Gators still make it to the National Championship if they win the SEC Championship? I know OSU is #1, then USC, next Michigan, and finally Florida. But can a win in the SEC Championship get them enough points to pass USC. When USC beats UCLA, no chance. If USC does not win then Michigan would get in. I do not think Florida will have enough points to get to #2. Their strength of schedule is hindering them. The SEC Conference is down this year and their out of conference schedule is not very impressive. That is why they will be left out.	sports
