One will obviously go for a new project, say implementing a CBIS(Computer Based Information System) if and only if it is feasible, i.e., profitable if taken. Before going for a new project, the following feasibilities are checked:\n  - Technical Feasibility (is it profitable and affordable \n           to adopt the new Technology ? ) \n  - Economic Feasibility (Will the current investment of \n       money bring profit ? ) \n  - Operational Feasibility (Will the new system be\n       affordable to operate ? Can the existing users use \n       it or can they be trained or new staff will have to \n       be recruited ? What will be the overhead (cost) ? )\n  - Social Feasibility ( Will the new system be socially \n       accepted ? )	computers and internet

What is the ALT code for the "heart" symbol?  The Character Map on your pc has a heart under.  "symbols".\n\nGo to "start" "programs" "accessories" "system tools"...then "character map"....scroll down to symbols.  (You can use your arrow up and down keys to get there faster.)\n\nGood Luck.\n\nHold down the ALT key and then press numbers on the num pad. When you let go, it will type a symbol such as this smiley face: ☺ (ALT + 1).\nA heart is ALT + 3: ♥. You can press more than one number, though, such as ALT + 1 + 3: ♪. Similar things are usually grouped together, so ♥ is ALT + 3, ♦ is ALT + 4, ♣ is ALT + 5, and ♠ is ALT + 6. Experiment and you will find many more.\n\nAnother way of doing it is to type special codes for certain entities such as &hearts ; (without the space inbetween the code and the semicolon) which is ♥. Here is a list of a bunch of them: http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40...\n\nIf you're using Windows then a third way is to go to start > all programs > accessories > system tools > and character map (or just go to run and enter charmap). Then search for what you want, select it, copy it, and paste it wherever you want. For example, I found this in character map: ♫.   I found this under another answer.	computers and internet

Car manufacturers also own the towing services that come and take us to the nearest gas stations that OH, incidentally, the car manufacturers own too.

Is there a law in PA that FORCES generic drugs on you? My husband just went to our local drugstore to pick up his Rx for Flonase, which he's done for over a year. He got home and realized they'd given him a generic instead.

Is the crusty stuff in your eyes when you wake up good or bad?

Is it caused by something & can you reduce the amount?\nI'm still rubbing it out of my eyes now! If you have more than just a little and if it's gluing your eyes shut, you need to see your eye doctor.  It's possibly a sign of a bacterial infection (maybe conjunctivitis).  Don't put salt water in your eyes - it will just irritate them.  If you need to, you can irrigate a little with artificial tears, sterile saline, or contact lens solution.  But get yourself to your eye doctor so that you can be treated properly.	health

Any man here had breast reduction surgery? Keep the jokes to yourself, people, I'm serious.\nI'm interested in hearing if any guys had any problems, or if you're happy with your surgery, and what I should know going into this. Breast Reduction surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Forerunners Healthcare .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.	health

What is a mustard gas? Mustard gas compositon,formula ,uses,harmful effect The sulphur mustards, of which mustard gas is a member, are a class of related cytotoxic, vesicant chemical warfare agents with the ability to form large blisters on exposed skin. In their pure form most sulfur mustards are colorless, odorless, viscous liquids at room temperature. They are usually yellow-brown in color and have an odor resembling mustard plants, garlic or horseradish, which is how they got their name. However, these compounds have absolutely no relation whatsoever to culinary mustard.\n\nSulfur mustards are variations of "mustard gas" (bis-(2-chloroethyl) sulfide), which was first synthesised by Frederick Guthrie in 1860, though it is possible that it was developed as early as 1822 by M Depretz. V Meyer published a paper in 1886 describing a synthesis which produced good yields. Mustard gas is referred to by numerous other names, including HD, senfgas, sulfur mustard, blister gas, s-lost, lost, Kampfstoff LOST, yellow cross liquid, and yperite. The abbreviation LOST comes from the names Lommel and Steinkopf, who developed a process for mass producing the gas for war use at the German company Bayer AG. This involved reacting thiodiglycol with hydrochloric acid.\n\nMustard agents, including sulfur mustard, are regulated under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Three classes of chemicals are monitored under this Convention, with sulfur and nitrogen mustard grouped in the highest risk class, "schedule 1".	science
What is the best analogy for a black hole? Best analogy wins. keep it simple. :) An open plug hole in a bath full of water. All the water is captured by the plug hole. Nothing escapes.\n\nBlack holes are the evolutionary endpoints of stars at least 10 to 15 times as massive as the Sun. If a star that massive or larger undergoes a supernova explosion, it may leave behind a fairly massive burned out stellar remnant. With no outward forces to oppose gravitational forces, the remnant will collapse in on itself. The star eventually collapses to the point of zero volume and infinite density, creating what is known as a " singularity ". As the density increases, the path of light rays emitted from the star are bent and eventually wrapped irrevocably around the star. Any emitted photons are trapped into an orbit by the intense gravitational field; they will never leave it. Because no light escapes after the star reaches this infinite density, it is called a black hole.	science

But, it is what you can afford.  If you can afford bigger, go bigger, but talk to your bank and they should ask you about your current bills and they should make the determination on how much home you can afford.\nIt will also help to look at older homes that have been fixed up or are in good shape because a lot of times you will be able to get more house with more room for less, or the same amount of money has a new, smaller house.\nYou always have to look at what is important to your family becuse your needs may change from the house you want. For instance, if you want to be close to schools, grocery store, or have a big yard, you can't get a Penthouse condo.\nResearch realitor websites and read what the listings say and look at the house.

Therefore, the volume of 2M NaCl solution that has the same number of chloride ions is 8mols/(2mols/liter)=4 litres.	science
Write an equation of the line that passes through (1, -2) and is perpendicular to the line that....? Write an equation of the line that passes through (1, -2) and is perpendicular to the line that passes through (4, 2) and (0, 4).\n\nAny help would be appreciated very much. Thank you. Use the forumula     delta Y/ deltaX to find the slope of the given points\n\n4-2/ 0-4   = -2/4 =  -1/2\n\n\nSince the perpendicular line is the equation  y = -1/2x; the other equation has the slope of the negative reciprocal of -1/2x so the equation would be \n\ny= 2x+b\n\nthen plugin x and y in this equation and you get\n\nb= -4\n\nso the final equation would be y=2x-4\n\n   Thats it	science

How does natural selection help bacteria to sdapt to their environments?  Natural Selection is a process where the weaker individuals are "culled out" and only the stronger ones survive.  A good example of this concerning bacteria is the overuse of antibiotics.  Eventually, the resilient individuals will survive antibiotic treatment and become resistant to that particular antibiotic.  Eventually, that population will grow enough and be untreatable with that particular treatment and another antibiotic will have to be used.  Some speculate (myself included) that this is how Bird Flu was created except on a viral level instead of bacterial.  In summary, new environment (heat, cold, antibiotics, etc.) weaker bacteria die off, strong ones survive and propagate and therefore, live on. . . thus adaptation.  Hope this helps.	science
How does one manufacture nitric acid? It is the key chemical for smokeless powders. Nitric acid is made by mixing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with water. Creating a very pure nitric acid usually involves distillation with sulfuric acid, as nitric acid forms an azeotrope with water with a composition of 68% nitric acid and 32% water. Commercial grade nitric acid solutions are usually between 52% and 68% nitric acid. Commercial production of nitric acid is via the Ostwald process after Wilhelm Ostwald.\n\nNitric acid can be made from Copper(II) nitrate or by reacting 200 g of potassium nitrate (KNO3) in 106 ml of 96% sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and distilling this mixture at nitric acid's boiling point of 83 °C until only a white crystalline mass, potassium hydrogen sulfate (KHSO4), remains in the reaction vessel. The obtained red fuming nitric acid may be converted to the white nitric acid. Note that in a laboratory setting, it is necessary to use all-glass equipment, ideally a one-piece retort, because nitric acid attacks cork and rubber, and leaks can be extremely dangerous.\n\nThe dissolved NOx are readily removed using reduced pressure at room temperature (10-30 min at 200 mmHg or 27 kPa). Obtained white fuming nitric acid has density 1.51 g/cm³. This procedure can also be performed under reduced pressure and temperature in one step in order to produce less nitrogen dioxide gas.\n\nThe acid can also be synthesized by oxidizing ammonia, but the product is diluted by the water also formed as part of the reaction. However, this synthesization method is important in producing ammonium nitrate from ammonia derived from the Haber process, because the final product can be produced from nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen as the sole feedstocks.\n\nWhite fuming nitric acid, also called 100% nitric acid or WFNA, is very close to the anhydrous nitric acid product. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2 % water and a maximum of 0.5 % dissolved NO2. Red fuming nitric acid, or RFNA, contains substantial quantities of dissolved nitrogen dioxide (NO2) leaving the solution with a reddish-brown color. One formulation of RFNA specifies a minimum of 17% NO2, another specifies 13% NO2. In either event, an inhibited fuming nitric acid (either IWFNA, or IRFNA) can be made by the addition of 0.6 to 0.7% hydrogen fluoride, HF. This fluoride is added for corrosion resistance in metal tanks (the fluoride creates a metal fluoride layer that protects the metal)	science
Not why?... How? When I took AP Chemistry last year, my teacher would tell me never to ask why, only how. And my father has explained to me that in Science, as in Math, you can't ask why because some things just are. My question is: Do people declare something as an "it just is" when Science can no longer probe its mysteries? Or is that just the furthest point Science has gotten or is needed to go to before exploration of the subject becomes unbeneficial to society? Hasn't anyone been curious enough to explain the whys... or just got too lost to explain them? Why implies there is a reason something happens.  There is no reason chemistry is the way it is (unless you want to attribute it to God, but that's not the question here).\n\nHow implies there is a mechanism by which something happens.  This can easily be tested, reported, critiqued, duplicated, etc.  \n\nScience does not declare something "just is".  Science tries to determine the mechanisms that govern our world, so we can best work within our world.  We cannot determine the reason these mechanisms exist.	science
help please - MATH? An automobile radiator contains 16 liters of antifreeze and water. This mixture is 30% antifreeze. How much of this mixture should be drained and replaced with pure antifreeze so that there will be 50% antifreeze?\n\n\nPlease explain so I learn. Here's how to think about it.  In the end you will be mixing so many liters of 30% mixture and so many liters of 100% mixture.\n\nLet a be the amount of 30% mixture.\nLet b be the amount of 100% mixture.\n\nAdded together these must equal 16 liters:\na + b = 16\n\nAlso, you want the mixture to equal 50%.\n30% x a + 100% x b = 50% x 16\n\nYou have two equations and two unknowns, so this should be solvable.\n\nLet's solve for a:\na = 16 - b\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n30% x (16 - b) + 100% x b = 50% x 16\n\nYou could do this all with decimal amounts (30% = 0.30, 50% = 0.50) etc.  But it is easier to just do them as whole amounts (30, 100, 50).  The answer will work out either way.\n\nDistribute through:\n30 x 16 - 30b + 100b = 50 x 16\n\nSimplify:\n480 - 30b + 100b = 800\n\nCombine like terms:\n480 + 70b = 800\n\nSubtract 480 from both sides:\n70b = 800 - 480\n70b = 320\n\nDivide both sides by 70:\nb = 320 / 70\nb = 32 / 7\nb = 4 4/7 liters\n\nSo you will need to drain 4 4/7 liters of the 30% mixture, then add 4 4/7 liters of the 100% mixture.\n\nAs a double check:\na = 11 3/7\nb = 4 4/7\n\n30% x 11 3/7 + 100% x 4 4/7 =? 50% x 16\n30% x 80/7 + 32/7 =? 8\n24/7 + 32/7 =? 8\n56/7 = 8 <-- check\n\nSo the correct answer is you must drain 32/7 liters, or 4 4/7 liters (as a mixed fraction).\n\nAs a decimal, the answer is approximately 4.571 liters.	science
why isn't anyone Else's favorite color clear? isnt clear a color also. A prizim is clear, yet it can reflect all color. Sorry but clear isn't a colour. And i think  a prism is a refraction of light not a reflection.In optics, a prism is a device used to refract light, reflect it or break it up (to disperse it) into its constituent spectral colours (colours of the rainbow). The traditional geometrical shape is that of a triangular prism, with a triangular base and rectangular sides. Some types of optical prisms are not in fact in the shape of geometric prisms.\n\nAs light moves from one medium (e.g. air) to another denser medium (the glass of the prism), it is slowed down and as a result either bent (refracted) or reflected. The angle that the beam of light makes with the interface as well as the refractive indices of the two media determine whether it is reflected or refracted, and by how much (see refraction, total internal reflection).\n\nReflective prisms are used to reflect light, for instance in binoculars, since they are easier to manufacture than mirrors. Dispersive prisms are used to break up light into its constituent spectral colours because the refractive index depends on frequency (see dispersion); the white light entering the prism is a mixture of different frequencies, each of which gets bent slightly differently. Blue light is slowed down more than red light and will therefore be bent more than red light. There are also polarizing prisms (also known as birefringent prisms) which can split a beam of light into components of varying polarization.\n\nIsaac Newton first thought that prisms split colours out of colourless light. Newton placed a second prism such that a separated colour would pass through it and found the colour unchanged. He concluded that prisms separate colours. He also used a lens and a second prism to recompose the rainbow into white light.	science

How do i become a movie agent? I have friends who act in some low budget movies and commericals how do i become an agent and land them some deals? Are there any resources or qualifications to have? well most agents have law degrees.  due to the legalities of everything and all the contracts you have to deal with.  But if these are people you know that would be willing to sign with you i would draft a contract and have them sign it.  The only problem is that you will need to do a lot of leg work in the beginning because noone will know who you are.  Youre also going to have to get them into acting unions because most bigger movies only take actors from the unions.  It is quite a process but if you put the work in you can be very successfull.	entertainment and Music

The midget took his advice and went to the doctor and told him what the problem was. \n\nThe doctor told him to drop his pants and he would have a look. The midget dropped his pants. The doctor put him up onto the examining table, and started to examine him. The doc put one finger under his left testicle and told the midget to turn his head and cough-the usual method to check for a hernia. "Aha!" the doc and putting his finger under the right testicle, he asked the midget to cough again. "Aha!" said the doctor and reached for his surgical scissors. Snip, snip, snip, snip on the right side then snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip, snip on the left side. \n\nThe midget was so scared he was afraid to look, but noted with amazement that the snipping did not hurt. The doctor then told the midget to get dressed and see if they still ached. \n\nThe midget was absolutely delighted as he walked around the doc's office and discovered his testicles were no longer aching. "Gee, what did you do, Doc?" he asked. \n\nThe doc replied, "I cut two inches off the tops of your cowboy boots.""	entertainment and Music

CAN ALOT OF PEOPLE PLEASE RESPOND...ANY advice would be greatly appreciated...? I am 17 years old and I like a guy who is 13. He is very mature for his age, everyone says so. He acts and looks older than 13. He is best friends with my step-uncle(who's almost 13). I started thinking he liked me about 8 or 9 months ago, my uncle told me he could tell he liked me. I didn't really know him that well then so I was thinking that there is no way I could like someone four years younger than me. But as I got to know him and we talked about a lot of serious, personal stuff, I realized what a good person he is and I started to like him. I have been debating about what to do for about a month. I live with my grandma now(my mom pasted away in July) (It's her husbands son who is my step-uncle.) Anyway, the guy I like was here yesterday. I told him that I liked him and he told me he liked me(it's a long story how that came about). But since my uncle was also here, we never really got a chance to talk about it. So now I don't know where we stand, all I know is we like each other. This is a very difficult situation you are in. While 4 years may or may not seem like a lot. At his age, and at yours, four years can be critical. People change a lot in four years (emotionally) at his and your age. He still has to go through highschool, you will soon be entering your young adult years. While now you two may seem to have a lot in common or can see the world through the same eyes, you can just as easily find that you are worlds a part in as little as a year. I would recommend you talk to an adult that you trust and has your best interests at heart. There guidance can help you decide what to do since they know you better than we do. I wish you well.	family and relationships

If you copy songs from original CD to your PC, is it legal to keep them on your PC if you give away the CD? I am only talking about original CD's that I purchased in the store or from online retailers. I know its legal toCan I give away the CD (not sell) to a friend or co-worker and keep the ripped songs on my PC or mp3 player? Actually, purchasing the CD grants you a use license that extends to your immediate family, friends, etc.  You may legally buy a CD, copy a song, and give it to, say, your sister, or your friend.  You cannot, however, post them on the net for people unknown to you to download.  There are several recent federal court cases attempting to decide where to draw the line between the copyright holder's rights and your own usage rights granted by your license.  Example:  if I don't know you, but agree to meet you on the street to exchange ripped music, are we "friends."  Are we "friends" once we've met?  \n\nYour specific question is difficult to answer.  If you purchased the CD's, you can certainly keep the copies on the computer if you threw the CD's away.  However, (and I'm only speculating here) if you sell the CD's, you may have in fact sold the usage rights with them.  Wish I had something more concrete for you!	politics and government
Our rights are being taken away!? Okay, Ohio has passed the non-smoking law. Where we can't smoke in public places. I am a smoker who agrees that people shouldn't have to inhale my second hand smoke. That's not the problem. The problem is now companies are not going to hire you if you smoke. One of the big employer in the area will now test you for nicotine. If there is nicotine in your system they will not hire you.  Cigarette smoking in not illegal. If this company can refuse to hire you because you smoke. Will they refuse to hire you because we weight to much. Then what next they will refuse to hire you because your too old? What's your opinion? people are carrying things a bit too far I have a bumper sticker that says at least I can still smoke in my car!	politics and government

Why do you think our country has never had a female president?  Not too many women have been close enough to run for the presidency. Geraldine Ferraro ran for Vice President on Walter Mondale's ticket, but Mondale had an extremely weak showing and probably would've lost in a landslide regardless of his running mate.\n\nMost presidential candidates run after having served as governor, senator, or vice president. Dwight Eisenhower, elected in 1952, was the last nominee of a major party not to have previously held one of these offices.\n\nThere have been 28 female governors in the history of the United States, including Sila Calderon of PR. 6 of these were appointees who were never elected, 3 others were elected as replacements for their husbands who had previously served as that state's governor.\n\nThere have been 33 female Senators in US history, 10 of which were appointees never elected.\n\nI don't believe that there is much specific bias against women in politics, but most women just aren't seen as presidantial candidate material. Senator Carol Moseley Braun (D-IL) ran for president in 2004, and American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole ran for the Republican nomination in 2000. Dole garned a good deal of interest early on, but neither candidate ended up being at all competitive.\n\nRight now Hillary Clinton and Condoleeze Rice are frequently mentioned as possible presidential candidates, although I suspect that Clinton is viewed negatively by too many voters, and I think that voters would be very reluctant to promote the Secretary of Defense to the highest office in the land until a bit more is known about the candidate's domestic policies.	politics and government

how do primary elections differ state to state?  Primary elections are mostly an American phenomenon.  For the most part, they are managed by each state political party.  The dominant Democratic and Republican party in each state, because of their usual involvement in legislative government, generally allow the use of balloting equipment and workers that is normally reserved for a general election.\n\nEach state party defines and enforces the primary rules for voting.  There are several different forms of primaries that each state can choose.  These include:\n\nOpen - Voters may vote in primaries of a party of their choice, the choice to be made at the voting booth.\n\nClosed - Voters may only vote in a primary if they are registered members of that party.\n\nSemi-open - Voters registered with a party may only vote in the primary of their party. Independents may choose which primary to vote in at the voting booth. For example, in West Virginia, Republican primaries are open to independents, but Democratic primaries are closed.\n\nRun-off - If no candidate receives a majority (50%) the top two candidates may face off in a run-off election. The word "run-off" can refer to either the system using a run-off election, or to the subsequential second election itself.\n\nPrimary elections generally get more attention during a Presidential election.  Many have criticized the traditional approach of early primary elections in Iowa and New Hampshire for defining party front-runners.  An alternative plan known as the Graduated Random Presidential Primary System (also known as the California Plan or American Plan) is designed to begin with presidential primaries in small-population states, where candidates do not need tens of millions of dollars in order to compete, and grow progressively larger and more challenging as the nominating process advances. A wide field of presidential hopefuls will be competitive in the early going. A "minor candidate's" surprise successes in the early rounds, based more on the merit of the message than on massive amounts of money, will tend to attract money from larger numbers of small contributors for the campaign to spend in later rounds of primaries. Thus there should be more longevity of candidacy, and more credible challengers to the "front-runners." However, as the campaign proceeds, the aggregate value of contested states becomes successively larger, requiring the expenditure of larger amounts of money in order to campaign effectively. A gradual weeding-out process occurs, as less-successful candidates drop out of the race. The goal is for the process to produce a clear winner in the end, but only after all voices have had a chance to be heard.	politics and government
how long can 15 felonys get u in cal? how long can 15 felonys get u in cal? Just because someone is convicted of a felony does not mean the conviction counts as a strike.  Not all felonies are strikes so ignore all the three-strike/life in prison stuff you're reading here.  \n\nIn California, only serious felonies as defined in 1192.7 PC and violent felonies as defined in 667.5 PC are considered strikes (there are some juvenile adjudications that are considered strikes, but they're basically the kiddy versions of 1192.7 and 667.5).  Lucky for crooks, that still leaves a lot of felonies that aren't considered strikes.\n\nIt's just not possible to answer your question without knowing an awful lot more than what you've provided here.  There's probably more questions about your question than there's room for here.  It isn't as if 15 felonies always equals a certain amount of years in prison...there are many, many variables that will have some bearing on the outcome and nobody here knows what the facts are surrounding what you're talking about.	politics and government
Does anyone on here know the actual statistics..? About the crime rate amoung illegals? I read an article in my local news paper and it was stating that most of the crimes that are commited by illegals are towards other illegals because they think that the crime will go unreported. Is this true and if so why would we even consider that in the "facts" that some people report here? anyone would be here !!!!!!!!\n\nwell i have three links one of them has the race population in jail which clearly shows an  increase in the lattest years of immiantes from the white race which has surpassed the black population today :\n\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/tables/jailracetab.htm\n\nthe second one is about the hate crimes commited agains hispanics which indicate huge numbers :\n\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/hcrvp.htm\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf\n\nand i have a tird one is about crimes commited against hispanics which indicates two things that it luckily has drop and that unfortunelly : \n\n*  9% of Hispanic victims stated that\nthe offender was an intimate, while\n34% described the offender as a\nfriend or acquaintance. \n\nmeaning that most of the time the criminal knows the victim and knows how likely the victim is to report the crime :\n\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/hvvc00.htm\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/hvvc00.txt\n\nnote : most people do not seem to release that :\n1.\n as u said the crimes which are commited by those undesirables are commited against victims which cannot defend themselves usually or are afraid of doing so . \n\n2. \n than a legalization would make the real criminals think twice before commiting any crimes against them . therefor the crime rate would drop and the real criminals would be easier to capture once they are nto able to hide between those whose only desire is to work and to better their lives by doing so ( not by commiting crimes and abusing others ) .	politics and government

Plus it hurts like hell!  I had problems with this personally and I almost lost the man I am about to marry.  We argued over this for over 2 years while dating and engaged.

Why do parents think they have the right to pick the person  their son  should marry? age wealth If you really love and adore a person, you will stand up for yourself.  Once I lost someone for that exact reason, the estranged mother thought that the only control left was to decide the right spouse.  Truly, it's crazy.

Jehovahs Witnesses-Baptism? I want to get baptized at our next convention which is in August. I want to tell the elders that and I was wondering if its wrong to call my PO up to tell him since I wont see him for a while and I dont want to wait any longer, possibly stopping the chances for me getting baptized at this convention. \n\nFYI I tried to tell him last night at meeting but the second it was over all the elders went to the back and had a meeting so I couldnt then. There is absolutely nothing wrong with telephoning the presiding overseer to inform him that you hope to be baptized at the next Jehovah's Witness convention. He will appreciate having the advance notice to start scheduling your reviews of the baptism questions. \n\nWhile it is uncommon, at times the PO will ask if you have a preference for which three elders will perform your reviews. Have three names ready just in case he asks (to avoid any delay).\n\nIncidentally, don't tell them that you got advice from Yahoo Answers. Jehovah's Witness publications and the congregation are really the only accurate sources for information about Jehovah's Witnesses.\nhttp://watchtower.org	society and culture

Why do people like to ware jewlery?  The urge to adorn oneself is as ancient as humankind. Beads strung into necklaces and bracelets have been found in Cro-Magnon burial sites as early as 40,000 BC. \n\nJewelry makes people feel prettier and is a means to boast your personal style. Certain shapes or styles of jewelry have been used to ward of evil or grant luck. Cultural heritage can also be expressed through jewelry.\n\nIn anciet Egypt the highest honor you could recieve was the Three Gold Flies, a necklace with three golden fly pendants. Egyptians also wore protective amulets to promote well-being in this life and the next. Native Americans sewed beads and feathers onto their clothing for special occasions. The Ceasars of ancient Rome wore crowns of laurel wreaths to display their soveriengty. Europeans monarchs and nobles dripped with jewels and precious metals, fine laces and elaborate gowns to show their power. Seal rings were passed down from father to son, and were greatly prized. Africans pierced their ears and noses. Aborigenes tattooed themselves. \n\nThe desire to better your appearance through jewelry is as much an instinct as keeping warm.	society and culture

How can anyone be serious about bringing dignity back to marriage with a constitutional amendment? Dennis Rodman, Britney Spears and plenty of high profile hetero couples have made a mockery of marriage with less than week long shams and exhibitions. Fox and the other networks are making marriage into game shows. Reality shows include wife swapping. Limiting marriage to one man and one woman is going to restore dignity? The point is political pandering for votes. They bring this issue up every election year. It has NOTHING to do with dignity, or morals, or sanctity or any other word they choose to attach to it. OR even Gay marriage for that matter.\n\nIf the majority of voters are "horrified" by gays, they will remember this person "fighting against" this  at election time.\n\nIts horribly wrong to do this at the cost of basic human rights and fuels hate crimes among 1000 other negative reasons.\n\n There are many things inherently wrong with our countries political $y$tem. \n\nI'll stop there before I really get started. :)\n\nI found this today thought you might find it interesting...\nhttp://www.armchairsubversive.com/	society and culture
