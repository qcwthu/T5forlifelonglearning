Where is the best honeymoon place that won't break the bank?  (Think in December)? I'm getting married this December and having trouble finding a nice, affordable honeymoon spot.  Any suggestions? As wild_orchid mentioned, there are so many variables.  What is "affordable", where are you located, and do you want cold weather or warm weather?  Caribbean and Mexican riviera crusises are a great bet, with Carnival being one of the least expensive.  \n\nObviously the closer you are to any certain location, the less expensive it will be to get there.  If you are on the West coast side of the US, Mexico has lots of affordable hotels on the coast - Los Cabos, Ixtapa, PV, Mazatlan, etc.  For those closer to the East coast, there are Caribbean cruises that leave from Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico for many cruise lines.  A Western Caribbean cruise may have less down time (travel time) and can give you long days at port.  You could also fly directly to Cancun or that area and stay in a hotel for they honeymoon.  \n\nThere are many all-inclusive resorts that end up being decent deals when you figure in the amount of food and alcohol that one might consume on vacation.  Many include water sports as well - like kayaking, snorkel gear, sailing, etc.  \n\nFor cold weather, Canada is also an option, depending on where you are.  The US dollar is fairly strong against theirs, so you may be able to find a place at a great rate with the conversion rates.  \n\nHappy engagement, Have a Beautiful wedding, and Good Luck in your future life together! :)	family and relationships
how can u keep a relationship with a goth? my bf is a goth and he never speaks much or shows emotions. I don't think his being goth has anything to do with his supposed lack of emotions. For whatever reason some guys have a super hard time showing emotion... period.. and some guys go complete drama queen about it (aka emo)\n\nTalk to your guy. Tell him that you care about him and that you feel like maybe he is shutting you out when he doesn't speak to you or let you see emotion from him.\n\nCommunication's the key to a good relationship. Maybe he doesn't realize that the way he acts bothers you.	family and relationships
i should not feel this way /but i do !? i got the S!@#%&* kick out of me while i was  watching my 3three year old  now she wants to think she can beat on me and i tell her fighting is not right but she still will say stuf like im going to whopp daddy and it hurts to hear her say that ! i got caught off gard by two guys when it all happen   with out a dought i can bi@#%^ch slap the one im so pissed att and its wrong but i want my daughter to watch me whipp up on him so bad but i know this ant going to fix any thing  or make things right  GOD FOR GIVE ME PLEASE You need to calm down and regroup.You are letting your emotions get the best of u and the good thing is u know it.

is it wrong to like your ex's bf? i just broke up with my ex a few months ago do think it's okay ? guys only! Of course not, you can like who you want.  It's called free will.  I hate to see people so young cut off options that could make them happy for life.  It didn't work out with your ex--so what!  Just make sure you guys are always open and up front and don't do the "sneaking around thing" it will cheapen the relationship.  Love First!	family and relationships
How much should a wedding photographer charge for a wedding and reception? A total time of 8 hours taking photos. How much should you pay for a car?\n\nHow much experience?  What is the market?  What is the competition?  Film or digital?  Med format or 35mm?   Prints?  Full resolution files?   Extensive retouching?  Albums?   How many?  What size?   DVD?  Slide shows?  Coffee table books?\nAll of the above?\n\nExpect to pay anywhere from $400 to $25,000.  I think a middle of the road figure for a competent experienced photographer  would be $2000 to $5000.\n\nGood luck!	family and relationships

why do guys feel unhappy to stay with one wife after having first kid? they will keep afiar with other women and then also the wife will be pregnent for another kid how is it.............. Things change when a husband and wife has a child because both of their lives change. He feels that there is no flame in the relationship and so he looks for someone else instead. He won't leave because of the child, but he wouldn't want his wife anymore.	family and relationships

Miss being attached? For the obvious reasons, it's great being single, but don't you find you start to miss the comfort of being in a relationship? \nAfter 2 years of "singularity" (although often filled with great fun!), there's nothing more I want right now than to cosy down with a cool girl that I can share everything that is me with. \nAnd yet, meeting the right person is so damn hard... \nI'm only 29 but sometimes I wonder whether maybe I'm one of those destined to drift through life with only flirting encounters.\nKnow what I mean? have you  ever heard the expresion"You have to be a friend to have a friend". Women can tell when a guy is seeking to find someone. I know that is hard to find someone in this day and time. Try to find someone that interest you. Don't always base your preference on looks. Start out by being friends.Spend time together with no pressure to date.That is a good way to get to know someone. No sexual contact or pressure.Sex always changes your relationship. If you can be friends then you have found someone to try and bring your relationship up one level with them.Do you know a girl that has the same interest in sports or art or what ever you like. And try to be honest in a relationship.Always speak your mind with love not sarcasm. I my self always found love when I wasn't looking for it!	family and relationships
Is it crazy to look up a love you haven't seen in over 5 years? He contacted my grandparents a few months ago which was the last known number he had. but he didn't leave a way to get in contact with him, he was my first love, and my grandparents don't like him, so I can't ask them to give him my new number because they won't Go for it girl.......If he's calling your family, that means he wants to talk to you....He probably thought your grandparents wouldn't give you his number, that's probably the reason he didn't leave any! It isn't crazy at all, trust me that's perfectly natural...Follow your instincts, you'll never know unless you try...Life is about taking risks and about experimenting, how bad can it be? Go for it!	family and relationships
have you ever...............? I cant stand to see girls in pain. especially my gf. and my gf is in pain right now. I feel so bad and i just want to take all the pain so she doesnt have to be hurting. I love her so much and she is my life and I cant stand to see her in pain. And I feel like I NEED to take her pain from her. what can I do? I lover her so much! she is my LIFE! I couldnt live with out her. and I would NEVER cheat on her. I feel so bad though that I wasnt there to catch her when she hurt herself. instead I was at hockey and I didnt find out till after I got back. What can I do for her? BTW she got hurt figure skating. she was skating and was doing some kind of jump and took a real hard fall. I am in pain cuz she is in pain and I want to help her but dont know how. I wish I could express how much I love and care for her but no gift can express my love for her. what can I do? do u ever feel this way? BTW,I am not a baby. but I am so sad that she is hurt I want to cry. PLez dont make mean comments. Thanks Here's a thing young man, grab a chair and stay up all night beside her bed making sure she is sleeping well.\n\nI'm sure that would be the best expression.	family and relationships
i once was inlove but found someone else had his baby but the old love is back what should ido? i'minlovew/2 i use to love my old boyfriend so much but he got in some trouble and had to leave me so i found someone else and love him but not as much as the first but i had his baby and my old love is back saying he's ready for commentment and also a changed man but i love both or should i say love one and in love with the other help me make the right decision. Life is not a movie. you say you love him more than your current boyfriend, but I think it's just a case of thinking 'the grass is greener on ther other side'. Maybe you should take time away from men for awhile and focus on your child. Things could end up not working out with the one that came back, and then where will you be? Alone with a baby, and the father of your child will feel very slighted. Don't underestimate the love you have for your boyfriend just because an old flame has shown up and makes you think things could be better...They will most likely be the same.	family and relationships

I got myself into a relationship with so-called - "SHY GIRL" what to do if...? So. We talk for allover a year through MSN Messenger, we already planned to meet up - but i never asked her for her phone number... I suggested her to come over my town - we got a great pool, we'll play some tennis...\nin the wrost case - i'll pay for everything if you're really short with cash...\n\ni asked for her phone number and she seemed to be 'accepting giving it to me'\nshe asked for my mobile number and i gave her... but when i asked her she said 'i dont have any' and 'ppl that want to talk to me call to my home phone' i asked for the home phone and she said "OK, I"M SHY!"\n\nWhat can I do.\nWhat should I do to finally get to see her.\nWhat do u say - she's a fake? that what it seems to me...\n\nPLEASE GIMME THE BEST ANSWER U CAN :) I can relate to shy...I am shy...however her behavior seems a bit odd and is this something you would be willing to deal with throughout a relationship with her (assuming she's for real)? I'd back off and let her take things at her pace at this point. Leave the door open for her if you like, but don't pass up other opportunities that you feel may have potential. If she's REALLY interested in you, she'll suck up her shyness and join you in taking the steps to meet and explore a 'live' relationship.	family and relationships

He's older and already has adult children. Do u think he would want to have children with me? Im crazy about an older man who already has adult children. I still haven't had children or started a family, although i really want to. Im not sure if i would be wasting my time falling for a guy who has already gone through it all. He's an adorable man, and we get on extremely well, but of course its way too early to be asking him these kind of questions. Time for me to have children is beginning to run out...what do other people think? I think that if this man really loves you and this is something that you really want then my answer would be yes. But only if it is a true love	family and relationships

he smoked...why do i feel so upset by it? My mum is a smoker and i hate it. It makes everything smell, and a few years ago, the doctor found a shadow on her lung but she never told me any more about it.For lots of reasons i hate it, and last week i was talking to my boyfriend and he said he hated it and it was horrible the first time he tried it.Then i just found out he smoked last night because i wasnt there.He said it was really coz everyone else as doing it,that it was stupid and he would never do it again,he's promised.But it just really upset me.I don't even know why it got me so mad? If he was truly just experimenting and he doesn't plan on doing it again, then just let it go. There's no use in being upset over it. It probably got you so mad because you probably connect smoking with the problems that your mom faced, so it's a sensitive subject for you. Just explain how you feel and if he is willing to listen then everything is fine!	family and relationships

am i right loving a girl who is elder to me? i am affraid that if she doesnot accept me , but she know me very well and we are good friends any suggestion regarding this story from little box:-\n\nIt's meaningful....\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area. Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,\n\nStudent : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Could you please help me?\n\nTeacher : (Silent for few second, than he answered)\n\nWell, it's a pretty hard and easy question.\n\nStudent : (Thinking hard) Huh???\n\nTeacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.\n\nStudent : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).\n\nA few minutes later...\n\nStudent : I'm back.\n\nTeacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.\n\nStudent : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Because you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.\n\nTeacher : That's what happened in real life.\n\nWhat is the message of this story?\n\n* Grass - is people around you\n* Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you\n* Grass Field - is time\n* In looking for your soulmate, please don't always\ncompare and hope that there will be a better one. By\ndoing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember\n\n"Time Never Goes Back".\n\nIt applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the morale is LOVE & grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time!	family and relationships
How can I get my husband to stop being so lazy.?  Don't nag him. Nagging just makes them more stubborn. Rather show appreciation for what he DOES do. Compliment his efforts and it will build his self-esteem and make him feel appreciated. Think of something that you can compliment him for if he does nothing. Reward him for his efforts. Give him good sex for doing something around the house and let him know that it's because of that. This might encourage him to do more things for you. ;)	family and relationships
what is wrong with my relationship? please help!? i have a fiancee, we have been together for more than 5 yrs. we also have 4 yr. old son together!! lately, we have been having constant fights! we get along for a few days and fight all the time. we can't seem to get along. i give her everything, but she doesn't seem to appreciate. she tells me that she wants to continue living with me, but when i explain and advise her how to lead her life, she does the opposite. it is getting really frustrating!!\nwhat should i do? why are you telling her how to lead her life?  maybe that's what's bothering her.  no one likes to be told what to do all the time and a partnership is about working together, not one person being in charge.  ask her what she wants besides living with you.. you may be frustrating her as much as she is frustrating you!	family and relationships

Is it ok  to like older  women or go out with them? Also to  have a intimate relationship with the person, does age matter.What would be the ok age.Is it ok to have feeling for that person. In answering please be truthful, please don't give a fantasy  based explanation. choose a particular side and explain on it. Thank you. Sure it is OK to like older women and go out with them as long as you're both 18. More and more you see older women with younger men. It seems like it was always OK for older men and younger women now it is the woman's turn to get that young stuff. Heck, I am 50 years old and I think a 30 or 35 year old man would be great. Go for it!	family and relationships
At what age should a woman start to worry that she's not married? If you definitely want kids but not out of wedlock, at what age should you at least have started dating your future husband?  Also, you'd want time together as a married couple  before rushing off into having babies right? And most of all, you would not want to have the kids when you are like Donald Trump's age becuz that's just silly. Yeah, probably early 30s.  I wouldn't leave it much longer than that, because there are risks associated with being pregnant when you are older.\n\nTrouble is, I think men can often sense the biological clock ticking, and feel the desperation coming from a woman in that situation, and they get frightened off.  I wouldn't like to be in that position at all.  I would say if having children with someone is high on the list of priorities, do it sooner rather than later.	family and relationships

My best friend is my 3 year old sister.? I desperately need help making friends. I am 12 years old and I don't have any friends at school. I probably only had about 5 friends in my entire life, all which were the kids of my parents' friends. I am really lonely and wish I had someone to call and talk to whenever I'm having a problem. Nobody at my school even notices me. you will grow out of this as you start to mature and grow into your self. You still dont know who you are yet. Most 20 year olds dont know who they are yet or where they want to be in life.

I've liked this guy since last semester.  It seems like he likes me too.  What should I do?  talk to him. Maybe suggest a casual, group like date at first and go from there. Or if you are braver, try asking him to a more casual date, like maybe out for lunch, or coffee. Make it seem like you just want to chill and talk, nothing too overwhelming yet.	family and relationships
I am way too attached to my girlfriend, it's at the point where I need her, how do I break it off? I've been through this before with women, I start to give myself to a girl and allow myself to become emotionally attached to her and she either cheats on me or breaks up with me and it devastates me for months afterward. I won't let it happen again\n\nI've been dating this girl for over a year, she is 20, I am 24. We are completely 100% in love, I am so completely attracted to her, I can't even look at or think about other women, it's crazy. We cuddle and hold each other all day, and I love it. Our love hasn't died down at all in the year we have dated, we act the same way we did when we first started dating. When you look at us, you wouldn't think we had spent 12 months with each other, more like a few weeks, but it's true, she is perfect and she thinks I am perfect. \n\nI need to break it off quick, I foolishly allowed myself to become emotionally attached to her and if she did something to hurt me I don't know what I would do, I need to just end this before I can give her that chance. i think you have got the best thing one can ever get! why do u want to lose it? u can be strong and in love at the same time. so u wont get hurt if she does something bad to you. i hope she doesnt but this sounds a very nice and happy friendship! keep it boy!	family and relationships
Why do Korean parents want their kids to date/marry only Koreans? I'm white and have been dating a Korean guy for three months.  He's 27 and I'm 37.  (he persued me.)  We have fallen in love.  He lives with his parents and is going to school.  His mom is upset he's dating a 37 yr old white woman.  His mom wants him to find a "good Korean girl." His father's upset that he's not moving fast enough with his education and wants him to work more.  My boyfriend told me he needs time to think and feels stretched.   His parents don't like him dating me.  Are there any Koreans who can help me understand this situation? Korean parents are typically old-fashioned, very traditional. More often the Korean son or daughter will bend to the will of his or her parents. \n\nIt's a cultural aspect. \n\nThe only thing I can say is patience and time. Try embracing more of his culture. Find ways to connect with his parents. They need to realize your beauty and what you provide for their son.\n\nIt will be hard, but if you really want this relationship and love this person, mountains are simple hills. Keep strong and stay on course. Support your love. Don't disrespect his parents. If you do, you will more than likely drive him away.	family and relationships
if ur loved one goes over seas for a year is letters and phone calls enough to build a relationship on? my boyfriend of 6 months has just left for iraq 2 months ago and i have told him i love him and he hasn't told me yet, does time away from one another help feelings grow or should i face reality and know that if he doesn't love me by now he may never love me especially when he comes home this year? well, if you're not sure that he loved you before he left then it may be hard to tell really. absance does make the heart grow fonder in many cases i think though.	family and relationships
i am confused.. plz gimme some of ur thoughts? Story a bit long though...? Me n my guy r havin some really tough times.. Our wedding is less than 4 weeks n we haven't done any preparation yet.. The marriage is sudden cos my we r havin some problems with both of our parents.. We bought a hse so tat we can stay together and we need to produce the marriage cert b4 we can finalise the deal.. Hence the hasty marriage... My parents are totally unaware of these at all... I feel very bad abt it but the tension between my guy n my dad is too much tat he can't bring himself to talk to my dad abt it, so am I.. Only his mom knows abt these and his mom too are starting to interfere too much in it... The original plan was to do this w/o the parents and now, he's like OK abt his mom chipping in into the marriage issues... I felt quite hurt abt it.. Tried to make him see my point but in the end we always end up arguing abt it..I know very well tat we r not making any right steps or decision here but he can't understand it.. I m beginning to think twice abt it now.. you should deffinitly just tell your parents. all of you should sit down and discuss it. as for your getting married, marrige is all about compromising. you both think you are right and  neither of you want to give in. you just have to think what is more important to you- him or you being right? sit down and talk with him about how you feel and dont let it turn into an argument. it wont hurt to listen to him and try to agreeabout some things. tell how much it bothered you what he did,. if you dont tell him he will never know and then how can he change? keep in mind that noone is perfect, and even the best of marriges have these fights. if you guys are engaged chances are you love him, and love is not the easiest thing to come by. every bride has second thoughts, if you didnt, it would just be weird. remember, marrige is a two way street, you both have to meet halfway, and sometimes you have to go a little further, just keep on thinking what is more important. winning a stupid argument or your marrige. i hope this helped you. good luck and congradulations!	family and relationships

i know this boy and he is really fun to be around and my friend said that we would make the prefect couple? and i think so to but he hasnt ask but we have kissed twice and we hold hands and i need so adive do yall think u could help I think you should not look into it deeply.  If you focus on the relationship aspect, you're going to ruin something good.  I think you should relax, go with the flow, and let things develop.  \n\nThinking about being a couple or any other relationship thoughts and analysis is a big NONO right now.  You shouldn't talk about it.  You don't go up to your friend and analyse your friendship or even make any assertions such as "YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND".  You do that only when things are down and people need encouraging or simply you evaluate your friendship if you have a "friend" that isn't really treating you like one.  The same can be said about relationships; when things are down or not going well, you have to start thinking where this is going.  Most women with some sense think at some point if it's worth continuing on or just simply ending it just to avoid future problems.  Don't do it yet, just go with the flow and see what happens.	family and relationships

How come he does not make a move?  What do you recommend? I get close to him, look him in the eyes and I kinda feel that he likes me, but there seems to be no progress. I assume he likes me because I feel his eyes on me all the time and he always looks for me with his gaze (I love that it is like he is caressing me with his eyes, nice). Anyway I have not dated in a long long time so, can anyone help me and tell me if I am doing something wrong? God bless! Be forward in this case and ask him.  Tell him you would like to take your friendship to a different level, and ask if he feels the same.  You can't lose.  IF he says no, you can quit wasting your time.  IF he says yes, you have your wish.  \n\nDon't wait, act.  There is nothing wrong with being the pursuer, just because you are a woman.  I am a man and I think it would be hugely flattering if a woman were that bold and interested in me.  At least I would be thankful and honored for the approach, even if I were NOT interested.\n\nFrom there you will have your answers.  Don't be afraid.  All you are doing is expediting the enevitable (whether good or bad)  by being forward. Best for you both!!!\n\nGood LUCK!!!!	family and relationships
i'm worried about my friend? in school, i have a friend (let's call her... Sara) well Sara's parents had been fighting since the summer and recently her dad walked out. but sara's mom has been taking all her angst on her, even beating her with a belt and slapping her. they might even migrate because her mom's been having an affair with a guy in NZ. and in school, people won't stop teasing sara because they notice we've become close and they accuse us of being... well you know... g*y. which is totally untrue... what should i do? i know family arguements might seem common to some of you, but to me, it's as normal as finding a hundred dollar bill under a rock. Just be with youre friend. Never leave her when she cries. I guess thats one thing you could do. If you think its appropriate to do some action, since you knew the case more than I knew it, then do, if you think its morally and ethically correct.	family and relationships
What should i tell my girlfriend? I have a really good girlfriend that got married in April (but has been with her husband for almost 9 years) She is also 7 months prgenant. They own a hose together and have for te last 5 yrs.... her parents have put a lot of work into their house with upgrades and she thinks that her husband has a drug problem. Now she says that they fight all the time and neither of them are happy. They hardly talk to each other and she wants out but won't leave because she doesn't want him to get anything form the profit of the house. She calls me crying all the time, I don't know what to say to her... any suggetions or has anyone been thorogh something like this? Since she is pregnant, she should consider counseling for she and her husband to discuss their relationship. If he is unwilling, or continues to use drugs, this is an unhealthy environment for their child. She could lose the house if he is caught with drugs in the house. She could even lose her child.\n\nAssure her that if she decides to get a divorce, she will not lose everything. I'm not sure what state she is in, but most laws say it must be split 50/50. The laws only count the actual length of the marriage. If she really wants to keep the house, it wouldn't be difficult to have a judge award her the house for she and the child, but she would need to "buy him out" by giving him half the value of the house, or other assets to equal it. It sounds like she has a supportive family, hopefully they can help her through this.\n\nI have a sister of a friend who's been through something similar. She divorced her husband because he used drugs, and pushed her while she was holding their baby. She had him sign off all parental rights to the child, so the child could not be used as leverage for money, etc., and also to ensure that he was in a safe environment. Her parents are the legal guardians if anything happens to her.\n\nIf your friend doesn't want him to get profits from the house out of spite, or because he didn't contribute to the upgrades, she will most likely have to accept it so she can move on with her life and find happiness for she and her baby.\n\nA good lawyer may be able to get her more, but she may have more trouble from her husband for custody, visitation, etc. If he is using drugs, he is unfit. If she believes he is, she should prove him unfit to protect her child.\n\nSorry such bad news, but I hope this helps. Best of luck to all of you.	family and relationships
Getting hold of someone? I'm in Year 9 and I feel uncomfortable being one in a small crowd of people who hasn't got hold of a girl yet. The thing that puts me down most is one I dont have a girlfriend, and I crave a decent lengthy relationship, and two, if I ever got to the stage where I was to get hold of a girl, what the hell do I do, I'm sure others have this problem, so my question is, how did you handle your first kiss (not just a peck on the lips, I've done all that!), but do you have any tips of just to take it easy and not be totally bad at it, I hope you sort of know what I'm asking, and can give me the sort of answer I need! Look you take your time, find someone you want to be with, don't go for someone just cos your mates are doing it, u'd be letting your principle's down and yourself, and if your mates take the Micky they're not such good mates after all... and as for every thing else you've asked advice on it'll will all come to you naturally i promise.. you seem very cool for your age and you'll figure it out.. when kissing don't have wet lips and for god sake don't stick your tongue down they're throat straight away.. take it slow u'll be great good luck	family and relationships

my boyfriend....? ok. we have been together for about six months and I'm thinking about dumping him. I haven't gotton to spend much time with him and he's a bit immature.(we're in middle school). So it's not that i hate him it's just that our relationship has gotton boring and when he acts immature it embarasses me. I tryed to talk to him about it before, and we ended up getting in a huge fight. what should i do now?? If you think it's time to leave, and you're ready, then It's probably best to break up. But do it nicely. Believe me, Breaking up can be very painful for the other person, and if you wanna remain friends, be nice about it.	family and relationships

Please help me by locating an old friend of mine named Caroline Pintac.? SHE MIGRATED TO SOUTH CAROLINA, USA 18 YEARS AGO. SHE GOT MARRIED BUT I DONT KNOW HER NEW SURNAME. PLEASE HELP. THANKS Do you know her parents? or do you know where they are? or maybe she has brothers and sisters?  If you can find a family member, that might help to locate her.\n\nIf you don't know of any family members - do you know what school/s she went to?  Maybe the school can get you in touch with her.\n\nI am a researcher for my family tree - did she get married 18 years ago?  If you know approximately when she got married, then maybe the local newspaper has her listed with her husband's name.  You can do an interlibrary loan and get the local newspaper which often has marriage announcements and sometimes those marriage announcements indicate where the newly married couple will reside - not so much the address, but at least the city and state.\n\nI'm sorry that I cannot think of anymore ideas - I hope that you can find her.\n\nGood Luck!	family and relationships
my boyfriend and i have been dating for 1.5 yrs.how do i get him to propose? i am 27 he is 32 he has previuosly been married but is now divorced. he shows me that he loves me in alot of ways but has never TOLD me he loves me (this relationship is very emotionally dead) we have a luagh and are good frieds but he is very emotionally distant. he has introduced me to his family though and has once or twice talked about us being married and having kids. i told him that i would like him to travel back home with him ( to meet my family) in sepember this year he said that he doesnt think it would be possible. so i dumped him.he wants to get back together but mentions nothing about the problem.what do i do? i definately know he wants us to continue dating. but i want alot more. If you have told him how you feel and nothing has changed, why waste your time.  You do not have to go into a relationship thinking " this is the one" each time.  But if you truly think he is the one for you try to work it out.  It may be that you are not the "one" for him.  He may be gun shy and time is what he needs.  Then again, he may not want to settle down again.  How does the old saying go? " Why buy the cow when the milk is free?"  Give him some time apart and maybe he will realize he wants to be with you.  Be careful though, ultimatums usually spoil any relationship. Good Luck!	family and relationships

Friend Crush. What to do/how to tell your best guy friend that you have a crush on them? I met this guy about three years in one of my college classes. When we first met he said that he wasn't interested in a relationship because he had been in a bad relationship in the past and I wasn't looking for a relationship either. The problem is that it seems like the more I get to know him the more that I like him as more than friends. It is hard to tell whether he feels the same or not. It seems like we flirt a lot and we talk about everything. He is really shy and when he does do something flirty his face turns red. But the other day we went to a basketball game and he put his arm around me and then when he realized what he was doing he turned red and quickly put his arm down. I have tried to hint around that I like him as in for Christmas I gave him a huge hershey kiss and told him that I had wanted to give him a big kiss for a long time. What should I do? Should I tell him that I like him as more than a friend? Anyone been in this situation? What was the outcome? Thanks! It sounds like he already likes you, if you go off of what he did at the basketball game. One of you needs to make a move now, before it loses momentum and *gets weird*.\n\nTips to avoid *getting weird* while getting your point across:\n\n1. Try not to be too serious about it, no matter how you feel inside. Laughter is a great tension-breaker.\n2. Don't bring it up when there are other distractions around.\n3. Bring it up like you both know where the relationship is going. Because you both do. Don't play dumb about it.\n\nAnd that's it, really. It will work. We have a tendency to make these things bigger in our heads, then we look back and see that it was a small step instead of a large leap. Just give up, surrender...and do it.	family and relationships

what would you do if your child would catch you in the middle of having sex? tell me what would you do the morning after? Depends how old the child is.  This happened to me when I was about fourteen.  There was no need to explain to me what they were doing, as I already knew.  If the child was younger, I would sit down with both parents. (this just reassures them) and explain to him that mom and dad need some time alone.  If you feel comfortable, it would be a good time to "have the talk" with them.  If not, just continue to explain as best you can....or like spiderman suggests, just avoid them.	family and relationships

binomial distribution? Is binomial distribution only describe ture experiments? wt about the natural experiment? The binomial distribution can describe both ture and natural experiments. A natural experiment occurs when your dog knocks over your jar of coins, and some of the coins land heads up and some tails up. If your dog does this many thousands of times, most of the time the coin distribution will be close to 50% heads and 50% tails, but hardly ever exactly 50% if you have lots of coins. But on some days you will get 75% heads and 25% tails, of course much less frequently than close to 50%. The binomial distribution describes the number of days that you will get each different kind of heads-tails outcome.\n\nAs for ture experiments, you are on your own.	science
Why does colored plastic turn white under stress?  Polymeric materials like plastic are made up of big molecules, and these very long molecules are disposed in a chaotic way, and there are links between molecules, It's something similar to a spaghetti dish and this structure is defined amorphous because there is no order. When plastic is put under stress these molecules are stretched and in that places the structure become more tidy , so it became crystalline, and crystalline structures are opaque, while amorphous structures are transparent.\nPigments are not important in this phenomenon.	science

The word paper comes from the ancient Egyptian writing material called "papyrus", which was woven from papyrus plants. \n\nPapyrus was produced as early as 3000 BCE in Egypt, and in ancient Greece and Rome. Further north, parchment or vellum, made of processed sheepskin or calfskin, replaced papyrus, as the papyrus plant requires subtropical conditions to grow. \n\nIn China, documents were ordinarily written on bamboo, making them very heavy and awkward to transport. Silk was sometimes used, but was normally too expensive to consider. Indeed, most of the above materials were rare and costly.\n\nArcheologically, true paper had been excavated in China dated from the 2nd-century BC. It spread slowly outside of China; other East Asian cultures, even after seeing paper, could not figure out how to make it themselves. Instruction in the manufacturing process was required, and the Chinese were reluctant to share their secrets. The technology was first transferred to Korea in 600 and then imported to Japan by a Buddhist priest.\n\nAfter further commercial trading and the defeat of the Chinese in the Battle of Talas, the invention spread to the Middle East, where it was adopted in India and subsequently in Italy in about the 13th century. They used hemp and linen rags as a source of fiber. The oldest known paper document in the West is the Missel of Silos from the 11th century.	science
What adaptations does a xerophyte have that makes it able to store water? I need this for school?  Desert Plant Adaptations\nDesert plants have adapted to the extremes of heat and aridity by using both physical and behavioral mechanisms, much like desert animals.\n\nPlants that have adapted by altering their physical structure are called xerophytes. Xerophytes, such as cacti, usually have special means of storing and conserving water. They often have few or no leaves, which reduces transpiration.\n\nPhreatophytes are plants that have adapted to arid environments by growing extremely long roots, allowing them to acquire moisture at or near the water table.\n\nOther desert plants, using behavioral adaptations, have developed a lifestyle in conformance with the seasons of greatest moisture and/or coolest temperatures. These type of plants are usually (and inaccurately) referred to as perennials, plants that live for several years, and annuals, plants that live for only a season.\n\nDesert perennials often survive by remaining dormant during dry periods of the year, then springing to life when water becomes available.\n\nMost annual desert plants germinate only after heavy seasonal rain, then complete their reproductive cycle very quickly. They bloom prodigiously for a few weeks in the spring, accounting for most of the annual wildflower explosions of the deserts. Their heat- and drought-resistant seeds remain dormant in the soil until the next year's annual rains.\n\nXerophytes\nThe physical and behavioral adaptations of desert plants are as numerous and innovative as those of desert animals. Xerophytes, plants that have altered their physical structure to survive extreme heat and lack of water, are the largest group of such plants living in the deserts of the American Southwest.\n\nEach of the four southwestern deserts offers habitats in which most xerophytic plants survive. But each is characterized by specific plants that seem to thrive there. The Great Basin Desert is noted for vast rolling stands of Sagebrush and Saltbush, while in the Mojave Desert, Joshua Trees, Creosote Bush, and Burroweed predominate. The Sonoran Desert is home to an incredible variety of succulents, including the giant Saguaro Cactus, as well as shrubs and trees like mesquite, Paloverde, and Ironwood. The Chihuahuan Desert is noted for mesquite ground cover and shrubby undergrowth, such as Yucca and Prickly Pear Cactus.\n\nCactus, xerophytic adaptations of the rose family, are among the most drought-resistant plants on the planet due to their absence of leaves, shallow root systems, ability to store water in their stems, spines for shade and waxy skin to seal in moisture. Cacti originated in the West Indies and migrated to many parts of the New World, populating the deserts of the Southwest with hundreds of varieties, such as the Beavertail Cactus and Jumping Cholla.\n\nCacti depend on chlorophyll in the outer tissue of their skin and stems to conduct photosynthesis for the manufacture of food. Spines protect the plant from animals, shade it from the sun and also collect moisture. Extensive shallow root systems are usually radial, allowing for the quick acquisition of large quantities of water when it rains. Because they store water in the core of both stems and roots, cacti are well-suited to dry climates and can survive years of drought on the water collected from a single rainfall.\n\nMany other desert trees and shrubs have also adapted by eliminating leaves -- replacing them with thorns, not spines -- or by greatly reducing leaf size to eliminate transpiration (loss of water to the air). Such plants also usually have smooth, green bark on stems and trunks serving to both produce food and seal in moisture.\n\nPhreatophytes\nPhreatophytes, like the mesquite tree, have adapted to desert conditions by developing extremely long root systems to draw water from deep underground near the water table. The mesquite's roots are considered the longest of any desert plant and have been recorded as long as 80 feet. Botanists do not agree on the exact c	science

hey guess im doing a project and i really need ur help please!!!!!!!!!!? im doing a history project on the great wall of china and i dont know wat else i can write about please help The Great Wall of China (Simplified Chinese:  Traditional Chinese: Pinyin: Wànlĭ Chángchéng; literally "10,000 Li¹ long wall") is a Chinese fortification built from 3rd century BC until the beginning of the 17th century, in order to protect the various dynasties from raids by Mongol, Turkic, and other nomadic tribes coming from areas in modern-day Mongolia and Manchuria. Several walls were built since the 3rd century BC, the most famous being the Great Wall built between 220 BC and 200 BC by the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, which was located much further north than the current Great Wall of China built during the Ming Dynasty, and little remains.\n\nThe Wall stretches over a formidable 6,352 km (3,948 miles), from Shanhai Pass on the Bohai Sea in the east, at the limit between China proper and Manchuria, to Lop Nur in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (refer to University of Washington: A. The Main Caravan Routes (b) The “Central Route” or “Middle Route.”)\n\nHISTORY \n\nA defensive wall on the northern border was built and maintained by several dynasties at different times in Chinese history. Its purpose, to defend the China mainland from nomadic Mongolians. There have been five major walls:\n\n208 BC (Qin Dynasty) \n1st century BC (Han Dynasty) \n7th century CE (Sui Dynasty) \n1138 - 1198 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period) \n1368 - 1640 (from Hongwu Emperor until Wanli Emperor of the Ming Dynasty) \nThe first major wall was built during the reign of the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. This wall was not constructed as a single endeavor, but was mostly the product of joining several regional walls built by the Warring States. The walls that were linked together at this time consisted of rammed earth with watch towers built at regular intervals. It was located much further north than the current Great Wall with its eastern end at modern day North Korea. Very little of this first wall remains - photos reveal a low, long mound.\n\nThe government ordered people to work on the wall, and workers were under perpetual danger of being attacked by brigands. Because many people died while building the wall, it has obtained the gruesome title, "longest cemetery on Earth" or "the long graveyard." Possibly as many as one million workers died building the wall, though the true numbers cannot be determined now.\n\nThe later long walls built by the Han, the Sui, and the Ten Kingdoms period were also built along the same design. They were made of rammed earth with multi-story watch towers built every few miles. These walls have also largely vanished into the surrounding landscape, eroded away by wind and rain.\n\nIn military terms, these walls were more frontier demarcations than defensive fortifications of worth. Certainly Chinese military strategy did not revolve around holding the wall, instead it was the cities themselves which were fortified.\n\nThe Great Wall which tourists visit today was built during the Ming Dynasty, starting around the year 1368 and lasting till around 1640. Work on the wall started as soon as the Ming took control of China but initially, walls were not the Ming's prefered response to raids out of the north. That attitude began to change in response to the Ming's inablilty to defeat the Oirat war leader Esen Taiji in the period 1449 to 1454. A huge Ming army with the Zhengtong Emperor at its head was anihilated in battle and the emperor himself held hostage in 1449.\n\nAppearently the real focus on wall building started as a result of Altan Khan's siege of Beijing which took place one hundred years later in 1550. The Ming, faced with the choice of trying to defeat the Mongols with direct military force, choose instead to build a massive defensive barrior to protect China. As a result, most of the Ming Great Wall was built in the period 1560 to 1640. This new wall was built on a grand scale with longer lasting materials (s	science

Why are the clouds before a tornado green?  While, dangerous thunderstorms that drop hail and spin up tornadoes seem to be routinely observed as turning green ("going green" in the movie Twister), scientists are trying to find out what exactly is going on. \n\nThey have confirmed that some thunderstorms do turn green, and have various theories about why. \n\nOne possibility is that thick, thunderstorm clouds, with their water vapor, rain and hail, scatter sunlight in such a way as to give the clouds a blue hue. \n\nWhen the sun is low in the sky, such as before sunset when most severe storms occur, the reddening light of the sun when shining through Earth's atmosphere makes the bluish cloud tint turn green. \n\nOr, maybe storm clouds act as a kind of canvas upon which low sunlight, scattered by particles in the air, paints a greenish color. \n\nBoth of these could be correct, and they may play in concert with each other to create the observed green tint. \n\nIn the spring of 1995, a University of Oklahoma graduate student used a special device called a spectrophotometer to measure the wavelength of light emitted from thunderstorm clouds during Project VORTEX, a major study of tornadoes. (Related: U. of Okla.: Green thunderstorm presentation).\n\nHis research confirmed green, greenish-yellow, and greenish-blue colors of the clouds, while ruling out lush farmland as the source of the green color. \n\nBut the researcher concluded that the actual green color observed may be different for different people. In other words, what may look strikingly green to one person, might be more greenish-blue or greenish-yellow to someone else. Maybe not even green at all. \n\nAll that's known for sure is that green thunderstorms do exist. It's not known whether all green thunderstorms are severe, nor whether all severe thunderstorms turn green.\n\nThe best advice: don't wait to see green clouds before seeking shelter from severe thunderstorms.	science
During sunrise and during moonrise on full moon nights, why does the sun and moon respectively appear large? The sun is more or less at the same distance from the earth on the same day so why does the sun appear so large during dawn and why does the moon appear large during moonrise??? It is an illusion. People tend to perceive objects on the horizon as larger than they really are, but you can destroy the illusion by looking at the horizon upside down. Really! I have tried it. And it is not only the Moon, but trees and buildings too. As you tilt your head more and more things on the horizon start to look smaller. I notice that sideways is enough tilt for me to see things on the horizon as noticeable smaller than when looking upright. The usual suggestion is to bend over and look at the horizon between your legs, but that is just to embarrassing for me so I tilt my head sideways until I am looking upside down to one side of my legs and notice the size changing when I am about half Way to being upside down. Try it, it is easy!	science

How WMAP  took picture in infrared of the universe aged about 400000 years old after the big bang ?? How COBE and WMAP could talk a picture in infrared of the universe aged about 400000 years old after the big bang ? The “Big Bang” really refers to one simple hypothesis:  that the Universe is expanding from a state when it was once much hotter and denser than it is today.  One can think of a “zero point” at which the Universe was unimaginably tiny, etc., and that point is what we often refer to as the “Big Bang,” but that presupposes a bit more than we need to.\n\nSo…  If the Universe was indeed once much hotter and denser than it is today, it may have been too hot and too dense for light to travel very far—a bit like the interior of a cloud, which is too dense for us to see inside.  We would then only “see” (i.e., be able to detect) radiation from a time after that epoch, after the Universe had cooled to the point that photons could zip around relatively unimpeded, as they do today.  That point in time corresponds to the equivalent of the surface of a cloud in our sky—also called the “surface of last scattering,” which isn’t a distinct, smooth surface at all, but kind of a fuzzy region that represents the limit of how far we can see into the cloud.  (Or, in the case of the Universe, the surface of last scattering, is the fuzzy boundary between when the Universe was too hot for light to travel far and when it was cool enough for photons to travel basically inifintely far.)\n\nSo far, so good (I hope).  It turns out that we can calculate the temperature at which this transition would took place—something like 3,000 Kelvins (or 5,000° Fahrenheit).  Something that hot should radiate light in a highly characteristic way, which we call “blackbody” radiation—the same effect that causes the Sun or other stars or a red-hot poker to glow a certain color.  As it turns out, a 3,000-Kelvin blackbody would glow reddish-orange—not just a single wavelength that we’d call “reddish-orange,” but a collection of wavelengths that peak around the color reddish-orange.\n\nBut wait!  The Universe is expanding, and light expands with it.  So that reddish-orange gets redshifted down into microwave light.  COBE and WMAP detect exactly the kind of microwave light we’d expect from a blackbody some 13 billion years in the past.  This is a remarkable confirmation of the Big Bang hypothesis.  Furthermore, we can look at the characteristics of the blackbody “curve” (another name for the collection of wavelengths of light emitted by stuff of a certain temperature) and determine lots of other things about the early Universe.  Including the time that the light was emitted, about 370,000 years after the “Big Bang.”\n\nOf course, other sources of microwave radiation get in the way, but because we’re looking for a collection of wavelengths (not just a single color, but a collection of colors that correspond to a specific temperature), we can weed out interference.  So we can determine which photons have travelled to us all the way from the early Universe, some 13 billion years ago.\n\nThe WMAP website explains all this pretty well, if you want another description:\nhttp://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/m_mm.html\n\nI hope that helps…\n\n\nRyan Wyatt\nRose Center for Earth & Space\nNew York, New York	science
Why do planets turn over the sun on ellipse ways?  The elliptical orbits are the result of Kepler's Law; the shape of a planet's orbit around a larger mass is a function of each planet's mass and the distance between the orbits.  One can derive the elliptical orbit path from Newton's Laws; when you start from Newton's Laws and perform this derivation, your result will be an equation in the form of an ellipse.\n\nSometimes orbits are not elliptical, but are circular.  Consider binary stars - when the masses of 2 binary stars is equal, the respective orbial path traced by each star is a cicrle in the complex plane, not an ellipse.\n\nBy the way, symmetry is one of the most natural phenomena observable.  To say that symmetry is not found in nature very often is an indication of lack of advanced physical and mathematical study.  Consider rings, field, and group theory.  Symmetric wavefunctions of identical particles and allowable energetic transition states in a molecule or, in some cases, an atom.  I could list 1000 different natural PERFECT symmetries based on solid foundations of laws of conservation and irrefutable mathematics, but only because I am limited as a human being in my knowledge of symmetrical processes.  There are many more than 1000 examples.  You get my point.	science

So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being "that which explains existence." \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though.

What Kind of embalming practices are out there? I want to know more about different ways people do embalming or funerals or at least when a person dies. Embalming is a way to prepare a dead human body for a viewing or funeral. Essentially, embalming removes the blood and other fluids from the body and replaces it with chemicals which temporarily restore the appearance of the body, sanitize the surface of the body, and slow down the decomposition of the body. \nArterial embalming is done by opening an artery, pumping embalming fluid into it (usually mechanically), and draining the blood through a vein. Sometimes many arteries are used if the body condition warrants it. Any incisions are sealed. Arterial fluid usually contains a pink dye to restore an "capillary flush" look to a person.\nCavity embalming is done by removing all the contents of the hollow organs (stomach, lungs, intestines, etc.) with a   tube-like instrument hooked up to a suction machine. An entry point is usually near the navel and all the fluid and blood is removed from the pelvic, abdominal and thoracic cavities. A strong embalming fluid is then introduced to the cavities, and the entry point is sealed. \nMost people who are embalmed have both arterial and cavity embalming done. Often these procedures are followed by cosmetizing the person to restore their coloration.	science
Why is time the fourth dimension? I'm not denying it's a dimension.  I'm just wondering how they know time isn't the first or the second or the third.  Who says it has to be the fourth?

The body needs to break down peroxide because it is a powerful oxidizer and acts as a free radical. If peroxide builds up in the body, cellular damage may happen.	science

What kinds of radiation have to be observed from the atmosphere? Visible light, x-rays, gamma rays, cosmic rays? "Electromagnetic radiation from space is unable to reach the surface of the Earth except at a very few wavelengths, such as the visible spectrum, radio frequencies, and some ultraviolet wavelengths. Astronomers can get above enough of the Earth's atmosphere to observe at some infrared wavelengths from mountain tops or by flying their telescopes in an aircraft. Experiments can also be taken up to altitudes as high as 35 km by balloons which can operate for months. Rocket flights can take instruments all the way above the Earth's atmosphere for just a few minutes before they fall back to Earth, but a great many important first results in astronomy and astrophysics came from just those few minutes of observations. For long-term observations, however, it is best to have your detector on an orbiting satellite ... and get above it all!"\n\nFor those frequencies that do get through, it's a lot cheaper to build the telescopes on the earth, even if you do need to put a lot of effort into correcting the wobble in the images caused by turbulence in the atmosphere. It's far cheaper to make a huge earth-bound telescope with fancy adaptive optics than it is to send up a space telescope... but you only get a few slices of the spectrum.	science

thank you for quick response,however im still at aloss.how do the atoms in a pencil for example"know" know that it is part of the eraser and not the metal fastner or the wood or the black ink in the name stamped inthe side?if they are constantly in motion why doesnt the pencil not begin to blur and dissisipate? .  The atoms in the pencil are in motion, but not freely in motion.  The atoms are bound up in molecules which make up crystaline or cellular structures.  The metal atoms in the eraser holder are part of the metal crystaline matrix.  The carbon and other atoms of the eraser are parts of organic molecules which form strands which are interlinked.  The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the wood are parts of cellulose molucules which formed the cell wall of the tree from which the wood was taken.  The "lead" of the pencil contains carbon molecules in fractured crystals of graphite, which are mixed with clay, which contains silicon, aluminum and oxygen in a crystaline structure.\n.  If you picture a ping pong ball tethered by a weak rubber band and knocked around by a mild shifting breeze, the ping pong ball would be "free" to move, but the rubber band would keep it moving about the same center.  A stronger breeze might have enough energy to break the rubber band and let the ping pong ball be blown wherever the wind goes.\n.  Atoms are of just the size that puts them on the brink of quantum mechanical uncertainty.  They are large enough that the uncertainty about their position is very small, even when their energy is know to a high degree of precision.  In quantum mechanics, this means that the amount they will wander is quite small, small enough that they remain bound to their neighbors in their molecular or crystaline arrangements.  Adding energy in the form of heat both increases the uncertainty about their position and increases the probability that their bonds will be broken.	science

What are the methods to solve an equation with more than one variable? First I would like to know how to solve equations that both have x, and y.I've managed before with help, but forgotten. Then, maybe examples of equations with 3 variables? I am sure such an equation is present in higher algebra and precalculus, and whatnot, but I'm curious.If anyone gives an example, how would the rules differ for a system of solving equations? Here is the rule: you have to have the same number of equations as you have variables to solve.  For example:\n\nx + y = 1\n\nx - y = 1\n\nHere you have two equations and two unknowns.  The process is to solve one equation for one of the variables, and substituting that into the other:\n\nx = 1 - y\n\n(1-y) -y = 1\n\nNow you solve the new equation for y:\n\n-2y = 0\ny = 0\n\nNow you plug y into any of the equations (preferably the easier one), and you get x.\n\nx + 0 = 1\n\nx = 1\n\nOf course this gets more complicated with each new variable and equation, but the process is the same.  You keep substituting until you get one equation with one variable.	science
why do some concrete mixes contain flyash? are there alternatives to flyash in a mix design? There are a few explainations.\n\n1.) Fly Ash is much cheaper than cement.  With the prices of natural gas and the fact that production of cement requires a rotary kiln that is heated by natural gas the cost of cement has gone through the roof.  From my understanding a ton of cement has increased in price by like 20% over the last year or so.\n\n2.) Fly Ash is a natural pozzulan and water reducer.  Fly ash lowers the water requirements of the concrete mix making for a much stronger concrete.  Fly ash slows early strength gains but increases late strength gains as well as increasing workability.  Think of it like this.  You put rocks in a jar and there's voids, then you fill in those voids with sand, water, and cement but there's still small voids so you use fly ash to fill those in.  You can still have voids and use other things to fill those in but that's for another question.\n\n3.) Fly Ash is a waste material (from coal fired power plants i believe don't quote me).  The federal government requires its use in some of its projects or at the very least recommends it.  It is considered a green material and i read an article in Concrete Construction magazine (Jan 2006 issue) about HVFA (high volume fly ash) mixes.  They will replace like 51% of the cement with Fly Ash in the mix and get tremendous late strengths out of the concrete.\n\nThese are three of the main reason's for the use of fly ash.  As sustainable building (green construction) continues to gain backing you'll probably find more use of fly ash in concrete.  Also with it being cheaper people will want it used.\n\nStrictly speaking Fly Ash DOES NOT increase the density of the concrete.  Fly Ash has a specific gravity of about 2.00 (meaning for a given volume it weighs 2 times the same volume of water), Cement has a specific gravity of about 3.15.  If you have 3 cubic feet of cement then it will weigh 589.68 pounds (3 x 62.4 x 3.15).  If you substitue 1.5 cubic feet of that for Fly Ash then you will have [(1.5 x 62.4 x 2.00)+(1.5 x 62.4 x 3.15)] or 187.2 + 294.84 = 482.04 lbs. (a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds i believe).  Fly ash actually lowers the unit weight of the concrete, because for a given volume it weighs 63.5% of what portland cement does.	science

why satillite orbits without much fuel consumption?  because there is very little resistance in space. objects in motion will stay in motion unless a force acts on them. since they are in space, there's not really much of a foce acting on them with one exception: gravity.\n\ngravity of course pulls the satellites down towards the earth. but the satellite is moving at a fairly constant velocity in a direction which is tangent to the earth. so the direction of travel is always perpendicular to the force of gravity, which means that the satellite stays in perfect orbit.\n\nif it used its fuel to speed up, it would overcome the earth's gravity and fly off into space. if it used its fuel to slow down, the earth's gravity would overcome the satellites speed and pull it in. orbit is the perfect middle ground between these two.\n\nnow if there were a bunch of air in space, then the air molecules would cause friction that would slow the satellite down. the earth's gravity would then pull it in and cause it to crash. so to overcome the air molecules, the satellite would need a constant thrust to keep it in orbit. but since there is little or no resistance in space, it doesn't need to hit its boosters at all. it just needs to get up to the perfect speed and physics will take care of the rest.\n\nsorry if this was unclear. it's late ;p	education and reference

How many men did General Hannibal Barca Have in the second PUnic War between Carthage and Rome? I need the answer like...NOW my project is do tomorrow on 5-26 The Second Punic War broke out in 218 when Hannibal took control of the Greek city and Roman ally, Saguntum (in Spain). Rome thought it would be easy to defeat Hannibal, but Hannibal, leaving 20,000 troops with his brother Hasdrubal, went further north on the Rhone River than the Romans expected and crossed the river with his elephants on flotation devices. \n\nHannibal reached the Po Valley with less than half his men. He had also encountered unexpected resistance from local tribes, although he did manage to recruit Gauls. This meant he had 30,000 troops by the time he met the Romans in battle. \n\nHannibal won battles in Trebia and at Lake Trasimene, and then continued through the Apennine Mountains. With troops from Gaul and Spain on his side, Hannibal won another battle, against Lucius Aemilius, in which the Romans lost thousands of troops, including their leader. The historian Polybius describes the both sides of this, the Battle of Cannae, as gallant, and says of the losses:\n--\nHannibal's army in Iberia reportedly totaled 90,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, although those figures probably include Hasdrubal's forces as well as Hannibal's. The expeditionary force would still number as many as 75,000 foot soldiers and 9,000 horsemen. His army also had an unknown number of war elephants. \n\nAfter completing his overland journey, Hannibal descended from the foothills into northern Italy. He had arrived, however, accompanied by only half the forces he had started with, and only a few elephants. In total, Hannibal had lost as many as 20,000 men and all but three of his war elephants	education and reference
are new modes of literacy evolving?if so,what are the implications for us as language teachers?  Literacy is one of the fastest changing arenas in education today.  The very idea that literacy simply means the ability to read and write is no longer valid (though that is what the word literally means).  The new ideas of literacy focus on students' individual prior knowledge, how they use that prior knowledge to navigate through particular subject matter and finally what the student is able to accomplish.  I have even heard talk (and I don't by into this much, but it is the 'buzz') that literacy doesn't necessarily mean being able to read about baseball, but if the student can tell you about baseball and play baseball, even if they can't read about baseball, is still somewhat literate in that subject.\n\nWhat does this mean for Language teachers?  Hmmm, I don't think it means much other that we have to modify how we view our assesment of student achievement.  We have to be a little more open and creative when monitoring and assessing the education progress of each student taking into account (and being more cognizant of) individual learning styles and modalities.  \n\nThis is a good thing in the fact that you can, with a little (lot) more effort reach more of your students...but it also gives the legislature more slosh room for "NCLB" standards and benchmarks.  We still, as Language teachers, have to focus on the reading and writing, but the legislation says that we, and esp. if the IEP states, can now take grades and make alternative assessments if if the child in question is unable to do the classical showing of proficiency (as long as they can, in some way show they have learned the material).\n\nSo, I am not sure if I answered the question as you would have liked.  I am in the habit of being verbose and this particular area can get pretty heavy between petagogy, philosophy, legislation, and personal vision.  All in all the effort is to try and make sure all students are able to show a certain amount of proficiency in a myriad of ways...while (by some miracle) being able to perform adaquately on their particular state's madatory assessment tool.\n\nTO me...I still do my job and expect my students to know and be able to do everything I ask of them...even if it is hard.  I follow state mandates regarding benchmarks, IEP's, ESOL, etc...  I do engage in alternative assessment, but it still is a language class...thus they, in the end, have to be able to read, comprehend and compose proficiently.	education and reference

how increase our self confidence, i want motivate myself , say technique and steps?  Self-confidence is an attitude which allows individuals to have positive yet realistic views of themselves and their situations. Self-confident people trust their own abilities, have a general sense of control in their lives, and believe that, within reason, they will be able to do what they wish, plan, and expect. \n\nHaving self-confidence does not mean that individuals will be able to do everything. Self-confident people have expectations that are realistic. Even when some of their expectations are not met, they continue to be positive and to accept themselves. \n\nPeople who are not self-confident depend excessively on the approval of others in order to feel good about themselves. They tend to avoid taking risks because they fear failure. They generally do not expect to be successful. They often put themselves down and tend to discount or ignore compliments paid to them. By contrast, self-confident people are willing to risk the disapproval of others because they generally trust their own abilities. They tend to accept themselves; they don't feel they have to conform in order to be accepted. \n\nSelf-confidence is not necessarily a general characteristic which pervades all aspects of a person's life. Typically, individuals will have some areas of their lives where they feel quite confident, e.g.,academics, athletics, while at the same time they do not feel at all confident in other areas, e.g., personal appearance, social relationships.	education and reference

Walden Question. Thoreau? Why did Thoreau leave the woods. I don't think he left out of loneliness becuase he said that solitude was his friend. Also what does he hope to gain by living in the woods. My reaspn would be to completely simplify his life. Can you give me some addtional info? Thoreau left the woods because he felt like he spent too much time lamenting the world's problems and not enough fixing them.\n\nBackground info:  Emerson was Thoureau's hero.  Emerson taught everything that Thoreau believed (mainly Transcendentalism and a mix b/w anarchy and true communism-not Chinese communism). However, Thoureau discovered that Emerson was a hipocrite- he didn't practice what he preached- and he (Thoreau) decided that he didn't want to be known as a hipocrite.  Unfortunately, Thoureau's circle of influence was much smaller than Emerson's, so he didn't do a whole lot to change the world. \n\nThoreou wanted to live in the woods because he wanted to live "deliberately" and simply. Here is a quote from his essay "Where I Lived and What I Lived For" :\n     "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived."\n\nI hope this helped- I'm studying Thoreau right now too- so I'm not exactly an expert, you should try reading "The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail"- it will either make things clearer for you, or confuse you even more.	education and reference

I need a list of food that was eatable in ltay in the 1500's?  Medieval Italy \nAround the year 1000, we have the first documented recipe for pasta in the book "De arte Coquinaria per vermicelli e macaroni siciliani", (The Art of Cooking Sicilian Macaroni and Vermicelli) written by Martino Corno, chef to the powerful Patriarch of Aquileia. \n\nThe first historical sources referring to the production of dried pasta in what seems like a small-scale industrial enterprise date from 1150 when the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi reports that at Trabia, about 30 km. from Palermo, "they produce an abundance of pasta in the shape of strings ("tria" in Arabic) which are exported everywhere, in Calabria and in many Muslim and Christian countries, even by ship." \n\nIn 1279 a Genoese soldier listed in the inventory of his estate a basket of dried pasta ('una bariscella plena de macaronis'). A document from 1244 and another from 1316 testify to the production of dried pasta in Liguria, indicating that pasta was now common all over the Italian peninsula. \n\nBetween 1400 and 1500, the production by craftsmen of "fidei" (pasta in the local dialect) became quite widespread in Liguria, as demonstrated by the founding of the Corporation of Pasta-Makers in 1546 (the oldest surviving document of this guild, however, dates from 1571) in Naples. In 1574 a similar guild was founded in Genoa, three years later, the "Regolazione dell'Arte dei Maestri Fidelari" (Rules for the Pasta-Masters' Art Corporation) were drawn up in Savona. \n\nIn 1584, the author Giordano Bruno quotes a Neapolitan saying, " è cascato il maccarone dentro il formaggio " (the maccherone has fallen into the cheese).	education and reference

describe the steps involved with mummification?  Preparing a body for the afterlife in ancient egypt was a very long and complicated process.  The Egyptians believed that preserving the body in death was important to keep their soul alive.  The Embalmers were priests who were trained in the mummification process.  Mummification was a ritual, so the priests who participated were trained to perform the process with both surgical and ritual precision.  The embalmers were required to work and labor outside of the town in a workshop called a “Wabet” or a clean place.\n\nThe head priest that supervised the ritual wore a terra-cotta mask in the form of Anubis.  Anubis was the chosen god for surgeons, and for priests performing the mummification process.  By wearing the mask of Anubis it symbolized Anubis watching over the mummification process to guide the priests in the ritual.  It was important that the priest did not make any unnecessary cuts in the body, because if the spirit could not recognize the body it would be doomed to wonder across the Earth and possibly haunt the priest responsible.\n\nThe first step in the process was to make a cut in the abdomen, below the ribs, on the left side of the body.  This first incision was done with a special flint knife, and all other cutting was done with an ordinary metal blade.  They had to cut into the body so that they could take out special organs.  Once the organs were removed they were placed in canopic jars, which were carved out of alabaster and inscribed with spells that would one day enable the organs to rejoin the body when it was resurrected.  The organs that were placed in the jars include: stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver.  Once inside the canopic jars each organ was protected by the one of sons of Horus whose head graced the lid.\n\nNext the brain would be extracted through the nose and then thrown away.  Resin was then poured through the nose and into the skull with the use of a funnel, to keep the head from collapsing.  The heart was left in place because later in the underworld Anubis would weigh the heart and guide the soul through the underworld.  During the embalming process every part of the body was saved and either placed in the tomb with the body or given to the relatives of the deceased.  Then, the body and organs were preserved with spices and dried out with natron salt.  The spices that were used in the preservation process made the body look brown and leathery.\n\nThe entire preservation process took about 70 days.  After the process was complete, the body was wrapped in linen.  Death masks were placed on the head of the mummy around the bandages to be used as a replacement head incase something happened to the real skull. Special amulets were placed within the wrapping of the mummy to protect it.  Finally, a “mummy tag,” similar to our toe tags, was placed around the mummy’s neck to help identify it for burial.	education and reference

I want to transfer to a different college.

So, the credits that you earned at your first school will transfer, the credits you failed won't.\n\nYour GPA will usually not transfer to the new college; your GPA there will usually only be figured on the courses you take at the new college. \n\nThe fact that you failed the second semester will be more of a problem in gaining admission to another college rather than a problem once you get admitted to another college.	education and reference

My bodies tired but my mind seems restless, how can i go to sleep?  Self hypnotize yourself to sleep. Close your eyes. Picture a place that makes you the most happy..mountains,beach,green pastures, something you can picture in detail. Then begin to 'build' it in your mind. Begin with things closest to you and then work outwards, and as you imagine outwards imagine yourself moving slowly forward. It helps if you think the sentence"slowly I walk....." as you move outwards.\n Best way to describe it is for me to tell you mine I guess. I imagine the sky dark,the only light being the moon..it's full. I hear the ocean as it comes in and out. Slowly I walk toward it feeling cool sand on my bare feet. I creep closer and closer to the shoreline. First just my toes get submerged in the warm water, then my calves(you have to actually see and hear your imagery it'll take practice before you can do it real good.) Long imagery short I eventually end up fully submerged and swim slowly to the very bottom of the water where there is a small pin prick of light (the pinprick of light is important you need it in yours too) I slowly make my way to it and as I move closer it gets gradually bigger. If I'm still awake after I reach it I imagine going through it until I am on the other side which is sky blue and I 'float' through the air. You have to make your senses cooperate with you...hearing smelling and feeling everything imagined. This really works and it's a technique I read in a book years ago when I was younger. Can't remember the book just the technique. It puts me to sleep every time and everyone I have shared it with has found peaceful slumber also. Oh big detail make sure your room is quiet and dark unless the dark bothers you.	health
Is urticaria deseases harmful?  Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is a frequent complaint of patients in the ED. It consists of circumscribed areas of raised erythema and edema of the superficial dermis. Urticaria can be acute or chronic, and a variety of urticarial variants exist, such as hereditary angioedema and anaphylaxis. \n\nBy definition, the acute form of urticaria lasts less than 4-6 weeks, and the chronic form lasts more than 4-6 weeks. Although the treatment for urticaria is specific and straightforward, the list of causes is extensive. When a patient presents with acute urticaria within 24 hours of onset, a cause often can be determined. However, in many cases of both acute and chronic urticaria, the cause can be difficult or even impossible to determine. Thus, although the determination of the underlying etiology of urticaria represents a diagnostic challenge, the management of urticaria remains straightforward and generally successful.\nPruritus (itching) and rash are the primary manifestations of urticaria, and hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation are rare. Acute urticaria is usually self-limited and commonly resolves within 24 hours but may last up to 4-6 weeks. Chronic urticaria lasts more than 4-6 weeks. Neither acute nor chronic urticaria results in long-term consequences (other than depression) or death	health

Why we r yawning? When? How our body act? It's a mechanizm the body uses to regulate the O2 levels in the body tissues. If you are in a confined room you are more likely to yawn because of the decreased O2 levels in that room.

Is there anyway to increase the size of penis witout using suppliments..?  Dear Buddy,\n\n   Suppliments and gadgets are all a huge scam. I don't care if it's endorsed by the pope himself, it's a ploy to get your money. The only way to increase penis size is through an operation. This operation is about $4,000 and will give you an extra 1in-2 1/2 in. So if you have the money go for it,but I think you should just focus on other aspects of pleasing your partner. A larger or longer penis won't lead to happiness, more dates, or a happier life. You'll just have a funny lookin longer penis.

Fever and involuntary jerking/shaking can be a danger and something has to be causing it. If Insurance is a problem, there should be some form of clinic near you that can work with you.. Also an ER in a hospital can't turn you away and won't charge you on the spot.. usually they will work out some sort of payment plan as well.	health
anyone know what a septic infection, How could U get this inf, inside U?

There I alot of heat  Sweeling, redness, heat,& pain, When I talk with the doctor. before the surgery in early April, after I have the surgery done. He treats me like another #  When I try to show him, what  is going on with my knee he changes the subject and tell me I have a drug problem, I think NOT I went into his office he grab my purse and took my pain pills. he said, He would send them to me in a week he has not. I am under pain mangment\nHe keeps trake of my med. That one week still has not happen at all. My ? is. what happen to the meds. I am in pain mangament. and he keeps close trake of how much pain meds, I have ! well.....  'need an answer' you state you are a medical professional. All I can say is thank god I dont have anything to do with you. What a closed mind. As someone also in the medical profession, what you allude to certainly does happen however you are being extremely judgemental here, and remember it's the internet here. sounds like you are purely siding with the doctor.... people usually do that to protect their own.\n\nI prefer to have an open mind and treat each patient as an individual, have in my mind the potential reasons why patients have complications... but assess each case on it's own merits.\n\n'treefrog' - nice answer. Hope you are going well.\n\nTo help the person asking this question however ----\n\nSepsis and septic infection literally means an infection around the site.. which has the potential to travel around the body and cause many more serious problems. It is not uncommon to have infections after a surgery. The professionals involved do everything they can to reduce the risk however  they cannot reduce the risk to zero. We all have bugs that live on our skin happily, healthily fighting off other viruses and bugs that we come into contact with. It's when these bugs get into your system, into a spot they shouldnt that they cause trouble. The treatment you have undegone is fairly standard for your condition and complication ( in regards to the antibiotics) It is vitally important that the infection get under control so that your knee surgery can finally be finished.\n\nHowever if you had told me this story... I would have the following concerns - \n\n1. Sounds like the doctor, by what you describe here, isnt listening to you, or is... but not allaying your fears. that is all about communication. If potentially he isnt hearing what you are saying, or not explaining things properly because you may be too upset to listen properly, my suggestion is to take a friend along to your next appointment. Have a list of questions written down and ask them, one by one. Do not give your doctor the list, just ask them the way you have written them - its your list, you need to understand it.\n\n2. The doctor removing medication from your handbag. I am afraid no professional has the right to do this. The medication is legally prescribed, you have had it legally dispensed from a pharmacist, it has your name on it. It is yours. My question here to him would be... why did you do that... why havent you sent them to me... If he thinks you may be starting to have an addiction to pain medication... then he has handled it poorly. Communication is the key again. He has taken your pain medication and not sent it.... maybe I can jump to conclusions like 'need an answer' did and say the doctor is taking the medication himself and he is addicted????\n\nAssumptions dont help. Getting you comfortable and pain free and on the right treatment is the goal here.\n\nTake a friend along, ask the questions, if you dont get satisfactory answers, then seek a second opinion. Maybe it isnt your fault, but a fault of the doctor in question.\n\nAfter all.... we are all human. sometimes everyone needs to be reminded of that. ( including you, 'need an answer' )	health

pain during intercourse? what might this possibly be? I have been tested already for every std possible even though I do not have unprotected sex. Sometimes when I wear a certain pair of jeans, I get pain in my pelvic region. I have regular pap smears. Also sometimes I get swelling in the left side of my pelvic area accompanying the pain. I have been to the doctor who does not do the proper testing, been to the ER when pain is severe for them to tell me nothing is wrong after doing NO testing whatsoever, give me an ibuprofen and send me home because I'm  uninsured. \nI need to know what this may be so I can demand that they check for it. Something is wrong and I need to find out what it is. please help. I do agree that you need a new doctor. First, you need to determine the kind of pain you are having during intercourse. Your doctor should do a thorough pelvic exam on you so that he can determine where the pain is located. If you are having pain in the entire vaginal region (as your question may suggest), you may have vulvar muscle degeneration, chronic vulvar pain, or a vaginal infection. Since the pain is exterior as well, it may not be endometriosis and it may not have anything to do with your uterus or ovaries. You should get a complete pap smear, a pelvic ultrasound or CT scan or MRI of your pelvis. You definitely need to go to a doctor who will take you seriously and will treat you, regardless of your insurance situation.	health

If a pill gets stuck in your windpipe and disolves, is it still effective?  Firstly, I'm guessing it was "stuck" in the esophagus.

what is the difference between a nervous breakdown and a panic attack? And is there anyway a person (me) observing either behavior would be able to distinguish the two states? Nervous breakdown: What is it?\nWhat is a nervous breakdown? What causes people to have them?\n- Linda / Minnesota\nMayo Clinic psychiatrist Daniel Hall-Flavin, M.D., and colleagues answer select questions from readers.\nAnswer\n\nNervous breakdown is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses. It's not a medical term, and it doesn't indicate a specific mental illness. Generally, it describes a person who is severely and persistently emotionally distraught and unable to function at his or her normal level.\n\nOften, when people refer to having a nervous breakdown, they're describing severe depression. Signs and symptoms of severe depression include:\n\n    * Agitation or restlessness\n    * Difficulty or inability to stop crying\n    * Sleeping difficulties\n    * Indecision\n\nThe causes of mental illness usually aren't clear. But these factors may play a role:\n\n    * Stress\n    * Drug and alcohol use\n    * Co-existing medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders and certain vitamin deficiencies\n    * Genetics\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nervous-breakdown/AN00476	health

how to cure multiple personality disorder?  DID is usually caused by some sort of early trauma, usually severe, sustained trauma like abuse, living on the streets, being a refugee, etc. Memories and experiences that are too much for a young child are then "given" to a separate personality, who is strong enough to handle them. \n\nWhen a psychiatrist deals with a person with more than one personality, he usually has to start out dealing with each one separately... The goal is to get them "talking" to each other, and cooperating. Ultimately, they may re-integrate into a single personality again. Before this can happen, the original trauma usually has to be dealt with and accepted as part of the person's past.\n\nMedicines can help--depression, PTSD, and anxiety are very common comorbids to DID, and these often respond to various antidepressants, tranquilizers, and antipsychotics. However, most of the work is done by the patient in counseling; the medicines in this case are helpers but not the main treatment.	health
What do you eat on an average day? Just want to see what people diets are like?\nDo you eat 3 meals, 6 meals, just eat whenever?\nDo you watch what you eat?

What is the arthritis index? I have arthritis in my left hip.  It gets bad and then other days it gets better.  Is it weather related?

am i still a virgin? we do foreplay n normally end everything at the entrance of my vagina. He tried to enter the other  day , but coudn't succeed .. my finger can fit in my vagina now. DOES THIS MEAN THAT I AM NO LONGER A VIRGIN No, you are still a virgin, but!!!!  Be sure he does not ejaculate at the entrance to your vagina.  If there is any "lubrication" the sperm can travel up the vagina and into the uterus and cause pregnancy.  It is not common, but it can happen.  Talk to your doctor about it.  If you can handle it, I suggest you go down on him when he is ready to ejaculate, and learn to swallow.

Prescriptions? Why does rx mean prescription? "Rx" and "medical prescription" are sometimes used interchangeably. The use of Rx in prescriptions originated as an astrological symbol that was written for talismanic reasons at the start of medical prescriptions. Later it changed into ℞ (an uppercase R with its tail crossed), and was used as an abbreviation for the Latin word recipe = "take" (imperative), i.e. an instruction to the pharmacist to take the items listed in order to prepare the medicine. When printing came, it was rendered as "Rx".	health

Is it true that if you scratch off your dandruff from your head it only worsens the condition? Please explain.  Well it doesn't worsen your condition, although it may irritate your scalp (and the flakes may fall on your clothes making it appear worse).\n\nCommon dandruff is thought to be caused by a fungus, so use of a medicated shampoo (such as Neutrogena T/Gel or Nizoral) will help. Use it every day until the flakes are under control, and then once or twice a week afterward to keep it under control.	health

I am in the middle school!!! That is pretty cool....I am also in middle school (but last year of it). Don't worry about. You are beautiful the way you are don't worry about what other ppl say about/to you. I use to see ppl make fun of other kids that were overweight but the problem is they get offended by what those mean kids said about them and they don't do anything about it. You need to stand up for yourself and don't let any rude comments get in your way. I don't let any one stay in my way by saying mean things to me. I just brush it off and that is what my friends love about me. My best friend is like are you offended. I was like no. He kept saying he thinks he is fat and he is so not fat. I don't think he has a 6 pack or anything. I can tell you one thing, don't let your weight affect you like it did to my best friend. I still care about him and I am always there for him no matter the situation and I love him to death. I won't let anyone be mean to my friends and to me. You need to keep your head high and don't care what other people think. Just do your own thing. I hope everything goes well but don't feel bad about what your body looks like. Don't be ashamed, God made you the way he wanted you. No girls our age are ever happy with their body. A girl in my class is the All-American girl that is thin, tan and blonde, and blue-eyed.

what natural home remedy prevents razer bumps and ingrown hair bumps?  take a loofah and scrub the area to be shaved more coarsely than you would if it were soapy and you were just washing your body.  the scrubbing will prevent as many ingrown hairs, and will also allow the area to be smoother longer, because you're scrubbing away dead skin, and shaving at the new skin level.  it might not sound like that big of a difference, but we're talking like 2 bonus days here, depending on how fast your hair grows.	health
what is the best way to work out your inner thighz?  Do a variety of hip adduction exercises (movements that bring your leg sideways across your body). You can do this by squeezing a stability ball between your legs. You can use a multi-hip machine or hip adduction machine at the gym. You can also use a resistance band; connect one end securely around an object, such as the leg of a bed. Connect the other end around your ankle. Stand with your side to the place where the resistance band is connected and with the ankle that has the resistance closer to the wall (other foot out). Stand far enough from the wall so that there is some resistance to moving your foot. Now slowly bring your foot with the resistance band forward and across in front of your other leg (so your legs are crossed) and bring it back to regular standing position. Use the wall/bed/furniture for balance.	health

What are the side effects of 1.-ripped fuel (or any fat burning pill)and 2. Buying protein powder? I am on my second month of weight lifting and there are so many products on the market! Is the protein poweder only for men? Should I buy whey or soy protein, And When I should use it? How about fat burning caffeine loaded pills? Should I or shouldn't I use them? What about creatine? 1. Fat burning pills\nMost of them contain random herbs, caffeine, and green tea. With the exception of ephedra, common side effects would be jitters (from caffeine), alertness / insomnia, decreased appetite, and possible increased heart rate. With ephedra-based, every one of those side effects would be enhanced. I take them not for weight loss but to stay awake in the morning. Studies are mixed as to whether they actually promote weight loss. I would be cautious about exercising while taking any pill containing ephedra, especially high intensity. \n\n2. Protein\nHow "intense" are your weight workouts? Are you getting enough protein in your diet? 1.6g of protein per kg of bodyweight is enough, so unless you're not eating right or are training intensely I wouldn't worry about protein powder. Whey is a fast acting protein and is typically taken directly after a workout to get protein to muscle quickly. Cassein (sp) is a slower protein that would be taken during the day. I wouldn't buy soy protein unless it's already part of your diet. Protein powders can be used by anyone. Women should only avoid the hormones and prohormones on the market.\n\n3. Creatine\nCreatine won't hurt you, but unless you care about larger muscles / increased strength it's not important. Most people (that are not vegans) get enough creatine through diet ie. meat. Beware that some people are non-responders, which means consuming creatine has no effect as their muscles have enough of it. Responders see an increase in muscle size and in some cases muscle strength. There are hundreds of studies of creatine and results vary.\n\nJohn	health

Am I Depressed? i found out a while ago that i wasnt allowed to return back to my home overseas. Ever since then i have been agruing with my freinds all the time, and been angry or sad all the time and im just not happy, am i depressed or just unhappy? You dont need a doctor..all a doctor is going to do is give you medication and way to may people are on medication that dont need to be. I know because my doctor tried to do the same thing to me and I dont need medication. Your depression sounds situational..in fact the reason you are depressed is because you cannot go home. You really want to go home so your frusterated that your not getting what you want. All you can do is be patient and accepting of the situation you are in now and make the most of it..try and be kind to your friends, and speak to those who may have similar experiences to yours. If worse comes to worse speak to a councellor, but dont run off to the doctor and get meds unless you feel like killing yourself etc. Im sure once you come to terms with not getting what you want youll feel a bit happier again.,	health

Please help me :( Why am I so worried? Ahh, okay here I go. I know this may sound stupid to most of you, but I don't know :( Well, I was with this guy from September 8th -12th and although we did not engage in sexual intercourse, I gave him a handjob and he fingered me. Although his fingers weren't like "dripping" with his semen or anything, I'm worried MAYBE there might have been *some* of it on him. He also never went inside of me, he was just rubbing "down there"\n\nWell, I got my full period three days later (on Sept. 15) and got my period again on (although it was late like 2-3 days) October 16th. Usually, I spot around ovulation, but this month I didn't. My breasts hurt a lot and stuff, and have been hurting since when I should have ovulated (Oct. 31st) I should have my period next week some time, if everything is "normal"\n\nThe question is, is there any way that I could still be pregnant? I am SO worried, I think maybe the guilt is getting to my head. I understand I am not ready for this stuff. Any help is appreciated. I'd say yes, everything sounds normal. You sound a little young. When you're younger, you're period will be irregular, and could be on an off schedule until you're around 20 or so, then it should be the same every month. I'm still kinda young and sometimes I'll go for 2 months w/out my period and beleive me it scares the crap outa me. My doctor said not to worry about it, and that sometimes your period will only last 2-3 days whereas other times it'll be like 8-9 days! Or atleast untill your period regulates. It's a slim chance you're pregnant, very very, so I wouldn't worry about that. As far as your breasts hurting, well mine get reallly tender right before my period, so that may be happening to you, which would be good meaning you're not pregnant! Just to be on the safe side, if I were you I'd take a pregnancy test a week after you were supposed to get your period (or a week after you do). Good luck and try not to be such a nervous wreck, enjoy yourself!	health

Why does eating  asparagus make your urine smell funny?  "As you clearly know, the human digestive processes are typically able to break asparagus down into smelly by-products with an amazing quickness, often within 15 to 30 minutes after eating. When you use the lavatory, those odorific by-products are released as a rather pungent form of "asparagus urine." \n\nThe website WebMD blames this smell on the break-up of a chemical called mercaptan. That said, asparagus contains a half-dozen sulfur-based chemicals identical ones found in other such lovely smells as rotten eggs, garlic breath and skunk spray. There is some controversy in the scientific community over exactly which by-product, or combination of by-products, causes the asparagus urine smell. The first published study on the phenomenon, written in 1891 by a man going by the name of "Nencki," found that the smell was caused by a metabolite called methanethiol. So far, this conclusion seems about as sound as any.\n\nBut the story of asparagus urine is far from ending there. Some people eat asparagus, go to the restroom, and-amazingly-no smell. Further research suggested that, likely due to genetics, some people did not possess the enzymes required to create asparagus urine. Perhaps you've heard it said that a person who's pee smells after eating asparagus has high intelligence? Well, maybe there is some genetic corollary for that. (Just kidding, all you eugenicists out there!) \n\nTo complicate matters even further, however, around 1980 a scientist had the good sense to pass the urine of the non-asparagus urine population in front of the noses of the asparagus urine population, and lo-and-behold, many found they could smell that asparagus urine smell. People are now debating whether genetics controls the ability to produce asparagus urine, the ability to smell asparagus urine, or possibly both."\n\n http://www.greenworks.tv/askgreenworks/asparagus.htm	health

what is vipera? homeopathic It is actually a homeopathic remedy, not herbal.  It is made from the venom of a viper (snake).  \n\nHomeopathic remedies use the original substance, in this case the venom, and dilute it greatly via a methed called potentization.  This is said to remove any toxic properties of the substance, but to keep in tact the healing aspects of the remedy.  The urls listed previously have some decent information, but homeopathy can be very complex and it is often better to seek professional help for homeopathic treatment.\n\nThe number and letter next to the name indicate the potency, or how diluted it is.

This can be confusing and not always accurate, so it helps first to understand the difference between infection and disease. Infection simply means that a germ – virus, bacteria, or parasite – that can cause disease or sickness is present inside a person’s body. An infected person does not necessarily have any symptoms or signs that the virus or bacteria is actually hurting their body (they do not necessarily feel sick). A disease means that the infection is actually causing the infected person to feel sick, or to notice something is wrong. For this reason, the term STI – which refers to infection with any germ that can cause an STD, even if the infected person has no symptoms – is a much broader term than STD. \n\nThe term STD refers only to infections that are causing symptoms or problems. Because most of the time, people don’t know they are infected with an STI until they start showing symptoms of disease, the AIDS Resource Center uses the term STD, even though the term STI is also appropriate in many cases.\n\nDepending on the STI, a person may or may not still be able to spread the infection if no signs of disease are present. For example, a person is much more likely to spread herpes infection when blisters are present (STD) than when they are absent (STI). However, a person can spread HIV infection (STI) at any time, even if they haven’t developed symptoms of AIDS (STD).	health
How high have you overclocked your intel core 2 duo e6300? For your evga nvidia geforce 7900gt? Has anyone gotten that processor past 2.592 Ghz per core? And has anyone gotten the 7900 gt to be as good as/better than a 7900 gtx? Can you tell me how you did it (what tinkering you did/stuff you needed)? You may get a E6300 that high.. but the 7900 gt no matter how high you over clock.. it still only has half the ram a 7900gtx has and usually requires volt modding to reach stock 7900gtx speeds.	computers and internet

My Dell laptop keyboard isn't working. When I hit one letter, 2 will show up. Help!? For example, when I hit "a", it types "as" perhaps your NumLock is on. When the NumLock is on, only the keys that double as numbers will work - for example, J=1, K=2, L=3, etc. You can easily turn off the NumLock by pressing Fn and F3(or whichever key has NumLk on it) at the same time. Try and see if it works, or you can always call Dell services to speak to a Dell specialist.\n\nGood Luck!	computers and internet

Difference between threshold and watermarking. anyone know?? I'm trying to understand the fundamental difference between setting thresold and setting watermark.? What in plain english it means ? While I understand threshold is something that when crossed becomes not usable. On the other hand there is low water mark and high water mark. When I associate threshold with watermark I don't see much difference. Any answers would be greatly helpful The article below details watermarking and includes reference to threshold. Threshold is the security measure (ie. how secure it is)of the watermark as far as I can make out. A threshold of zero would form a fragile watermark more susceptible to attack.	computers and internet
what does "Allow subframes to navigate across different domains" mean?  This is a security setting in Internet Explorer.  (Tools, then Internet Options, then Security, then Custom Level...)\n\nThis setting gives you the option to allow IE to display subframes that originated from different domains. A subframe is a portion of a Web page that could function as a standalone page but has instead been incorporated into a larger page that may contain other subframes.\n\nYou can enable or disable this option, or you may prompt the user. Having subframes that come from different domains, however, is generally harmless and so is permitted by default.	computers and internet

does anyone know how to fix the brightness on a acer laptop? hey i just got this new acer laptop, and i lowered the brightness to check it out, but now it doesnt wannna go up, no matter how many times i have tried. does anyoneknow how to make it stay bright? it will help me a lot. thanks in advanced If it's new or under some kind of warranty, I would try calling tech support if there still is one for Acer. I have seen this once or twice with IBM laptops in the somewhat distant past and the problem is likely in the switch that raises and lowers the brightness. We sent them off for repair. If this is a known issue with Acer, then they may likely repair it free even if it's out of warranty though you would have to pay shippng it there (and get insurance) to the repair center. Hopefully, it isn't he LCD that has gone bad - that can be expensive on a laptop. Also, you might look closely at the keyboard for an Fn (purple lettering maybe) key which will correspond to other purple writing above some of the function keys. There will be one that has some type of sun or light on it that will adjust brightness or dimness, you might tinker with these holding down the Fn key as you repeatedly press the corresponding key. This may be how you dimmed it though - just a thought. Good Luck!	computers and internet

Can I telnet into a UNIX machine that is in the single user mode (init1)?  The other answerers are correct that the networking\nstack isn't functional in single user mode; however,\nthere is something similar that you might consider.\n\nIn many server rooms, it's common to install a terminal\nconcentrator that connects to the serial ports of\nmultiple machines.  In that situation, you "telnet"\nto the terminal concentrator and open the connection\nto the serial port of the machine in question.  If\nthe console has been redirected to the serial port,\nthen you're in business.\n\nA similar solution which avoids the need for a terminal\nconcentrator is to connect the serial port of a machine\nto the serial port of a second machine via a \ncross-over RS232 cable.  Then you can "tip" from one\nmachine to the other.\n\nFinally, on newer machines (well, typically "servers"),\nit's becoming common for there to be a "service processor"\nto provide "LOM" (lights out management).  If this\nis available, you telnet to the service processor (which\nhas a distinct IP address from the rest of the system)\nand it will have the capability to take over the\nconsole.\n\nNot sure if this answers your question, but it seemed\nlike it might be related to the problem you might be\ntrying to solve.	computers and internet

The first thing you have to do is go to a website that has everything you could possibly think of to put on your page: background, cursor, contact box, online now image, glitter graphics, music, etc.  www.toxxic.net, www.mynicespace.com, and www.createblog.com (which is my favorite because almost everything is all ready set up for you) are just a few. Now on www.mynicespace.com, to the left are all the links you need to customize your page. When you go to backgrounds for example, you can scroll down to pick one you like and be sure to look at all the pages.  After you've chosen one, under it you will find an html code to that background and you simply highlight it and copy it. Then you have to go to your myspace account and click home, then click on edit profile, then on the about me section paste the html code, click on preview section and you should see the different background you added, finally click on save. It is basically the same routine for everything else. I hope this helps you have a pretty homepage.

How come Norton and AVG don't work together?  They others are right.  You can not run two anti-virus programs at the same time.  They will conflict with each other, each trying to control any files you open so they can scan them, and each thinking the other is some type of virus trying to prevent it from working.\n\nIf you feel the need to have a second virus scanner on your PC, use one of the online scanners (like Mircotrend) which does not run in the background, but only when you go online and specifically run it. About once a week check the PC with it to be sure there is nothing the Norton or the AVG, whichever you choose, is missing.	computers and internet

I am having some problems with computer configuration after installing a wireless mouse and keyboard set!? It works fine after i install it but when i have to re-start the computer for any reason i am taken to a prompt screen telling me that my computer configuration has been changed and it gives me several options. one is to go into Windows in safe mode but lose my previous configuration, or it tells me to try to resart Windows normally or to try to go to the last correct configuration If i go to safe mode i lose my configuration and if i try to restart Windows or find the last correct configuration i am taken back to the prompt window that i started off with.\nI followed the instructions on the book and on the driver correctly and it keeps doing this. At every re-start i have to put the original keyboard and mouse back on and re-install the driver and the wireless units and then remove the old units and then wireless works fine until the next start-up. Can anyone help me? G'day,\n\nA few things come in minds.\n1. Try to download the latest driver/software for your wireless set from the manufacturer's website.  Make sure you uninstall the old driver/software before installing the new one.\nIf the previous suggestion does not work there are 2 possibilities as follows:\n2a. You may have a corrupted Operating System (I assume you are using Windows XP).  You may need to reformat your HDD and reinstall your operating system from scratch.  Please refer to some answers in Yahoo Answers about reformatting HDD and make sure you back up your data files before doing so.  This is gonna be a major work if you want to take this way\n2b. Pls dun get offended, but you might buy a cheap brand wireless set. I helped a few of my clients installing cheap/unknown wireless set that they bought themselves and it gives me alot of problems.  Once I suggest them to exchange with well-known brands wireless set (eg. Microsoft or Logitech), the hardware works perfectly without any problems.  So you may want to try this option first before reformatting HDD.\n\nHope this helps.  Good Luck :)	computers and internet

Go to Start menu and hit search and then do a search on the filename. If you remember the filename then it should pop up. Where do your downloads usually end up in? You should go back to the download page and try to download it and it will show you where it has downloaded to. yOu just need to go back to that folder and track it. Its possible you didnt save it on your hard drive.

What is the actual work of a Oracle DBA and SUN Administrator?  An Oracle Database Administrator holds a key role in keeping the system up and running and hence, whatever business it supports up and running. It is a very technical role. They are typically the ones who move objects (tables, views, triggers, functions...) from one environment to the next (Development-->test-->production). They work closely with developers who write software to read/write/update/delete data to and from the database.  They monitor database size allocations and make adjustments for growth. they determine proper data elements that should be used for indexes so that searches against the database run quickly for customers. There is much more. It is a demanding job and they are often the first ones who are required to 'get the system back up and running' when the database goes nutty. (like when someone accidently submits a wacked out query doing a full table scan.\na SUN administrator is different than a DBA because they do not focus on the database but they keep the server hardware running that the database runs on. They monitor server performance and deploy other custom written unix or java applications that programmers have developed. they too get involved with 'getting the system back up' when something goes haywire. It is also a very technical role and requires great knowledge of the unix commands and operating system.	computers and internet
Help!! Problems with Windows Movie Maker? I completed a video in Windows Movie Maker but can't get it copied to CD, Web Host or email.

I want to make copies of the video to pass out to family at my daughters graduation.  Thank you in advance. It sounds like maybe you just clicked "Save Project" instead of "Save Movie File."  You need to end up with a file that ends in ".wmv" for it to be recognized and played on other computers.  The Save Movie process should take a long time and create a pretty big .wmv file.

What are LP's and EP's? I know that bands release albums that are either LP or EP, and I fairly certain that LP's are full length albums, but what does it stand for and what do they mean? Terms from the days of vinyl records. As I worked in a record store selling Vinyl for 2 years during the 80s, I got to work intimately with them... so...\n\nLP = Long Play (full length album) - 33 1/3 speed\nEP = Extended Play (as in extended from a single) - 33 1/3 speed\nSingle = one song a side - 45 speed\n\nLP records could be a maximum of about 40 minutes with microgrooving, less without.\nEP records were from 3-20 minutes (as I recall).\n\nAn LP could hold 5-6 songs per side.\nAn EP could hold 1-3 (cramped at 3) per side.\nA single could hold one song per side.\n\nHow they were used.  Bands generally used LPs for full length album releases.  EPs were used commonly to release a short album release (a few songs or extended remix singles).  The EP format was also typically used on 12" singles.  12" singles also ran 33 1/3 speed.  45's (singles) were obviously used to release two songs from an album (not usually remixes).\n\nSizes for vinyl include 12", 10" and 7" diameter.  EPs could be 10" or 12".  LPs were only 12".  45's were only 7".  \n\nAnd finally, there were picture disks.  These were a special process to overlay the vinyl grooves on top of a picture.  They were generally heavier and the vinyl didn't hold up as long.  Picture disks were, as I recall, always 12" in size.	entertainment and Music

Clean My House? A woman was sitting at a bar enjoying an after-work cocktail with her girlfriends when an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely sexy, young man entered. He was so striking that the woman could not take her eyes away from him. \nThe young man noticed her overly attentive stare and walked directly toward them. Before she could offer her apologies for being so rude as to stare, the young man whispered to her, "I'll do anything, absolutely anything, that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $100, on one condition." \nFlabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. \nThe young man replied, "You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words." \nThe woman considered his proposition for a moment, withdrew from her purse, and slowly counted out five $20 bills, which she gladly pressed into the young man's hand. \nShe looked deeply into his eyes and slowly and meaningfully said, "Clean my house." another top quality joke from one of yahoos best tellers	entertainment and Music

Who is Stravinsky?  Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Russian: И́горь Фёдорович Страви́нский Igor' Fëdorovič Stravinskij) (June 17, 1882 – April 6, 1971) was a Russian-born composer of modern classical music. He composed in the primitivist, neo-classical and serialist styles, but he is best known for three works from his earlier, Russian period: Le sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring), Petrushka and L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). For some, these daring and innovative ballets practically reinvented the genre. Stravinsky also wrote in a broad spectrum of ensemble combinations and classical forms. His oeuvre included everything from symphonies to piano miniatures.\n\nStravinsky also achieved fame as a pianist and conductor, often at the premieres of his own works. He was also a writer. With the help of Alexis Roland-Manuel, Stravinsky composed a theoretical work entitled Poetics of Music. In it, he famously claimed that music was incapable of "expressing anything but itself". Robert Craft transcribed several interviews with the composer, which were published as Conversations with Stravinsky.\n\nA quintessentially cosmopolitan Russian, Stravinsky was one of the most influential composers and artists of 20th century music, both in the West and in his native land. He was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people of the century.\n\nStravinsky was born in Oranienbaum (now Lomonosov), near St. Petersburg, Russia. Brought up in St. Petersburg and dominated by his father and elder brother, Stravinsky's early childhood was a mix of experience that hinted little at the cosmopolitan artist he was to become. Although his father Fyodor Stravinsky was a bass singer at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Stravinsky originally studied to be a lawyer. He switched to composition later. In 1902, at the age of 20, Stravinsky became the pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, probably the leading Russian composer of the time.\n\nStravinsky left Russia for the first time in 1910, going to Paris to attend the premiere of his ballet L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). During his stay in the city, he composed two further works for the Ballets Russes—Petrushka (1911) and Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring) (1913). The ballets trace his stylistic development: from the L'oiseau de feu, whose style draws largely on Rimsky-Korsakov, to Petrushka's emphasis on bitonality, and finally to the savage polyphonic dissonance of Le Sacre du printemps. As Stravinsky noted about the premieres, his intention was "[to send] them all to hell". (He succeeded: the 1913 première of Le sacre du printemps was probably the most famous riot in music history).\n\nStravinsky displayed an inexhaustible desire to learn and explore art, literature, and life. This desire manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations. Not only was he the principal composer for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russes, but he also collaborated with Pablo Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), Jean Cocteau (Oedipus Rex, 1927) and George Balanchine (Apollon Musagete, 1928).\n\nRelatively short of stature and not conventionally handsome, Stravinsky was nevertheless photogenic, as many pictures show. He was still young when, on 23 January 1906, he married his cousin Katerina Nossenko whom he had known since early childhood. Their marriage endured for 33 years, but the true love of his life, and later his partner until his death, was his second wife Vera de Bosset (1888-1982). Although a notorious philanderer (even rumoured to have affairs with high-class partners such as Coco Chanel), Stravinsky was also a family man who devoted considerable amounts of his time and expenditure to his sons and daughters. One of his sons, Soulima Stravinsky, was also a composer, but is little known compared to his father.\n\nWhen Stravinsky met Vera in the early 1920s, she was married to the painter and stage designer Serge Sudeikin, but they soon began	entertainment and Music

Why do most cars have speedometers that go up to at least 150 when you legally can't go that fast on any road?  First, the Speedometer predates the Speed Limit.\n\nSecond, they tried reducing the numbers on the Speedometer and drivers didn't like it. In fact, they paid extra to buy racing gauges.\n\nAnd Third, speedometers are usually spring activated. The more the go to the right the more the spring is strained. Over time the sping gets spung and the needle begins to float and stick and give you inacurate readouts. So. if you keep the needle on the left hand side of the dial it should keep functioning longer and designing the dial to do so makes perfect sense.	entertainment and Music

First of all get a copy of the return, you can do this by filing a form with the IRS? Next write them a letter and camly explain the situation. They are human and make mistakes also find out if they entered a number wrong. I have seen some instances where an employer reported wages on the wrong social and the irs went after the person with this social...did not take long to straighten this out. Patience and time, you will be fine and I am sure if you friend obeys all the tax laws on the initial return there is no way that he/she should owe all of that money unless he has a major profit, capital gains, or stocks sold things of this manor! Let me know how it goes?	business

Where can I buy insent expresso powder?  INSTANT ESPRESSO POWDER: Coffee compliments the flavor of chocolate. Instant espresso powder can be found in Italian delicatessens and many supermarkets.  The most common brand is Medaglia d'Oro. It's a little hard to find, but I found a reliable mail order source. However, brands from major American companies are coming onto the market in reaction to the newfound love for "real" coffee.  If you wish, you can substitute regular instant coffee, but it isn't nearly as intensely flavored.	business

I have 3  broken leases and two aren't even what you would consider a broken lease are there any apts in tx? my lease was up and we moved out and two days before the end of the month I went into labor early and was hospitalized.We did the 30 day letter and the office manager was really understanding and said that it was ok because we had a tv left in the apt. A year later i find that the apt is on my credit report as a broken lease and they want 1,000.00 from me. The last one was when my home was shot up because of a drug deal gone bad with the neighbors and their connection My family was caught in the crossfire and we left the next day after letting the people in the leasing office know that we felt our lives were in danger. How can I fight these because they are messing up my credit. Are there any apartments who will rent to someone with several broken leases? In houston texas, that are not dumps? You have three options.\n1) Rent from an individual who will not run a credit/background check.  Of course if they own more than one unit (i.e. apartments instead of a house) you risk having neighbors who have done gods-only-know-what because 99% of the time the criminal background check is done with the credit check.\n2) Go to public housing, but I thought you said no dumps....\n3) Admit up front what the issues are and keep looking until you find a property manager who is willing to work with you.  You may be required to put down an additional deposit, but it won't be as bad as other options.  If you chose to do this option, MAKE SURE you talk to the property manager, not an assistant or a leasing agent as they are not authorized (generally speaking) to make those kinds of decisions.\n\nMy family was in a similar situation a few months ago but thankfully we found a community that had just emptied due to renovations and was trying to lease up again fast.  The manager was willing to work with us because she needed the occupancy.	business

Boss has me doing crappy personal things? I work for a very successful attorney. He is one of the most arrogant people I've ever met in my life - but he pays me GREAT.  I mostly work at home doing billing, but when my husband schedule allows, I go into the office for a few hours a week. He is married and his wife doesn't work and they have an 8 year old.\n\nI spend my days calling to find massage places that offer a shower afterwards (he doesn't like feeling oily), finding places that his daughter can have private tennis lessons on specific days and times, calling his house maid and complaining that she didn't clean the master bath good enough. This afternoon I got an email from him asking me to get Hanukah wrapping paper.\n\nI HATE doing these things for myself, never mind for someone else. Does anyone else do crap like this? Or maybe I'm just not used to doing this kind of work for someone else? Or maybe because he is just arrogant? Should I just suck it up and think about my upcoming paycheck when I get annoyed? It may not be the job your applied for, but the money is. Nothing your write is illegal or immoral - presuming he and not the company is paying your salary. If you report him to the company, you get sacked and he will get his fanny tapped.\nYou do the same thing - do you think the grocery stocker likes turning the cereal back around after you studied the back? How about the retail clerk who has to refold the shirt you held up to hubby? \nIn our own way, each of us inconveniences others. When it becomes intolerable, we need to move on. I know, I used to have to pick up bulletins in the pews after preaching at 3 services.	business

What is the beta of a small 3MM Software and services company? Beta is the mesure of volitility and used in finantial calculations. If this company is public and its stock is traded on a stock exchange, you can find its beta (vs. S&P500) on Yahoo! finance or other financial web sites.\n\nIf you are interested in its beta compared to some other indices, you will need to compare the stock's price movement over a long period of time to the specific index concerned.  Most finance/investment text book will teach that calculation.  \n\nIf this stock is not public, I don't think you can find a beta as it has no price history for the analysis.  Or you can pick another software company of similar size that is public and use its beta as a comparable.\n\nHope this helps.  Good luck.	business

what is APR as it relates to home loans?  IT's the true cost of obtaining the loan in terms of interest rate.\nThe APR will typically be the same or higher than the note rate.  The note rate is the actual rate/payment you pay against the loan.  \nThe fees involved directly raise the rate by virtue of being added to (sometimes subtracted from in the case of a "no fees" loan)the loan balance, after which the APR is calculated.\n\nIn most cases , the lower the APR (compared to the note rate), the better.  But not always.  This is a complex issue, and depends on many factors, such as how long you plan to keep the property, etc..\n\nA good loan agent can help you make the choice.	business

Can the wall street stock market crash ?  The only way the stock market would crash again is if everyone borrows money from banks to invest in stocks and never pay the money back. For example buyer A borrows money from the bank and buys stock. buyer A then sells his stock, that he has earned profit off of, to buyer B. buyer B has borrowed money from the bank to purchase from buyer A. buyer b then takes that stock and sells back to buyer A. Buyer A then has borrowed money from the bank to afford the price of the stock buyer B has asked for. this goes on and on, borrowing money from the banks and niether of the buyers has payed the banks back which makes the banks go into default and this results in a stock market crash. so as long as people do not borrow too much money and pay back their loans, we should not have to worry about a depression. Although someone once said....."HISTORY DOES REPEAT ITSELF"	business

They yell atleast 5 times a day over stupid things!  Like taking trash out or brushing teeth!  My hubby and i have been together 15 years.  son is almost 16.  step dad but dad at heart.  what can i do?????By bed time Im NEVER in the mood cuz of all the tention all thru the day.  I love them BOTH soooo much and im so lost at what to do.  Have talked to hubby millions of times yet we end up only arguing.  My son is a really good kid and hubby is so wonderful and gentle with me so why not with our son????  I feel so alone and frustrated! No question about it: defend your kid, tell your husband he must be mature and friendly; it's called child abuse. Let the kid be, they're always like that, is in their nature to be sloppy and lazzy, and it's wonderful he has good grades. Your husband is inmature, he's gonna ruin your son.

Where is Velka Lhota, Dacice, Czechoslovakia? My Great Great Grandmother was born in Velka Lhota, Dacice, Czechoslovakia, 10 March 1842.

If not, is there a Czechoslovakian map for 1842 that still exists, that shows where Velka Lhota, Dacice, Czechoslovakia existed?

is it wrong to email an ex boyfriend after a few years w/o knowing if he's got a girlfriend? this guy is really cute, but since i like someone else...i just wanna talk to my ex again and become friends like before and i don't know if he has a gf or not and if she would hate him talking to an ex gf....but since he was my aunt's brother in law, and my aunt and his brother divorced, do ya think that he'd wanna talk to me after that situation? I doubt it but you could be the first to offer him an olive branch.  Just because your relatives can't seem to get along doesn't mean the both of you can't.  However, be prepared for the eventuality that he may not want to resume ties with you.  There is a reason why the past is past. But you can try. Usually though, they don't like hearing about your present love interests.  If you haven't been in touch in a couple of years, that means he's moved on and so should you.  Why don't you just get perspective on your love life now with your other girl-friends instead of your ex?	business

You should be able to enter your name and it will search for any money owed to you that has gone unclaimed. It will give you details on how to claim the cash.\nI went on the CA Treasury site and found over $100 bucks for my sister.

Do you think God exists?? or are we just assuming there is God somewhere in the universe watching us??!!? Please give ur opinions with relevant reasons to support urselves.. "ur experiences with God" are also welcome.. Thanks!!  =) Of course there is some question of, "Why are we here?" and the "Meaning of life?" I believe strongly in God. I believe he sent his son down to earth to die for my sins, your sins, and everyone sins. Jesus, bridges the gap between God and us that was separated when Adam and Eve first turn their backs on him in the Garden of Eden. Sacrificing something pure, like a lamb, then was the gap filled. But then Jesus came, a pure being, God’s only son, he was like the lamb, pure and without sin, sacrificed for our sins to fill the gap between God and us. Believing in Jesus and accepting him into our lives fill that gap to God and we have access to eternal life. \n\nGod is so significant in my life. My mother was taken from me at 12 years old by ovarian cancer. I didn’t think God cared. Later I experienced trials of my faith. I grew to learn that there is a purpose to everything and that everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for the best. \n\nOne certain case, I believe, would be that an angel of the Lord confronted me. I had had some troubles at home and I stormed off to my school. I sat there on the swing sets looking down at the ground. I noticed the school was completely empty. I cannot recall any sound of the highway that could be heard very clearly near by. Then I noticed a young woman with blonde hair. She was pushing a baby in a stroller. She had been walking around the track and soon came to the playground, which I had been the whole time. She slowly approached and asked if I was all right. Of course, I said yes, trying to shrug her off. She asked me if I knew about Jesus. I thought that she saw it was a perfect opportunity to preach about Jesus and God. I already knew all that stuff, I told her I knew him and told her my father is involved with the church. She smiled and said that that was nice. She then said something I will never forget. She said with a smile on her face, “Alright, just know that He loves you and knows that you are upset.” I smiled, thinking that she was being nice. She started walking away and she said, “Nice talking to you, Michael.” She walked away towards the surrounding school buildings. I then realized, I never mentioned my name. I didn’t even know her. In a small community, I had never seen her before. I then got on my bike and rode to the building to talk again with her. She had gone past the building very shortly before I arrived there on my bike. I turned the corner and she wasn’t there. It was physically impossible to get out of the school that fast, especially with a baby. I was then filled with a great sense of power and strength. It was a great feeling. I rode my bike home faster than ever. I was crying all the way home.\n\nI have told this story to only a few people. I never expected people to believe me; I could care less if they didn’t. I believe what happened. I was there. That helped incidence helped me so much. I felt much better after that. Today, I still have problems. I am human. But I can always turn to Jesus for help. I believe in him by Faith, and Faith alone. That is all you need to attain salvation! Faith.\n\nI hope you understand to that God loves you. \n             God Bless You!\n                  Michael DeCourcy	business

what is general ledger?  The general ledger, sometimes known as the nominal ledger, is the main accounting record of a business which uses double-entry bookkeeping. It will usually include accounts for such items as fixed assets, current assets and liabilities, profit and loss or income and expenditure items, and funds or reserves.\n\nThe general ledger is a summary of all of the transactions that occur in the company. It is taken directly from the general journal, where each transaction is recorded.\n\nThe balance sheet and the profit/loss statement are both derived from the general ledger. Because it is organized by accounts, the general ledger allows you to observe the impact of all the transactions affecting each account at any given time. The general ledger is where posting occurs, which is the process of recording credits and debits in the general ledger. The actual balances are called the trial balance.\n\nThe general ledger should include the date, description and balance entries for each account. It is usually divided into at least five main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and sometimes additionally equity (liabilities held by the owners of the company). The main categories of the general ledger may be subdivided into subledgers to include details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.\n\nBecause each transaction debits one account and credits another to an equal extent an accounting system will ensure that the general ledger will always be in balance unless, for example, an account (some times called a T-account) is deleted or mis-specified in the general journal.	business
If you could choose only one stock what would it be?  Proctor and Gamble, not because you will make a killing tomorrow nor because Warren Buffett just bought some of it.

We are talking about soap, toothpaste, shampoo, throw away razors, laundry detergent, dish detergent, toilet paper, coffee, diapers, hair care...well you get the picture.  People may cut a lot of expenses when times are tough, but these are the basics that get cut the least.	business
what will my credit score look like right after a bankruptcy discharge chpt 7?  Go out to into the country and find a pig farm.  Walk out to the pen and look at the ground.  See that big pile?  Smell the bad air?\n\nThat is your credit score.  And it will be with you for 10 years.\n\nDon't dispare....even with a bankruptcy you can still find people to loan you money and help rebuild your life.  True, the interest rate will suck, but at least your debts are managable now, and you can move on.\n\nDon't be ashamed that you went bankrupt.  You are in very good company.  Last year tens of thousands of people filed for bankruptcy due to the new laws that took effect last October.  \n\nJust remember, in the future watch where you are walking so you don't step in another pile of bankruptcy or debt.	business

Plant Selling License? I know that in order to start a business you need a business license and if you plan to sell food you need a food selling license. Do you need a plant selling license if you plan on selling plants? Plants as in house plants, not bouquets. I reside in California. I have lived and worked in the garden center field in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island and in all four states you needed a license from the state.  It usually comes from the Department of Agriculture.  We brought plant material in from California and I'm pretty sure we had to have the nurseries license number or a copy on file for our records.  I am sure you need a license to sell plant goods in California, check with your Dept. of Agriculture.	business

what are EBAY challenges right now? what strategy should the management employ to overcome those challenges?  eBay faces a lot of challenges right now. Once it was the darling of internet stocks, but not anymore.\n\n1. Its main auction model is slowing as ebay faces maturity = to achieve growth, it will have to do so not with its auction site but its acquisitions such as Paypal and eBay. Forbes Magazine has an interesting article on this   http://www.forbes.com/markets/equities/2006/05/08/ebay-skype-0508markets04.html\n\n2. Stiffer competition particularly abroad = early this year, eBay had to scrap seller transaction fees in China due to significant competition from Alibaba.com. Even in Korea, Yahoo is aggressively challenging eBay  http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=17139&hed=Yahoo+Challenges+eBay+in+Korea\n\n3. Sellers are looking for other (cheaper) channels to sell their products = ebay's fees are continuously rising, and sellers are looking for ways to sell their items. They are flocking to ebay's competitors or creating their own ecommerce site\n\n4. Competition from Google = Google has developed GBuy or Google Checkout, which is its main challenge to Paypal http://www.forbes.com/markets/2006/06/09/google-0609markets09.html	business
Why are chinese people always talking that bull crap when you walk into the hairstore or nail shop?NEGATIVITY?  I'm not Chinese, but I speak Chinese fluently.  My looks make it so Chinese people never expect this.  As one who can understand what they are saying, let me be the first to tell you, you are not missing out on anything.  They're saying stuff like "did you include that customer's pedicure on her ticket when you rang her up?" or "Did you see that girl on American Idol last night?"\n\nYou can't understand what they're saying, so you assume they're talking about YOU and that they are saying NEGATIVE things.  That says more about YOU "Drama Queen" then it does about them.\n\nIt's not bull crap, it's their language.  If you were working in a foreign country, you'd try to get a job with people from your country, in a field where not being able to speak the foreign country's language wasn't such a handicap.  That's what they're doing.  And would you be speaking English with your co-workers, while working in this foreign country? Of course.\n\nI'll bet your ancestors did the same thing when they first got to the US.  The only reason you don't do it is because you aren't first generation from the old country.	business

Is there an organization or company? in the U.S. that do/does not try to take money from people having a rough time?? I mean, like when you have to get help with your electric bill and FPL (electric co) keeps adding deposits to your account of almost $200.00?  I mean, people can't get a break anymore.  It's all companies - their late charges.  I consider almost $200.00 a fairly large "late charge" and they get away with it because they call it "additional deposit" even though they have your first deposit.  I'd like to hear if there are any positive organizations out there that make big bucks (like FPL) who are actually NICE to people who are struggling. I'd like to  know in my heart that they aren't all like that. Most people are 2 checks away from losing their home. We got 5 checks away because of a job loss and no one to borrow money from. We're okay now but I'd feel so much better knowing someone out there was NICE. Most utility companies have programs to help people. It's a matter of knowing how to enroll in that, I guess. Also drug companies have similar programs to give out drugs for free. I know many doctors give out brand sample drugs to their patients who need them. The programs to assist people are there, but, they don't come to you, you have to go look for them because these companies exist to make profit and not to help people.	business

I had an ins claim due to water damage to a storage bldg. Co is cancelling my ins on Dec 5. What can I do?  I think what you are saying is that because of the water claim the company is cancelling your insurance at the renewal on December 5th.    Call your agent and ask why it is being cancelled.  Was there other claims besides this claim?  When they inspected the building was it in good shape?  If the building is in bad shape the company may cancel due to the maintenance of the building.  There are numerous reasons why it could be cancelled.  Call your agent and find out why.\n\nThe company does have the right to cancel a policy at renewal so long as they comply with state laws and send a cancellation notice.	business

How was buying a home for you?  How was acquiring a mortgage?  I am going to be purchasing one soon...? I'm buying a small starter house with my sister.\nMy credit is in the mid 700s and my sister has only had one credit card in her name (paying off monthly).\nWe have about $15k in savings.\nI work part time, she works full time but only $7-8 an hour.\nI'm fairly certain the payment will be less than the $555 rent I am paying now by myself, plus we will be gaining equity.\n\nHow was your experience purchasing a home?\nI have a credit union, will rates be cheaper there?\nWhat and how much fees will be involved?  Inspector?  I will not have a buying broker, but they are selling thru a realtor.  Do I need a lawyer?\n\nPlease let me know the good and bad things you have encountered while buying your home.  Thanks! The first home is the most challenging...so many questions.  But so much fun!\n\nIf the seller is using a broker, you should as well.  The seller is paying a set percentage to the agent (usually 5%-7%) of the sales price which gets split between the agents.  Your agent should be with a different agency to prevent conflicts of interest (there are never supposed to be conflicts, based on Realtor ethics codes enforced by the National Association of Realtors, but it's always better to be safe).  Your agent won't cost you a dime, and you'll have the benefit of representation.\n\nAn attorney (or title company, depending on your state) conducts the closing in all non-cash closings.  Don't get too anxious about specific attorneys, as long as they are reputable, they should be fine.  You could always pick a seperate one from the seller, but it isn't always necessary.\n\nYour fees will depend greatly on your shopping ability.  I suggest printing a copy of your credit report and carry it with you until you find a bank/mortgage company/credit union you are satisfied with.\nAsk questions like what is the APR you are offering.  The APR takes into account all points (a point is equal to 1% of the loan), fees, junk fees, origination fees, and the interest rate.  **Comparing APRs will allow you to compare apples to apples**  Comparing interest rates alone forces you to compare apples to oranges, bannanas, and even watermelons!\n\n**Check with your newly aquired realty agent, or the lenders that you are shopping with, on the availability of 1st time homebuyer incentives....there are litterally hundreds available that will reduce your down payment, APRs, points required, etc.***\n\nThis should be a lot of fun!  Remember that it is OK to get emotional regarding the house, but wait until you have closed and have the keys in your hand.  Keep emotion out of the shopping and financing portion of the process.\n\nHave a great time in your new home!  Best of luck.	business
Should I enroll in 401k plan? I am from another country and have a great job in USA. My company has an excellent 401 k plan.

How would it all work? Yes, you should. As long as the company is contributing as well. If The company isn't, it might be better for you to invest in something else. You would be able to cash in your 401k in 10 years, there will be a fee, but it still would be worth it.	business
Online Opinion and surveys - Can Money be made on these things? If anyone has personal experience; overall Good or Bad, domains you can recommend, how much money did you earn compared with time and effort.\n\nThanks Much soo many pros and cons to this.  First, some surveys pay high, but what is high?  do you consider $15 dollars a high pay for doing nothing but sitting on your butt?  maybe....so, what do you have to do for 15 dollars?  maybe answer a survey that takes like 3 hours.....see how they get you?  or sometimes you have to qualify for the survey...so they ask you  qualifying questions first...and if you qualify, they give you the survey..if not then forget it.....and it costed you time to look and then you dont get it alot of times...reason is because they need a certain "strain" of people to get an exact opinion to complete their requirement sensitive surveys....and sometimes they dont pay you right away...and other times you need to get at least 20 dollars before they issue you a check..and if you get to the 20...then the money sits there until you get enough...all the while...the money they owe you is sitting in the bank...collecting interest to the point where it will cost them nothing to get you to do some of their surveys....i have tried it...i have to be honest and say that i didnt try it all..but i tried a couple of them and i know enough that the pay per hour is extremely low compared to just regular jobs....i would rather spend 5 dollars for gas to go to work for 10 buxx an hour for 2 hours.....at least i know i make 15 buxx....other there..some people make out if they have alot of time on hand...but for the most part...nobody has that kind of time..and even if they make out..i dont think its anywhere close to a job that supports you on ramen noodles....	business

The last election?? Please explain to a dumb Canadian the difference between the Congress and Setate, and why mid-term? As I understand it now the Democrats can change many things Bush has done in the past and control what he plans for the future. Aw, you can't be that dumb...you're smart enough to live in Canada, eh? \n\nCongress refers to the full legislative branch of government, we have a bicameral Congress split into the Senate and the House of Representatives, ("House" for short.) There are two senators from every state for a total of 100 senators, giving each state equal representation in senate, while the 435 Representatives, or congressmen, are divided into districts according to a state's population. (So Alaska has only one representative, while California has 53.) Mid-term elections are the elections that take place right smack in the middle of a presidential term. We vote for ALL of our congressmen, who serve only 2 year terms, and a third of our Senators, who serve 6 year terms. We also voted for various governors (terms vary by state,) city council members, state laws, and town ordinances. \n\nThe Democrats do indeed now have the power to change things. Bush still has the ability to veto, but with the Democratic majority share of both the House AND the Senate, hes going to have to go along to get along. The biggest change that will happen now is that Congress (meaning both houses,) will cease to "rubber stamp" everything Bush proposes. Thats been the case for the past few years, with not so much as a meek protest emerging from the Capital building when Bush cuts taxes for the rich or sends more of our boys and girls to die. So...no more of that. Its a new era, and I can't tell you how happy I, and everyone that I know, truly is to see it ushered in.	politics and government

Does the other person have the legal right to force me to get rid of the photo?  This is assuming the photo is clean (non-nude), of course. Technically, is not legal to take a person's picture if the picture identifies the person. ie: you can tell it is them in the picture. If the face is blurred or it is the backside of a person it is OK and legal.\n\nNow, if that person grants you the rights to their immage it is OK.

Neoconservatism is the name for a new branch of conservative politics that supports extensive U.S. involvement in foreign affairs (as opposed to traditional conservatives such as Pat Buchanan who oppose foreign entanglements), its origins are largely based in the think tank Project for a New American Century (PNAC), whose founding members include Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush, Steve Forbes, Dan Quayle and Donald Rumsfeld. \n\nMost significantly, they have argued that America needs to control the flow of oil in the Middle East in order to check the growth of China as an economic power, and have advocated for the removal from power of Saddam Hussein since the mid-90s.	politics and government

I don't get offended.  If you want to fly the flag of another country, this is the land of the free, go for it.  I probably will get a bunch of thumbs down for this opinion, but if you think about it, flying a flag of another country is not showing disrespect for America.  It is showing pride in where they came from, but not disrespect of America.  I was born and bred here in the US.  I can trace back my lines to my american Indian heritage, and also to my English heritage.  However, my husband is from Honduras.  I, not him, but me, bought a Honduras flag, and it is hanging in our children's room.  I also bought one of those flags that go onto the windshield of our car - and it was a Honduras flag.  But that doesn't mean that I am showing any disrespect for America.	politics and government

Be practical please, don't go on about "Deport them" cos the president said "It ain't gonna work!". And please do NOT go on about " secure the border" iether cos we all know it should be done!\n So.. the Smart Americans out there, give a solution. We can't deport them nor Amnesty, so what do we do with them? stop being racist and live and let live as we did pre 911.\nacting with inhumanity against others out of fear of terrorism , is a form a complicit terrorism against others.\nread a sociology book or go online and check out the caste and outcaste systems of Japan and India, the outcaste society here being immigrants and look at the human rights watch sites and government achived documents there, the facts speak for themselves being intolerant and callous is being part of the problem, people need to get real and start living by the bullshit they claim they live by christianity and humanity and treat these mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers as the human beings who desrve just as much respect as any other human ,they are hard working, exploited and taking care of their families and often homeless scapegoats and the biggest reciever of welfare and government handouts is white women not immigrants, the biggest group who commits violent crimes against society is white men ,contrary to the pictures you seeon fox news just take any introductory sociology class, .we can help by being advocates for all human rights and treating the stranger and the travelor well as Jesus asked in the bible for those of you who love to quote it as you commit your acts of hatyred against others in selfrighteous,patriotic, dogmatic hypocrisy	politics and government

was joseph stalin a good leader in politicial, economic, and militaraly??  No, Stalin was a paltry excuse for a leader. Politically he failed to unify the minorities of the Soviet Union, instead focusing on persecution and forced Russianization. His foreign policy was horrible, his plans with Finland disasterous, and his look towards Western Europe miserable. Economically, he failed to take advantage of Russia's ever-growing wheat feilds, instead creating a ration system, which immediately led to starvation. He took total advantage of the Soviet satillite states after WWII without realizing their needs and desire for freedom. Militarily, he failed by using choking tactics (cramming as many troops to meet the enemy in hopes of winning through sheer numbers) without any real manuvering. His part in the invasion of Poland was considerably easy, as Poland was still using horses instead of tanks and cars. Although he ballooned the military in the pre- and post-war years, he was weary of insurrection and kept the army underfed, never realizing that a shabby army will eventually rebel. He took to scaring people, often to the point of bullying them, which is really the only way he'd get any work done.	politics and government

It is yet another version of the standard M16, but with attachment rails on the hand guards (and other minor changes).  The Corps only uses the M4 in limited applications.	politics and government

What is the purpose of government?  Government is the ordering of the unwilling by the incompetent for the ungrateful.\n\nActually, the purpose of government is to do that which is socially necssary but which all people cannot or will not do willingly.  I mean, if you had to go around for a collection box to pave a road, would everyone who drives on that road contribute?  How many people would chip in on a voluntary basis to build a prison?  Would the majority agree that police should be stopping speeders?  Everybody likes to speed.\n\nAnd, of course, government is the legitimator of force.  Only with government permission may one adult use physical force against another.  And that's the way it should be.	politics and government
how do i get my picture id if the rmv (registry of motor vehicle)is giving me such a hard time? the reason why i waited soo long to get my id was because i moved out from my parents since i was 16. i try going to the rmv to get it at the time but they needed a certified birth certificate. i didn't have one at the time. i had the one given to at birth. (i'm a u.s citizen)  since they were giving me such a hard time then i gave up. now 4 years later i wanted to go back and get my license but yet they were still giving me a hard time.(the law change cuz of all the immigration system) so i said fine i'm trying to get a picture id. they wanted for forms of id i  finally had my certified birth certificate, my s.s, as well as my bill, but the one thing i didn't have is a signature. what should i do??? i mess up everything for my self. They aren't giving you a hard time.  They have specific requirements that are probably spelled out in many of their publications and everyone applying for a license/photo ID needs to abide by the same rules.  Do you have a Voter Registration card?  Are you 18 at least?  Register to vote.  It's a free process and you sign your card and it is proof of residency.  You can pick up a Voter Registration application at most US Post Offices, libraries, or contact the voter registration office in your town.\n\nYou might think about applying for a US Passport.  You submit your passport application along with a copy of your birth certificate and 2 identical photographs.  A passport is a very valid form of ID and can give you that proof you need to get other forms of ID.  You will need 2 forms of ID when you are hired for jobs in the US, too.  Last time I had my passport renewed it was about $50 and it is good for 10 years but it can be used for ID even after it expires.  \n\nYou can pick up a passport application at many Post Office locations, or the process is probably available online by now.	politics and government

So says the 216th General Assembly, "military action against Iraq" as "unwise, immoral and illegal," This is a question that historians are going to be writing about for centuries to come... if our planet last that long.\n\nOf course, the war in Iraq is illegal and immoral. It really doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that.\n\nThe problem is that most Americans don't want to believe that they have supported, funded with their tax dollars and flat believed in a war that has killed 600,000+ civilians. They can't...\n\nYou see, the human mind can only handle so much guilt. I guess I am saying that most ppl actually have a 'need' to believe it was for a just cause.\n\nPut it this way, say a guy came to you very excited and confident that in 1 week the family next door was going to blow up your house. Say he went on and on about how he heard this and saw the bombs they had etc...\n\nSo, you said ok go get him and here is some money to go buy the weapons you need to get him out.\n\nThe next day the guy raids the neighbors house, captures him but in the process he kills 3 of the man's kids and his wife.\n\nWhen all the dust has settled, come to find out, the neighbor was just a bad husband, bad father and a jerk but had no weapons, no plan to attack you and was no threat to anyone.\n\nNow, how would you feel?\n\nWould you be sick to your stomach?

How many 5 star generals are there today? or whatever the highest rank military person is if it's not 5 star.\n\nalso, i saw online that 5 star is during war time only, so there should be 5 star now right?  what happens when war time is over?  do they go back down to 4 star general? There hasn't been a 5-Star General since WWII.  Once you do make 5-Star, you'll probably too close to retirement.  If it's a field promotion (meaning someone died in battle and your next one up), the military have their right take your field promotion away.  But, being a 4-Star promoted to 5-Star, that probably won't happened (because of politics).\n\n(My uncle was in the Air Force during the Vietnam War.  He was TSgt in EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal).  He received a field promotion to Colonel (because back then the Air Force didn't have EOD Officers just enlisted because they were under the base commander.  So they needed someone with a power and respect.  When the war was over and he returned to Florida.  He got demoted back to TSgt, but he was able to keep his paygrade of a Colonel.)\n\nThere isn't any public record of the exact number of 4 star generals and Admirals because some of that information needs to be classified, but the roundabout number is: 800 (for all services, including the Coast Guards, National Guards, and Reserves).	politics and government

The framer's of our constitution intentions was to have a cross section of the American people serving in the U.S. Congress.  What has happened is that you have to be rich in order to get elected therefore we are being represented by the top 2% of the government that gets the largest tax breaks.  Is anybody seeing a theme here.  We have both Liberal and Conservative Millionaires in this country and I find it very hard to believe that any rich person actually has the poor peoples needs at heart.  The reason that the Liberals are having so much trouble getting candidates elected these days is the fact that people are starting to see through this as well as the fact that the voter's that vote are actually more conservative.  For any election there are 40% of Voting Age Population not voting and no one knows where they stand except with the apathetic.	politics and government

Do you think illegal immigrants help or hurt the United States? Many people think that (illegal) immigrants take American jobs and threaten national security. While others say that they are helping the economy by "doing jobs Americans won't do." What do you think? Is this a common misconception that (illegal) immigrants are bad, when they infact could help us in some ways? We do because we use their services and labor. It helps to keep many of our offices clean, fruits and vegetable affordable, lawns mowed, new houses built, Mexican food cheap at the drive-thru after closing hours at the bars, hotel rooms clean, dishes cleared after a nice meal at the fine restaurant, dry our cars after the car wash and many more.\n\nIf these jobs were paying more, Americans would work those jobs. Except that if Americans worked those jobs, our laws would cost more to mow, our office rent would increase, hotel rates would increase, washing your car would be $30, our strawberries would be $8 instead of $4.\n\nThey are helping to keep things affordable.	politics and government

Why does the metheorologis (weather man) hides the mexican penisula of Baja California on the TV screen? Do this has to do with a boicoit againts Mexico turis pleces from the US Gov. So they persude the people not to go there, not showing the nice weather conditions? .Instead they want pleople to go to the peninsula of Flodida, something like the boicoit agains Cuba Island, Istead they preffer to show a big part of Canada's map. I think that's a bit of a schwinging comment to make. During the hurricane season in 2005 when Cancun was hit, the weather forecasters on Fox News made a deliberate attempt to show the forecast for Cancun. It could be argued here in the UK that the weather forecasters turn their back on the Republic of Ireland in protest over the 1921 partition. No they don't, they've got to stand somewhere and wherever they stand, they are going to block part of the UK	politics and government

what are you allowed and not allowed to do within freedom of assembly (examples)? compare and contrast what you can and cannot do within freedom of assembly and right to bear arms Freedom of assembly has been terribly reduced to mean nothing at all.

Why does the DEA and AMA allow tobacco companies to continue to put nicotine in cigarettes? It's obvious and has been for years that the most lethally addicting substance available is cigarettes.

Why in the world is there a "war on drugs" when the most heinous drug is allowed everywhere?

After what period should education standards be changed according to the rapid advancement in educationalfield by standards====> courses of chemistry,physics,english,maths,etc \nare there any international laws which support the revision and changing of educational courses in school colleges etc There are certainly no international laws.  The syllabus is set by the awarding body for the qualification you are studying for.  In England, for example, there are "examination boards" which set the syllabus for the different educational qualifications.\n\nThe syllabuses generally get a major revision about every five years, although there can be annual minor revisions.  \n\nHowever, If you were taking a subject like information technology, where there is a rapid pace of change, the examination board would probably not penalise you for relying on information from a textbook that is only a couple of years out of date.\n\n\nCONSTILAWCONSERVATIVE:  I wish you would pose your ideas for educational reform as a question!

hi once again, could someone please explain what probate actually  entails or  means?  When a person dies having made a will, that will has to be submitted to the Probate Office, a government department, which then holds it permanently as a public record available for anyone to see upon application.  Copies of the will may be obtained for a fee from the Probate Office. A grant of probate is then made to the executors named in the will. Until this vital step has been taken, the executors are powerless to act in dealing with the estate, as all banks, building societies, etc. etc. will want to see a copy of the will and possibly the grant of probate before responding to requests from the executors.\n\nThe fact that the estate is not very large does not mean it doesn't have to go to probate: the main difference between a large and small estate is when it comes to paying inheritance tax.	politics and government

Have you ever recovered from backsliding or your spouse backsliding? Any suggestions on getting back on track would be great. I've recovered from backsliding multiple times.\nIt's through God's grace and mercy that we are able to manage our sins and down falls.  We don't ever truly defeat them, but we are able to recover if we will humble ourselves and alloy God to change us.  \n\nOnce we get married... There's more at stake.  There's more people involved then just you.  Your sins and downfalls will greatly effect your spouse as well.  If (or when) you do sin, you have to humble yourself and prove to your spouse and God that you are changing.  Faith is action.  If you want someone to have faith in you again, you have to prove yourself to them once again.  Then, it's through God's grace, Mercy and forgiveness that you are both able to overcome the pain the sin and backsliding has caused.  Once you realize that you have sinned and asked forgiveness for that, you need to keep yourself accountable to God, yourself, and your spouse.  It's not easy for you nor your spouse to recover from backsliding but yes it IS possible.  My wife and I are living proof.	society and culture

Bible help...? I need to know were in the Bible it talks about if a fellow Christian sins are you supposed to bring it to that persons attention...I've been looking through the Bible but I can't find it...Please help. Matthew 18:15ff and Galatians 6 are the clearest NT references.  \n\nBut there are more.  One very good one is the often missed original setting of the "second greatest commandment" --\n\nLeviticus 19:17-18\nDo not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in his guilt.\nDo not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. \n\nAlong the same lines is a set of instructions by Paul in\nEphesians 4:25-27 Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. "In your anger do not sin"[=Psalm 4:4]: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.\n\nThis echoes Paul's call in v.15 to "Tell the truth in love." as part of building up the body in love (and avoiding deceit and error).\n\nFor some reason many separate the warning about anger from the call to be truthful.  But I believe they are intended to be read together.  As in Leviticus 19 the warning is against keeping it to yourself and nursing a grudge rather than correcting and RESTORING your brother and (in the case of sin BETWEEN you), of reconciling/making peace/restoring the RELATIONSHIP (cf. Matthew 5:23-24 which looks at the other side, calling us to go seek restoration if someone has something against US).  \n\nNote: the purpose must NOT be to "get it off my chest", for my own sake [so I won't be a hypocrite?]  It's about not allowing your brother to continue in sin without warning or seeking to restore him [thus we tell him as an expression of LOVING our neighbor] and the related sin of allowing a grudge to fester in my heart.  This is were the Galatians 6 call to be gentle & humble comes in.\n\nAlso note that there is not some generalized command to bring EVERY sin to people's attention!   It is for the sake of that person's good, for the health of the body, for restoration and reconciliation...    There are MANY sins for which the final word should be "Love covers a multitude of sins." (1 Peter 4:8)	society and culture

Is it only a coincidence that they are the same except for the last letter? totally different ... the similarity of the names (in english) is coincidence. As pointed out, Iran means land of the Aryans (the race to which the Persian people belong). and FYI ... Mesopotamia was never a nation, it's a geographical area and was part of the ancient Persia.

If you had a choice, would you have all of existence unite into one consciousness for eternity (pure being)... ...or would you allow the human drama to repeat itself within space/time indefinitely. Please explain the reason for your answer :) I think that the universe is divine. That the expanding and contracting correspond to the Hindu view of the great cycle of Brahman breathing in and out. We begin at the starting point, evolve until we return to that same point. So what you've described above, that united existence, is pretty much the way it is regardless. (And before someone jumps on this and says they, aka scientists, no longer believe in a contracting universe ... That was before they discovered that each galaxy has a black hole at its center that draws everything in on itself. Once the galaxies have folded in upon themselves they will begin to draw each other until ... Contraction. Funny how contractions always come before birth. lol )	society and culture

How does Islam relate to women? The holy Quran has the following to say:\n\nMen are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and scourge them (4:34).\n\nWomen's testimony is equal to half that of a man:\n        Get two witnesses, out of your own men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her (2:282).\n\nPolygyny, and sex with slave and captive women:\n        "If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, (4:3).

race,region,skin color,eye color tell me if this is true!!!? well my mom told me the other day is the reason why white people have white skin and light colored eyes is because they're ancestors are from colder regions like snowy and you know how you never go outside you never get darker and so like they're skin stayed pale until they wasn't and ice age and for black people the reason why they are brown is because the ancestors are from africa and they live in HOT regions so theyre skin gets tanned browner and theyre eyes are darker and they're hair gets...well steamed and crinkles up while lighter people theyre hair was thin flat,straight...thats what she told me do you think its true? cause ya know it makes since not that black peoples eyes can't be colored cause mine are green but...just answer my question! lol Yes, it's true.  Developing dark skin was nature's way of providing more protection from the sun's rays. That's why people tan, it's to help protect the skin. Light skin burns easily. Light eyes are more sensitive to bright light. Have you also noticed that  most black americans are not real dark like true africans? They aren't exposed to that harsh sun anymore and have lightened up. I'm not sure about the hair "curling up from steam" it sounds reasonable, but actually, straight hair when seen under a microscope is round like a pencil, and tight curly hair is flatter like a ruler.

A question about St. Paul (writer of all those letters)? Somebody told me that he was a womanizer, and actually begged God to take this sin away from him.   But God refused in order to teach him a lesson in humility.\n\nHas anyone else heard anything to this effect? That story is the product of someone's imagination and a perversion of the Scriptures. Probably the person who made it up had a problem in that area himself and "read into" the Scriptures to give himself some sort of justification for his own sins. Compare these two passages. The first one is where this false teaching has it's shaky foundation.\n\nAnd lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  2 Corinthians 12:7-9 \n\nMany scholars have wrestled with trying to determine exactly what the "thorn" in Paul's flesh was and no one has come up with a definitive answer but only a plethora of theories. That he might have been a womanizer doesn't even make it to the top 10 of that list of possibilities. Then look at what Paul said about himself and marriage and fornication.\n\n"Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment. For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. " 1 Corinthians 7:1-7 \n\nPaul had what is known as the gift of celibacy or staying single without being overcome by lust. Jesus talked about this to his disciples although He didn't use that term for it.\n\n"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."  Matthew 19:12 \n\nNotice that Jesus doesn't make this a command to give up having sex in order to serve God but says for those who are able to receive it, let them receive it.	society and culture

Does your religion tell you not to judge others?? If so, let me tell you that I am a witch and DO NOT worship satan in any way.  So, if you aren't to judge, or hate me why do you?  I don't hurt anyone or push my beliefs on them.  Please answer with your heart not the bible. Hi Kristy,\n\nI understand that Wicca does not actively serve the devil. \n\n(To be honest, I doubt anyone really actively serves diabolical forces. Who in their right mind would? )\n\nAnd I know a lot of motivation of Wicca is good -- my guess is that it wants to preserve nature, it wants to free people from destructive emotions, it offers a sense of peace and aesthetic beauty, it tries to remedy society's negative views of women, and so forth. \n\n(Please excuse my ignorance if I mistated something... or feel free to clarify something I missed.)\n\nI think most of the people here are simply thinking that a person either serves "God" or they don't, just as a person either serves Wicca or they don't. And by not actively serving the purposes of one, a person is automatically serving the purposes of the other.\n\nI think the distinction is extremely important, though, in how we relate to each other; and telling someone they "serve the devil" is a pretty lousy way to build relationships, or show concern for and interest in each other. I know I'd be turned off if someone said that about me, especially if my intentions were good.\n\nAs far as the verse you refer to ("Judge, lest ye not be judged..."), the context isn't saying that a person cannot come to an opinion about someone else and their behavior. People always come to conclusions, it's part of life. \n\n(After all, you yourself have just made a judgment: You've judged other people as wrong because you perceive they're judging YOU, right? My point is that it's impossible to live life without constantly "judging" other things at that level. We HAVE to make some judgements just in order to live.) \n\nJesus IS saying (very specifically) that, before I worry about fixing someone else, I need to look even harder at myself and see what needs fixing in ME. \n\n("Why focus on the speck of dust in your brother's eye, while you have a beam sticking out of yours?" That's one of Jesus' hyperbole's here. "You goofball, take the beam out of your own eye, so that you can see clearly on how to help your brother fix his.")\n\nThe person who evaluates someone else as needing help has to first evaluate himself and at least acknowledge (if not deal with) his own issues first. Otherwise our intentions are in the wrong place.	society and culture

Delusional Media? Does anyone else see how horribly the media is subtly depicting Christian religions, especially Catholic? Or just even how immoral they have gotten.

And shows like Sex In The City and The Bedford Diaries are just completely immoral. Does anyone else see this? I see it, but I do not think it is very subtle. There has been an all out FRONTAL assault on Christianity in the media for the last 20 - 30 years. What you are seeing is the culmination of the attack. It is anything but subtle. It is overt and blatant. Look at Law and Order, Boston Legal, any talk show, yes Oprah too, and any thing on the Discovery or History channels.

Is God male or female?  He has no body, nor shape, that is why He has no creator. Male and female concept has come because in English or any Western language due to teachings of the Bible there is a tendency to refer God as He which is wrong. The fact that it is a mistake is realized very recently when a letter has been circulated from the Pope that all the prayers are to be corrected and God should never be referred as a male or He. Hindus are very clear since the days of Vedanta and the Veda i.e. at least 30,000 years or before that God has no physical body and His manifestation is the Nature which is visible and the invisible part is much much bigger, the ever expanding Universe.	society and culture

y do ppl seem to think all blonde's are dumb? I am a blonde and ppl r always saying i am dumb. Yeah im girly and preppy. I may look like malabo barbie but im not dumb. How can i get ppl 2 stop? The dumb blonde is a stereotype typically applied to women (but may be applied to men) with blonde hair color, which achieved a degree of prominence in popular usage. Several notable actresses have been labelled "dumb blondes", Marilyn Monroe and Suzanne Somers (due to her role as Chrissy Snow on Three's Company) being perhaps two of the most notable examples. Dolly Parton is an example of a singer who used this image to her own benefit, singing songs such as "Dumb Blonde". Goldie Hawn is best known for playing a dumb blonde in several roles, including the stage persona she used on Laugh-In. Jessica Simpson is famous for her 'real life' dumb blonde persona. Paris Hilton is also considered a prominent dumb blonde judging on her many escapades that leak into the tabloids and the media. The bimbo is a similar stereotype, though a bimbo can have any hair color.\n\nStereotypes are ideas held by some individuals about members of particular groups, based solely on membership in that group. They are often used in a negative or prejudicial sense and are frequently used to justify certain discriminatory behaviors. More benignly, they may express sometimes-accurate folk wisdom about social reality.	society and culture
Why do you ask? If people do not want your opinion, why do they ask for it?  Questions like: Is divine intervention real? Can prayer really help those in need? Is God real?  I continue to answer these questions with my honest opinion: that god is a fictional character and the bible is a clever but outdated mythology.  Stragely, people keep responding with "CORE you are dumb"- or much worse- simply because I answered their question with an opinion they found shocking or offensive.  If these people were being honest, they would say right up front that they don't want answers or opinions, they just want to preach.  Why do people keep asking questions they don't want answers to?  Is there some gratifying aspect of rhetoric that I am missing?  If an opinion contratry to your own is not welcome, should you be asking those questions in a public forum and then chastising others for answering?  To me it seems like a trap- and intentional deception created just to cause harm.  Your thoughts? Hey CORE,\n\nWhile I don't agree with you on the Biblical issues, I definitely agree with you on the rest of your statement.  One thing that I would add though, is that it is not just we Christians that do that.  I have seen my fair share of "baiting" from the athiests, agnostics, Muslims, and every other group that think that they "have it right."\n\nAnyway, thanks for making a good point, and here's to disagreeing without being disagreeable.	society and culture

If languages evolved, how come there are no "half-languages"? Also, what use is half a language?\n\nAny intermediates would have been functionally useless. Uhm, there are. Many forms of Creole are found in the Carribean and Louisiana, all evolved from French into something more or less distinct. While similar enough to French that a French-speaker could usually understand the gist of what is being said in Creole and that a Creole speaker could make himself better understood with effort, it's separate enough that someone actually has to study the other to speak it fluently. Louisiana Creole takes this evolution from French further and incorporates some expressions from English.\n\n\nAnother half-languages you might be interested in is Luxumburgian, which evolved from a Dutch dialect with influences from French. Something possibly on the way to becoming a half-language is the difference between Quebecois French, which is similar to medieval French, and the more modern French spoken in France, and the deriviations found in western Africa. Another possibility is the differences between the various Englishes of the US alone. Can a Californian understand the heavy drawl of a Southerner or New Englander? Not easily, if at all, and I'm not even mentioning all the dialects of the British Isles.\n\nWhenever you see languages in the same family, they came from half-languages and sometimes still are effectively half-languages. Latin evolved separately in France, Spain, Italy, and Romania, though for a short enough time each was still only a regional dialect or half-language and could be understood by each other, especially if they made the effort to enunciate clearly. We can see the slow shifting of German as it went from the west to east through Europe, eventually becoming English. A German can sometimes understand the gist of Dutch even today with a lot of work, and vice versa.	society and culture

have you heard of the gospel of judas iscariot.what is your opinion about the content.it very horrible.? the gospel actually mention judas did not actually betray jesus chirst but that it was a plan deal arrange between him and jesus to fullfill the scripture written some year ago before their exitence.at first judas refuse but after jesus chirst explain it to him as his own sacrifice to gain savation he has no choice but to do was his master said.can u believe it.also in his gospel he said all the other apostle wrote a gospel about jesus.now why do we have only four gospel ie mhtt,mark.luke and john. Sorry to cut and paste, but I've answered this question quite a lot lately...\n\n\nThe gospel of Judas is not credible. Scientists believe it to be the work of gnostics, a mystical early Christian denomination. People in those times did not have the access to the scriptures as we do today. They rarely had more than one or two books of the Bible at one time, so they often did not know what the other parts said. Gnostics often wrote stories of the way they thought things might be. The gospel of Judas is a philosophical conjecture, not scripture. It was also written at least 100 years after the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - the 4 gospels present in the Bible that tell of Judas's betrayal.\nAlso, because "gospel" means "good news", and the good news is that Jesus died for our sins, the text would have to include the crucifixion and resurrection to be classified as a gospel. The gospel of Judas tells of neither. \n\nThe gospel of Judas has indeed been authenticated - that means that it is indeed as old as it seems. It does not mean that it is a work of scripture. If you want to back up what I have said, then watch the National Geographic special. April 13 and 22 at 9pm ET/PT. \nAs for the other gospels, the earliest known manuscripts date from 65 to 95 AD. That is 35 to 65 years after Christ died.

I go to my mom's house on Christmas Eve and we order chinese food, and relax before the big day.  I buy my children new christmas pjs to open and wear for christmas eve.  When we return home, my children write Santa a note and leave out his cookies on his special plate and a carrot for Rudolph.	society and culture
What age do you think children should be able to stay home alone? What age should they no longer have a babysitter?  Example:coming home from school and spending 3-5 hours alone. It depends on the child, and your exact situation; but a safe bet would be a young teenager, 13-16. An extremely responsible child in a neighborhood with very little crime, I might say as young as 10. Then again, I know some kids who aren't responsible enough to be alone before they turn 14; and some neighborhoods I've lived in where I wouldn't let the best kid stay even then. My best advice is if you trust them to fix a healthy meal for themselves (especially since they'll be alone until between 6 & 9 PM) then you can probably trust them to be alone.	society and culture

a question if your christian please do not answer, i keep getting told i am not a real christian and i am? why  You're a REAL Christian.  It's foolish to say you believe in the "Word of God" when you disregard the Gnostic texts; these texts were deliberately removed in 325 AD.  It was the removal of these texts (which are now known as apocrypha) that helped secure the Church's authority over all spirituality, and therefore, over all life.\n\nThose who disrespect the apocrypha are to be pitied, for they've been brainwashed by church propaganda.	society and culture

what is the byzantine catholic rite church? I am a roman catholic. I walked in to a byzantine catholic church by mistake and thought it was a catholic one because of its similariity from the outside, and the chants. Everything was going ok, except that the priest was on his back, but i thought what the hell? they did this a long time ago anyways... and then  At the time of communion, the priest got a spoon and fed everyone a spoonfull of something that tasted like fruit-pie and wine.. what was that? I couldnt get out of the line so i had to take te spoonfull.. lol what was it? what are the differences between roman catholics and byzantine catholics? why does the priest give mass on his back? please help me understand where i went and what i tasted ! thanks You were most likely attending a Catholic Mass, in an Eastern Rite Byzantine Catholic Church, which is probably fully in union with the Holy See at the Vatican, but using a different liturgy than western (Roman) Catholics are used to.  You should have just stayed around after Mass and asked these questions to the priest. You likely received both the body and the blood of Christ at the same time, rather than separately.

why do shias pray on a stone or a tissue paper!?  They base this on some obscure and very weak hadith that says that the Prophet pbuh did this once - which they took to mean this is the only way to pray. But as I said there is much dispute over whether its even true that he did that and no indication whatsoever that this is the only way to pray.\n\nRather we are told that we can pray anywhere on the Earth, that the Earth is a place of worship and we can pray indoors or outdoors, wherever - you don't even need a rug - its juts you and Allah swt nothing and no-one else - do I need a piece of stone before I can communicate to Him? Do we think Allah swt is dependent on a stone? How silly is that!\n\nNot only that the prayer to an onbject is as we know indicative of idol worship and this is what a lot of them now do - they direct their worship to this stone believing it to be a link with Allah swt and that those of us who pray without it are not praying properly and our prayers won't be heard - - this is shirk on their part and a grave sin.\n\nEnough said really!\n\npeace	society and culture

Should I switch positions at work? I have 1 coworker that drives me crazy...and she's very rude & mean. I could switch to a different job that pays the same, but I would loose seniority & I would be on probation for six months? The real question is "What does my supervisor think of the situation?" If he/she knows about the conflict and does nothing, you already know you have to remove yourself from the department. I quit a promising career at Southern States Cooperative because of just such an issue, but I knew there was no way to win.\n\nThe best part?

Why does nobody talk about this? Why do Muslims knocking Israel hide these facts, or don't they even know them So many talk about Arab Palestinians expelled from Israel that we forget the ONE MILLION Jews expelled from Arab countries they had inhabited for more than two thousand years! Israel's home to one million Arab Muslims (up from just 155,000 sixty years ago)who are excused from certain taxes, don't have to join the army like other Israelis, and have their own Arabic schools and universities. Arabic is also one of Israel's official languages. All over the Arab world there are fewer than 7,000 Jews. The Jewish population of Arab countries has decreased by more than 99%. Unlike Arab countries that don't take care of Arab Palestinian refugees, the State of Israel always supported Arab Jewish refugees. Nothing's changed since these days. Arab media still spits out anti-Semitic propoganda and Muslims hate Jews more than I thought anybody could hate anyone else. Israel treats Muslims very much better than Muslims treat Israelis or Jews. I like what you said.\n\nMay God richly bless you and yours,\n\nAdyghe C.	society and culture

What's your opinion about Australian cricket players using abuse words against oponents in the field?  locktheglock...I dont think the game of cricket has anything to do with speaking/writing english.

Anyways, from what I have seen in last year, they are calming down. The verbal abuse has gotten lesser.	sports
Who should the 49ers draft in the 1st round of the 2006 NFL draft? I would like to hear who you think, and why? If you think they should trade, what should the trade be? Keep in mind they have both the 6th pick and the 22nd pick From everything ive been reading the 49ers have two players that are their top picks, AJ Hawk from The Ohio State and Mario Williams NC State.  There have also been reports that their reasoning for trading theit  second and third round picks with Denver was to position themselves to move up to the top 3, the thinking would be that Williams and Hawk will both be gone at 6.  But for the question asked I'll assume they stay put.\n\nFor the 6th pick Id go with Michael Huff.  Its really a bit of a reach at this high a pick, but I believe that his versatiltiy of playing either corner or saftey in the NFL would benefit the very thin defensive backfield of the 49ers. \n\nAs for the 22nd pick, it would be ideal if either WR Santonio Holmes of The OSU or Chad Jackson from Florida were available to select one of them.  Another option ive been hearing of lately would be DE/OLB Manny Lawson, but any 49er fan knows that the offense is miles behind the defense in every aspect.	sports

What is the difference between the Champions league and the UEFA? What is the difference and WHO and HOW do teams qualify for both of them, thanks. Champions League (More prestigious)\nAli sort of had it, but it is more complicated than the top four teams from each country league qualify.  The different countries have rankings based on how good the league is.  The top 3 leagues each get four teams, the leagues ranked 4-6 have three teams, the leagues ranked 7-15 get two teams, and leagues ranked 16 and lower get one team.  So the Spanish league, ranked number one, gets four teams qualified, while the Dutch league, ranked number seven, gets two teams qualified.  But then it gets even more complicated because they don't all enter the tournament at the same time.  The champions from the top 9 ranked leagues all automatically get to the group stage (32 teams in total), along with second place teams from the top 6 ranked leagues and the Champions League returning winner.  The other 16 teams come from previous round qualifying stages.  The link provided has a good breakdown of all the stages.\n\nUEFA Cup is basically the best teams that don't make it to the Champions League.  In fact, some teams that get eliminated from the Champions League in the group stage get thrown back into the EUFA cup competition.  \n\nCheck out the link.  \nThe second link shows the ranking of the leagues (scroll down to where it says "League Coefficients")	sports

is judo a good form of martial arts to learn for fitness?  I think the answer to this question depends on the type of dojo you train at. I trained in judo and at my dojo, the first hour was nothing but cardio drills, footwork, push ups, abdominal work with medicine balls, calisthenics, stretching,etc. Then the next hour was actual Judo where we learned techniques with repositioning, throws (Tachi waza) as well as ground fighting (Ne waza), pins, joint locks, arm bars,etc. Even the second hour was tough because it takes energy to grapple. That was my school. Other judo schools, you will just see a bunch of fat guys standing around working on throws and what not. But overall, I think Judo is great for fitness.	sports

who do you think should be west indies next captain?  It doesnt mean that a good player can be a good captain. the player should be aggresive for him to make a good captain, like ponting(australia) and smith(south africa), and their performance is proof for this. \nI think one player in the windies team  who falls in this category is Chris gayle. I think he is aggresive and the right man in the current squad to lead this depleted windies team.	sports

Do you think england is going to win the world cup?  If you look at the rating on a lot of websites, soccernet.com included, England is rated second best to lift this cup. And like i have said, in the history of this competition, only in 1958 - 1962 did Brazil take it consecutively, it has never happened again after then  and i don't expect it to happen again now. \n\nIf history repeats itself, then its Europe's turn to take the cup and England is favorite to lift it among the European teams, so i think they can win it.	sports

If Jackie Robison's number (42) was retired, then why does Mariano Rivera have that number?  His uniform number is 42, which has been retired by all Major League Baseball teams since 1997 in honor of Jackie Robinson. However, Rivera is permitted to use the number due to a grandfather clause, and he is the last active Major League player to wear the number. Given the many uniform numbers retired by the Yankees, it is very likely his number would have been retired by them after his career ended anyway.	sports

Why didn't Roy Oswalt win the Cy Young Award? Please, no answers saying he didn't get enough votes. It was a tough call, and it just went against Oswalt.  He had the best ERA, but he pitched fewer innings than Webb, had one fewer win, and had a slightly higher WHIP.  Oswalt may also have been overshadowed by his teammate Roger Clemens, who had better numbers albeit over fewer innings.\n\nYou could definitely make the argument for Oswalt, just as you could for Webb or Carpenter.  This was a tough voting year.\n\nEDIT - You're right about Adam Everett - He's by far the best defensive shortstop in baseball by any measure, but he never gets the credit.  Derek Jeter is not half as good, but he gets all the love for his defense.	sports

How can I meet Ozzie Guillen in person?  I am sure that if you go to see a Chicago White Sox game and got to the ballpark early you might be able to meet Ozzie Guillen and a few of the players. Or go online to the Major League Baseball website and go to the Chicago White Sox site and look and see if they have a way to contact the ballpark. I know this isn't much but I hope that it helps. I don't live in Chicago and I am not a real fan of the White Sox so I don't know do much about them.	sports

What does it mean when a pitcher is in the stretch? I hear the commentators talking about it all the time but I never figured out exactly what is and what it means.  How does it affect the pitcher/strategy? It is when a runner is on base. The pitcher has to "hold" the runner on, meaning keep him close to first so he doesn't steal second. If he was in the wind-up (his regular motion), the runner could get an enormous jump to steal second. In the stretch, he holds the runner better. \n\nThe stretch is basically pitching without the wind-up. The pitcher comes to a set (hands come down to a point and he pauses) before raising his leg and going home. Compare that to a full wind-up and you'll notice a huge difference.	sports
Can the Florida Gators still make it to the National Championship if they win the SEC Championship? I know OSU is #1, then USC, next Michigan, and finally Florida. But can a win in the SEC Championship get them enough points to pass USC. When USC beats UCLA, no chance. If USC does not win then Michigan would get in. I do not think Florida will have enough points to get to #2. Their strength of schedule is hindering them. The SEC Conference is down this year and their out of conference schedule is not very impressive. That is why they will be left out.	sports
