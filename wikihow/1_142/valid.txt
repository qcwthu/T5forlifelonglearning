Careful observation is more likely to make sense of what is happening.; , When bees swarm, it's so their colony can spread out into new areas. This means they minimize the risk that a single disaster will wipe out their gene pool at one location, and they increase their chances of survival. Nature benefits because this also increases the number of bees for pollination. There are also other reasons, but this is the main one.  Bees not under human management, so called “feral bees”, cross breed and benefit from more defensive characteristics rather than increased productivity, therefore they tend to become more dangerous. Their poison is often more severe, and they more easily get angry. When they are difficult to handle, they can’t be checked for disease, and they can carry parasites that spread to healthy hives.  It's really important that we protect the managed bees that we rely on for pollination and honey from bees that can easily bring serious problems, such as parasites or disease. It often means that feral bees need to be removed by someone with proper knowledge to do this safely. If he can't safely check them for disease, its better that they are put down. He may need a licence to use chemicals safely, to do this job. The best chemicals for the job are virtually non toxic to humans, anyway.  Safe and careful intervention is essential for bee eradication that both prevents infestation and protects healthy bee populations. Further information follows.	Simply observe the bees and think first. Understand why bees swarm. Beware of "feral bees.", Protect the "good" bees from the "bad.", Don't put this job in the hands of an amateur, whether that's you or an untrained "professional"!
First straighten your photo, then make it look attractive with exposure adjustments, starting with contrast. Crop to simplify. Use Windows Live Photo Gallery or Microsoft Office Picture Manager (Windows Live Photo Gallery is free), or whatever photo program you usually use.  When you have two people in a photo, eyeball a center between them, and place this center according to the golden mean.  Look at the photo below and notice the dead space at the bottom. The interesting part of this photo is the area where the two men are looking (besides what is in their mouth and their facial expressions) and there should be more space there.  In this image, notice how the space to the lady's right, even with the lines, does not balance the rest of the photo. Asymmetry is many times vertical in Asian art and in this photo the asymmetry is horizontal. Again, take many photos and ask the person to pose differently. Your photo must be pleasing to look at––trust your instincts on what is pleasing, even if you cannot explain why exactly.  For a peaceful composition, use a horizontal line. With objects of the same size, arrange them so they appear different, such as in this photo: , The approximate ratio of the golden mean is 6/10, so a vertical placement of a subject would be 6/10 in height on your frame. If your subject matter is the moon, imagine a dot at the center of the moon, and place it there, according to the golden mean.       When you have two or more objects, find the center of those objects and place this center according to the golden mean.  In the image shown here, the people in the bottom section and the plants frame this photo; this enhances the speaker who is the center of interest. The bottom, left corner should be cropped a bit in this graduation picture, and the bottom left corner in the previous step's picture could do with having a bit more space.  The visual path is from left to right, just as we read from left to right. The lines from the building converge at the sunset.  Contrast will ensure that the viewer's attention is on the center of interest. Take pictures from different heights––you do not have to be looking at the preview directly. Take some pictures with the camera held above your head and held low, below eye level.   The contrast in this photo is with light. In this scene, if the camera was held lower (perhaps the top part of the photo), it would look less compacted. The top part of the photo has a science fiction look–-okay if that is what you want, but not if you want a professional-looking photo.	Edit your photos later. Determine the midpoint of your center of interests. Create balance in the elements of your photo. Arrange the center of interest to form a dynamic diagonal line. For harmony, place your subject matter based on the golden mean, vertically and horizontally. Use frames. Use a different setting, such as wide angle and telephoto to arrange the subject matter in your photo. Provide contrast.
Your knowledge of cause and effect with regards to your possessions and so on is directly tied into your ability to increase the amount that you own. The more knowledge you have of cause and effect the more likely you are to gain more because you know how to make it happen.  People have more resources than they think usually, and knowing the resources that you have available to you allows you to organize or gather them in ways that leave you with possessions. Think what resources are in nature - forests, beaches, plains, mountains. What resources can be found in cities - scrapyards, charity shops?, When you make your own possessions you gain exactly the possessions that you want with the only cost being the cost of the resources necessary to make that thing and the effort and time that it takes to make it. It is often incredibly fun too and makes what you can own limited to your imagination. Through making your own possessions you begin to develop creative and problem solving skills as well as becoming more skillful with your hands., Buying in bulk is one way to minimize the cost of everything you buy to the point that you effectively buy it for free. Supermarkets and shops exist to break bulk and sell individual items in order to create a profit. If you go to the place that supermarkets buy from they will often be happy to sell you bulk items for the required price - which makes each individual item in that bulk considerably lower than the supermarkets and shops., Wastefulness and resourcefulness are on opposite ends of the spectrum and being less wasteful with what you have leaves you with more possessions at the end of the month - think on how you are wasting your money, the things you buy and the things you already own - are you putting them to their best use? Are you throwing them away when they still have use left in them? Are you buying new ones when you can repair the ones you already have?, Building networks of people is one surefire way to figure out who you need to talk to in order to gain possessions and property. Through utilizing networks you can look for job opportunities, see what people are selling and buying, see what people are willing to trade for, you also gain a list of skilled workers and laborers that you can pay if you want to engage in any endeavor. Networks allow for many opportunities for economic growth., Money is a very important thing when it comes to owning more possessions and having even a little knowledge of how monetary systems work will aid significantly in owning more things. Planning your finances effectively is how you coordinate all of your monetary activities and allows you to produce timescales and plans for your own economic growth. Budgeting, producing purchasing plans, keeping track of your expenditures - this is how you track how you are doing financially., This skill saves a lot of money in the long run and allows for you to own more possessions. Over time, its a skill that takes patience and discipline but it is economically justified. The internet makes this step much easier - things that are expensive in shops are often incredibly cheap online with the only downside being that you do not get them right away. which is almost always an economically justified cost., The amount of money that can be saved from simply searching for a discount online is substantial. Many companies have promotions and deals on offer that allow you to get the same thing at a fraction of the cost - even a quick search for '(your item) discount' online can be very beneficial financially., In any given city there are usually a handful of retailers which are buying things in order to resell. These retailers can be key to both building contacts and having a place to sell any items which you come into possession of for some extra cash in order to get what you want - try furniture retailers, scrapyards, computer parts shops and markets. By doing this wherein there is not a set price for everything you learn key skills of bartering and haggling that aid you significantly in all off your successive transactions., Money can fill this role well but it does not just have to be a monetary thing - it can be skilled labor, property or some other possession that you keep exclusively for trading. Think of marbles - when playing marbles you have a taw, and if you ever lose your taw you lose your ability to play marbles. Make sure you always have something you can trade.	Develop knowledge of cause and effect with regards to possessions, money and property. Look at what resources you have available to you already. Make possessions. Buy in bulk. Be less wasteful - find other uses for things. Build networks. Plan financially. Always shop around for the best deals. Before you buy something reasonably expensive, check for discounts and deals online. Look at local retailers in your area that are buying. Always have something that you are willing to trade or capable of trading.
Performing "rock the baby" will require you to be able to keep a yo-yo "sleeping" - spinning in place at the end of its string - for a few seconds. The first step in this process is to throw the yo-yo down and let the string extend fully. Keep your hand still after throwing the yo-yo.; , Once the string is fully extended, the yo-yo will have plenty of rotational inertia and will begin spinning in place or "sleeping." Keep your hand still during this time to avoid jerking the yo-yo and causing it to wind up again.  After letting the yo-yo sleep for a few seconds, jerk your hand lightly upward and then down again. As the yo-yo moves upward and your hand returns to its original position, slack will be created in the string that will cause the string to begin winding around the yo-yo's bearing. If it has enough inertia, it will return to your hand.	Let out the slack in the yo-yo. Allow the yo-yo to spin in place. Return the yo-yo to your hand.
; , You must heat the material to temperatures nearing 1,600 degrees F (870 degrees C) to make it malleable for forging and to remove impurities. During the heating process, substances like sulfur and silica will oxidize and separate from the iron, creating slag. The removal of slag greatly strengthens the steel. ,   Strike the substance with a hammer, turning it as you forge. You will need to reheat the substance during the forging process to keep it malleable. Bend and chisel the substance on the anvil to form the blade shape. Target your hammer strikes to help shape the blade. Focus on the basic proportion of the blade initially. Forge the sword tip once you are satisfied with the basic blade shape, and then work on curvature and bevels. Bevel the blade in two sections: a long, sharp bevel extending to the tip of the sword provides the cutting edge of the sword and the shorter, thicker section runs along spine of the sword. Taper the blade on the end that will join with the handle.  Use grinders and files to form the final shape of the blade.  You can add a mixture of clay and other substances, like grass and feathers, to the blade to achieve desired results. Coat the spine of the blade with the mixture, leaving the edge largely untreated. This will help make the spine flexible and the edge sharp. Reheat the blade in the forge.  This process both cools and hardens the substance. You can use water or oil for quenching.   Immerse the blade in water or oil along the edge and tip first. This method has a dual purpose: to make the cutting surface hardest and to keep the back of the blade softer to absorb blows meted out by adversaries. Quenching technique is important as the faster you quench the blade, the harder it becomes.  Reheat the blade to about 400 degrees F (204.4 degrees C) after quenching and then allow it to cool to room temperature. This process helps balance the blade's flexibility and hardness. , Use water stones to sharpen the blade. When polishing is complete, the hardened and unhardened portions of the blade will become apparent. Give the blade a final filing for cosmetic purposes. , The sword handle, or hilt, must be long enough to accommodate both hands and provide optimum balance when joined to the blade.   Build the handle out of a hardwood, like yellow poplar or alder. Quarter-saw the wood at the end to provide maximum strength. Install two brass or copper pegs and anchors and align them with the tang. They will hold the blade in place.  Insert the hilt pegs through the holes in the blade's tang and fasten them to their anchors. Use industrial adhesive and leather wraps to further strengthen the attachment of the blade and handle.	Purchase or find a piece of steel about 2 inches (5.1 cm) wide and .5 inches (1.27 m) thick and slightly more than 3 feet (0.9 m) long (0.914 m). Heat the steel in a furnace or open hearth. Pull the heated material from the hearth when it becomes a yellow-orange hue and put it on an anvil.  , Forge the steel. Shape the blade. Treat the blade with a special clay mixture. Quench the steel. Temper the blade. Remove the clay mixture from the blade and grind the blade edge until it is sharp.  , Polish the blade. Drill two holes at the base, or tang, of the blade to help fasten it to the hilt.  , Fabricate the handle. Secure the blade to the hilt.
If you’re overloaded by your own or someone else’s emotional experience, it’s best to delay any decision- making. Take a moment to reorient yourself before acting.   When you’re caught up in an emotional reaction, it’s easy to say things you later regret or act impulsively. Ask for a break. Go outside and get some fresh air. Get a drink of water. Return when you’ve gotten your emotions back in check., You may often find yourself annoyed because others don't seem to respect your feelings, but you may not have conveyed them clearly. When you learn to clearly say what you are thinking, feeling, or wanting in a certain situation, you can avoid misunderstandings.A great route to effectively stating your feelings is with "I" statements. This helps you convey your own experience without making the other person upset or defensive. You might say, "I feel ignored. I really need you to listen to me right now. I need your support." This is far better than, "You are a terrible listener." or "You are always ignoring me!", You need to know when to say “no” and have the courage and discipline to do it. This simple strategy is a hallmark in emotional self-regulation.For example, your mom suggests you drive down for the weekend to attend the family picnic. But, you have a major essay to finish for a college course. It’s completely expected that you would feel guilty, but that guilt (or, your mom’s shaming you) shouldn’t force you to give in. The smartest response would be to say, “I’m sorry, Mom. I’d like to come, but I haven’t gotten started on my paper due on Tuesday. I can’t.”  , One of the most important ways you can meet your own needs and others' is through compromise. This allows your own thoughts and feelings to be considered while also honoring those of others'. Compromise involves weighing the importance of a situation and coming to a mutual agreement.You can weigh the importance of a situation by asking yourself how significant it is in the scheme of things. Will you care about this in a week, a month, or a year? If not, you might honor the other person's feelings or needs and set yours aside for the time being. If you both care equally about the issue at hand, you'll have to find common ground. For instance, you and your friend both want to see a movie, but can't agree on a choice. You might ask a third party to select one or you might decide to watch whichever one starts next when you arrive at the theater.  No matter how hard you try, some people may naturally overtake your own feelings, causing you to act according to their whims. Perform a well-being check when you depart from others. Notice whether you are tense, angry, or bruised from the encounter. When someone raises a red flag within your own emotional experience, make the commitment to reduce the time you spend with that person.	Pause before making decisions. Express your feelings and needs clearly. Learn to say “no.” It can be hard to balance your feelings with others’ if you say "yes" to requests that don’t benefit you. Learn the art of compromise. Limit interactions with toxic people.
Aside from putting the labels on the boxes, you should inform the movers about the boxes that contain fragile items. It will serve as a heads up for them to handle it with extra care.; , Use paper or bubble wrap to wrap your fragile items to provide cushioning. Packaging peanuts or other loose fill can fill gaps in your boxes and provide extra protection. When packing with clothing, use socks and small items as filler, and wrap your fragile items in larger, soft articles of clothing. , For taller items like glasses, roll the item in the paper and fold the edges over. For other items like plates, fold the paper around the item and tape paper to finish. Use more than one sheet of paper when necessary or for extra padding.  A cell pack is a structure made of cardboard or plastic that fits into your box and holds items in separate cells. This will keep these items in place and can help protect them. Wrap items in newspaper or other padding before packing them, and when finished,  ,, Remember to handle these boxes with care.	Communicate with the moving company or whoever will be handling your items. Choose packaging materials that can keep fragile items safe from bumps, shocks or variations of any kind. Pad the sides and bottom of a box before placing anything into it.  , Wrap fragile items in paper or bubble wrap. Pack some items, like cups or mugs, in a cell pack. After filling a box, gently pack tissue or bubble wrap into any open spaces.  , When finished with a box, secure it with packaging tape and label it as fragile.
They come with the names "wriggly magic worm" and "twisty worm". They come in colors like green, blue, light blue, purple, red, orange, and pink.   Check online if you can't make it to the stores to buy one.  Twist all the way until it is fully extended.; ,, The worm will start to follow you.   To make it even funnier, pretend you don't know its there, and when turning to see, move your fist so that it goes behind you. This works best on younger children. If you want, try with a younger sibling first.  You will need to extend the worm to about 12 inches and put it under a pillow. ,   To make it go back, pretend to view the back of the cave and move your hand with you, therefore pulling it back.  Choose a cylinder, from a pencil to an oven handle, and wrap it around three to five times.    To make it do a little extra, with more "pizazz", wrap it on a chair with bars on the back, and do it any pattern you want. , Find two flat surfaces that are slightly shorter than the full length of the string.  The magic fuzzy worm will fly through the air and land right in front of you.   To make this more believable, stretch your hand out, say, "come here wormie" and then pull to put your hand back in place.  Put it on the ground at full length or long enough so that it is on the ground and when you pull all it does is moves its head. , Stop occasionally for sniffs, and continue.   To make this more believable, light a scented candle or make a scent and then start the action!  , Any cool tricks that you think you would like? You can even get some friends and start a live "magic wormie" comedy show, charging a charity fee of 50 cents per person!   Make it funny: Is the wormie your friend, your enemy, does it spy on you, does it hide on you? Introduce some comedy to the performance.	Obtain a fuzzy magic worm from a toy or department store. Make the fuzzy magic worm follow you. Hold the piece of white cardboard in your hand and make a fist to hide it.  , Make a fist with your other hand and start walking. Make the fuzzy magic worm "hide" in a "cave". Lean the pillow against the side of the sofa or a chair so that its in a "cave".  , Gently tug on the string slowly, with jerks, and out will come the frightened worm. Make the fuzzy magic worm twist and twirl. Gently pull and it will twist around the cylinder. Pull and watch as it goes crazy!  , Make the fuzzy magic worm "super jump". Put the fuzzy magic worm on surface one, walk behind surface two, and pull!, Make the fuzzy magic worm "sniff" and "follow a scent". Gently tug the fuzzy magic worm and move it around, so that only the nose sticks up and it looks like it's sniffing.  , Drag it along. Get creative.
Make sure all of your designs are kept up to date. Who wants to go to a beauty parlor with a sign from the 1980’s or buy from a website which looks like it’s hosted on Geocities (people under the age of 22 may need to look that up).; , Don’t make your product packaging and logo yourself unless you have extensive design and artistic experience. Having attractive branding and graphic design is extremely important and is really best left to the pros. Commission a graphic designer (you can find a cheap one by inquiring at the local art college) to do your designs for you.  You will need a logo for your company and product if you do not have one already. Make sure it is easy to read, simple to print, easily memorable, and versatile. Your graphic designer should be able to help you come up with something.   The most successful logos use bold lines and dynamic shapes. Think the Pepsi logo, the Nike logo, or the Batman symbol.  You will need labels and other visuals on your packaging and these should be similarly well designed as your logo. The packaging will need to be attractive, appropriate to your product and company image, and easily recognizable.   Remember: if someone can't remember what you're product is called when they describe it to people, they're probably going to say something like, "Go to the blank aisle and you'll see it on the shelf: it's the thing in the purple package with the cool, white swirly design".  The most important thing these days, when it comes to marketing a product, is having a website. This will give you a wider audience than any other type of marketing, is relatively cheap, and lends legitimacy to your business. It will also be necessary for some of the more effective marketing methods. If you really want your website to help you succeed, enable the sale of your product through the site.   The simplest way to sell your product through your website will be to have an Amazon store where the product is available and use the storefront widget or link to the product on your site.  For certain types of products, a press release might be a good idea. Find a media which is related to (ie. whose audience would be excited about) the type of product you are selling and give them a press release about your product becoming available. This is best for brand new products, especially those which are innovative in some way.  Social media is a powerful marketing tool. You can use your own contacts to spread the word about your product (across Twitter, Facebook, or even sites like Pinterest) or you can use social media’s internal advertising (such as Facebook ads and sponsored posts).   Most products can easily benefit from a Facebook page or Facebook ads. It is a very versatile marketing tool. Make a business page or a fanpage for your product. From there you can have promotions or place ads using Facebook's internal systems. Twitter is also a versatile advertising tool. Use it to alert your customers to sales and business developments (now you can buy Cool Product at your local Awesome Store!). Try to mix it up by also posting cool things that are only slightly related to your business, to keep your feed interesting to people. Certain types of products can make use of a Pinterest marketing campaign. Maybe you make clothes and you can show how to make great outfits using your product, or how to modify and personalize your product. Maybe you make a food product and you can show recipes that make use of your product.  Another great marketing tool is internet banner ads. These ads, which would go up on websites which meet your audience criteria and budget, can funnel traffic into your website, allowing you to tell potential customers all about the wonders of your product.   Use a reliable service to set up internet advertising (such as Project Wonderful) or work out a deal with local website owners if your product is better for a local audience.  If you have a website, consider an email marketing campaign. Send a well-crafted email telling these people why they should purchase your product, where they can get it, and give them a great hook (such as a sale) to draw them in. Remember: don’t be spammy!   Collect the emails of customers during sales of either new or old products, purchase emails from a reputable service, or target specifically to interested parties who might be able to get the word out if they enjoy your product.  People love to feel like they’re getting a great deal on something. Use digital coupons to draw customers in. You can use codes, print-out coupons for customers to bring to your store, or digital QR codes which can be displayed on a phone and scanned.  You can also use more traditional methods of getting the word out. These methods work best for advertising and gaining customers in your local area. Make sure that your ad is easy to understand, looks attractive, and has some kind of hook to draw customers in. Flyers and pamphlets can be handed out or posted in allocated spots (such as store windows). Pamphlets and postcards can be mailed to street addresses in your local area.  You can also advertise in local print media. Get your ad in a newspaper, magazine, or other print media like phone books and real estate guides. This is easy to do, as you need only contact the advertising department for the companies which produce your chosen publication.  If you have a large amount of money to produce a good television ad and get it to play on local television, this can be a good way to advertise to a broad audience. Unless you have very large amounts of money, however, you will probably be limited to local channels or daytime television, so only use this method if you think your ad will reach people who would actually buy your product.  Conduct research about your target market. You can look up information online or at a library, or you can conduct your own experiments by polling members of your target market or giving them samples to try to review.   Make sure to consider what your target market should be. Certain demographics to consider include age, gender, education level, location, interests, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.  Once you have some feedback about your product and more information about your target market, make any changes that seem appropriate to perfect it for your market.   Remember that while you will get widely differing opinions, if there are common criticisms of your product, they are probably correct and should be addressed.  Think about how much money you will have to market your product in the beginning. This will determine what type of marketing you do and sometimes what strategy you use.  You will need to determine how much of your product at what price will need to sell in order to keep your business afloat. This is very, very important. Balancing this will be tricky and it may take some time to figure out the right formula.  This is when you will need to write out and specify your sales timeline, target market needs, priorities, objectives, challenges, how you will acquire new business, and how you will grow your existing business. A sales plan will be necessary if you want investors to consider your product.  There are a number of different ways you can market your product, or different approaches in who you market to and what aspect of people you appeal to in your marketing. These strategies can bring you widely different customers or they can help you soar with a specific set of people.   Consider a concentrated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing appeals to and is targeted at only your target market. This is commonly seen with luxury items, which get marketed to very specific parts of a population, but can also be seen in other areas as well. Think Teen Magazine. Consider an undifferentiated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing appeals to and is targeted at pretty much everybody, and certainly a very broad audience. This strategy works well when you have a product which is broadly useful or appealing. Usually this means the traditional marketing mediums: television ads, print ads, and billboards for example. Consider a differentiated marketing strategy. This is when your marketing takes different aspects of your product and markets it to different demographics. Use the price, for example, to market to customers with a limited budget who may be looking for something less costly than your competitor’s products. Meanwhile, use convenience to make your product appeal to a local market.  Give samples, trials, or introductory sales to show your customer base why they want your product. You can do this by handing out samples outside your store, or finding a complementary business with whom your product can be paired with for short run, among a number of other ways. This will help build your initial business base and is very important.   Continue to test your marketing strategy as you go through this initial phase, to ensure that you are taking the right approach for your market.  Once you’ve had a certain measure of success and you feel your product is ready, you can expand your market by getting your product into major retailers. You will want to consider where you should sell (Walmart, etc.). Following the advice in the Serious Success section will be very important, as stores will not want to carry your product if they feel you are unprepared to handle the volume.	Keep it up-to-date. Hire a graphic designer. Design a logo. Design unforgettable product packaging. Have a website. Make a press release. Maximize social media. Use internet ads. Be smart about email marketing. Utilize digital coupons. Don't forget flyers, pamphlets, and postcards. Use print advertising. Consider television ads. Become an expert in your market. Perfect your product for the market. Determine your startup budget. Develop sales goals. Develop a sales plan. Choose a strategy to succeed. Seed your market. Expand your market.
You can purchase powdered tempera in individual colors or in color sets. If you wish to, experiment with mixing tempera powders to achieve the color you want.          If possible, use a hand mixer to incorporate the ingredients until they are well blended. , Use within several days for best results.	Mix all ingredients. Strain through cheesecloth to remove any large clumps.         , Store paint in a cool area (such as a refrigerator) for several days.
Purchase a ⅛ inch aircraft cable. Then, use wire cutters to cut the cable so that it is 48 inches (1.2 meters) in length.You can purchase an aircraft cable at your local hardware store.; , Using a 5/32 inch drill bit, drill two holes in a flat washer. Lay the washer flat and drill one hole at the top and the other hole at the bottom of the washer. For example, the two holes should be located at 12 and 6 o’clock.Position the holes between the pre-existing center hole of the washer and the outer rim.  Place the washer in a bench vise and pinch the washer. It should bend slightly in half. This will form the lock for the snare., Take one end of the cable and thread it through a ¼ inch nut. Then, thread it back through the nut creating a loop. Continue to pull the cable back through the nut until you have a loop with a ¾ inch (2 cm) diameter.Leave an extra inch of cable at the end.  Place the nut on an anvil and hammer the nut so that the cable is fastened in place and the loop is secure.  Then, push the cable through the top hole of the washer, from the outside of the bend to the inside. Pull the cable about a foot through the washer. Then, loop the cable through the bottom hole of the washer from the inside of the bend to the outside.This should create a loop.  Create a stopper at the end of the cable. Thread the end through a ¼ inch nut. There should be about ½ an inch (1 cm) of cable sticking out through the center of the nut., Place the nut on an anvil and hammer it so that the nut tightens around the cable, locking it in place.The snare is now complete and ready to be set.  In order to set a snare trap, you want to place it on a trail or path that is frequented by coyotes. Then, attach the small looped end of the snare to a solid object, such as a fence post or small sapling. This will anchor the snare in place. Hang the larger loop from a nearby branch so that the bottom of the loop is approximately 12 inches (30 cm) off the ground.When a coyote walks past it will mistake the hanging wire for a branch and walk into the snare. The loop will tighten, trapping the coyote as it continues walking and the bent washer will prevent the loop from loosening.	Cut an aircraft cable. Drill two holes in a washer. Pinch the washer using a vise. Thread the aircraft cable through a nut. Hammer the nut closed. Push the cable through the washer holes. Thread the end of the cable through a nut. Hammer the nut closed. Set the snare trap.
Pyramid solitaire is typically played with a standard 52-card deck. Because suits don't matter in pyramid solitaire, a well-shuffled deck isn't vital for a good game, even with a brand new pack of cards.; , This card will be the "top" of your pyramid tableau. In solitaire, a tableau is the large central layout and the main source for free cards. Unlike many other forms of solitaire, the pyramid tableau is completely face up., Place the two cards face up and side by side. Each of the two new cards should cover one lower quarter of the first card. The three cards should create a horizontally symmetrical triangle, Each additional row will have one more card than the one underneath it. The pyramid tableau is seven cards tall and has a base seven cards.If your pyramid has a different number of rows or is not horizontally symmetrical, go backwards to figure out where you may have made a mistake while dealing.  This stack of cards is called your stock. The stock should be neatly stacked so that only the top card is visible. Once the pyramid is fully formed and you've set your stock aside, you're ready to begin playing.	Shuffle the deck. Deal a single card face up. Make a new row with two more cards partially on top of the first. Keep adding rows until you've dealt 28 cards total. Place the remaining cards stacked face up and to the side.
The shutter priority mode allows you, the photographer, to set the shutter speed manually. The shutter speed dictates the length of time your shutter is open and your camera’s sensor is exposed to light. While slow shutter speeds capture blurry pictures, faster shutter speeds freeze, or stop, the action and produce crisp images.   Locate the labeled dial on top of your DSLR camera. Turn the camera to the shutter priority mode. This mode is often represented by a “S” or “TV.” If you are unsure how to place your camera in this mode, check the manual.

Concrete sealer is applied like a stain on wood, and it soaks into the pores of the concrete and protects it from stains. You can get it at any home-improvement store. For the best results, reapply the sealer every 2-3 years:   Choose a weekend with very little chance of rain to work. Wash the concrete and remove any existing stains. Starting in the corner, roll the sealant onto the concrete. Let the sealant sit for 48 hours before placing any furniture on it., If you do need to, try and remove it during rainstorms. The number one cause of rust stains comes from outdoor metal furniture that gets wet, but this can be easily prevented with some forethought.You can get felt runners, or outdoor carpets and mats, to protect your concrete as well. You can try coating your metal furniture with a sealant to prevent rust. You can also seal already rusted furniture to prevent the rust from spreading to your concrete. Even interior concrete can get rust stains if the room is moist or humid, so be aware of any metal to concrete interactions.

The sooner you close up the leak the better, as moisture can cause more damage then just a few easily cleaned stains.	Seal your concrete for the best protection against rust stains.
